      "content": "Paper Title: Map matching queries on realistic input graphs under the Fréchet distance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Map matching is a common preprocessing step for analysing vehicle trajectories. In the theory community, the most popular approach for map matching is to compute a path on the road network that is the most spatially similar to the trajectory, where spatial similarity is measured using the Fréchet distance. A shortcoming of existing map matching algorithms under the Fréchet distance is that every time a trajectory is matched, the entire road network needs to be reprocessed from scratch. An open problem is whether one can preprocess the road network into a data structure, so that map matching queries can be answered in sublinear time. In this paper, we investigate map matching queries under the Fréchet distance. We provide a negative result for geometric planar graphs. We show that, unless SETH fails, there is no data structure that can be constructed in polynomial time that answers map matching queries in O​((p​q)1−δ)𝑂superscript𝑝𝑞1𝛿O((pq)^{1-\\delta}) query time for any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, where p𝑝p and q𝑞q are the complexities of the geometric planar graph and the query trajectory, respectively. We provide a positive result for realistic input graphs, which we regard as the main result of this paper. We show that for c𝑐c-packed graphs, one can construct a data structure of O~​(c​p)~𝑂𝑐𝑝\\tilde{O}(cp) size that can answer (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate map matching queries in O~​(c4​q​log4⁡p)~𝑂superscript𝑐4𝑞superscript4𝑝\\tilde{O}(c^{4}q\\log^{4}p) time, where O~​(⋅)~𝑂⋅\\tilde{O}(\\cdot) hides lower-order factors and dependence on ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
