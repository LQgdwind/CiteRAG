      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Column Generation Heuristic for Airline Crew Pairing Optimization with Large-scale Complex Flight Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Crew Pairing Optimization (CPO) is critical for an airlines’ business viability, given that the crew operating cost is second only to the fuel cost. CPO aims at generating a set of flight sequences (crew pairings) to cover all scheduled flights, at minimum cost, while satisfying several legality constraints. The state-of-the-art heavily relies on relaxing the underlying Integer Programming Problem into a Linear Programming Problem, that in turn is solved through the Column generation (CG) technique. However, with the alarmingly expanding airlines’ operations, CPO is marred by the curse of dimensionality, rendering the exact CG-implementations obsolete, and necessitating the heuristic based CG-implementations. Yet, in literature, the much prevalent large-scale complex flight networks involving multiple – crew bases and/or hub-and-spoke sub-networks, largely remain uninvestigated. This paper proposes a novel CG heuristic, which has enabled in-house development of an Airline Crew Pairing Optimizer (AirCROP). The efficacy of the heuristic/AirCROP has been tested on real-world, large-scale, complex network instances with over 4,200 flights, 15 crew bases and multiple hub-and-spoke sub-networks (resulting in a billion-plus possible pairings). Notably, this paper has a dedicated focus on the proposed CG heuristic (not the entire AirCROP framework) based on balancing random exploration of pairings; exploitation of domain knowledge (on optimal solution features); and utilization of the past computational & search effort through archiving. Though this paper has an airline context, the proposed CG heuristic may find wider applications across different domains, by serving as a template on how to utilize domain knowledge to better tackle combinatorial optimization problems.
