Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Tripartite Interaction Information from Live Stream E-Commerce for Improving Product Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Recently, a new form of online shopping becomes more and more popular, which combines live streaming with E-Commerce activity. The streamers introduce products and interact with their audiences, and hence greatly improve the performance of selling products. Despite of the successful applications in industries, the live stream E-commerce has not been well studied in the data science community. To fill this gap, we investigate this brand-new scenario and collect a real-world Live Stream E-Commerce (LSEC) dataset. Different from conventional E-commerce activities, the streamers play a pivotal role in the LSEC events. Hence, the key is to make full use of rich interaction information among streamers, users, and products. We first conduct data analysis on the tripartite interaction data and quantify the streamer’s influence on users’ purchase behavior. Based on the analysis results, we model the tripartite information as a heterogeneous graph, which can be decomposed to multiple bipartite graphs in order to better capture the influence. We propose a novel Live Stream E-Commerce Graph Neural Network framework (LSEC-GNN) to learn the node representations of each bipartite graph, and further design a multi-task learning approach to improve product recommendation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets with different scales show that our method can significantly outperform various baseline approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
