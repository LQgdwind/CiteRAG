Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Quantum-inspired Resnet and Densenet for Pattern Recognition with Completeness Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the contemporary digital technology approaching, deep neural networks are emerging as the foundational algorithm of the artificial intelligence boom. Whereas, the evolving social demands have been emphasizing the necessity of novel methodologies to substitute traditional neural networks. Concurrently, the advent of the post-Moore era has spurred the development of quantum-inspired neural networks with outstanding potentials at certain circumstances. Nonetheless, a definitive evaluating system with detailed metrics is tremendously vital and indispensable owing to the vague indicators in comparison between the novel and traditional deep learning models at present. Hence, to improve and evaluate the performances of the novel neural networks more comprehensively in complex and unpredictable environments, we propose two hybrid quantum-inspired neural networks which are rooted in residual and dense connections respectively for pattern recognitions with completeness representation theory for model assessment. Comparative analyses against pure classical models with detailed frameworks reveal that our hybrid models with lower parameter complexity not only match the generalization power of pure classical models, but also outperform them notably in resistance to parameter attacks with various asymmetric noises. Moreover, our hybrid models indicate unique superiority to prevent gradient explosion problems through theoretical argumentation. Eventually, We elaborate on the application scenarios where our hybrid models are applicable and efficient, which paves the way for their industrialization and commercialization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
