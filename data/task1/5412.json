Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explainability in Machine Learning: a Pedagogical Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Given the importance of integrating of explainability into machine learning, at present, there are a lack of pedagogical resources exploring this. Specifically, we have found a need for resources in explaining how one can teach the advantages of explainability in machine learning. Often pedagogical approaches in the field of machine learning focus on getting students prepared to apply various models in the real world setting, but much less attention is given to teaching students the various techniques one could employ to explain a model’s decision-making process. Furthermore, explainability can benefit from a narrative structure that aids one in understanding which techniques are governed by which questions about the data. We provide a pedagogical perspective on how to structure the learning process to better impart knowledge to students and researchers in machine learning, when and how to implement various explainability techniques as well as how to interpret the results. We discuss a system of teaching explainability in machine learning, by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of various opaque and transparent machine learning models, as well as when to utilize specific explainability techniques and the various frameworks used to structure the tools for explainability. Among discussing concrete assignments, we will also discuss ways to structure potential assignments to best help students learn to use explainability as a tool alongside any given machine learning application. Data science professionals completing the course will have a birds-eye view of a rapidly developing area and will be confident to deploy machine learning more widely. A preliminary analysis on the effectiveness of a recently delivered course following the structure presented here is included as evidence supporting our pedagogical approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
