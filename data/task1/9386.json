      "content": "Paper Title: Combating Confirmation Bias: A Unified Pseudo-Labeling Framework for Entity Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. It has been a compelling but challenging task that requires the integration of heterogeneous information from different KGs to expand the knowledge coverage and enhance inference abilities. To circumvent the shortage of prior alignment seeds provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the training data for model retraining. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias has been largely overlooked during pseudo-labeling, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) The Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to enable more accurate determination of entity correspondences across two KGs and to mitigate the adverse impact of erroneous matches. A simple but highly effective criterion is further devised to derive pseudo-labeled entity pairs that satisfy one-to-one correspondences at each iteration. (2) The cross-iteration pseudo-label calibration operates across multiple consecutive iterations to further improve the pseudo-labeling precision rate by reducing the local pseudo-label selection variability with a theoretical guarantee. The two components are respectively designed to eliminate Type I and Type II pseudo-labeling errors identified through our analyse. The calibrated pseudo-labels are thereafter used to augment prior alignment seeds to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. The experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance with limited prior alignment seeds.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
