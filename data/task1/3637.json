Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Discrete Auto-regressive Variational Attention Models for Text Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely applied for text modeling. In practice, however, they are troubled by two challenges: information underrepresentation and posterior collapse. The former arises as only the last hidden state of LSTM encoder is transformed into the latent space, which is generally insufficient to summarize the data. The latter is a long-standing problem during the training of VAEs as the optimization is trapped to a disastrous local optimum. In this paper, we propose Discrete Auto-regressive Variational Attention Model (DAVAM) to address the challenges. Specifically, we introduce an auto-regressive variational attention approach to enrich the latent space by effectively capturing the semantic dependency from the input. We further design discrete latent space for the variational attention and mathematically show that our model is free from posterior collapse. Extensive experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate the superiority of DAVAM against several VAE counterparts. Code will be released.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
