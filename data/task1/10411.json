      "content": "Paper Title: Aesthetic Preference Prediction in Interior Design: Fuzzy Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Interior design is all about creating spaces that look and feel good. However, the subjective nature of aesthetic preferences presents a significant challenge in defining and quantifying what makes an interior design visually appealing. The current paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel methodology for quantifying and predicting aesthetic preferences in interior design. Our study combines fuzzy logic with image processing techniques. We collected a dataset of interior design images from social media platforms, focusing on essential visual attributes such as color harmony, lightness, and complexity. We integrate these features using weighted average to compute a general aesthetic score. Our approach considers individual color preferences in calculating the overall aesthetic preference. We initially gather user ratings for primary colors like red, brown, and others to understand their preferences. Then, we use the pixel count of the top five dominant colors in the image to get the color scheme preference. The color scheme preference and the aesthetic score are then passed as inputs to the fuzzy inference system to calculate an overall preference score. This score represents a comprehensive measure of the user’s preference for a particular interior design, considering their color choices and general aesthetic appeal. We used the 2AFC (Two-Alternative Forced Choice) method to validate our methodology, achieving a notable hit rate of 0.7. This study can help designers and professionals better understand and meet people’s interior design preferences, especially in a world that relies heavily on digital media.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
