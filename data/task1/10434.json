      "content": "Paper Title: RadDQN: a Deep Q Learning-based Architecture for Finding Time-efficient Minimum Radiation Exposure Pathway\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques have sparked its multifaceted applications in the automation sector. Managing complex decision-making problems with DRL encourages its use in the nuclear industry for tasks such as optimizing radiation exposure to the personnel during normal operating conditions and potential accidental scenarios. However, the lack of efficient reward function and effective exploration strategy thwarted its implementation in the development of radiation-aware autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for achieving maximum radiation protection. Here, in this article, we address these intriguing issues and introduce a deep Q-learning based architecture (RadDQN) that operates on a radiation-aware reward function to provide time-efficient minimum radiation-exposure pathway in a radiation zone. We propose a set of unique exploration strategies that fine-tune the extent of exploration and exploitation based on the state-wise variation in radiation exposure during training. Further, we benchmark the predicted path with grid-based deterministic method. We demonstrate that the formulated reward function in conjugation with adequate exploration strategy is effective in handling several scenarios with drastically different radiation field distributions. When compared to vanilla DQN, our model achieves a superior convergence rate and higher training stability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
