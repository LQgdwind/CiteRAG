Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exemplar LCA-Decoder: A Scalable Framework for On-Chip Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neuromorphic computing has recently gained significant attention as a promising combined approach for developing energy-efficient, parallel computing systems inspired by the human brain. Efficient training algorithms are imperative for the effective processing of data on neuromorphic platforms; however, their absence remains a notable gap in the field. In this paper, we reduce the gap by proposing an innovative encoder-decoder technique that leverages sparse coding and the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to provide a computationally efficient and power-conscious algorithm specifically designed for neuromorphic platforms. Using Exemplar LCA-Decoder we reduce the computational demands and memory requirements associated with training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using error backpropagation methods. Our results show notable test accuracy on ImageNet and CIFAR10/100 datasets, surpassing the previously achieved SNN accuracy on these datasets. Additionally, Exemplar LCA-Decoder is scalable and allows expanding the model and adding new data points and classes cost-effectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
