Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking pooling in graph neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph pooling is a central component of a myriad of graph neural network (GNN) architectures. As an inheritance from traditional CNNs, most approaches formulate graph pooling as a cluster assignment problem, extending the idea of local patches in regular grids to graphs. Despite the wide adherence to this design choice, no work has rigorously evaluated its influence on the success of GNNs. In this paper, we build upon representative GNNs and introduce variants that challenge the need for locality-preserving representations, either using randomization or clustering on the complement graph. Strikingly, our experiments demonstrate that using these variants does not result in any decrease in performance. To understand this phenomenon, we study the interplay between convolutional layers and the subsequent pooling ones. We show that the convolutions play a leading role in the learned representations. In contrast to the common belief, local pooling is not responsible for the success of GNNs on relevant and widely-used benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
