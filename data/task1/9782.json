Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Augmentation for Class-Imbalanced Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Class imbalance is prevalent in real-world node classification tasks and often biases graph learning models toward majority classes. Most existing studies root from a node-centric perspective and aim to address the class imbalance in training data by node/class-wise reweighting or resampling. In this paper, we approach the source of the class-imbalance bias from an under-explored topology-centric perspective. Our investigation reveals that beyond the inherently skewed training class distribution, the graph topology also plays an important role in the formation of predictive bias: we identify two fundamental challenges, namely ambivalent and distant message-passing, that can exacerbate the bias by aggravating majority-class over-generalization and minority-class misclassification. In light of these findings, we devise a lightweight topological augmentation method ToBA to dynamically rectify the nodes influenced by ambivalent/distant message-passing during graph learning, so as to mitigate the class-imbalance bias. We highlight that ToBA is a model-agnostic, efficient, and versatile solution that can be seamlessly combined with and further boost other imbalance-handling techniques. Systematic experiments validate the superior performance of ToBA in both promoting imbalanced node classification and mitigating the prediction bias between different classes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
