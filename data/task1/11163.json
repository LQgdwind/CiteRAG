The latter is a discrete relaxation of the property that in Euclidean spaces the union of two geodesics sharing a terminal segment must be also a geodesic. Recently in (Dragan & Ducoffe, WG’23) we initiated the study of the algorithmic applications of αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i}-metric graphs. Our results in this prior work were very similar to those established in (Chepoi et al., SoCG’08) and (Chepoi et al., COCOA’18) for graphs with bounded hyperbolicity. The latter is a heavily studied metric tree-likeness parameter first introduced by Gromov. In this paper, we clarify the relationship between hyperbolicity and the αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i}-metric property, proving that αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i}-metric graphs are f​(i)𝑓𝑖f(i)-hyperbolic for some function f𝑓f linear in i𝑖i. We give different proofs of this result, using various equivalent definitions to graph hyperbolicity. By contrast, we give simple constructions of 111-hyperbolic graphs that are not αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i}-metric for any constant i𝑖i. Finally, in the special case of i=1𝑖1i=1, we prove that α1subscript𝛼1\\alpha_{1}-metric graphs are 111-hyperbolic, and the bound is sharp. By doing so, we can answer some questions left open in (Dragan & Ducoffe, WG’23). Keywords: metric graph classes; αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i}-metric; hyperbolicity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
