The proposed methodology consists of two major steps. In the first step, we recast the reliability assessment of MSS as a machine learning problem using the framework of PINN. A feedforward neural network with two individual loss groups are constructed to encode the initial condition and state transitions governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in MSS. Next, we tackle the problem of high imbalance in the magnitude of the back-propagated gradients in PINN from a multi-task learning perspective. Particularly, we treat each element in the loss function as an individual task, and adopt a gradient surgery approach named projecting conflicting gradients (PCGrad), where a taskâ€™s gradient is projected onto the norm plane of any other task that has a conflicting gradient. The gradient projection operation significantly mitigates the detrimental effects caused by the gradient interference when training PINN, thus accelerating the convergence speed of PINN to high-precision solutions to MSS reliability assessment. With the proposed PINN-based framework, we investigate its applications for MSS reliability assessment in several different contexts in terms of time-independent or dependent state transitions and system scales varying from small to medium. The results demonstrate that the proposed PINN-based framework shows generic and remarkable performance in MSS reliability assessment, and the incorporation of PCGrad in PINN leads to substantial improvement in solution quality and convergence speed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
