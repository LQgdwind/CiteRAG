      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Trimodal Relation for Audio-Visual Question Answering with Missing Modality\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) methods rely on complete visual and audio input to answer questions accurately. However, in real-world scenarios, issues such as device malfunctions and data transmission errors frequently result in missing audio or visual modality. In such cases, existing AVQA methods suffer significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a framework that ensures robust AVQA performance even when a modality is missing. First, we propose a Relation-aware Missing Modal (RMM) generator with Relation-aware Missing Modal Recalling (RMMR) loss to enhance the ability of the generator to recall missing modal information by understanding the relationships and context among the available modalities. Second, we design an Audio-Visual Relation-aware (AVR) diffusion model with Audio-Visual Enhancing (AVE) loss to further enhance audio-visual features by leveraging the relationships and shared cues between the audio-visual modalities. As a result, our method can provide accurate answers by effectively utilizing available information even when input modalities are missing. We believe our method holds potential applications not only in AVQA research but also in various multi-modal scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/VisualAIKHU/Missing-AVQA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
