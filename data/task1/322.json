      "content": "Paper Title: TEDL: A Text Encryption Method Based on Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent years have seen an increasing emphasis on information security, and various encryption methods have been proposed. However, for symmetric encryption methods, the well-known encryption techniques still rely on the key space to guarantee security and suffer from frequent key updating. Aiming to solve those problems, this paper proposes a novel text encryption method based on deep learning called TEDL, where the secret key includes hyperparameters in deep learning model and the core step of encryption is transforming input data into weights trained under hyperparameters. Firstly, both communication parties establish a word vector table by training a deep learning model according to specified hyperparameters. Then, a self-update codebook is constructed on the word vector table with the SHA-256 function and other tricks. When communication starts, encryption and decryption are equivalent to indexing and inverted indexing on the codebook, respectively, thus achieving the transformation between plaintext and ciphertext. Results of experiments and relevant analyses show that TEDL performs well for security, efficiency, generality, and has a lower demand for the frequency of key redistribution. Especially, as a supplement to current encryption methods, the time-consuming process of constructing a codebook increases the difficulty of brute-force attacks while not degrade the communication efficiency.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
