Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: RotEqNet: Rotation-Equivariant Network for Fluid Systems with Symmetric High-Order Tensors\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the recent application of scientific modeling, machine learning models are largely applied to facilitate computational simulations of fluid systems. Rotation symmetry is a general property for most symmetric fluid systems. However, in general, current machine learning methods have no theoretical guarantee of Rotation symmetry. By observing an important property of contraction and rotation operation on high order symmetric tensors, we prove that the rotation operation is preserved via tensor contraction. Based on this theoretical justification, in this paper, we introduce Rotation-Equivariant Network (RotEqNet) to guarantee the property of rotation-equivariance for high order tensors in fluid systems. We implement RotEqNet and evaluate our claims with four case studies on various fluid systems. The property of error reduction and rotation-equivariance is verified in these case studies. Results are showing the high superiority of RotEqNet compared to traditional machine learning methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
