      "content": "Paper Title: ShuttleSet: A Human-Annotated Stroke-Level Singles Dataset for Badminton Tactical Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. With the recent progress in sports analytics, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of mining insights into players’ tactics for improving performance quality and fan engagement. This is attributed to the availability of public ground-truth datasets. While there are a few available datasets for turn-based sports for action detection, these datasets severely lack structured source data and stroke-level records since these require high-cost labeling efforts from domain experts and are hard to detect using automatic techniques. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence approaches is significantly hindered when existing models are applied to more challenging structured turn-based sequences. In this paper, we present ShuttleSet, the largest publicly-available badminton singles dataset with annotated stroke-level records. It contains 104 sets, 3,685 rallies, and 36,492 strokes in 44 matches between 2018 and 2021 with 27 top-ranking men’s singles and women’s singles players. ShuttleSet is manually annotated with a computer-aided labeling tool to increase the labeling efficiency and effectiveness of selecting the shot type with a choice of 18 distinct classes, the corresponding hitting locations, and the locations of both players at each stroke. In the experiments, we provide multiple benchmarks (i.e., stroke influence, stroke forecasting, and movement forecasting) with baselines to illustrate the practicability of using ShuttleSet for turn-based analytics, which is expected to stimulate both academic and sports communities. Over the past two years, a visualization platform has been deployed to illustrate the variability of analysis cases from ShuttleSet for coaches to delve into players’ tactical preferences with human-interactive interfaces, which was also used by national badminton teams during multiple international high-ranking matches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.

The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
