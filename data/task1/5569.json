Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Multi-Tenant Deep Learning Inference on GPU\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep Learning (DL) models have achieved superior performance. Meanwhile, the computing hardware like NVIDIA GPUs also demonstrated strong computing scaling trends with 2Ã—\\times throughput and memory bandwidth for each generation. With such strong computing scaling of GPUs, multi-tenant deep learning inference by co-locating multiple DL models onto the same GPU become widely deployed to improve resource utilization, enhance serving throughput, and reduce energy cost, etc. However, achieving efficient multi-tenant DL inference is challenging which requires thorough full-stack system optimization. Previous surveys either target at summarizing single tenant deep learning inference optimizations, or only focus on certain single optimization layer alone, such as graph-level, kernel-level, etc. This survey aims to summarize and categorize the emerging challenges and optimization opportunities for multi-tenant DL inference on GPU. By overviewing the entire optimization stack, summarizing the multi-tenant computing innovations, and elaborating the recent technique advances, we hope that this survey could shed light on new optimization perspectives and motivate novel works in future large-scale DL inference system optimization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
