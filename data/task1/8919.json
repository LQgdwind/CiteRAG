Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Physical Deep Reinforcement Learning: Safety and Unknown Unknowns\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose the Phy-DRL: a physics-model-regulated deep reinforcement learning framework for safety-critical autonomous systems. The Phy-DRL is unique in three innovations: i) proactive unknown-unknowns training, ii) conjunctive residual control (i.e., integration of data-driven control and physics-model-based control) and safety- & stability-sensitive reward, and iii) physics-model-based neural network editing, including link editing and activation editing. Thanks to the concurrent designs, the Phy-DRL is able to 1) tolerate unknown-unknowns disturbances, 2) guarantee mathematically provable safety and stability, and 3) strictly comply with physical knowledge pertaining to Bellman equation and reward. The effectiveness of the Phy-DRL is finally validated by an inverted pendulum and a quadruped robot. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with purely data-driven DRL, Phy-DRL features remarkably fewer learning parameters, accelerated training and enlarged reward, while offering enhanced model robustness and safety assurance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
