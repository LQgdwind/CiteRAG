      "content": "Paper Title: RealNet: Combining Optimized Object Detection with Information Fusion Depth Estimation Co-Design Method on IoT\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Depth Estimation and Object Detection Recognition play an important role in autonomous driving technology under the guidance of deep learning artificial intelligence [25]. We propose a hybrid structure called RealNet: a co-design method combining the model-streamlined recognition algorithm, the depth estimation algorithm with information fusion, and deploying them on the Jetson-Nano for unmanned vehicles with monocular vision sensors. We use ROS for experiment. The method proposed in this paper is suitable for mobile platforms with high real-time request. Innovation of our method is using information fusion to compensate the problem of insufficient frame rate of output image, and improve the robustness of target detection and depth estimation under monocular vision.Object Detection is based on YOLO-v5( https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) [28]. We have simplified the network structure of its DarkNet53 [7] and realized a prediction speed up to 0.01s. Depth Estimation is based on the VNL Depth Estimation, which considers multiple geometric constraints in 3D global space. [48] It calculates the loss function by calculating the deviation of the virtual normal vector VN and the label, which can obtain deeper depth information. We use PnP fusion algorithm to solve the problem of insufficient frame rate of depth map output. It solves the motion estimation depth from three-dimensional target to two-dimensional point based on corner feature matching, which is faster than VNL calculation. We interpolate VNL output and PnP [33] output to achieve information fusion. Experiments show that this can effectively eliminate the jitter of depth information and improve robustness. At the control end, this method combines the results of target detection and depth estimation to calculate the target position, and uses a pure tracking control algorithm to track it.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
