Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mining Reaction and Diffusion Dynamics in Social Activities\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Large quantifies of online user activity data, such as weekly web search volumes, which co-evolve with the mutual influence of several queries and locations, serve as an important social sensor. It is an important task to accurately forecast the future activity by discovering latent interactions from such data, i.e., the ecosystems between each query and the flow of influences between each area. However, this is a difficult problem in terms of data quantity and complex patterns covering the dynamics. To tackle the problem, we propose FluxCube, which is an effective mining method that forecasts large collections of co-evolving online user activity and provides good interpretability. Our model is the expansion of a combination of two mathematical models: a reaction-diffusion system provides a framework for modeling the flow of influences between local area groups and an ecological system models the latent interactions between each query. Also, by leveraging the concept of physics-informed neural networks, FluxCube achieves high interpretability obtained from the parameters and high forecasting performance, together. Extensive experiments on real datasets showed that FluxCube outperforms comparable models in terms of the forecasting accuracy, and each component in FluxCube contributes to the enhanced performance. We then show some case studies that FluxCube can extract useful latent interactions between queries and area groups.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
