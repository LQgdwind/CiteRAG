Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep autoregressive modeling for land use and land cover\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Land use / land cover (LULC) modeling is a challenging task due to long-range dependencies between geographic features and distinct spatial patterns related to topography, ecology, and human development. We identify a strong connection between modeling spatial patterns of land use and the task of image inpainting from computer vision, and conduct a study of a modified PixelCNN architecture with approximately 19 million parameters for modeling LULC. Compared with a benchmark spatial statistical model, we find that the former is capable of capturing much richer spatial correlation patterns such as roads and water bodies but does not produce a calibrated predictive distribution, suggesting the need for further tuning. We find evidence of predictive underdispersion with regard to important ecologically-relevant land use statistics such as patch count and adjacency, which can be mitigated to some extent by manipulating sampling variability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
