      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Sparse Least Absolute Deviation Regression with Differential Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms have attracted increasing attention because of their important applications in many scientific fields. However, in the literature, most privacy-preserving algorithms demand learning objectives to be strongly convex and Lipschitz smooth, which thus cannot cover a wide class of robust loss functions (e.g., quantile/least absolute loss). In this work, we aim to develop a fast privacy-preserving learning solution for a sparse robust regression problem. Our learning loss consists of a robust least absolute loss and an ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} sparse penalty term. To fast solve the non-smooth loss under a given privacy budget, we develop a Fast Robust And Privacy-Preserving Estimation (FRAPPE) algorithm for least absolute deviation regression. Our algorithm achieves a fast estimation by reformulating the sparse LAD problem as a penalized least square estimation problem and adopts a three-stage noise injection to guarantee the (œµ,Œ¥)italic-œµùõø(\\epsilon,\\delta)-differential privacy. We show that our algorithm can achieve better privacy and statistical accuracy trade-off compared with the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving regression algorithms. In the end, we conduct experiments to verify the efficiency of our proposed FRAPPE algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
