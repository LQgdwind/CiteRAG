Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Can counterfactual explanations of AI systems‚Äô predictions skew lay users‚Äô causal intuitions about the world? If so, can we correct for that?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Counterfactual (CF) explanations have been employed as one of the modes of explainability in explainable AI‚Äîboth to increase the transparency of AI systems and to provide recourse. Cognitive science and psychology have pointed out that people regularly use CFs to express causal relationships. Most AI systems, however, are only able to capture associations or correlations in data so interpreting them as casual would not be justified. In this paper, we present two experiments (total N=364ùëÅ364N=364) exploring the effects of CF explanations of AI system‚Äôs predictions on lay people‚Äôs causal beliefs about the real world. In Experiment 1 we found that providing CF explanations of an AI system‚Äôs predictions does indeed (unjustifiably) affect people‚Äôs causal beliefs regarding factors/features the AI uses and that people are more likely to view them as causal factors in the real world. Inspired by the literature on misinformation and health warning messaging, Experiment 2 tested whether we can correct for the unjustified change in causal beliefs. We found that pointing out that AI systems capture correlations and not necessarily causal relationships can attenuate the effects of CF explanations on people‚Äôs causal beliefs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
