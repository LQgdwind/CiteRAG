Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multiplierless MP-Kernel Machine For Energy-efficient Edge Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a novel framework for designing multiplierless kernel machines that can be used on resource-constrained platforms like intelligent edge devices. The framework uses a piecewise linear (PWL) approximation based on a margin propagation (MP) technique and uses only addition/subtraction, shift, comparison, and register underflow/overflow operations. We propose a hardware-friendly MP-based inference and online training algorithm that has been optimized for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. Our FPGA implementation eliminates the need for DSP units and reduces the number of LUTs. By reusing the same hardware for inference and training, we show that the platform can overcome classification errors and local minima artifacts that result from the MP approximation. The implementation of this proposed multiplierless MP-kernel machine on FPGA results in an estimated energy consumption of 13.4 pJ and power consumption of 107 mW with ~9k LUTs and FFs each for a 256×3225632256\\times 32 sized kernel making it superior in terms of power, performance, and area compared to other comparable implementations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
