      "content": "Paper Title: Random orthogonal additive filters: a solution to the vanishing/exploding gradient of deep neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Since the recognition in the early nineties of the vanishing/exploding (V/E) gradient issue plaguing the training of neural networks (NNs), significant efforts have been exerted to overcome this obstacle. However, a clear solution to the V/E issue remained elusive so far. In this manuscript a new architecture of NN is proposed, designed to mathematically prevent the V/E issue to occur. The pursuit of approximate dynamical isometry, i.e. parameter configurations where the singular values of the input-output Jacobian are tightly distributed around 1, leads to the derivation of a NNâ€™s architecture that shares common traits with the popular Residual Network model. Instead of skipping connections between layers, the idea is to filter the previous activations orthogonally and add them to the nonlinear activations of the next layer, realising a convex combination between them. Remarkably, the impossibility for the gradient updates to either vanish or explode is demonstrated with analytical bounds that hold even in the infinite depth case. The effectiveness of this method is empirically proved by means of training via backpropagation an extremely deep multilayer perceptron of 50k layers, and an Elman NN to learn long-term dependencies in the input of 10k time steps in the past. Compared with other architectures specifically devised to deal with the V/E problem, e.g. LSTMs for recurrent NNs, the proposed model is way simpler yet more effective. Surprisingly, a single layer vanilla RNN can be enhanced to reach state of the art performance, while converging super fast; for instance on the psMNIST task, it is possible to get test accuracy of over 94%percent9494\\% in the first epoch, and over 98%percent9898\\% after just 10 epochs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
