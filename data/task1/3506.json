Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: IM-META: Influence Maximization Using Node Metadata in Networks With Unknown Topology\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Since the structure of complex networks is often unknown, we may identify the most influential seed nodes by exploring only a part of the underlying network, given a small budget for node queries. We propose IM-META, a solution to influence maximization (IM) in networks with unknown topology by retrieving information from queries and node metadata. Since using such metadata is not without risk due to the noisy nature of metadata and uncertainties in connectivity inference, we formulate a new IM problem that aims to find both seed nodes and queried nodes. In IM-META, we develop an effective method that iteratively performs three steps: 1) we learn the relationship between collected metadata and edges via a Siamese neural network, 2) we select a number of inferred confident edges to construct a reinforced graph, and 3) we identify the next node to query by maximizing the inferred influence spread using our topology-aware ranking strategy. Through experimental evaluation of IM-META on four real-world datasets, we demonstrate a) the speed of network exploration via node queries, b) the effectiveness of each module, c) the superiority over benchmark methods, d) the robustness to more difficult settings, e) the hyperparameter sensitivity, and f) the scalability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
