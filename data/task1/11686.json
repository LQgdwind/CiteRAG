Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multimodal Large Language Model Driven Scenario Testing for Autonomous Vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The generation of corner cases has become increasingly crucial for efficiently testing autonomous vehicles prior to road deployment. However, existing methods struggle to accommodate diverse testing requirements and often lack the ability to generalize to unseen situations, thereby reducing the convenience and usability of the generated scenarios. A method that facilitates easily controllable scenario generation for efficient autonomous vehicles (AV) testing with realistic and challenging situations is greatly needed. To address this, we proposed OmniTester: a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) based framework that fully leverages the extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. OmniTester is designed to generate realistic and diverse scenarios within a simulation environment, offering a robust solution for testing and evaluating AVs. In addition to prompt engineering, we employ tools from Simulation of Urban Mobility to simplify the complexity of codes generated by LLMs. Furthermore, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation and a self-improvement mechanism to enhance the LLM’s understanding of scenarios, thereby increasing its ability to produce more realistic scenes. In the experiments, we demonstrated the controllability and realism of our approaches in generating three types of challenging and complex scenarios. Additionally, we showcased its effectiveness in reconstructing new scenarios described in crash report, driven by the generalization capability of LLMs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
