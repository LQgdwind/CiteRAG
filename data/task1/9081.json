Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Permutation Equivariant Graph Framelets for Heterophilous Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The nature of heterophilous graphs is significantly different from that of homophilous graphs, which causes difficulties in early graph neural network models and suggests aggregations beyond the 1-hop neighborhood. In this paper, we develop a new way to implement multi-scale extraction via constructing Haar-type graph framelets with desired properties of permutation equivariance, efficiency, and sparsity, for deep learning tasks on graphs. We further design a graph framelet neural network model PEGFAN (Permutation Equivariant Graph Framelet Augmented Network) based on our constructed graph framelets. The experiments are conducted on a synthetic dataset and 9 benchmark datasets to compare performance with other state-of-the-art models. The result shows that our model can achieve the best performance on certain datasets of heterophilous graphs (including the majority of heterophilous datasets with relatively larger sizes and denser connections) and competitive performance on the remaining.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
