Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: A new class of generative classifiers based on staged tree models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generative models for classification use the joint probability distribution of the class variable and the features to construct a decision rule. Among generative models, Bayesian networks and naive Bayes classifiers are the most commonly used and provide a clear graphical representation of the relationship among all variables. However, these have the disadvantage of highly restricting the type of relationships that could exist, by not allowing for context-specific independences. Here we introduce a new class of generative classifiers, called staged tree classifiers, which formally account for context-specific independence. They are constructed by a partitioning of the vertices of an event tree from which conditional independence can be formally read. The naive staged tree classifier is also defined, which extends the classic naive Bayes classifier whilst retaining the same complexity. An extensive simulation study shows that the classification accuracy of staged tree classifiers is competitive with that of state-of-the-art classifiers and an example showcases their use in practice.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
