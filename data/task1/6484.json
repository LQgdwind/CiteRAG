Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Using attention methods to predict judicial outcomes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The prediction of legal judgments is one of the most recognized fields in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Law combined. By legal prediction, we mean intelligent systems capable of predicting specific judicial characteristics such as the judicial outcome, the judicial class, and the prediction of a particular case. In this study, we used an artificial intelligence classifier to predict the decisions of Brazilian courts. To this end, we developed a text crawler to extract data from official Brazilian electronic legal systems, consisting of two datasets of cases of second-degree murder and active corruption. We applied various classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, and others, to predict judicial outcomes by analyzing text features from the dataset. Our research demonstrated that Regression Trees, Gated Recurring Units, and Hierarchical Attention Networks tended to have higher metrics across our datasets. As the final goal, we searched the weights of one of the algorithms, Hierarchical Attention Networks, to find samples of the words that might be used to acquit or convict defendants based on their relevance to the algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 61\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
