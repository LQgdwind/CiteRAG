Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Enhance DNN Adversarial Robustness and Efficiency via Injecting Noise to Non-Essential Neurons\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized a wide range of industries, from healthcare and finance to automotive, by offering unparalleled capabilities in data analysis and decision-making. Despite their transforming impact, DNNs face two critical challenges: the vulnerability to adversarial attacks and the increasing computational costs associated with more complex and larger models. In this paper, we introduce an effective method designed to simultaneously enhance adversarial robustness and execution efficiency. Unlike prior studies that enhance robustness via uniformly injecting noise, we introduce a non-uniform noise injection algorithm, strategically applied at each DNN layer to disrupt adversarial perturbations introduced in attacks. By employing approximation techniques, our approach identifies and protects essential neurons while strategically introducing noise into non-essential neurons. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully enhances both robustness and efficiency across several attack scenarios, model architectures, and datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
