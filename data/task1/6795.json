      "content": "Paper Title: Level-set based pre-processing algorithm for particle-based methods\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Obtaining high quality particle distribution representing clean geometry in pre-processing is essential for the simulation accuracy of the particle-based methods. In this paper, several level-set based techniques for cleaning up ‘dirty’ geometries automatically and generating homogeneous particle distributions are presented. First, a non-resolved structure identifying method based on level-set field is employed to detect the tiny fragments which make the geometry ‘dirty’ under a given resolutions. Second, a re-distance algorithm is proposed to remove the tiny fragments and reconstruct clean and smooth geometries. Third, a ‘static confinement’ boundary condition is developed in the particle relaxation process. By complementing the kernel support for the particles near the geometric surface, the boundary condition achieves better body-fitted particle distribution on the narrow region with high curvature. Several numerical examples include a 2D airfoil 30P30N, 3D SPHinXsys symbol, a skyscraper with a flagpole and an inferior vena cava demonstrate that the present method not only cleans up the ‘dirty’ geometries efficiently, but also provides better body-fitted homogeneous particle distribution for complex geometry.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
