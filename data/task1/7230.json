Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Time-rEversed diffusioN tEnsor Transformer: A new TENET of Few-Shot Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of Few-shot Object Detection. Existing FSOD pipelines (i) use average-pooled representations that result in information loss; and/or (ii) discard position information that can help detect object instances. Consequently, such pipelines are sensitive to large intra-class appearance and geometric variations between support and query images. To address these drawbacks, we propose a Time-rEversed diffusioN tEnsor Transformer (TENET), which i) forms high-order tensor representations that capture multi-way feature occurrences that are highly discriminative, and ii) uses a transformer that dynamically extracts correlations between the query image and the entire support set, instead of a single average-pooled support embedding. We also propose a Transformer Relation Head (TRH), equipped with higher-order representations, which encodes correlations between query regions and the entire support set, while being sensitive to the positional variability of object instances. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC, FSOD, and COCO.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
