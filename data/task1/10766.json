Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Savvy: Trustworthy Autonomous Vehicles Architecture (PREPRINT)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The increasing interest in Autonomous Vehicles (AV) is notable due to business, safety, and performance reasons. While there is salient success in recent AV architectures, hinging on the advancements in AI models, there is a growing number of fatal incidents that impedes full AVs from going mainstream. This calls for the need to revisit the fundamentals of building safety-critical AV architectures. However, this direction should not deter leveraging the power of AI. To this end, we propose Savvy, a new trustworthy intelligent AV architecture that achieves the best of both worlds. Savvy makes a clear separation between the control plane and the data plane to guarantee the safety-first principles. The former assume control to ensure safety using design-time defined rules, while launching the latter for optimising decisions as much as possible within safety time-bounds. This is achieved through guided Time-aware predictive quality degradation (TPQD): using dynamic ML models that can be tuned to provide either richer or faster outputs based on the available safety time bounds. For instance, Savvy allows to safely identify an elephant as an obstacle (a mere object) the earliest possible, rather than optimally recognizing it as an elephant when it is too late. This position paper presents the Savvy’s motivations and concept, whereas empirical evaluation is a work in progress.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
