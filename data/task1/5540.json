Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Switch Trajectory Transformer with Distributional Value Approximation for Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose SwitchTT, a multi-task extension to Trajectory Transformer but enhanced with two striking features: (i) exploiting a sparsely activated model to reduce computation cost in multi-task offline model learning and (ii) adopting a distributional trajectory value estimator that improves policy performance, especially in sparse reward settings. These two enhancements make SwitchTT suitable for solving multi-task offline reinforcement learning problems, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the multi-task dataset. More specifically, SwitchTT exploits switch transformer model architecture for multi-task policy learning, allowing us to improve model capacity without proportional computation cost. Also, SwitchTT approximates the distribution rather than the expectation of trajectory value, mitigating the effects of the Monte-Carlo Value estimator suffering from poor sample complexity, especially in the sparse-reward setting. We evaluate our method using the suite of ten sparse-reward tasks from the gym-mini-grid environment. We show an improvement of 10% over Trajectory Transformer across 10-task learning and obtain up to 90% increase in offline model training speed. Our results also demonstrate the advantage of the switch transformer model for absorbing expert knowledge and the importance of value distribution in evaluating the trajectory.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
