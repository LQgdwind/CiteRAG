Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: TopicBERT: A Transformer transfer learning based memory–graph approach for multimodal streaming social media topic detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Real time nature of social networks with bursty short messages and their respective large data scale spread among vast variety of topics are research interest of many researchers. These properties of social networks which are known as 5’Vs of big data has led to many unique and enlightenment algorithms and techniques applied to large social networking datasets and data streams. Many of these researches are based on detection and tracking of hot topics and trending social media events that help revealing many unanswered questions. These algorithms and in some cases software products mostly rely on the nature of the language itself. Although, other techniques such as unsupervised data mining methods are language independent but many requirements for a comprehensive solution are not met. Many research issues such as noisy sentences that adverse grammar and new online user invented words are challenging maintenance of a good social network topic detection and tracking methodology; The semantic relationship between words and in most cases, synonyms are also ignored by many of these researches. In this research, we use Transformers combined with an incremental community detection algorithm. Transformer in one hand, provides the semantic relation between words in different contexts. On the other hand, the proposed graph mining technique enhances the resulting topics with aid of simple structural rules. Named entity recognition from multimodal data, image and text, labels the named entities with entity type and the extracted topics are tuned using them. All operations of proposed system has been applied with big social data perspective under NoSQL technologies. In order to present a working and systematic solution, we combined MongoDB with Neo4j as two major database systems of our work. The proposed system shows higher precision and recall compared to other methods in three different datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
