Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling the impact of external influence on green behaviour spreading in multilayer financial networks This work was supported by the Polish National Science Centre, grant no. 2016/21/D/ST6/02408 (PB, JJ) and 2018/31/B/HS4/00570 (MZ, AS). We would like to acknowledge the support of prof. Thomas Lux (University of Kiel) in the understanding multilayer bank-companies network model and sharing the data on connections between banks, and banks and companies.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Growing awareness of the impact of business activity on the environment increases the pressure for governing bodies to address this issue. One possibility is to encourage or force the market into green behaviours. However, it is often hard to predict how different actions affect the market. Thus, to help with that, in this paper, we have proposed the green behaviour spreading model in the bank-company multilayer network. This model allows assessing how various elements like the duration of external influence, targeted market segment, or intensity of action affect the outcome regarding market greening level. The model evaluation results indicate that governing bodies, depending on the market \"openness\" to green activities, can adjust the duration and intensity of the proposed action. The strength of the impact can be changed by the public or private authority with the use of obligatory or voluntary rules and the proportion of influenced banks. This research may be helpful in the process of creating the optimal setups and increasing the performance of greening policies implementation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
