Motivated by applications where curves stem from paths and walks on an underlying graph (such as a road network), we define and study the Fr√©chet distance for paths and walks on graphs. When provided with a distance oracle of Gùê∫G with O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) query time, the classical quadratic-time dynamic program can compute the Fr√©chet distance between two walks PùëÉP and QùëÑQ in a graph Gùê∫G in O‚Äã(|P|‚ãÖ|Q|)ùëÇ‚ãÖùëÉùëÑO(|P|\\cdot|Q|) time. We show that there are situations where the graph structure helps with computing Fr√©chet distance: when the graph Gùê∫G is planar, we apply existing (approximate) distance oracles to compute a (1+Œµ)1ùúÄ(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation of the Fr√©chet distance between any shortest path PùëÉP and any walk QùëÑQ in O‚Äã(|G|‚Äãlog‚Å°|G|/Œµ+|P|+|Q|Œµ)ùëÇùê∫ùê∫ùúÄùëÉùëÑùúÄO(|G|\\log|G|/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}+|P|+\\frac{|Q|}{\\varepsilon}) time. We generalise this result to near-shortest paths, i.e. Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa-straight paths, as we show how to compute a (1+Œµ)1ùúÄ(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation between a Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa-straight path PùëÉP and any walk QùëÑQ in O‚Äã(|G|‚Äãlog‚Å°|G|/Œµ+|P|+Œ∫‚Äã|Q|Œµ)ùëÇùê∫ùê∫ùúÄùëÉùúÖùëÑùúÄO(|G|\\log|G|/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}+|P|+\\frac{\\kappa|Q|}{\\varepsilon}) time. Our algorithmic results hold for both the strong and the weak discrete Fr√©chet distance over the shortest path metric in Gùê∫G. Finally, we show that additional assumptions on the input, such as our assumption on path straightness, are indeed necessary to obtain truly subquadratic running time. We provide a conditional lower bound showing that the Fr√©chet distance, or even its 1.011.011.01-approximation, between arbitrary paths in a weighted planar graph cannot be computed in O‚Äã((|P|‚ãÖ|Q|)1‚àíŒ¥)ùëÇsuperscript‚ãÖùëÉùëÑ1ùõøO((|P|\\cdot|Q|)^{1-\\delta}) time for any Œ¥>0ùõø0\\delta>0 unless the Orthogonal Vector Hypothesis fails. For walks, this lower bound holds even when Gùê∫G is planar, unit-weight and has O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) vertices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
