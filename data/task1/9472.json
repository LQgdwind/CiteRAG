      "content": "Paper Title: MPDIoU: A Loss for Efficient and Accurate Bounding Box Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bounding box regression (BBR) has been widely used in object detection and instance segmentation, which is an important step in object localization. However, most of the existing loss functions for bounding box regression cannot be optimized when the predicted box has the same aspect ratio as the groundtruth box, but the width and height values are exactly different. In order to tackle the issues mentioned above, we fully explore the geometric features of horizontal rectangle and propose a novel bounding box similarity comparison metric M‚ÄãP‚ÄãD‚ÄãI‚Äão‚ÄãUùëÄùëÉùê∑ùêºùëúùëàMPDIoU based on minimum point distance, which contains all of the relevant factors considered in the existing loss functions, namely overlapping or non-overlapping area, central points distance, and deviation of width and height, while simplifying the calculation process. On this basis, we propose a bounding box regression loss function based on M‚ÄãP‚ÄãD‚ÄãI‚Äão‚ÄãUùëÄùëÉùê∑ùêºùëúùëàMPDIoU, called ‚ÑíM‚ÄãP‚ÄãD‚ÄãI‚Äão‚ÄãUsubscript‚ÑíùëÄùëÉùê∑ùêºùëúùëà\\mathcal{L}_{MPDIoU}. Experimental results show that the MPDIoU loss function is applied to state-of-the-art instance segmentation (e.g., YOLACT) and object detection (e.g., YOLOv7) model trained on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and IIIT5k outperforms existing loss functions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
