Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Strong Structural Bounds for MaxSAT: The Fine Details of Using Neuromorphic and Quantum Hardware Accelerators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Hardware accelerators like quantum annealers or neuromorphic chips are capable of finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian. A promising route in utilizing these devices is via methods from automated reasoning: The problem at hand is first encoded into maxsat; then maxsat is reduced to max2sat; and finally, max2sat is translated into a Hamiltonian. It was observed that different encodings can dramatically affect the efficiency of the hardware accelerators. Yet, previous studies were only concerned with the size of the encodings rather than with syntactic or structural properties. We establish structure-aware reductions between maxsat, max2sat, and the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (qubo) that underlies such hardware accelerators. All these problems turn out to be equivalent under linear-time, treewidth-preserving reductions. As a consequence, we obtain tight lower bounds under ETH\\mathrm{ETH} and SETH\\mathrm{SETH} for max2sat and qubo, as well as a new time-optimal fixed-parameter algorithm for qubo. While our results are tight up to a constant additive factor for the primal treewidth, we require a constant multiplicative factor for the incidence treewidth. To close the emerging gap, we supplement our results with novel time-optimal algorithms for fragments of maxsat based on model counting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
