Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: SITTA: Single Image Texture Translation for Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advances in data augmentation enable one to translate images by learning the mapping between a source domain and a target domain. Existing methods tend to learn the distributions by training a model on a variety of datasets, with results evaluated largely in a subjective manner. Relatively few works in this area, however, study the potential use of image synthesis methods for recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose and explore the problem of image translation for data augmentation. We first propose a lightweight yet efficient model for translating texture to augment images based on a single input of source texture, allowing for fast training and testing, referred to as Single Image Texture Translation for data Augmentation (SITTA). Then we explore the use of augmented data in long-tailed and few-shot image classification tasks. We find the proposed augmentation method and workflow is capable of translating the texture of input data into a target domain, leading to consistently improved image recognition performance. Finally, we examine how SITTA and related image translation methods can provide a basis for a data-efficient, “augmentation engineering” approach to model training. Codes are available at https://github.com/Boyiliee/SITTA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
