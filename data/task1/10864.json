Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: DIGIC: Domain Generalizable Imitation Learning by Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Causality has been combined with machine learning to produce robust representations for domain generalization. Most existing methods of this type require massive data from multiple domains to identify causal features by cross-domain variations, which can be expensive or even infeasible and may lead to misidentification in some cases. In this work, we make a different attempt by leveraging the demonstration data distribution to discover the causal features for a domain generalizable policy. We design a novel framework, called DIGIC, to identify the causal features by finding the direct cause of the expert action from the demonstration data distribution via causal discovery. Our framework can achieve domain generalizable imitation learning with only single-domain data and serve as a complement for cross-domain variation-based methods under non-structural assumptions on the underlying causal models. Our empirical study in various control tasks shows that the proposed framework evidently improves the domain generalization performance and has comparable performance to the expert in the original domain simultaneously.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
