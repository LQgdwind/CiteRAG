      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Multistage Multi-Task Learning for Quality Prediction of Multistage Manufacturing Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In multistage manufacturing systems, modeling multiple quality indices based on the process sensing variables is important. However, the classic modeling technique predicts each quality variable one at a time, which fails to consider the correlation within or between stages. We propose a deep multistage multi-task learning framework to jointly predict all output sensing variables in a unified end-to-end learning framework according to the sequential system architecture in the MMS. Our numerical studies and real case study have shown that the new model has a superior performance compared to many benchmark methods as well as great interpretability through developed variable selection techniques. Keywords: deep neural network, multi-task learning, multistage manufacturing process, quality prediction\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
