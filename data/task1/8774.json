Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: AnalogNAS: A Neural Network Design Framework for Accurate Inference with Analog In-Memory Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The advancement of Deep Learning (DL) is driven by efficient Deep Neural Network (DNN) design and new hardware accelerators. Current DNN design is primarily tailored for general-purpose use and deployment on commercially viable platforms. Inference at the edge requires low latency, compact and power-efficient models, and must be cost-effective. Digital processors based on typical von Neumann architectures are not conducive to edge AI given the large amounts of required data movement in and out of memory. Conversely, analog/mixed-signal in-memory computing hardware accelerators can easily transcend the memory wall of von Neuman architectures when accelerating inference workloads. They offer increased area- and power efficiency, which are paramount in edge resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose AnalogNAS, a framework for automated DNN design targeting deployment on analog In-Memory Computing (IMC) inference accelerators. We conduct extensive hardware simulations to demonstrate the performance of AnalogNAS on State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) models in terms of accuracy and deployment efficiency on various Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) tasks. We also present experimental results that show AnalogNAS models achieving higher accuracy than SOTA models when implemented on a 64-core IMC chip based on Phase Change Memory (PCM). The AnalogNAS search code is released111https://github.com/IBM/analog-nas.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
