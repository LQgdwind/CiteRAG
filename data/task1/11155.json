Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

The research leading to these results was supported by UKRI EP/X024431/1.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Information-processing tasks modelled by homomorphisms between relational structures can witness quantum advantage when entanglement is used as a computational resource. We prove that the occurrence of quantum advantage is determined by the same type of algebraic structure (known as a minion) that captures the polymorphism identities of CSPs and, thus, CSP complexity. We investigate the connection between the minion of quantum advantage and other known minions controlling CSP tractability and width. In this way, we make use of complexity results from the algebraic theory of CSPs to characterise the occurrence of quantum advantage in the case of graphs, and to obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions in the case of arbitrary relational structures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
