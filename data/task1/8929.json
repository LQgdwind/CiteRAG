Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Do We Really Need a Large Number of Visual Prompts?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Due to increasing interest in adapting models on resource-constrained edges, parameter-efficient transfer learning has been widely explored. Among various methods, Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), prepending learnable prompts to input space, shows competitive fine-tuning performance compared to training of full network parameters. However, VPT increases the number of input tokens, resulting in additional computational overhead. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the number of prompts on fine-tuning performance and self-attention operation in a vision transformer architecture. Through theoretical and empirical analysis we show that adding more prompts does not lead to linear performance improvement. Further, we propose a Prompt Condensation (PC) technique that aims to prevent performance degradation from using a small number of prompts. We validate our methods on FGVC and VTAB-1k tasks and show that our approach reduces the number of prompts by ∼similar-to\\sim70% while maintaining accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
