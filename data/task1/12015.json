Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sustainable Hardware Specialization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Hardware specialization is commonly viewed as a way to scale performance in the dark silicon era with modern-day SoCs featuring multiple tens of dedicated accelerators. By only powering on hardware circuitry when needed, accelerators fundamentally trade off chip area for power efficiency. Dark silicon however comes with a severe downside, namely its environmental footprint. While hardware specialization typically reduces the operational footprint through high energy efficiency, the embodied footprint incurred by integrating additional accelerators on chip leads to a net overall increase in environmental footprint, which has led prior work to conclude that dark silicon is not a sustainable design paradigm. We explore sustainable hardware specialization through reconfigurable logic that has the potential to drastically reduce the environmental footprint compared to a sea of accelerators by amortizing its embodied footprint across multiple applications. We present an abstract analytical model that evaluates the sustainability implications of replacing dedicated accelerators with a reconfigurable accelerator. We derive hardware synthesis results on ASIC and CGRA (a representative reconfigurable fabric) for chip area and energy numbers for a wide variety of kernels. We input these results to the analytical model and conclude that reconfigurable fabric is more sustainable. We find that as few as a handful to a dozen accelerators can be replaced by a CGRA. Moreover, replacing a sea of accelerators with a CGRA leads to a drastically reduced environmental footprint (by a factor of 2.5×2.5\\times to 7.6×7.6\\times).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
