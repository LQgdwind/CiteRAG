Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-based Latent Aligner for Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning models tend to forget their earlier knowledge while incrementally learning new tasks. This behavior emerges because the parameter updates optimized for the new tasks may not align well with the updates suitable for older tasks. The resulting latent representation mismatch causes forgetting. In this work, we propose ELI: Energy-based Latent Aligner for Incremental Learning, which first learns an energy manifold for the latent representations such that previous task latents will have low energy and the current task latents have high energy values. This learned manifold is used to counter the representational shift that happens during incremental learning. The implicit regularization that is offered by our proposed methodology can be used as a plug-and-play module in existing incremental learning methodologies. We validate this through extensive evaluation on CIFAR-100, ImageNet subset, ImageNet 1k and Pascal VOC datasets. We observe consistent improvement when ELI is added to three prominent methodologies in class-incremental learning, across multiple incremental settings. Further, when added to the state-of-the-art incremental object detector, ELI provides over 5%percent55\\% improvement in detection accuracy, corroborating its effectiveness and complementary advantage to the existing art. Code is available at: https://github.com/JosephKJ/ELI.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
