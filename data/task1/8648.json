Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unified Model Learning for Various Neural Machine Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing neural machine translation (NMT) studies mainly focus on developing dataset-specific models based on data from different tasks (e.g., document translation and chat translation). Although the dataset-specific models have achieved impressive performance, it is cumbersome as each dataset demands a model to be designed, trained, and stored. In this work, we aim to unify these translation tasks into a more general setting. Specifically, we propose a “versatile” model, i.e., the Unified Model Learning for NMT (UMLNMT) that works with data from different tasks, and can translate well in multiple settings simultaneously, and theoretically it can be as many as possible. Through unified learning, UMLNMT is able to jointly train across multiple tasks, implementing intelligent on-demand translation. On seven widely-used translation tasks, including sentence translation, document translation, and chat translation, our UMLNMT results in substantial improvements over dataset-specific models with significantly reduced model deployment costs. Furthermore, UMLNMT can achieve competitive or better performance than state-of-the-art dataset-specific methods. Human evaluation and in-depth analysis also demonstrate the superiority of our approach on generating diverse and high-quality translations. Additionally, we provide a new genre translation dataset about famous aphorisms with 186k Chinese→→\\rightarrowEnglish sentence pairs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
