Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: SplineGen: a generative model for B-spline approximation of unorganized points\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents a learning-based method to solve the traditional parameterization and knot placement problems in B-spline approximation. Different from conventional heuristic methods or recent AI-based methods, the proposed method does not assume ordered or fixed-size data points as input. There is also no need for manually setting the number of knots. It casts the parameterization and knot placement problems as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem, a generative process automatically determining the number of knots, their placement, parameter values, and their ordering. Once trained, SplineGen demonstrates a notable improvement over existing methods, with a one to two orders of magnitude increase in approximation accuracy on test data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
