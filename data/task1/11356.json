Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Object-Attribute-Relation Representation based Video Semantic Communication\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the rapid growth of multimedia data volume, there is an increasing need for efficient video transmission in applications such as virtual reality and future video streaming services. Semantic communication is emerging as a vital technique for ensuring efficient and reliable transmission in low-bandwidth, high-noise settings. However, most current approaches focus on joint source-channel coding (JSCC) that depends on end-to-end training. These methods often lack an interpretable semantic representation and struggle with adaptability to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce the use of object-attribute-relation (OAR) as a semantic framework for videos to facilitate low bit-rate coding and enhance the JSCC process for more effective video transmission. We utilize OAR sequences for both low bit-rate representation and generative video reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate OAR into the image JSCC model to prioritize communication resources for areas more critical to downstream tasks. Our experiments on traffic surveillance video datasets assess the effectiveness of our approach in terms of video transmission performance. The empirical findings demonstrate that our OAR-based video coding method not only outperforms H.265 coding at lower bit-rates but also synergizes with JSCC to deliver robust and efficient video transmission.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
