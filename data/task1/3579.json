Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Matching Patterns with Variables under Hamming Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A pattern Œ±ùõº\\alpha is a string of variables and terminal letters. We say that Œ±ùõº\\alpha matches a word wùë§w, consisting only of terminal letters, if wùë§w can be obtained by replacing the variables of Œ±ùõº\\alpha by terminal words. The matching problem, i.e., deciding whether a given pattern matches a given word, was heavily investigated: it is NP-complete in general, but can be solved efficiently for classes of patterns with restricted structure. In this paper, we approach this problem in a generalized setting, by considering approximate pattern matching under Hamming distance. More precisely, we are interested in what is the minimum Hamming distance between wùë§w and any word uùë¢u obtained by replacing the variables of Œ±ùõº\\alpha by terminal words. Firstly, we address the class of regular patterns (in which no variable occurs twice) and propose efficient algorithms for this problem, as well as matching conditional lower bounds. We show that the problem can still be solved efficiently if we allow repeated variables, but restrict the way the different variables can be interleaved according to a locality parameter. However, as soon as we allow a variable to occur more than once and its occurrences can be interleaved arbitrarily with those of other variables, even if none of them occurs more than once, the problem becomes intractable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
