Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Non-conflicting no-where zero 𝑍₂×𝑍₂ flows in cubic graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Let Z2×Z2={0,α,β,α+β}subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍20𝛼𝛽𝛼𝛽Z_{2}\\times Z_{2}=\\{0,\\alpha,\\beta,\\alpha+\\beta\\}. If G𝐺G is a bridgeless cubic graph, F𝐹F is a perfect matching of G𝐺G and F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} is the complementary 2-factor of F𝐹F, then a no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2}-flow θ𝜃\\theta of G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} is called non-conflicting with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F}, if F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} contains no edge e=u​v𝑒𝑢𝑣e=uv, such that u𝑢u is incident to an edge with θ𝜃\\theta-value α𝛼\\alpha and v𝑣v is incident to an edge with θ𝜃\\theta-value β𝛽\\beta. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of non-conflicting flows by showing that if a cubic graph G𝐺G admits such a flow with respect to some perfect matching F𝐹F, then G𝐺G admits a normal 6-edge-coloring. We use this observation in order to show that claw-free bridgeless cubic graphs, bridgeless cubic graphs possessing a 2-factor having at most two cycles admit a normal 6-edge-coloring. We demonstrate the usefulness of non-conflicting flows further by relating them to a recent conjecture of Thomassen about edge-disjoint perfect matchings in highly connected regular graphs. In the end of the paper, we construct infinitely many 2-edge-connected cubic graphs such that G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} does not admit a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2}-flow with respect to any perfect matching F𝐹F.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
