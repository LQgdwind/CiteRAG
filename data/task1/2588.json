Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: CSS-LM: A Contrastive Framework for Semi-supervised Fine-tuning of Pre-trained Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated its effectiveness on various downstream NLP tasks recently. However, in many scenarios with limited supervised data, the conventional fine-tuning strategies cannot sufficiently capture the important semantic features for downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework (named “CSS-LM”) to improve the fine-tuning phase of PLMs via contrastive semi-supervised learning. Specifically, given a specific task, we retrieve positive and negative instances from large-scale unlabeled corpora according to their domain-level and class-level semantic relatedness to the task. We then perform contrastive semi-supervised learning on both the retrieved unlabeled instances and original labeled instances to help PLMs capture crucial task-related semantic features. The experimental results show that CSS-LM achieves better results than the conventional fine-tuning strategy on a series of downstream tasks with few-shot settings by up to 7.8%, and outperforms the latest supervised contrastive fine-tuning strategy by up to 7.1%. Our datasets and source code will be available to provide more details.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
