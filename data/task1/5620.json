Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Effective Clustered Federated Learning: A Peer-to-peer Framework with Adaptive Neighbor Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In federated learning (FL), clients may have diverse objectives, and merging all clientsâ€™ knowledge into one global model will cause negative transfer to local performance. Thus, clustered FL is proposed to group similar clients into clusters and maintain several global models. In the literature, centralized clustered FL algorithms require the assumption of the number of clusters and hence are not effective enough to explore the latent relationships among clients. In this paper, without assuming the number of clusters, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) FL algorithm named PANM. In PANM, clients communicate with peers to adaptively form an effective clustered topology. Specifically, we present two novel metrics for measuring client similarity and a two-stage neighbor matching algorithm based Monte Carlo method and Expectation Maximization under the Gaussian Mixture Model assumption. We have conducted theoretical analyses of PANM on the probability of neighbor estimation and the error gap to the clustered optimum. We have also implemented extensive experiments under both synthetic and real-world clustered heterogeneity. Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the P2P FL counterparts, and it achieves better performance than the centralized cluster FL method. PANM is effective even under extremely low communication budgets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
