Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: UOR: Universal Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Backdoors implanted in pre-trained language models (PLMs) can be transferred to various downstream tasks, which exposes a severe security threat. However, most existing backdoor attacks against PLMs are un-targeted and task-specific. Few targeted and task-agnostic methods use manually pre-defined triggers and output representations, which prevent the attacks from being more effective and general. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements that a more threatening backdoor attack against PLMs should satisfy, and then propose a new backdoor attack method called UOR, which breaks the bottleneck of the previous approach by turning manual selection into automatic optimization. Specifically, we define poisoned supervised contrastive learning which can automatically learn the more uniform and universal output representations of triggers for various PLMs. Moreover, we use gradient search to select appropriate trigger words which can be adaptive to different PLMs and vocabularies. Experiments show that our method can achieve better attack performance on various text classification tasks compared to manual methods. Further, we tested our method on PLMs with different architectures, different usage paradigms, and more difficult tasks, which demonstrated the universality of our method. The source code of UOR will be released with the paper if accepted.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
