Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: RTEx: A novel methodology for Ranking, Tagging, and Explanatory diagnostic captioning of radiography exams\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. This paper introduces RTEx, a novel methodology for a) ranking radiography exams based on their probability to contain an abnormality, b) generating abnormality tags for abnormal exams, and c) providing a diagnostic explanation in natural language for each abnormal exam. The task of ranking radiography exams is an important first step for practitioners who want to identify and prioritize those radiography exams that are more likely to contain abnormalities, for example, to avoid mistakes due to tiredness or to manage heavy workload (e.g., during a pandemic). We used two publicly available datasets to assess our methodology and demonstrate that for the task of ranking it outperforms its competitors in terms of n‚Äãd‚Äãc‚Äãg‚Äã@‚Äãkùëõùëëùëêùëî@ùëòndcg@k. For each abnormal radiography exam RTEx generates a set of abnormality tags alongside an explanatory diagnostic text to explain the tags and guide the medical expert. Our tagging component outperforms two strong competitor methods in terms of F‚Äã1ùêπ1F1. Moreover, the diagnostic captioning component of RTEx, which exploits the already extracted tags to constrain the captioning process, outperforms all competitors with respect to clinical precision and recall.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
