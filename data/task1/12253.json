Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: FlameForge: Combustion of Generalized Wooden Structures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a unified volumetric combustion simulator that supports general wooden structures capturing the multi-phase combustion of charring materials. Complex geometric structures can conveniently be represented in a voxel grid for the effective evaluation of volumetric effects. In addition, a signed distance field is introduced to efficiently query the surface information required to compute the insulating effect caused by the char layer. Non-charring materials such as acrylic glass or non-combustible materials such as stone can also be modeled in the simulator. Adaptive data structures are utilized to enable memory-efficient computations within our multiresolution approach. The simulator is qualitatively validated by showcasing the numerical simulation of a variety of scenes covering different kinds of structural configurations and materials. Two-way coupling of our combustion simulator and position-based dynamics is demonstrated capturing characteristic mechanical deformations caused by the combustion process. The volumetric combustion process of wooden structures is further quantitatively assessed by comparing our simulated results to sub-surface measurements of a real-world combustion experiment.
