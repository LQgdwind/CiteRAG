      "content": "Paper Title: Few and Fewer: Learning Better from Few Examples Using Fewer Base Classes This work was performed using HPC resources from GENCI–IDRIS (Grant 202123656B).\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract When training data is scarce, it is common to make use of a feature extractor that has been pre-trained on a large “base” dataset, either by fine-tuning its parameters on the “target” dataset or by directly adopting its representation as features for a simple classifier. Fine-tuning is ineffective for few-shot learning, since the target dataset contains only a handful of examples. However, directly adopting the features without fine-tuning relies on the base and target distributions being similar enough that these features achieve separability and generalization. This paper investigates whether better features for the target dataset can be obtained by training on fewer base classes, seeking to identify a more useful base dataset for a given task. We consider cross-domain few-shot image classification in eight different domains from Meta-Dataset and entertain multiple real-world settings (domain-informed, task-informed and uninformed) where progressively less detail is known about the target task. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that fine-tuning on a subset of carefully selected base classes can significantly improve few-shot learning. Our contributions are simple and intuitive methods that can be implemented in any few-shot solution. We also give insights into the conditions in which these solutions are likely to provide a boost in accuracy. We release the code to reproduce all experiments from this paper on GitHub. https://github.com/RafLaf/Few-and-Fewer.git\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
