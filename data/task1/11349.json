      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Next Era of Multi-objective Optimization: Large Language Models as Architects of Evolutionary Operators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) are prevalent in various real-world applications, necessitating sophisticated solutions that balance conflicting objectives. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while effective, often rely on domain-specific expert knowledge and iterative tuning, which can impede innovation when encountering novel MOPs. Very recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized software engineering by enabling the autonomous development and refinement of programs. Capitalizing on this advancement, we propose a new LLM-based framework for evolving EA operators, designed to address a wide array of MOPs. This framework facilitates the production of EA operators without the extensive demands for expert intervention, thereby streamlining the design process. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we have conducted extensive empirical studies across various categories of MOPs. The results demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of our LLM-evolved operators.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
