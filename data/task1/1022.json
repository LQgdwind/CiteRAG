Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scoring and Assessment in Medical VR Training Simulators with Dynamic Time Series Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This research proposes and evaluates scoring and assessment methods for Virtual Reality (VR) training simulators. VR simulators capture detailed n-dimensional human motion data which is useful for performance analysis. Custom made medical haptic VR training simulators were developed and used to record data from 271 trainees of multiple clinical experience levels. DTW Multivariate Prototyping (DTW-MP) is proposed. VR data was classified as Novice, Intermediate or Expert. Accuracy of algorithms applied for time-series classification were: dynamic time warping 1-nearest neighbor (DTW-1NN) 60%, nearest centroid SoftDTW classification 77.5%, Deep Learning: ResNet 85%, FCN 75%, CNN 72.5% and MCDCNN 28.5%. Expert VR data recordings can be used for guidance of novices. Assessment feedback can help trainees to improve skills and consistency. Motion analysis can identify different techniques used by individuals. Mistakes can be detected dynamically in real-time, raising alarms to prevent injuries.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
