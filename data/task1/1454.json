      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning Techniques for Geospatial Data Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Consumer electronic devices such as mobile handsets, goods tagged with RFID labels, location and position sensors are continuously generating a vast amount of location enriched data called geospatial data. Conventionally such geospatial data is used for military applications. In recent times, many useful civilian applications have been designed and deployed around such geospatial data. For example, a recommendation system to suggest restaurants or places of attraction to a tourist visiting a particular locality. At the same time, civic bodies are harnessing geospatial data generated through remote sensing devices to provide better services to citizens such as traffic monitoring, pothole identification, and weather reporting. Typically such applications are leveraged upon non-hierarchical machine learning techniques such as Naive-Bayes Classifiers, Support Vector Machines, and decision trees. Recent advances in the field of deep-learning showed that Neural Network-based techniques outperform conventional techniques and provide effective solutions for many geospatial data analysis tasks such as object recognition, image classification, and scene understanding. The chapter presents a survey on the current state of the applications of deep learning techniques for analyzing geospatial data. The chapter is organized as below: (i) A brief overview of deep learning algorithms. (ii)Geospatial Analysis: a Data Science Perspective (iii) Deep-learning techniques for Remote Sensing data analytics tasks (iv) Deep-learning techniques for GPS data analytics(iv) Deep-learning techniques for RFID data analytics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
