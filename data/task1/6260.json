      "content": "Paper Title: Euclidean Steiner Spanners: Light and Sparse\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Lightness and sparsity are two natural parameters for Euclidean (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanners. Classical results show that, when the dimension d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N} and ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 are constant, every set S𝑆S of n𝑛n points in d𝑑d-space admits an (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanners with O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) edges and weight proportional to that of the Euclidean MST of S𝑆S. In a recent breakthrough, Le and Solomon (2019) established the precise dependencies on ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, for constant d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N}, of the minimum lightness and sparsity of (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanners, and observed that Steiner points can substantially improve the lightness and sparsity of a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanner. They gave upper bounds of O~​(ε−(d+1)/2)~𝑂superscript𝜀𝑑12\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-(d+1)/2}) for the minimum lightness in dimensions d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3, and O~​(ε−(d−1)/2)~𝑂superscript𝜀𝑑12\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2}) for the minimum sparsity in d𝑑d-space for all d≥1𝑑1d\\geq 1. Subsequently, Le and Solomon (2020) constructed Steiner (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanners of lightness O​(ε−1​log⁡Δ)𝑂superscript𝜀1ΔO(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log\\Delta) in the plane, where Δ∈Ω​(n)ΔΩ𝑛\\Delta\\in\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) is the spread of S𝑆S, defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance between a pair of points. In this work, we improve several bounds on the lightness and sparsity of Euclidean Steiner (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanners. We establish lower bounds of Ω​(ε−d/2)Ωsuperscript𝜀𝑑2\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-d/2}) for the lightness and Ω​(ε−(d−1)/2)Ωsuperscript𝜀𝑑12\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2}) for the sparsity of such spanners in Euclidean d𝑑d-space for all constant d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2. Our lower bound constructions generalize previous constructions by Le and Solomon, but the analysis substantially simplifies previous work, using new geometric insight, focusing on the directions of edges. Next, we show that for every finite set of points in the plane and every ε∈(0,1]𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1], there exists a Euclidean Steiner (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanner of lightness O​(ε−1)𝑂superscript𝜀1O(\\varepsilon^{-1}); this matches the lower bound for d=2𝑑2d=2. We generalize the notion of shallow light trees, which may be of independent interest, and use directional spanners and a modified window partitioning scheme to achieve a tight weight analysis.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
