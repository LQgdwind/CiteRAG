Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Harnessing the Conditioning Sensorium for Improved Image Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multi-modal domain translation typically refers to synthesizing a novel image that inherits certain localized attributes from a ‘content’ image (e.g. layout, semantics, or geometry), and inherits everything else (e.g. texture, lighting, sometimes even semantics) from a ‘style’ image. The dominant approach to this task is attempting to learn disentangled ‘content’ and ‘style’ representations from scratch. However, this is not only challenging, but ill-posed, as what users wish to preserve during translation varies depending on their goals. Motivated by this inherent ambiguity, we define ‘content’ based on conditioning information extracted by off-the-shelf pre-trained models. We then train our style extractor and image decoder with an easy to optimize set of reconstruction objectives. The wide variety of high-quality pre-trained models available and simple training procedure makes our approach straightforward to apply across numerous domains and definitions of ‘content’. Additionally it offers intuitive control over which aspects of ’content’ are preserved across domains. We evaluate our method on traditional, well-aligned, datasets such as CelebA-HQ, and propose two novel datasets for evaluation on more complex scenes: ClassicTV and FFHQ-Wild. Our approach, Sensorium, enables higher quality domain translation for more complex scenes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
