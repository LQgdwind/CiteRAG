Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Linear Bandits with Limited Adaptivity and Learning Distributional Optimal DesignAuthor names are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivated by practical needs such as large-scale learning, we study the impact of adaptivity constraints to linear contextual bandits, a central problem in online learning and decision making. We consider two popular limited adaptivity models in literature: batch learning and rare policy switches. We show that, when the context vectors are adversarially chosen in dùëëd-dimensional linear contextual bandits, the learner needs O‚Äã(d‚Äãlog‚Å°d‚Äãlog‚Å°T)ùëÇùëëùëëùëáO(d\\log d\\log T) policy switches to achieve the minimax-optimal regret, and this is optimal up to poly‚Äã(log‚Å°d,log‚Å°log‚Å°T)polyùëëùëá\\mathrm{poly}(\\log d,\\log\\log T) factors; for stochastic context vectors, even in the more restricted batch learning model, only O‚Äã(log‚Å°log‚Å°T)ùëÇùëáO(\\log\\log T) batches are needed to achieve the optimal regret. Together with the known results in literature, our results present a complete picture about the adaptivity constraints in linear contextual bandits. Along the way, we propose the distributional optimal design, a natural extension of the optimal experiment design, and provide a both statistically and computationally efficient learning algorithm for the problem, which may be of independent interest.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
