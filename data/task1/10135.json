Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Solving multiscale dynamical systems by deep learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multiscale dynamical systems, modeled by high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with wide-ranging characteristic timescales, arise across diverse fields of science and engineering, but their numerical solvers often encounter severe efficiency bottlenecks. This paper introduces a novel DeePODE method, which consists of a global multiscale sampling method and a fitting by deep neural networks to handle multiscale systems. DeePODE’s primary contribution is to address the multiscale challenge of efficiently uncovering representative training sets by combining the Monte Carlo method and the ODE system’s intrinsic evolution without suffering from the “curse of dimensionality”. The DeePODE method is validated in multiscale systems from diverse areas, including a predator-prey model, a power system oscillation, a battery electrolyte auto-ignition, and turbulent flames. Our methods exhibit strong generalization capabilities to unseen conditions, highlighting the power of deep learning in modeling intricate multiscale dynamical processes across science and engineering domains.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
