Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: SeaPlace: Process Variation Aware Placement for Reliable Combinational Circuits against SETs and METs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Nowadays nanoscale combinational circuits are facing significant reliability challenges including soft errors and process variations. This paper presents novel process variation-aware placement strategies that include two algorithms to increase the reliability of combinational circuits against both Single Event Transients (SETs) and Multiple Event Transients (METs). The first proposed algorithm is a global placement method (called SeaPlace-G) that places the cells for hardening the circuit against SETs by solving a quadratic formulation. Afterwards, a detailed placement algorithm (named SeaPlace-D) is proposed to increase the circuit reliability against METs by solving a linear programming optimization problem. Experimental results show that SeaPlace-G and SeaPlace-D averagely achieve 41.78% and 32.04% soft error reliability improvement against SET and MET, respectively. Moreover, when SeaPlace-D is followed by SeaPlace-G, MET reduction can be improved by up to 53.3%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
