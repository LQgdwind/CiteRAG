Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Detecting Ongoing Events Using Contextual Word and Sentence Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper introduces the Ongoing Event Detection (OED) task, which is a specific Event Detection task where the goal is to detect ongoing event mentions only, as opposed to historical, future, hypothetical, or other forms or events that are neither fresh nor current. Any application that needs to extract structured information about ongoing events from unstructured texts can take advantage of an OED system. The main contribution of this paper are the following: (1) it introduces the OED task along with a dataset manually labeled for the task; (2) it presents the design and implementation of an RNN model for the task that uses BERT embeddings to define contextual word and contextual sentence embeddings as attributes, which to the best of our knowledge were never used before for detecting ongoing events in news; (3) it presents an extensive empirical evaluation that includes (i) the exploration of different architectures and hyperparameters, (ii) an ablation test to study the impact of each attribute, and (iii) a comparison with a replication of a state-of-the-art model. The results offer several insights into the importance of contextual embeddings and indicate that the proposed approach is effective in the OED task, outperforming the baseline models.
