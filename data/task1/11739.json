Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-objective Memetic Algorithm with Adaptive Weights for Inverse Antenna Design\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper describes the modification of a single-objective algorithm into its multi-objective counterpart. The outcome is a considerable increase in speed in the order of tens to hundreds and the resulting Pareto front is of higher quality compared to conventional state-of-the-art automated inverse design setups. This advancement is possible thanks to a memetic algorithm combining a gradient-based search for local minima with heuristic optimization to maintain sufficient diversity. The local algorithm is based on rank-1 perturbations; the global algorithm is NSGA-II. An important advancement is the adaptive weighting of objective functions during optimization. The procedure is tested on three challenging examples dealing with both physical and topological metrics and multi-objective settings. The results are compared with standard techniques, and the superb performance of the proposed technique is reported. The implemented algorithm applies to antenna inverse design problems and is an efficient data miner for machine learning tools.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
