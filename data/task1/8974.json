      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph is Worth 1-bit Spikes: When Graph Contrastive Learning Meets Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While contrastive self-supervised learning has become the de-facto learning paradigm for graph neural networks, the pursuit of high task accuracy requires a large hidden dimensionality to learn informative and discriminative full-precision representations, raising concerns about computation, memory footprint, and energy consumption burden (largely overlooked) for real-world applications. This paper explores a promising direction for graph contrastive learning (GCL) with spiking neural networks (SNNs), which leverage sparse and binary characteristics of SNNs to learn more biologically plausible and compact representations. We propose SpikeGCL, a novel GCL framework to learn binarized 1-bit representations for graphs, making balanced trade-offs between efficiency and performance. We provide theoretical guarantees to demonstrate that SpikeGCL has comparable expressiveness with its full-precision counterparts. Experimental results demonstrate that, with nearly 32x representation storage compression, SpikeGCL is either comparable to or outperforms many fancy state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised methods across several graph benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
