Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: ResizeMix: Mixing Data with Preserved Object Information and True Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data augmentation is a powerful technique to increase the diversity of data, which can effectively improve the generalization ability of neural networks in image recognition tasks. Recent data mixing based augmentation strategies have achieved great success. Especially, CutMix uses a simple but effective method to improve the classifiers by randomly cropping a patch from one image and pasting it on another image. To further promote the performance of CutMix, a series of works explore to use the saliency information of the image to guide the mixing. We systematically study the importance of the saliency information for mixing data, and find that the saliency information is not so necessary for promoting the augmentation performance. Furthermore, we find that the cutting based data mixing methods carry two problems of label misallocation and object information missing, which cannot be resolved simultaneously. We propose a more effective but very easily implemented method, namely ResizeMix. We mix the data by directly resizing the source image to a small patch and paste it on another image. The obtained patch preserves more substantial object information compared with conventional cut-based methods. ResizeMix shows evident advantages over CutMix and the saliency-guided methods on both image classification and object detection tasks without additional computation cost, which even outperforms most costly search-based automatic augmentation methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
