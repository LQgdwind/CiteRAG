Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Weakly-supervised Multi-task Learning for Multimodal Affect Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multimodal affect recognition constitutes an important aspect for enhancing interpersonal relationships in human-computer interaction. However, relevant data is hard to come by and notably costly to annotate, which poses a challenging barrier to build robust multimodal affect recognition systems. Models trained on these relatively small datasets tend to overfit and the improvement gained by using complex state-of-the-art models is marginal compared to simple baselines. Meanwhile, there are many different multimodal affect recognition datasets, though each may be small. In this paper, we propose to leverage these datasets using weakly-supervised multi-task learning to improve the generalization performance on each of them. Specifically, we explore three multimodal affect recognition tasks: 1) emotion recognition; 2) sentiment analysis; and 3) sarcasm recognition. Our experimental results show that multi-tasking can benefit all these tasks, achieving an improvement up to 2.9% accuracy and 3.3% F1-score. Furthermore, our method also helps to improve the stability of model performance. In addition, our analysis suggests that weak supervision can provide a comparable contribution to strong supervision if the tasks are highly correlated. ††Preprint.
