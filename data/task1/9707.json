Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: DomainAdaptor: A Novel Approach to Test-time Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To deal with the domain shift between training and test samples, current methods have primarily focused on learning generalizable features during training and ignore the specificity of unseen samples that are also critical during the test. In this paper, we investigate a more challenging task that aims to adapt a trained CNN model to unseen domains during the test. To maximumly mine the information in the test data, we propose a unified method called DomainAdaptor for the test-time adaptation, which consists of an AdaMixBN module and a Generalized Entropy Minimization (GEM) loss. Specifically, AdaMixBN addresses the domain shift by adaptively fusing training and test statistics in the normalization layer via a dynamic mixture coefficient and a statistic transformation operation. To further enhance the adaptation ability of AdaMixBN, we design a GEM loss that extends the Entropy Minimization loss to better exploit the information in the test data. Extensive experiments show that DomainAdaptor consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks. Furthermore, our method brings more remarkable improvement against existing methods on the few-data unseen domain. The code is available at https://github.com/koncle/DomainAdaptor.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
