Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Kernel Relative-prototype Spectral Filtering for Few-shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Few-shot learning performs classification tasks and regression tasks on scarce samples. As one of the most representative few-shot learning models, Prototypical Network represents each class as sample average, or a prototype, and measures the similarity of samples and prototypes by Euclidean distance. In this paper, we propose a framework of spectral filtering (shrinkage) for measuring the difference between query samples and prototypes, or namely the relative prototypes, in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In this framework, we further propose a method utilizing Tikhonov regularization as the filter function for few-shot classification. We conduct several experiments to verify our method utilizing different kernels based on the miniImageNet dataset, tiered-ImageNet dataset and CIFAR-FS dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model can perform the state-of-the-art. In addition, the experimental results show that the proposed shrinkage method can boost the performance.
