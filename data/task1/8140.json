      "content": "Paper Title: Enumeration and Unimodular Equivalence of Empty Delta-Modular Simplices The article was prepared under financial support of Russian Science Foundation grant No 21-11-00194.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Consider a class of simplices defined by systems A‚Äãx‚â§bùê¥ùë•ùëèAx\\leq b of linear inequalities with ŒîŒî\\Delta-modular matrices. A matrix is called ŒîŒî\\Delta-modular, if all its rank-order sub-determinants are bounded by ŒîŒî\\Delta in an absolute value. In our work we call a simplex ŒîŒî\\Delta-modular, if it can be defined by a system A‚Äãx‚â§bùê¥ùë•ùëèAx\\leq b with a ŒîŒî\\Delta-modular matrix Aùê¥A. And we call a simplex empty, if it contains no points with integer coordinates. In literature, a simplex is called lattice-simplex, if all its vertices have integer coordinates. And a lattice-simplex called empty, if it contains no points with integer coordinates excluding its vertices. Recently, assuming that ŒîŒî\\Delta is fixed, it was shown in [37] that the number of ŒîŒî\\Delta-modular empty simplices modulo the unimodular equivalence relation is bounded by a polynomial on dimension. We show that the analogous fact holds for the class of ŒîŒî\\Delta-modular empty lattice-simplices. As the main result, assuming again that the value of the parameter ŒîŒî\\Delta is fixed, we show that all unimodular equivalence classes of simplices of the both types can be enumerated by a polynomial-time algorithm. As the secondary result, we show the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem to check the unimodular equivalence relation for a given pair of ŒîŒî\\Delta-modular, not necessarily empty, simplices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
