Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: EvoSeed: Unveiling the Threat on Deep Neural Networks with Real-World Illusions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Deep neural networks are exploited using natural adversarial samples, which have no impact on human perception but are misclassified. Current approaches often rely on the white-box nature of deep neural networks to generate these adversarial samples or alter the distribution of adversarial samples compared to training distribution. To alleviate the limitations of current approaches, we propose EvoSeed, a novel evolutionary strategy-based search algorithmic framework to generate natural adversarial samples. Our EvoSeed framework uses auxiliary Diffusion and Classifier models to operate in a model-agnostic black-box setting. We employ CMA-ES to optimize the search for an adversarial seed vector, which, when processed by the Conditional Diffusion Model, results in an unrestricted natural adversarial sample misclassified by the Classifier Model. Experiments show that generated adversarial images are of high image quality and are transferable to different classifiers. Our approach demonstrates promise in enhancing the quality of adversarial samples using evolutionary algorithms. We hope our research opens new avenues to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks in real-world scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
