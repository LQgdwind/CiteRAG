Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: ArmanEmo: A Persian Dataset for Text-based Emotion Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the recent proliferation of open textual data on social media platforms, Emotion Detection (ED) from Text has received more attention over the past years. It has many applications, especially for businesses and online service providers, where emotion detection techniques can help them make informed commercial decisions by analyzing customers/users’ feelings towards their products and services. In this study, we introduce ArmanEmo, a human-labeled emotion dataset of more than 7000 Persian sentences labeled for seven categories. The dataset has been collected from different resources, including Twitter, Instagram, and Digikala 111an Iranian e-commerce company. comments. Labels are based on Ekman’s six basic emotions (Anger, Fear, Happiness, Hatred, Sadness, Wonder) and another category (Other) to consider any other emotion not included in Ekman’s model. Along with the dataset, we have provided several baseline models for emotion classification focusing on the state-of-the-art transformer-based language models. Our best model achieves a macro-averaged F1 score of 75.39 percent across our test dataset. Moreover, we also conduct transfer learning experiments to compare our proposed dataset’s generalization against other Persian emotion datasets. Results of these experiments suggest that our dataset has superior generalizability among the existing Persian emotion datasets. ArmanEmo is publicly available for non-commercial use at https://github.com/Arman-Rayan-Sharif/arman-text-emotion.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
