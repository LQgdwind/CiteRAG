Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Lifting uniform learners via distributional decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We show how any PAC learning algorithm that works under the uniform distribution can be transformed, in a blackbox fashion, into one that works under an arbitrary and unknown distribution 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. The efficiency of our transformation scales with the inherent complexity of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, running in poly​(n,(m​d)d)poly𝑛superscript𝑚𝑑𝑑\\mathrm{poly}(n,(md)^{d}) time for distributions over {±1}nsuperscriptplus-or-minus1𝑛\\{\\pm 1\\}^{n} whose pmfs are computed by depth-d𝑑d decision trees, where m𝑚m is the sample complexity of the original algorithm. For monotone distributions our transformation uses only samples from 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, and for general ones it uses subcube conditioning samples. A key technical ingredient is an algorithm which, given the aforementioned access to 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, produces an optimal decision tree decomposition of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}: an approximation of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} as a mixture of uniform distributions over disjoint subcubes. With this decomposition in hand, we run the uniform-distribution learner on each subcube and combine the hypotheses using the decision tree. This algorithmic decomposition lemma also yields new algorithms for learning decision tree distributions with runtimes that exponentially improve on the prior state of the art—results of independent interest in distribution learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
