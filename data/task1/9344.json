Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Integrated FPGA Accelerator for Deep Learning-based 2D/3D Path Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Path planning is a crucial component for realizing the autonomy of mobile robots. However, due to limited computational resources on mobile robots, it remains challenging to deploy state-of-the-art methods and achieve real-time performance. To address this, we propose P3Net (PointNet-based Path Planning Networks), a lightweight deep-learning-based method for 2D/3D path planning, and design an IP core (P3NetCore) targeting FPGA SoCs (Xilinx ZCU104). P3Net improves the algorithm and model architecture of the recently-proposed MPNet. P3Net employs an encoder with a PointNet backbone and a lightweight planning network in order to extract robust point cloud features and sample path points from a promising region. P3NetCore is comprised of the fully-pipelined point cloud encoder, batched bidirectional path planner, and parallel collision checker, to cover most part of the algorithm. On the 2D (3D) datasets, P3Net with the IP core runs 24.54‚Äì149.57x and 6.19‚Äì115.25x (10.03‚Äì59.47x and 3.38‚Äì28.76x) faster than ARM Cortex CPU and Nvidia Jetson while only consuming 0.255W (0.809W), and is up to 1049.42x (133.84x) power-efficient than the workstation. P3Net improves the success rate by up to 28.2% and plans a near-optimal path, leading to a significantly better tradeoff between computation and solution quality than MPNet and the state-of-the-art sampling-based methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
