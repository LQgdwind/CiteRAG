Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: OpenClinicalAI: An Open and Dynamic Model for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Diagnosis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Although Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) cannot be reversed or cured, timely diagnosis can significantly reduce the burden of treatment and care. Current research on AD diagnosis models usually regards the diagnosis task as a typical classification task with two primary assumptions: 1) All target categories are known a priori; 2) The diagnostic strategy for each patient is consistent, that is, the number and type of model input data for each patient are the same. However, real-world clinical settings are open, with complexity and uncertainty in terms of both subjects and the resources of the medical institutions. This means that diagnostic models may encounter unseen disease categories and need to dynamically develop diagnostic strategies based on the subject‚Äôs specific circumstances and available medical resources. Thus, the AD diagnosis task is tangled and coupled with the diagnosis strategy formulation. To promote the application of diagnostic systems in real-world clinical settings, we propose OpenClinicalAI for direct AD diagnosis in complex and uncertain clinical settings. This is the first powerful end-to-end model to dynamically formulate diagnostic strategies and provide diagnostic results based on the subject‚Äôs conditions and available medical resources. OpenClinicalAI combines reciprocally coupled deep multiaction reinforcement learning (DMARL) for diagnostic strategy formulation and multicenter meta-learning (MCML) for open-set recognition. The experimental results show that OpenClinicalAI achieves better performance and fewer clinical examinations than the state-of-the-art model. Our method provides an opportunity to embed the AD diagnostic system into the current health care system to cooperate with clinicians to improve current health care.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
