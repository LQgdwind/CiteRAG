      "content": "Paper Title: Employing Deep Ensemble Learning for Improving the Security of Computer Networks against Adversarial Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated promising performance in various real-world cybersecurity applications, such as network and multimedia security. However, the underlying fragility of CNN structures poses major security problems, making them inappropriate for use in security-oriented applications including such computer networks. Protecting these architectures from adversarial attacks necessitates using security-wise architectures that are challenging to attack. In this study, we present a novel architecture based on an ensemble classifier that combines the enhanced security of 1-Class classification (known as 1C) with the high performance of conventional 2-Class classification (known as 2C) in the absence of attacks.Our architecture is referred to as the 1.5-Class (SPRITZ-1.5C) classifier and constructed using a final dense classifier, one 2C classifier (i.e., CNNs), and two parallel 1C classifiers (i.e., auto-encoders). In our experiments, we evaluated the robustness of our proposed architecture by considering eight possible adversarial attacks in various scenarios. We performed these attacks on the 2C and SPRITZ-1.5C architectures separately. The experimental results of our study showed that the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of the I-FGSM attack against a 2C classifier trained with the N-BaIoT dataset is 0.9900. In contrast, the ASR is 0.0000 for the SPRITZ-1.5C classifier.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
