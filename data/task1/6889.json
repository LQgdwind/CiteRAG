Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Efficacy of Self-Supervised Speech Models as Audio Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, which can serve as powerful upstream models to extract meaningful speech representations, have achieved unprecedented success in speech representation learning. However, their effectiveness on non-speech datasets is relatively less explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework, with a combination of ensemble techniques, to fuse SSL speech models’ embeddings. Extensive experiments on speech and non-speech audio datasets are conducted to investigate the representation abilities of our ensemble method and its single constituent model. Ablation studies are carried out to evaluate the performances of different ensemble techniques, such as feature averaging and concatenation. All experiments are conducted during NeurIPS 2021 HEAR Challenge as a standard evaluation pipeline provided by competition officials. Results demonstrate SSL speech models’ strong abilities on various non-speech tasks, while we also note that they fail to deal with fine-grained music tasks, such as pitch classification and note onset detection. In addition, feature ensemble is shown to have great potential on producing more holistic representations, as our proposed framework generally surpasses state-of-the-art SSL speech/audio models and has superior performance on various datasets compared with other teams in HEAR Challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/tony10101105/HEAR-2021- NeurIPS-Challenge—NTU-GURA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
