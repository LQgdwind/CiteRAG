Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Dense Retrieval for Dialogue Response Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Recent progress in deep learning has continuously improved the accuracy of dialogue response selection. In particular, sophisticated neural network architectures are leveraged to capture the rich interactions between dialogue context and response candidates. While remarkably effective, these models also bring in a steep increase in computational cost. Consequently, such models can only be used as a re-rank module in practice. In this study, we present a solution to directly select proper responses from a large corpus or even a nonparallel corpus that only consists of unpaired sentences, using a dense retrieval model. To push the limits of dense retrieval, we design an interaction layer upon the dense retrieval models and apply a set of tailor-designed learning strategies. Our model shows superiority over strong baselines on the conventional re-rank evaluation setting, which is remarkable given its efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of our approach in realistic scenarios, we also conduct full-rank evaluation, where the target is to select proper responses from a full candidate pool that may contain millions of candidates and evaluate them fairly through human annotations. Our proposed model notably outperforms pipeline baselines that integrate fast recall and expressive re-rank modules. Human evaluation results show that enlarging the candidate pool with nonparallel corpora improves response quality further. 111All our source codes, datasets, model parameters, and other related resources have been publicly available.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
