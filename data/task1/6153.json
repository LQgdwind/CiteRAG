Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling Frequency Thresholds for Quantum Advantage of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We compare the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with state-of-the-art classical solvers Gurobi and MQLib to solve the MaxCut problem on 3-regular graphs. We identify minimum noiseless sampling frequency and depth p𝑝p required for a quantum device to outperform classical algorithms. There is potential for quantum advantage on hundreds of qubits and moderate depth with a sampling frequency of 10kHz. We observe, however, that classical heuristic solvers are capable of producing high-quality approximate solutions in linear time complexity. In order to match this quality for large graph sizes N𝑁N, a quantum device must support depth p>11𝑝11p>11. Additionally, multi-shot QAOA is not efficient on large graphs, indicating that QAOA p≤11𝑝11p\\leq 11 does not scale with N𝑁N. These results limit achieving quantum advantage for QAOA MaxCut on 3-regular graphs. Other problems, such as different graphs, weighted MaxCut, and 3-SAT, may be better suited for achieving quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
