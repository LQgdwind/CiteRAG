      "content": "Paper Title: Computational modeling of the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of horizontal drillstrings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work intends to analyze the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of drillstrings in horizontal configuration. For this purpose, it considers a beam theory, with effects of rotatory inertia and shear deformation, which is capable of reproducing the large displacements that the beam undergoes. The friction and shock effects, due to beam/borehole wall transversal impacts, as well as the force and torque induced by bit-rock interaction, are also considered in the model. Uncertainties of bit-rock interaction model are taken into account using a parametric probabilistic approach. Numerical simulations have shown that the mechanical system of interest has a very rich nonlinear stochastic dynamics, which generate phenomena such as bit-bounce, stick-slip, and transverse impacts. A study aiming to maximize the drilling process efficiency, varying drillstring velocities of translation and rotation is presented. Also, the work presents the definition and solution of two optimizations problems, one deterministic and one robust, where the objective is to maximize drillstring rate of penetration into the soil respecting its structural limits.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 68 most likely reference titles for this paper.
