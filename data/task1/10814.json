      "content": "Paper Title: On Distributed Larger-Than-Memory Subset Selection With Pairwise Submodular Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many learning problems hinge on the fundamental problem of subset selection, i.e., identifying a subset of important and representative points. For example, selecting the most significant samples in ML training cannot only reduce training costs but also enhance model quality. Submodularity, a discrete analogue of convexity, is commonly used for solving subset selection problems. However, existing algorithms for optimizing submodular functions are sequential, and the prior distributed methods require at least one central machine to fit the target subset. In this paper, we relax the requirement of having a central machine for the target subset by proposing a novel distributed bounding algorithm with provable approximation guarantees. The algorithm iteratively bounds the minimum and maximum utility values to select high quality points and discard the unimportant ones. When bounding does not find the complete subset, we use a multi-round, partition-based distributed greedy algorithm to identify the remaining subset. We show that these algorithms find high quality subsets on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with marginal or no loss in quality compared to centralized methods, and scale to a dataset with 13 billion points.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
