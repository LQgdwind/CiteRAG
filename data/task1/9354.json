Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: SDC-HSDD-NDSA: Structure Detecting Cluster by Hierarchical Secondary Directed Differential with Normalized Density and Self-Adaption\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Density-based clustering could be the most popular clustering algorithm since it can identify clusters of arbitrary shape as long as different (high-density) clusters are separated by low-density regions. However, the requirement of the separateness of clusters by low-density regions is not trivial since a high-density region might have different structures which should be clustered into different groups. Such a situation demonstrates the main flaw of all previous density-based clustering algorithms we have knownâ€“structures in a high-density cluster could not be detected. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a density-based clustering scheme that not only has the ability previous ones have but could also detect structures in a high-density region not separated by low-density ones. The algorithm employs secondary directed differential, hierarchy, normalized density, as well as the self-adaption coefficient, and thus is called Structure Detecting Cluster by Hierarchical Secondary Directed Differential with Normalized Density and Self-Adaption, dubbed by SDC-HSDD-NDSA for short. To illustrate its effectiveness, we run the algorithm in several data sets. The results verify its validity in structure detection, robustness over noises, as well as independence of granularities, and demonstrate that it could outperform previous ones. The Python code of the paper could be found on https://github.com/Hao-B-Shu/SDC-HSDD-NDSA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
