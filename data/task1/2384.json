      "content": "Paper Title: Wasserstein barycenters are NP-hard to computeThis work was partially supported by NSF Graduate Research Fellowship 1122374, a Siebel PhD Fellowship, and a TwoSigma PhD fellowship.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computing Wasserstein barycenters (a.k.a. Optimal Transport barycenters) is a fundamental problem in geometry which has recently attracted considerable attention due to many applications in data science. While there exist polynomial-time algorithms in any fixed dimension, all known running times suffer exponentially in the dimension. It is an open question whether this exponential dependence is improvable to a polynomial dependence. This paper proves that unless ùñØ=ùñ≠ùñØùñØùñ≠ùñØ\\mathsf{P}=\\mathsf{NP}, the answer is no. This uncovers a ‚Äúcurse of dimensionality‚Äù for Wasserstein barycenter computation which does not occur for Optimal Transport computation. Moreover, our hardness results for computing Wasserstein barycenters extend to approximate computation, to seemingly simple cases of the problem, and to averaging probability distributions in other Optimal Transport metrics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
