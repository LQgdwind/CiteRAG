      "content": "Paper Title: A Framework to Implement 1+N Multi-task Fine-tuning Pattern in LLMs Using The CGC-LoRA Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the productive evolution of large language models (LLMs) in the field of natural language processing (NLP), tons of effort has been made to effectively fine-tune common pre-trained LLMs to fulfill a variety of tasks in one or multiple specific domain (e.g., code interpreting, data analysis, medicine, and item recommendation). In practice, there are two prevailing ways, in which the adaptation can be achieved: (i) Multiple Independent Models: Pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned a few times independently using the corresponding training samples from each task. (ii) An Integrated Model: Samples from all tasks are employed to fine-tune a pre-trianed LLM unitedly. The first scheme, in most cases, leads to high computing cost since pre-trained LLMs need to undergo fine-tuning process numerous times separately. Although various parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are proposed and they indeed can alleviate the issue in a sense, high computing cost is still prohibitively and unacceptable. More seriously, the knowledge of each task stays isolated and it cannot be shared across different tasks efficiently, which may lead to the sub-optimal overall performance of fine-tuned LLMs. Regarding the second method, although different kinds of loss functions are ingeniously designed, which sufficiently consider especial situations of multi-task learning (MTL), a promotive consequence of one task frequently causes the degradation of other one or ones, called the seesawing issue. To address the high computing cost and seesawing issue simultaneously, we propose a unified framework that implements a 1+N1ùëÅ1+N mutli-task fine-tuning pattern in LLMs using a novel Customized Gate Control (CGC) Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) algorithm. In detail, ‚Äú1\" stands for a central LLM offering common and extensive capabilities in general cases while ‚ÄúNùëÅN\" denotes N sets of CGC-LoRA modules that provides adaptive abilities to behave well on multiple clusters of unseen tasks, respectively. Our work aims to take an advantage of both MTL (i.e., CGC) and PEFT (i.e., LoRA) scheme. For a given cluster of tasks, we design an innovative layer that contains two types of experts as additional trainable parameters to make LoRA be compatible with MTL. In specific, task-common experts intend to capture the message that should be shared across distinct tasks while service objects of task-specific experts are specific tasks. In addition, we also nominate a Task-motivated Gate (TMG) function that determines contributions of each expert to different tasks and this function desires to organize experts in an efficient way. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct well-designed experiments on two public datasets including a wide range of multi-tasks: (i) Prompt Chinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (PromptCBLUE). (ii) Firefly. Both datasets involve over a thousand samples of each sub-task. The experimental results demonstrate that the unified framework with CGC-LoRA modules achieves higher evaluation scores than all benchmarks on both two datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
