      "content": "Paper Title: Posterior Summaries of Grocery Retail Topic Models: Evaluation, Interpretability and Credibility\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Understanding the shopping motivations behind market baskets has significant commercial value for the grocery retail industry. The analysis of shopping transactions demands techniques that can cope with the volume and dimensionality of grocery transactional data while delivering interpretable outcomes. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) provides a natural framework to process grocery transactions and to discover a broad representation of customersâ€™ shopping motivations. However, summarizing the posterior distribution of the LDA model is challenging. LDA is, in essence, a mixture model and thus, even after addressing the label-switching problem, averaging topic distributions across posterior draws may fuse topics that illustrate distinct shopping motivations. On the other hand, individual LDA draws cannot capture the uncertainty around topics, as topics may (dis)appear in different posterior samples. In this paper, we introduce a clustering methodology that post-processes posterior LDA draws to summarise the entire posterior distribution and identify semantic modes represented as recurrent topics. Instead of resolving the label-switching problem by re-labelling components from each posterior draw to minimize an overall loss function, our approach identifies clusters of component parameters across iterations. This allows us to potentially identify multiple modes (termed topical themes) in the posterior distribution, as well as provide associated measures of uncertainty for each cluster. We also establish a more holistic definition for model evaluation, which assesses topic models based not only on their predictive likelihood but also on qualitative aspects such as coherence and distinctiveness of individual topics and credibility of the set of identified topics. Using the outcomes of a tailored survey, we set thresholds that aid the interpretation of the qualitative aspects in the domain of grocery retail data. We demonstrate that the selection of recurrent topics through our clustering methodology not only improves predictive likelihood but also outperforms qualitative aspects such as interpretability and credibility. We illustrate our methods on an example from a large British supermarket chain.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
