      "content": "Paper Title: Random-Order Online Interval Scheduling and Geometric Generalizations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the Maximum Independent Set of Hyperrectangles problem, we are given a set of n𝑛n (possibly overlapping) d𝑑d-dimensional axis-aligned hyperrectangles, and the goal is to find a subset of non-overlapping hyperrectangles of maximum cardinality. For d=1𝑑1d=1, this corresponds to the classical Interval Scheduling problem, where a simple greedy algorithm returns an optimal solution. In the offline setting, for d𝑑d-dimensional hyperrectangles, polynomial time (log⁡n)O​(d)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑑(\\log n)^{O(d)}-approximation algorithms are known [13]. However, the problem becomes notably challenging in the online setting, where the input objects (hyperrectangles) appear one by one in an adversarial order, and on the arrival of an object, the algorithm needs to make an immediate and irrevocable decision whether or not to select the object while maintaining the feasibility. Even for interval scheduling, an Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) lower bound is known on the competitive ratio. To circumvent these negative results, in this work, we study the online maximum independent set of axis-aligned hyperrectangles in the random-order arrival model, where the adversary specifies the set of input objects which then arrive in a uniformly random order. Starting from the prototypical secretary problem, the random-order model has received significant attention to study algorithms beyond the worst-case competitive analysis (see the survey by Gupta and Singla [37]). Surprisingly, we show that the problem in the random-order model almost matches the best-known offline approximation guarantees, up to polylogarithmic factors. In particular, we give a simple (log⁡n)O​(d)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑑(\\log n)^{O(d)}-competitive algorithm for d𝑑d-dimensional hyperrectangles in this model, which runs in Od~​(n)~subscript𝑂𝑑𝑛\\tilde{O_{d}}(n) time. Our approach also yields (log⁡n)O​(d)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑑(\\log n)^{O(d)}-competitive algorithms in the random-order model for more general objects such as d𝑑d-dimensional fat objects and ellipsoids.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
