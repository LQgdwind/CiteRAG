Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Adversarial Bayesian Optimization for Surrogate Objectives\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Offline model-based policy optimization seeks to optimize a learned surrogate objective function without querying the true oracle objective during optimization. However, inaccurate surrogate model predictions are frequently encountered along the optimization trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose generative adversarial Bayesian optimization (GABO) using adaptive source critic regularization, a task-agnostic framework for Bayesian optimization that employs a Lipschitz-bounded source critic model to constrain the optimization trajectory to regions where the surrogate function is reliable. We show that under certain assumptions for the continuous input space prior, our algorithm dynamically adjusts the strength of the source critic regularization. GABO outperforms existing baselines on a number of different offline optimization tasks across a variety of scientific domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/michael-s-yao/gabo.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
