Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Speeding Up Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization by Task Similarity-Based Meta-Learning for the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a vital step in improving performance in deep learning (DL). Practitioners are often faced with the trade-off between multiple criteria, such as accuracy and latency. Given the high computational needs of DL and the growing demand for efficient HPO, the acceleration of multi-objective (MO) optimization becomes ever more important. Despite the significant body of work on meta-learning for HPO, existing methods are inapplicable to MO tree-structured Parzen estimator (MO-TPE), a simple yet powerful MO-HPO algorithm. In this paper, we extend TPE’s acquisition function to the meta-learning setting using a task similarity defined by the overlap of top domains between tasks. We also theoretically analyze and address the limitations of our task similarity. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our method speeds up MO-TPE on tabular HPO benchmarks and attains state-of-the-art performance. Our method was also validated externally by winning the AutoML 2022 competition on “Multiobjective Hyperparameter Optimization for Transformers”.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
