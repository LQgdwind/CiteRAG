Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Storage of Fine-Tuned Models via Low-Rank Approximation of Weight Residuals\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we present an efficient method for storing fine-tuned models by leveraging the low-rank properties of weight residuals. Our key observation is that weight residuals in large overparameterized models exhibit even stronger low-rank characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Efficient Residual Encoding (ERE), a novel approach that achieves efficient storage of fine-tuned model weights by approximating the low-rank weight residuals. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of weight residuals and push the limit of storage efficiency by utilizing additional quantization and layer-wise rank allocation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory footprint while preserving performance in various tasks and modalities. We release our code. 111Our code is available at: https://github.com/cloneofsimo/ere\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
