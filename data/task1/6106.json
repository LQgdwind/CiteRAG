Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: DiVAE : Photorealistic Images Synthesis with Denoising Diffusion Decoder\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently most successful image synthesis models are multi stage process to combine the advantages of different methods, which always includes a VAE-like model for faithfully reconstructing embedding to image and a prior model to generate image embedding. At the same time, diffusion models have shown be capacity to generate high-quality synthetic images. Our work proposes a VQ-VAE architecture model with a diffusion decoder (DiVAE) to work as the reconstructing component in image synthesis. We explore how to input image embedding into diffusion model for excellent performance and find that simple modification on diffusion’s UNet can achieve it. Training on ImageNet 256×256, Our model achieves state-of-the-art results and generates more photorealistic images specifically. In addition, we apply the DiVAE with an Auto-regressive generator on conditional synthesis tasks to perform more human-feeling and detailed samples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
