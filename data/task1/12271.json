Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: STITCH: Surface reconstrucTion using Implicit neural representations with Topology Constraints and persistent Homology\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present STITCH, a novel approach for neural implicit surface reconstruction of a sparse and irregularly spaced point cloud while enforcing topological constraints (such as having a single connected component). We develop a new differentiable framework based on persistent homology to formulate topological loss terms that enforce the prior of a single 2-manifold object. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in preserving the topology of complex 3D geometries, evident through both visual and empirical comparisons. We supplement this with a theoretical analysis, and provably show that optimizing the loss with stochastic (sub)gradient descent leads to convergence and enables reconstructing shapes with a single connected component. Our approach showcases the integration of differentiable topological data analysis tools for implicit surface reconstruction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
