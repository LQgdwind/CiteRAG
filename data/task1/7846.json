      "content": "Paper Title: Real Estate Property Valuation using Self-Supervised Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the real estate market has been growing in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new method for property valuation that utilizes self-supervised vision transformers, a recent breakthrough in computer vision and deep learning. Our proposed algorithm uses a combination of machine learning, computer vision and hedonic pricing models trained on real estate data to estimate the value of a given property. We collected and pre-processed a data set of real estate properties in the city of Boulder, Colorado and used it to train, validate and test our algorithm. Our data set consisted of qualitative images (including house interiors, exteriors, and street views) as well as quantitative features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, lot square footage, property age, crime rates, and proximity to amenities. We evaluated the performance of our model using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our findings indicate that these techniques are able to accurately predict the value of properties, with a low RMSE. The proposed algorithm outperforms traditional appraisal methods that do not leverage property images and has the potential to be used in real-world applications. keywords: housing price prediction model, hedonic model, self-supervised vision transformers, computer vision, deep neural networks, real estate property appraisal, regression analysis, image data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
