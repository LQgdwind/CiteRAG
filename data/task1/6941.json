      "content": "Paper Title: Taming Fat-Tailed (“Heavier-Tailed” with Potentially Infinite Variance) Noise in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important distributed machine learning paradigm to collaboratively learn a global model with multiple clients, while keeping data local and private. However, a key assumption in most existing works on FL algorithms’ convergence analysis is that the noise in stochastic first-order information has a finite variance. Although this assumption covers all light-tailed (i.e., sub-exponential) and some heavy-tailed noise distributions (e.g., log-normal, Weibull, and some Pareto distributions), it fails for many fat-tailed noise distributions (i.e., “heavier-tailed” with potentially infinite variance) that have been empirically observed in the FL literature. To date, it remains unclear whether one can design convergent algorithms for FL systems that experience fat-tailed noise. This motivates us to fill this gap in this paper by proposing an algorithmic framework called 𝖥𝖠𝖳𝖥𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{FAT}-𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀\\mathsf{Clipping}~{}(federated averaging with two-sided learning rates and clipping), which contains two variants: 𝖥𝖠𝖳𝖥𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{FAT}-𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀\\mathsf{Clipping}~{}per-round (𝖥𝖠𝖳𝖥𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{FAT}-𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀\\mathsf{Clipping}-𝖯𝖱𝖯𝖱\\mathsf{PR}) and 𝖥𝖠𝖳𝖥𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{FAT}-𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀\\mathsf{Clipping}~{}per-iteration (𝖥𝖠𝖳𝖥𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{FAT}-𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀\\mathsf{Clipping}-𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖨\\mathsf{PI}). Specifically, for the largest tail-index α∈(1,2]𝛼12\\alpha\\in(1,2] such that the fat-tailed noise in FL still has a bounded α𝛼\\alpha-moment, we show that both variants achieve 𝒪​((m​T)2−αα)𝒪superscript𝑚𝑇2𝛼𝛼\\mathcal{O}((mT)^{\\frac{2-\\alpha}{\\alpha}}) and 𝒪​((m​T)1−α3​α−2)𝒪superscript𝑚𝑇1𝛼3𝛼2\\mathcal{O}((mT)^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{3\\alpha-2}}) convergence rates in the strongly-convex and general non-convex settings, respectively, where m𝑚m and T𝑇T are the numbers of clients and communication rounds. Moreover, with more clipping operations compared to 𝖥𝖠𝖳𝖥𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{FAT}-𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀\\mathsf{Clipping}-𝖯𝖱𝖯𝖱\\mathsf{PR}, 𝖥𝖠𝖳𝖥𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{FAT}-𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀𝖢𝗅𝗂𝗉𝗉𝗂𝗇𝗀\\mathsf{Clipping}-𝖯𝖨𝖯𝖨\\mathsf{PI}~{}further enjoys a linear speedup effect with respect to the number of local updates at each client and being lower-bound-matching (i.e., order-optimal). Collectively, our results advance the understanding of designing efficient algorithms for FL systems that exhibit fat-tailed first-order oracle information.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
