Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 64 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Weighted Automata and Logics Meet Computational Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Complexity classes such as #​𝐏#𝐏\\#\\mathbf{P}, ⊕𝐏direct-sum𝐏\\oplus\\mathbf{P}, 𝐆𝐚𝐩𝐏𝐆𝐚𝐩𝐏\\mathbf{GapP}, 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐏𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐏\\mathbf{OptP}, 𝐍𝐏𝐌𝐕𝐍𝐏𝐌𝐕\\mathbf{NPMV}, or the class of fuzzy languages realised by polynomial-time fuzzy nondeterministic Turing machines, can all be described in terms of a class 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S] for a suitable semiring S𝑆S, defined via weighted Turing machines over S𝑆S similarly as 𝐍𝐏𝐍𝐏\\mathbf{NP} is defined via the classical nondeterministic Turing machines. Other complexity classes of decision problems can be lifted to the quantitative world using the same recipe as well, and the resulting classes relate to the original ones in the same way as weighted automata or logics relate to their unweighted counterparts. The article surveys these too-little-known connexions between weighted automata theory and computational complexity theory implicit in the existing literature, suggests a systematic approach to the study of weighted complexity classes, and presents several new observations strengthening the relation between both fields. In particular, it is proved that a natural extension of the Boolean satisfiability problem to weighted propositional logic is complete for the class 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S] when S𝑆S is a finitely generated semiring. Moreover, a class of semiring-valued functions 𝐅𝐏​[S]𝐅𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{FP}[S] is introduced for each semiring S𝑆S as a counterpart to the class 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P}, and the relations between 𝐅𝐏​[S]𝐅𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{FP}[S] and 𝐍𝐏​[S]𝐍𝐏delimited-[]𝑆\\mathbf{NP}[S] are considered.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 64 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
