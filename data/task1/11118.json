      "content": "Paper Title: Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only on the other part. This suggests a canonical local tester for entanglement spectra (i.e., Schmidt coefficients), and reveals that purified samples offer no advantage in property testing of mixed states. As applications, we show new sample lower bounds, for example: • The first general lower bound Ω​(r/ε2)Ω𝑟superscript𝜀2\\Omega(r/\\varepsilon^{2}) for testing whether the Schmidt rank of a bipartite state is at most r𝑟r or ε𝜀\\varepsilon-far, settling an open question raised in the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf (ToC 2016). • A lower bound Ω​((n+r)⋅r/ε2)Ω⋅𝑛𝑟𝑟superscript𝜀2\\Omega((\\sqrt{n}+\\sqrt{r})\\cdot\\sqrt{r}/\\varepsilon^{2}) for testing whether an n𝑛n-partite state is a matrix product state of bond dimension r𝑟r or ε𝜀\\varepsilon-far, improving the prior lower bound Ω​(n/ε2)Ω𝑛superscript𝜀2\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}/\\varepsilon^{2}) by Soleimanifar and Wright (SODA 2022) and Ω​(r)Ω𝑟\\Omega(\\sqrt{r}) by Aaronson et al. (ITCS 2024). Furthermore, when perfect completeness is required, we provide a matching lower bound Ω​(r2/ε2)Ωsuperscript𝑟2superscript𝜀2\\Omega(r^{2}/\\varepsilon^{2}) with respect to r𝑟r and ε𝜀\\varepsilon. • A matching lower bound Ω​(d/ε2)Ω𝑑superscript𝜀2\\Omega(d/\\varepsilon^{2}) for testing whether a d𝑑d-dimensional bipartite state is maximally entangled or ε𝜀\\varepsilon-far, showing that the algorithm of O’Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015) is optimal for this task. Beyond sample complexity, we also contribute new quantum query lower bounds: • A query lower bound Ω~​(d/Δ)~Ω𝑑Δ\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{d/\\Delta}) for the d𝑑d-dimensional entanglement entropy problem with gap ΔΔ\\Delta,444Ω~​(⋅)~Ω⋅\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\lparen\\cdot\\rparen suppreses polylogarithmic factors. improving the prior best Ω​(d4)Ω4𝑑\\Omega\\lparen\\sqrt[4]{d}\\rparen by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023) and Ω~​(1/Δ)~Ω1Δ\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\lparen 1/\\sqrt{\\Delta}\\rparen by Wang and Zhang (2023) and Weggemans (2024). Furthermore, our central result can be extended when the tested state is mixed: one-way LOCC is sufficient to realize the optimal tester.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
