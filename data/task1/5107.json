Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Automated Dissipation Control for Turbulence Simulation with Shell Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The application of machine learning (ML) techniques, especially neural networks, has seen tremendous success at processing images and language. This is because we often lack formal models to understand visual and audio input, so here neural networks can unfold their abilities as they can model solely from data. In the field of physics we typically have models that describe natural processes reasonably well on a formal level. Nonetheless, in recent years, ML has also proven useful in these realms, be it by speeding up numerical simulations or by improving accuracy. One important and so far unsolved problem in classical physics is understanding turbulent fluid motion. In this work we construct a strongly simplified representation of turbulence by using the Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model. With this system we intend to investigate the potential of ML-supported and physics-constrained small-scale turbulence modelling. Instead of standard supervised learning we propose an approach that aims to reconstruct statistical properties of turbulence such as the self-similar inertial-range scaling, where we could achieve encouraging experimental results. Furthermore we discuss pitfalls when combining machine learning with differential equations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
