Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Role of Urban Form in the Performance of Shared Automated Vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The technology of Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs) has advanced significantly in recent years. However, existing SAV studies primarily focus on the system design while limited studies have examined the impacts of exogenous variables, especially urban form, on SAV performance. Therefore, it remains unclear what key urban form measurements may influence SAV system’s sustainability. This study fills the research gap by conducting simulation experiments using data collected from 286 cities. This study identifies critical urban form measurements correlated with the simulated SAV performance using fixed effects regression models. The results suggest that SAVs are more efficient and generate less VMT in denser cities with more connected networks and diversified land use development patterns. The model results can help provide insights on land use and transportation policies to curb the adverse effects of SAVs in the future and generalize existing SAV simulation results to the rest of U.S. cities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
