Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Empirical Error Modeling Improves Robustness of Noisy Neural Sequence Labeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite recent advances, standard sequence labeling systems often fail when processing noisy user-generated text or consuming the output of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. In this paper, we improve the noise-aware training method by proposing an empirical error generation approach that employs a sequence-to-sequence model trained to perform translation from error-free to erroneous text. Using an OCR engine, we generated a large parallel text corpus for training and produced several real-world noisy sequence labeling benchmarks for evaluation. Moreover, to overcome the data sparsity problem that exacerbates in the case of imperfect textual input, we learned noisy language model-based embeddings. Our approach outperformed the baseline noise generation and error correction techniques on the erroneous sequence labeling data sets. To facilitate future research on robustness, we make our code, embeddings, and data conversion scripts publicly available.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
