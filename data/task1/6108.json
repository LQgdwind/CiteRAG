Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Benign Overfitting in Classification: Provably Counter Label Noise with Larger Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Studies on benign overfitting provide insights for the success of overparameterized deep learning models. In this work, we examine whether overfitting is truly benign in real-world classification tasks. We start with the observation that a ResNet model overfits benignly on Cifar10 but not benignly on ImageNet. To understand why benign overfitting fails in the ImageNet experiment, we theoretically analyze benign overfitting under a more restrictive setup where the number of parameters is not significantly larger than the number of data points. Under this mild overparameterization setup, our analysis identifies a phase change: unlike in the previous heavy overparameterization settings, benign overfitting can now fail in the presence of label noise. Our analysis explains our empirical observations, and is validated by a set of control experiments with ResNets. Our work highlights the importance of understanding implicit bias in underfitting regimes as a future direction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
