      "content": "Paper Title: Overlap-aware End-to-End Supervised Hierarchical Graph Clustering for Speaker Diarization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Speaker diarization, the task of segmenting an audio recording based on speaker identity, constitutes an important speech pre-processing step for several downstream applications. The conventional approach to diarization involves multiple steps of embedding extraction and clustering, which are often optimized in an isolated fashion. While end-to-end diarization systems attempt to learn a single model for the task, they are often cumbersome to train and require large supervised datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm based on graph neural networks (GNN), called End-to-end Supervised HierARchical Clustering (E-SHARC). The E-SHARC approach uses front-end mel-filterbank features as input and jointly learns an embedding extractor and the GNN clustering module, performing representation learning, metric learning, and clustering with end-to-end optimization. Further, with additional inputs from an external overlap detector, the E-SHARC approach is capable of predicting the speakers in the overlapping speech regions. The experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets like AMI, VoxConverse and DISPLACE, illustrates that the proposed E-SHARC framework improves significantly over the state-of-art diarization systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
