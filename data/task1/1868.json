Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: One Model to Reconstruct Them All: A Novel Way to Use the Stochastic Noise in StyleGAN\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generative Adversarial Networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance for several image generation and manipulation tasks. Different works have improved the limited understanding of the latent space of GANs by embedding images into specific GAN architectures to reconstruct the original images. We present a novel StyleGAN-based autoencoder architecture, which can reconstruct images with very high quality across several data domains. We demonstrate a previously unknown grade of generalizablility by training the encoder and decoder independently and on different datasets. Furthermore, we provide new insights about the significance and capabilities of noise inputs of the well-known StyleGAN architecture. Our proposed architecture can handle up to 40 images per second on a single GPU, which is approximately 28Ã—\\times faster than previous approaches. Finally, our model also shows promising results, when compared to the state-of-the-art on the image denoising task, although it was not explicitly designed for this task.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
