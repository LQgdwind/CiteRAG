Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Inference for decorated graphs and application to multiplex networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A graphon is a limiting object used to describe the behaviour of large networks through a function that captures the probability of edge formation between nodes. Although the merits of graphons to describe large and unlabelled networks are clear, they traditionally are used for describing only binary edge information, which limits their utility for more complex relational data. Decorated graphons were introduced to extend the graphon framework by incorporating richer relationships, such as edge weights and types. This specificity in modelling connections provides more granular insight into network dynamics. Yet, there are no existing inference techniques for decorated graphons. We develop such an estimation method, extending existing techniques from traditional graphon estimation to accommodate these richer interactions. We derive the rate of convergence for our method and show that it is consistent with traditional non-parametric theory when the decoration space is finite. Simulations confirm that these theoretical rates are achieved in practice. Our method, tested on synthetic and empirical data, effectively captures additional edge information, resulting in improved network models. This advancement extends the scope of graphon estimation to encompass more complex networks, such as multiplex networks and attributed graphs, thereby increasing our understanding of their underlying structures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
