Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Fully First-Order Method for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider stochastic unconstrained bilevel optimization problems when only the first-order gradient oracles are available. While numerous optimization methods have been proposed for tackling bilevel problems, existing methods either tend to require possibly expensive calculations involving Hessians of lower-level objectives, or lack rigorous finite-time performance guarantees. In this work, we propose a Fully First-order Stochastic Approximation (F2SA) method, and study its non-asymptotic convergence properties. Specifically, we show that F2SA converges to an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-stationary solution of the bilevel problem after œµ‚àí7/2,œµ‚àí5/2superscriptitalic-œµ72superscriptitalic-œµ52\\epsilon^{-7/2},\\epsilon^{-5/2}, or œµ‚àí3/2superscriptitalic-œµ32\\epsilon^{-3/2} iterations (each iteration using O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) samples) when stochastic noises are in both level objectives, only in the upper-level objective, or not present (deterministic settings), respectively. We further show that if we employ momentum-assisted gradient estimators, the iteration complexities can be improved to œµ‚àí5/2,œµ‚àí4/2superscriptitalic-œµ52superscriptitalic-œµ42\\epsilon^{-5/2},\\epsilon^{-4/2}, or œµ‚àí3/2superscriptitalic-œµ32\\epsilon^{-3/2}, respectively. We demonstrate the superior practical performance of the proposed method over existing second-order based approaches on MNIST data-hypercleaning experiments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
