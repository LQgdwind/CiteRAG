Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Bandwidth Parameterized by Cluster Vertex Deletion Number\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given a graph Gùê∫G and an integer bùëèb, Bandwidth asks whether there exists a bijection œÄùúã\\pi from V‚Äã(G)ùëâùê∫V(G) to {1,‚Ä¶,|V‚Äã(G)|}1‚Ä¶ùëâùê∫\\{1,\\ldots,|V(G)|\\} such that max{u,v}‚ààE‚Äã(G)‚Å°|œÄ‚Äã(u)‚àíœÄ‚Äã(v)|‚â§bsubscriptùë¢ùë£ùê∏ùê∫ùúãùë¢ùúãùë£ùëè\\max_{\\{u,v\\}\\in E(G)}|\\pi(u)-\\pi(v)|\\leq b. This is a classical NP-complete problem, known to remain NP-complete even on very restricted classes of graphs, such as trees of maximum degree 3 and caterpillars of hair length 3. In the realm of parameterized complexity, these results imply that the problem remains NP-hard on graphs of bounded pathwidth, while it is additionally known to be W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treedepth of the input graph. In contrast, the problem does become FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number of the input graph. In this paper, we make progress towards the parameterized (in)tractability of Bandwidth. We first show that it is FPT when parameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number cvd plus the clique number œâùúî\\omega of the input graph, thus generalizing the previously mentioned result for vertex cover. On the other hand, we show that Bandwidth is W[1]-hard when parameterized only by cvd. Our results generalize some of the previous results and narrow some of the complexity gaps.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
