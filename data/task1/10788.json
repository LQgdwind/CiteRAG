Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Linear Dynamics-embedded Neural Network for Long-Sequence Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The trade-off between performance and computational efficiency in long-sequence modeling becomes a bottleneck for existing models. Inspired by the continuous state space models (SSMs) with multi-input and multi-output in control theory, we propose a new neural network called Linear Dynamics-embedded Neural Network (LDNN). SSMs‚Äô continuous, discrete, and convolutional properties enable LDNN to have few parameters, flexible inference, and efficient training in long-sequence tasks. Two efficient strategies, diagonalization and Disentanglement then Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)‚Ä≤‚Ä≤superscriptsuperscriptDisentanglement then Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)‚Ä≤‚Ä≤{}^{\\prime}\\text{Disentanglement then Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)}^{\\prime}, are developed to reduce the time complexity of convolution from O‚Äã(L‚ÄãN‚ÄãH‚Äãmax‚Å°{L,N})ùëÇùêøùëÅùêªùêøùëÅO(LNH\\max\\{L,N\\}) to O‚Äã(L‚ÄãN‚Äãmax‚Å°{H,log‚Å°L})ùëÇùêøùëÅùêªùêøO(LN\\max\\{H,\\log L\\}). We further improve LDNN through bidirectional noncausal and multi-head settings to accommodate a broader range of applications. Extensive experiments on the Long Range Arena (LRA) demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of LDNN.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
