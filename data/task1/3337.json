      "content": "Paper Title: Degrees and Gaps: Tight Complexity Results of General Factor Problems Parameterized by Treewidth and Cutwidth\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the General Factor problem, we are given an undirected graph Gùê∫G and for each vertex v‚ààV‚Äã(G)ùë£ùëâùê∫v\\in V(G) a finite set Bvsubscriptùêµùë£B_{v} of non-negative integers. The task is to decide if there is a subset S‚äÜE‚Äã(G)ùëÜùê∏ùê∫S\\subseteq E(G) such that degS‚Å°(v)‚ààBvsubscriptdegreeùëÜùë£subscriptùêµùë£\\deg_{S}(v)\\in B_{v} for all vertices vùë£v of Gùê∫G. Define the max‚àígapmaxgap\\operatorname{max-gap} of a finite integer set BùêµB to be the largest d‚â•0ùëë0d\\geq 0 such that there is an a‚â•0ùëé0a\\geq 0 with [a,a+d+1]‚à©B={a,a+d+1}ùëéùëéùëë1ùêµùëéùëéùëë1[a,a+d+1]\\cap B=\\{a,a+d+1\\}. Cornu√©jols showed in 1988 that if the max‚àígapmaxgap\\operatorname{max-gap} of all sets Bvsubscriptùêµùë£B_{v} is at most 1, then the decision version of General Factor is polynomial-time solvable. This result was extended 2018 by Dudycz and Paluch for the optimization (i.e. minimization and maximization) versions. We present a general algorithm counting the number of solutions of a certain size in time (M+1)tw‚Äãnùí™‚Äã(1)superscriptùëÄ1twsuperscriptùëõùí™1(M+1)^{\\operatorname{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, given a tree decomposition of width twtw{\\operatorname{tw}}, where MùëÄM is the maximum integer over all Bvsubscriptùêµùë£B_{v}. By using convolution techniques from van Rooij (2020), we improve upon the previous (M+1)3‚Äãtw‚Äãnùí™‚Äã(1)superscriptùëÄ13twsuperscriptùëõùí™1(M+1)^{3{\\operatorname{tw}}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} time algorithm by Arulselvan et al. from 2018. We prove that this algorithm is essentially optimal for all cases that are not trivial or polynomial time solvable for the decision, minimization or maximization versions. Our lower bounds show that such an improvement is not even possible for BùêµB-Factor, which is General Factor on graphs where all sets Bvsubscriptùêµùë£B_{v} agree with the fixed set BùêµB. We show that for every fixed BùêµB where the problem is NP-hard, our (max‚Å°B+1)tw‚Äãnùí™‚Äã(1)superscriptùêµ1twsuperscriptùëõùí™1(\\max B+1)^{{\\operatorname{tw}}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} algorithm cannot be significantly improved: assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), no algorithm can solve BùêµB-Factor in time (max‚Å°B+1‚àíœµ)tw‚Äãnùí™‚Äã(1)superscriptùêµ1italic-œµtwsuperscriptùëõùí™1(\\max B+1-\\epsilon)^{\\operatorname{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} for any œµ>0italic-œµ0\\epsilon>0. We extend this bound to the counting version of BùêµB-Factor for arbitrary, non-trivial sets BùêµB, assuming #SETH. We also investigate the parameterization of the problem by cutwidth. Unlike for treewidth, having a larger set BùêµB does not appear to make the problem harder: we give a 2cutw‚Äãnùí™‚Äã(1)superscript2cutwsuperscriptùëõùí™12^{\\operatorname{cutw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} algorithm for any BùêµB and provide a matching lower bound that this is optimal for the NP-hard cases.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
