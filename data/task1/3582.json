This research/project is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore under its AI Singapore Programme (AISG Award No: AISG-PhD/2021-08-013).\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problem of sparse tensor principal component analysis: given a tensor 𝒀=𝑾+λ​x⊗p𝒀𝑾𝜆superscript𝑥tensor-productabsent𝑝\\boldsymbol{Y}=\\boldsymbol{W}+\\lambda x^{\\otimes p} with 𝑾∈⊗pℝn\\boldsymbol{W}\\in\\otimes^{p}\\mathbb{R}^{n} having i.i.d. Gaussian entries, the goal is to recover the k𝑘k-sparse unit vector x∈ℝn𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}. The model captures both sparse PCA (in its Wigner form) and tensor PCA. For the highly sparse regime of k≤n𝑘𝑛k\\leq\\sqrt{n}, we present a family of algorithms that smoothly interpolates between a simple polynomial-time algorithm and the exponential-time exhaustive search algorithm. For any 1≤t≤k1𝑡𝑘1\\leq t\\leq k, our algorithms recovers the sparse vector for signal-to-noise ratio λ≥𝒪~​(t⋅(k/t)p/2)𝜆~𝒪⋅𝑡superscript𝑘𝑡𝑝2\\lambda\\geq\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{t}\\cdot(k/t)^{p/2}) in time 𝒪~​(np+t)~𝒪superscript𝑛𝑝𝑡\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{p+t}), capturing the state-of-the-art guarantees for the matrix settings (in both the polynomial-time and sub-exponential time regimes). Our results naturally extend to the case of r𝑟r distinct k𝑘k-sparse signals with disjoint supports, with guarantees that are independent of the number of spikes. Even in the restricted case of sparse PCA, known algorithms only recover the sparse vectors for λ≥𝒪~​(k⋅r)𝜆~𝒪⋅𝑘𝑟\\lambda\\geq\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k\\cdot r) while our algorithms require λ≥𝒪~​(k)𝜆~𝒪𝑘\\lambda\\geq\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k). Finally, by analyzing the low-degree likelihood ratio, we complement these algorithmic results with rigorous evidence illustrating the trade-offs between signal-to-noise ratio and running time. This lower bound captures the known lower bounds for both sparse PCA and tensor PCA. In this general model, we observe a more intricate three-way trade-off between the number of samples n𝑛n, the sparsity k𝑘k, and the tensor power p𝑝p.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
