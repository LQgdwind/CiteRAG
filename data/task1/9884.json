      "content": "Paper Title: Mira: Cracking Black-box Watermarking on Deep Neural Networks via Model Inversion-based Removal Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To protect the intellectual property of well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), black-box DNN watermarks, which are embedded into the prediction behavior of DNN models on a set of specially-crafted samples, have gained increasing popularity in both academy and industry. Watermark robustness is usually implemented against attackers who steal the protected model and obfuscate its parameters for watermark removal. Recent studies empirically prove the robustness of most black-box watermarking schemes against known removal attempts. In this paper, we propose a novel Model Inversion-based Removal Attack (Mira), which is watermark-agnostic and effective against most of mainstream black-box DNN watermarking schemes. In general, our attack pipeline exploits the internals of the protected model to recover and unlearn the watermark message. We further design target class detection and recovered sample splitting algorithms to reduce the utility loss caused by Mira and achieve data-free watermark removal on half of the watermarking schemes. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of Mira against ten mainstream black-box watermarks on three benchmark datasets and DNN architectures. Compared with six baseline removal attacks, Mira achieves strong watermark removal effects on the covered watermarks, preserving at least 90%percent9090\\% of the stolen model utility, under more relaxed or even no assumptions on the dataset availability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
