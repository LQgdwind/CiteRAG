Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: HCGR: Hyperbolic Contrastive Graph Representation Learning for Session-based Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Session-based recommendation (SBR) learns users‚Äô preferences by capturing the short-term and sequential patterns from the evolution of user behaviors. Among the studies in the SBR field, graph-based approaches are a relatively powerful kind of way, which generally extract item information by message aggregation under Euclidean space. However, such methods can‚Äôt effectively extract the hierarchical information contained among consecutive items in a session, which is critical to represent users‚Äô preferences. In this paper, we present a hyperbolic contrastive graph recommender (HCGR), a principled session-based recommendation framework involving Lorentz hyperbolic space to adequately capture the coherence and hierarchical representations of the items. Within this framework, we design a novel adaptive hyperbolic attention computation to aggregate the graph message of each user‚Äôs preference in a session-based behavior sequence. In addition, contrastive learning is leveraged to optimize the item representation by considering the geodesic distance between positive and negative samples in hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HCGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 0.43%percent\\%-28.84%percent\\% in terms of H‚Äãi‚Äãt‚ÄãR‚Äãa‚Äãt‚Äãeùêªùëñùë°ùëÖùëéùë°ùëíHitRate, N‚ÄãD‚ÄãC‚ÄãGùëÅùê∑ùê∂ùê∫NDCG and M‚ÄãR‚ÄãRùëÄùëÖùëÖMRR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
