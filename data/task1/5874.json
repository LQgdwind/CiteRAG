Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Capacity Variation in the Many-to-one Stable Matching To Gerhard Woeginger (1964-2022), an outstanding computer scientist\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The many-to-one stable matching problem provides the fundamental abstraction of several real-world matching markets such as school choice and hospital-resident allocation. The agents on both sides are often referred to as residents and hospitals. The classical setup assumes that the agents rank the opposite side and that the capacities of the hospitals are fixed. It is known that increasing the capacity of a single hospital improves the residents’ final allocation. On the other hand, reducing the capacity of a single hospital deteriorates the residents’ allocation. In this work, we study the computational complexity of finding the optimal variation of hospitals’ capacities that leads to the best outcome for the residents, subject to stability and a capacity variation constraint. First, we show that the decision problem of finding the optimal capacity expansion is NP-complete and the corresponding optimization problem is inapproximable within a certain factor. This result holds under strict and complete preferences, and even if we allocate extra capacities to disjoint sets of hospitals. Second, we obtain analogous computational complexity results for the problem of capacity reduction. Finally, we study the variants of these problems when the goal is to maximize the size of the final matching under incomplete preference lists.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
