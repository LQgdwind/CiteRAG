Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task learning for natural language processing in the 2020s: where are we going?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multi-task learning (MTL) significantly pre-dates the deep learning era, and it has seen a resurgence in the past few years as researchers have been applying MTL to deep learning solutions for natural language tasks. While steady MTL research has always been present, there is a growing interest driven by the impressive successes published in the related fields of transfer learning and pre-training, such as BERT, and the release of new challenge problems, such as GLUE and the NLP Decathlon (decaNLP). These efforts place more focus on how weights are shared across networks, evaluate the re-usability of network components and identify use cases where MTL can significantly outperform single-task solutions. This paper strives to provide a comprehensive survey of the numerous recent MTL contributions to the field of natural language processing and provide a forum to focus efforts on the hardest unsolved problems in the next decade. While novel models that improve performance on NLP benchmarks are continually produced, lasting MTL challenges remain unsolved which could hold the key to better language understanding, knowledge discovery and natural language interfaces.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
