Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for ùêÇùêÄùêì‚Å¢(ùúø) Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact shapes X‚äÇ‚ÑùNùëãsuperscript‚ÑùùëÅX\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{N} that are CAT‚Äã(Œ∫)CATùúÖ\\mathrm{CAT}(\\kappa) in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris‚ÄìRips complexes computed from a compact sample SùëÜS, Hausdorff‚Äìclose to the unknown shape XùëãX. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact CAT‚Äã(Œ∫)CATùúÖ\\mathrm{CAT}(\\kappa) spaces. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and Œºùúá\\mu‚Äìreach. In particular, we introduce a new parameter, called the restricted distortion, which is a generalization of the well-known global distortion of embedding. We show examples of Euclidean subspaces, for which the known parameters such as the reach, Œºùúá\\mu‚Äìreach and weak features size vanish, whereas the restricted distortion is finite, making our reconstruction results applicable for such spaces.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
