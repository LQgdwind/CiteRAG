Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 64 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the stability of solutions to random optimization problems under small perturbations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Consider the Euclidean traveling salesman problem with nùëõn random points on the plane. Suppose that one of the points is shifted to a new random location. This gives us a new optimal path. Consider such shifts for each of the nùëõn points. Do we get nùëõn very different optimal paths? In this article, we show that this is not the case ‚Äî in fact, the number of truly different paths can be at most \\bigO‚Äã(1)\\bigO1\\bigO(1) as n‚Üí‚àû‚Üíùëõn\\to\\infty. The proof is based on a general argument which allows us to prove similar stability results in a number of other settings, such as branching random walk, the Sherrington‚ÄìKirkpatrick model of mean-field spin glasses, the Edwards‚ÄìAnderson model of short-range spin glasses, and the Wigner ensemble of random matrices.
