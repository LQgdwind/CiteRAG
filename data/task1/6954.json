Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Active Learning for Regression with Aggregated Outputs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Due to the privacy protection or the difficulty of data collection, we cannot observe individual outputs for each instance, but we can observe aggregated outputs that are summed over multiple instances in a set in some real-world applications. To reduce the labeling cost for training regression models for such aggregated data, we propose an active learning method that sequentially selects sets to be labeled to improve the predictive performance with fewer labeled sets. For the selection measurement, the proposed method uses the mutual information, which quantifies the reduction of the uncertainty of the model parameters by observing the aggregated output. With Bayesian linear basis functions for modeling outputs given an input, which include approximated Gaussian processes and neural networks, we can efficiently calculate the mutual information in a closed form. With the experiments using various datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better predictive performance with fewer labeled sets than existing methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
