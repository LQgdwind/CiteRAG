Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A deep learning guided memetic framework for graph coloring problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given an undirected graph G=(V,E)ùê∫ùëâùê∏G=(V,E) with a set of vertices VùëâV and a set of edges Eùê∏E, a graph coloring problem involves finding a partition of the vertices into different independent sets. In this paper we present a new framework that combines a deep neural network with the best tools of classical heuristics for graph coloring. The proposed method is evaluated on two popular graph coloring problems (vertex coloring and weighted coloring). Computational experiments on well-known benchmark graphs show that the proposed approach is able to obtain highly competitive results for both problems. A study of the contribution of deep learning in the method highlights that it is possible to learn relevant patterns useful to obtain better solutions to graph coloring problems. Keywords: Population-based search; GPU-based parallel search; deep learning; heuristics; graph coloring.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
