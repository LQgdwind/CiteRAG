      "content": "Paper Title: Motion-based Camera Localization System in Colonoscopy Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Optical colonoscopy is an essential diagnostic and prognostic tool for many gastrointestinal diseases, including cancer screening and staging, intestinal bleeding, diarrhea, abdominal symptom evaluation, and inflammatory bowel disease assessment. However, the evaluation, classification, and quantification of findings from colonoscopy are subject to inter-observer variation. Automated assessment of colonoscopy is of interest considering the subjectivity present in qualitative human interpretations of colonoscopy findings. Localization of the camera is essential to interpreting the meaning and context of findings for diseases evaluated by colonoscopy. In this study, we propose a camera localization system to estimate the relative location of the camera and classify the colon into anatomical segments. The camera localization system begins with non-informative frame detection and removal. Then a self-training end-to-end convolutional neural network is built to estimate the camera motion, where several strategies are proposed to improve its robustness and generalization on endoscopic videos. Using the estimated camera motion a camera trajectory can be derived and a relative location index calculated. Based on the estimated location index, anatomical colon segment classification is performed by constructing a colon template. The proposed motion estimation algorithm was evaluated on an external dataset containing the ground truth for camera pose. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to other published methods. The relative location index estimation and anatomical region classification were further validated using colonoscopy videos collected from routine clinical practice. This validation yielded an average accuracy in classification of 0.754, which is substantially higher than the performances obtained using location indices built from other methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
