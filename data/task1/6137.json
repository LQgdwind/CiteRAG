Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Perturbation Learning Based Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents a simple yet effective method for anomaly detection. The main idea is to learn small perturbations to perturb normal data and learn a classifier to classify the normal data and the perturbed data into two different classes. The perturbator and classifier are jointly learned using deep neural networks. Importantly, the perturbations should be as small as possible but the classifier is still able to recognize the perturbed data from unperturbed data. Therefore, the perturbed data are regarded as abnormal data and the classifier provides a decision boundary between the normal data and abnormal data, although the training data do not include any abnormal data. Compared with the state-of-the-art of anomaly detection, our method does not require any assumption about the shape (e.g. hypersphere) of the decision boundary and has fewer hyper-parameters to determine. Empirical studies on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
