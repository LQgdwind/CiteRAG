Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5.

      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Machine Reading Comprehension with Contextualized Commonsense Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we aim to extract commonsense knowledge to improve machine reading comprehension. We propose to represent relations implicitly by situating structured knowledge in a context instead of relying on a pre-defined set of relations, and we call it contextualized knowledge. Each piece of contextualized knowledge consists of a pair of interrelated verbal and nonverbal messages extracted from a script and the scene in which they occur as context to implicitly represent the relation between the verbal and nonverbal messages, which are originally conveyed by different modalities within the script. We propose a two-stage fine-tuning strategy to use the large-scale weakly-labeled data based on a single type of contextualized knowledge and employ a teacher-student paradigm to inject multiple types of contextualized knowledge into a student machine reader. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline by a 4.3%percent4.34.3\\% improvement in accuracy on the machine reading comprehension dataset C3, wherein most of the questions require unstated prior knowledge.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
