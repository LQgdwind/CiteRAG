Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Monotone Submodular Matroid\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, and present for it a deterministic non-oblivious local search algorithm that has an approximation guarantee of 1−1/e−ε11𝑒𝜀1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}}-\\varepsilon (for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0) and query complexity of O~ε​(n​r)subscript~𝑂𝜀𝑛𝑟\\tilde{O}_{\\varepsilon}(nr), where n𝑛n is the size of the ground set and r𝑟r is the rank of the matroid. Our algorithm vastly improves over the previous state-of-the-art 0.50080.50080.5008-approximation deterministic algorithm, and in fact, shows that there is no separation between the approximation guarantees that can be obtained by deterministic and randomized algorithms for the problem considered. The query complexity of our algorithm can be improved to O~ε​(n+r​n)subscript~𝑂𝜀𝑛𝑟𝑛\\tilde{O}_{\\varepsilon}(n+r\\sqrt{n}) using randomization, which is nearly-linear for r=O​(n)𝑟𝑂𝑛r=O(\\sqrt{n}), and is always at least as good as the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.
