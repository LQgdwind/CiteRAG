Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Explainable TOPSIS: Visual Insights into the Effects of Weights and Aggregations on Rankings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is extensively used across diverse industries to assess and rank alternatives. Among numerous MCDA methods developed to solve real-world ranking problems, TOPSIS remains one of the most popular choices in many application areas. TOPSIS calculates distances between the considered alternatives and two predefined ones, namely the ideal and the anti-ideal, and creates a ranking of the alternatives according to a chosen aggregation of these distances. However, the interpretation of the inner workings of TOPSIS is difficult, especially when the number of criteria is large. To this end, recent research has shown that TOPSIS aggregations can be expressed using the means (M) and standard deviations (SD) of alternatives, creating MSD-space, a tool for visualizing and explaining aggregations. Even though MSD-space is highly useful, it assumes equally important criteria, making it less applicable to real-world ranking problems. In this paper, we generalize the concept of MSD-space to weighted criteria by introducing the concept of WMSD-space defined by what is referred to as weight-scaled means and standard deviations. We demonstrate that TOPSIS and similar distance-based aggregation methods can be successfully illustrated in a plane and interpreted even when the criteria are weighted, regardless of their number. The proposed WMSD-space offers a practical method for explaining TOPSIS rankings in real-world decision problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
