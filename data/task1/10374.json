Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: HEQuant: Marrying Homomorphic Encryption and Quantization for Communication-Efficient Private Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Secure two-party computation with homomorphic encryption (HE) protects data privacy with a formal security guarantee but suffers from high communication overhead. While previous works, e.g., Cheetah, Iron, etc, have proposed efficient HE-based protocols for different neural network (NN) operations, they still assume high precision, e.g., fixed point 37 bit, for the NN operations and ignore NNs’ native robustness against quantization error. In this paper, we propose HEQuant, which features low-precision-quantization-aware optimization for the HE-based protocols. We observe the benefit of a naive combination of quantization and HE quickly saturates as bit precision goes down. Hence, to further improve communication efficiency, we propose a series of optimizations, including an intra-coefficient packing algorithm and a quantization-aware tiling algorithm, to simultaneously reduce the number and precision of the transferred data. Compared with prior-art HE-based protocols, e.g., CrypTFlow2, Cheetah, Iron, etc, HEQuant achieves 3.5∼23.4×3.5\\sim 23.4\\times communication reduction and 3.0∼9.3×3.0\\sim 9.3\\times latency reduction. Meanwhile, when compared with prior-art network optimization frameworks, e.g., SENet, SNL, etc, HEQuant also achieves 3.1∼3.6×3.1\\sim 3.6\\times communication reduction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
