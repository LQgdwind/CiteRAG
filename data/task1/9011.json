Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Domain Generalization for Domain-Linked Classes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Domain generalization (DG) focuses on transferring domain-invariant knowledge from multiple source domains (available at train time) to an a priori unseen target domain(s). This requires a class to be expressed in multiple domains for the learning algorithm to break the spurious correlations between domain and class. However, in the real-world, classes may often be domain-linked, i.e. expressed only in a specific domain, which leads to extremely poor generalization performance for these classes. In this work, we aim to learn generalizable representations for these domain-linked classes by transferring domain-invariant knowledge from classes expressed in multiple source domains (domain-shared classes). To this end, we introduce this task to the community and propose a Fair and cONtrastive feature-space regularization algorithm for Domain-linked DG FOND. Rigorous and reproducible experiments with baselines across popular DG tasks demonstrate our method and its variantsâ€™ ability to accomplish state-of-the-art DG results for domain-linked classes. We also provide practical insights on data conditions that increase domain-linked class generalizability to tackle real-world data scarcity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
