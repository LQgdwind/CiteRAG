      "content": "Paper Title: Local and Global Contextual Features Fusion for Pedestrian Intention Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming an indispensable part of future transportation. However, safety challenges and lack of reliability limit their real-world deployment. Towards boosting the appearance of AVs on the roads, the interaction of AVs with pedestrians including “prediction of the pedestrian crossing intention” deserves extensive research. This is a highly challenging task as involves multiple non-linear parameters. In this direction, we extract and analyse spatio-temporal visual features of both pedestrian and traffic contexts. The pedestrian features include body pose and local context features that represent the pedestrian’s behaviour. Additionally, to understand the global context, we utilise location, motion, and environmental information using scene parsing technology that represents the pedestrian’s surroundings, and may affect the pedestrian’s intention. Finally, these multi-modality features are intelligently fused for effective intention prediction learning. The experimental results of the proposed model on the JAAD dataset show a superior result on the combined AUC and F1-score compared to the state-of-the-art.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
