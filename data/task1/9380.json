Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Human Trajectory Forecasting with Explainable Behavioral Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Human trajectory forecasting helps to understand and predict human behaviors, enabling applications from social robots to self-driving cars, and therefore has been heavily investigated. Most existing methods can be divided into model-free and model-based methods. Model-free methods offer superior prediction accuracy but lack explainability, while model-based methods provide explainability but cannot predict well. Combining both methodologies, we propose a new Bayesian Neural Stochastic Differential Equation model BNSP-SFM, where a behavior SDE model is combined with Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). While the NNs provide superior predictive power, the SDE offers strong explainability with quantifiable uncertainty in behavior and observation. We show that BNSP-SFM achieves up to a 50% improvement in prediction accuracy, compared with 11 state-of-the-art methods. BNSP-SFM also generalizes better to drastically different scenes with different environments and crowd densities (∼similar-to\\sim20 times higher than the testing data). Finally, BNSP-SFM can provide predictions with confidence to better explain potential causes of behaviors. The code will be released upon acceptance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
