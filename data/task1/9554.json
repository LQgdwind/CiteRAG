Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding Deep Neural Networks via Linear Separability of Hidden Layers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we measure the linear separability of hidden layer outputs to study the characteristics of deep neural networks. In particular, we first propose Minkowski difference based linear separability measures (MD-LSMs) to evaluate the linear separability degree of two points sets. Then, we demonstrate that there is a synchronicity between the linear separability degree of hidden layer outputs and the network training performance, i.e., if the updated weights can enhance the linear separability degree of hidden layer outputs, the updated network will achieve a better training performance, and vice versa. Moreover, we study the effect of activation function and network size (including width and depth) on the linear separability of hidden layers. Finally, we conduct the numerical experiments to validate our findings on some popular deep networks including multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), deep belief network (DBN), ResNet, VGGNet, AlexNet, vision transformer (ViT) and GoogLeNet.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
