      "content": "Paper Title: Minimizing Convex Functions with Rational MinimizersTo appear in the Journal of the ACM. This journal version simplifies and significantly strengthens the results in an earlier version of this paper which appeared in SODA 2021.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given a separation oracle 𝖲𝖮𝖲𝖮\\mathsf{SO} for a convex function f𝑓f defined on ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} that has an integral minimizer inside a box with radius R𝑅R, we show how to find an exact minimizer of f𝑓f using at most • O​(n​(n​log⁡log⁡(n)/log⁡(n)+log⁡(R)))𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑅O(n(n\\log\\log(n)/\\log(n)+\\log(R))) calls to 𝖲𝖮𝖲𝖮\\mathsf{SO} and 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(n,log⁡(R))𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛𝑅\\mathsf{poly}(n,\\log(R)) arithmetic operations, or • O​(n​log⁡(n​R))𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑅O(n\\log(nR)) calls to 𝖲𝖮𝖲𝖮\\mathsf{SO} and exp⁡(O​(n))⋅𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(log⁡(R))⋅𝑂𝑛𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑅\\exp(O(n))\\cdot\\mathsf{poly}(\\log(R)) arithmetic operations. When the set of minimizers of f𝑓f has integral extreme points, our algorithm outputs an integral minimizer of f𝑓f. This improves upon the previously best oracle complexity of O​(n2​(n+log⁡(R)))𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛𝑅O(n^{2}(n+\\log(R))) for polynomial time algorithms and O​(n2​log⁡(n​R))𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛𝑅O(n^{2}\\log(nR)) for exponential time algorithms obtained by [Grötschel, Lovász and Schrijver, Prog. Comb. Opt. 1984, Springer 1988] over thirty years ago. Our improvement on Grötschel, Lovász and Schrijver’s result generalizes to the setting where the set of minimizers of f𝑓f is a rational polyhedron with bounded vertex complexity. For the Submodular Function Minimization problem, our result immediately implies a strongly polynomial algorithm that makes at most O​(n3​log⁡log⁡(n)/log⁡(n))𝑂superscript𝑛3𝑛𝑛O(n^{3}\\log\\log(n)/\\log(n)) calls to an evaluation oracle, and an exponential time algorithm that makes at most O​(n2​log⁡(n))𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛O(n^{2}\\log(n)) calls to an evaluation oracle. These improve upon the previously best O​(n3​log2⁡(n))𝑂superscript𝑛3superscript2𝑛O(n^{3}\\log^{2}(n)) oracle complexity for strongly polynomial algorithms given in [Lee, Sidford and Wong, FOCS 2015] and [Dadush, Végh and Zambelli, SODA 2018], and an exponential time algorithm with oracle complexity O​(n3​log⁡(n))𝑂superscript𝑛3𝑛O(n^{3}\\log(n)) given in the former work. Our result is achieved via a reduction to the Shortest Vector Problem in lattices. We show how an approximately shortest vector of certain lattice can be used to effectively reduce the dimension of the problem. Our analysis of the oracle complexity is based on a potential function that captures simultaneously the size of the search set and the density of the lattice, which we analyze via tools from convex geometry and lattice theory.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
