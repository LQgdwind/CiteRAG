      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing VarLiNGAM for Scalable and Efficient Time Series Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Causal discovery identifies causal relationships in data, but the task is more complex for multivariate time series due to the computational demands of methods like VarLiNGAM, which combines a Vector Autoregressive Model with a Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model. This study optimizes causal discovery specifically for time series data, which are common in practical applications. Time series causal discovery is particularly challenging because of temporal dependencies and potential time lag effects. By developing a specialized dataset generator and reducing the computational complexity of the VarLiNGAM model from O‚Äã(m3‚ãÖn)ùëÇ‚ãÖsuperscriptùëö3ùëõO(m^{3}\\cdot n) to O‚Äã(m3+m2‚ãÖn)ùëÇsuperscriptùëö3‚ãÖsuperscriptùëö2ùëõO(m^{3}+m^{2}\\cdot n), this study enhances the feasibility of processing large datasets. The proposed methods were validated on advanced computational platforms and tested on simulated, real-world, and large-scale datasets, demonstrating improved efficiency and performance. The optimized algorithm achieved 7 to 13 times speedup compared to the original and about 4.5 times speedup compared to the GPU-accelerated version on large-scale datasets with feature sizes from 200 to 400. Our methods extend current causal discovery capabilities, making them more robust, scalable, and applicable to real-world scenarios, facilitating advancements in fields like healthcare and finance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
