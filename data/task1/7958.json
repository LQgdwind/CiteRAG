Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Variational Bayesian Neural Networks via Resolution of Singularities\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we advocate for the importance of singular learning theory (SLT) as it pertains to the theory and practice of variational inference in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). To begin, using SLT, we lay to rest some of the confusion surrounding discrepancies between downstream predictive performance measured via e.g., the test log predictive density, and the variational objective. Next, we use the SLT-corrected asymptotic form for singular posterior distributions to inform the design of the variational family itself. Specifically, we build upon the idealized variational family introduced in Bhattacharya et al. (2020) which is theoretically appealing but practically intractable. Our proposal takes shape as a normalizing flow where the base distribution is a carefully-initialized generalized gamma. We conduct experiments comparing this to the canonical Gaussian base distribution and show improvements in terms of variational free energy and variational generalization error.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
