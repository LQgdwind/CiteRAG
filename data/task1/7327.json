Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A New Conjecture on Hardness of Low-Degree 2-CSP‚Äôs with Implications to Hardness of Densest ùëò-Subgraph and Other Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: We propose a new conjecture on hardness of low-degree 222-CSP‚Äôs, and show that new hardness of approximation results for Densest kùëòk-Subgraph and several other problems, including a graph partitioning problem, and a variation of the Graph Crossing Number problem, follow from this conjecture. The conjecture can be viewed as occupying a middle ground between the dùëëd-to-111 conjecture, and hardness results for 222-CSP‚Äôs that can be obtained via standard techniques, such as Parallel Repetition combined with standard 222-prover protocols for the 3SAT problem. We hope that this work will motivate further exploration of hardness of 222-CSP‚Äôs in the regimes arising from the conjecture. We believe that a positive resolution of the conjecture will provide a good starting point for further hardness of approximation proofs. Another contribution of our work is proving that the problems that we consider are roughly equivalent from the approximation perspective. Some of these problems arose in previous work, from which it appeared that they may be related to each other. We formalize this relationship in this work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
