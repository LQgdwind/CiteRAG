      "content": "Paper Title: The Approximate Degree of DNF and CNF Formulas∗\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The approximate degree of a Boolean function f:{0,1}n→{0,1}:𝑓→superscript01𝑛01f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{0,1\\} is the minimum degree of a real polynomial p𝑝p that approximates f𝑓f pointwise: |f​(x)−p​(x)|⩽1/3𝑓𝑥𝑝𝑥13|f(x)-p(x)|\\leqslant 1/3 for all x∈{0,1}n.𝑥superscript01𝑛x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}. For every δ>0,𝛿0\\delta>0, we construct CNF and DNF formulas of polynomial size with approximate degree Ω​(n1−δ),Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}), essentially matching the trivial upper bound of n.𝑛n. This improves polynomially on previous lower bounds and fully resolves the approximate degree of constant-depth circuits (𝖠𝖢0),superscript𝖠𝖢0(\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0}), a question that has seen extensive research over the past 10 years. Prior to our work, an Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}) lower bound was known only for 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} circuits of depth that grows with 1/δ1𝛿1/\\delta (Bun and Thaler, FOCS 2017). Furthermore, the CNF and DNF formulas that we construct are the simplest possible in that they have constant width. Our result holds even for one-sided approximation: for any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, we construct a polynomial-size constant-width CNF formula with one-sided approximate degree Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}). Our work has the following consequences. (i) We essentially settle the communication complexity of 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\operatorname{\\mathsf{AC}}^{0} circuits in the bounded-error quantum model, k𝑘k-party number-on-the-forehead randomized model, and k𝑘k-party number-on-the-forehead nondeterministic model: we prove that for every δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, these models require Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}), Ω​(n/4k​k2)1−δΩsuperscript𝑛superscript4𝑘superscript𝑘21𝛿\\Omega(n/4^{k}k^{2})^{1-\\delta}, and Ω​(n/4k​k2)1−δΩsuperscript𝑛superscript4𝑘superscript𝑘21𝛿\\Omega(n/4^{k}k^{2})^{1-\\delta}, respectively, bits of communication even for polynomial-size constant-width CNF formulas. (ii) In particular, we show that the multiparty communication class 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯ksubscript𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝑘\\mathsf{coNP}_{k} can be separated essentially optimally from 𝖭𝖯ksubscript𝖭𝖯𝑘\\mathsf{NP}_{k} and 𝖡𝖯𝖯ksubscript𝖡𝖯𝖯𝑘\\mathsf{BPP}_{k} by a particularly simple function, a polynomial-size constant-width CNF formula. (iii) We give an essentially tight separation, of O​(1)𝑂1O(1) versus Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}), for the one-sided versus two-sided approximate degree of a function; and O​(1)𝑂1O(1) versus Ω​(n1−δ)Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝛿\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}) for the one-sided approximate degree of a function f𝑓f versus its negation ¬f𝑓\\neg f. Our proof departs significantly from previous approaches and contributes a novel, number-theoretic method for amplifying approximate degree.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
