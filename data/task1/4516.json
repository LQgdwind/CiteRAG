      "content": "Paper Title: ConTIG: Continuous Representation Learning on Temporal Interaction Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Representation learning on temporal interaction graphs (TIG) is to model complex networks with the dynamic evolution of interactions arising in a broad spectrum of problems. Existing dynamic embedding methods on TIG discretely update node embeddings merely when an interaction occurs. They fail to capture the continuous dynamic evolution of embedding trajectories of nodes. In this paper, we propose a two-module framework named ConTIG, a continuous representation method that captures the continuous dynamic evolution of node embedding trajectories. With two essential modules, our model exploit three-fold factors in dynamic networks which include latest interaction, neighbor features and inherent characteristics. In the first update module, we employ a continuous inference block to learn the nodesâ€™ state trajectories by learning from time-adjacent interaction patterns between node pairs using ordinary differential equations. In the second transform module, we introduce a self-attention mechanism to predict future node embeddings by aggregating historical temporal interaction information. Experiments results demonstrate the superiority of ConTIG on temporal link prediction, temporal node recommendation and dynamic node classification tasks compared with a range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially for long-interval interactions prediction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
