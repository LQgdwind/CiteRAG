Grochow‚Äôs NSF award CISE-2047756 and the University of Colorado Boulder, Department of Computer Science Summer Research Fellowship.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we extend the work of Grohe & Neuen (ACM T. Comput. Log., 2023) to show that the (6‚Äãk+3)6ùëò3(6k+3)-dimensional Weisfeiler‚ÄìLeman (WL) algorithm can identify graphs of rank width kùëòk using only O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n) rounds. As a consequence, we obtain that graphs of bounded rank width are identified by FO+CFOC\\textsf{FO}+\\textsf{C} formulas with 6‚Äãk+46ùëò46k+4 variables and quantifier depth O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n). Furthermore, in light of the parallel WL implementation due to Grohe & Verbitsky (ICALP 2006), we obtain TC1superscriptTC1\\textsf{TC}^{1} upper bounds for isomorphism testing of graphs of bounded rank width. Prior to this paper, isomorphism testing for graphs of bounded rank width was not known to be in NC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
