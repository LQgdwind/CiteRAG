Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multicriteria Scalable Graph Drawing via Stochastic Gradient Descent, (𝑆⁢𝐺⁢𝐷)²\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Readability criteria, such as distance or neighborhood preservation, are often used to optimize node-link representations of graphs to enable the comprehension of the underlying data. With few exceptions, graph drawing algorithms typically optimize one such criterion, usually at the expense of others. We propose a layout approach, Multicriteria Scalable Graph Drawing via Stochastic Gradient Descent, (S​G​D)2superscript𝑆𝐺𝐷2(SGD)^{2}, that can handle multiple readability criteria. (S​G​D)2superscript𝑆𝐺𝐷2(SGD)^{2} can optimize any criterion that can be described by a differentiable function. Our approach is flexible and can be used to optimize several criteria that have already been considered earlier (e.g., obtaining ideal edge lengths, stress, neighborhood preservation) as well as other criteria which have not yet been explicitly optimized in such fashion (e.g., node resolution, angular resolution, aspect ratio). The approach is scalable and can handle large graphs. A variation of the underlying approach can also be used to optimize many desirable properties in planar graphs, while maintaining planarity. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effectiveness of (S​G​D)2superscript𝑆𝐺𝐷2(SGD)^{2}: we analyze the interactions between criteria, measure the quality of layouts generated from (S​G​D)2superscript𝑆𝐺𝐷2(SGD)^{2} as well as the runtime behavior, and analyze the impact of sample sizes. The source code is available on github and we also provide an interactive demo for small graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
