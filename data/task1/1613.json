Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Neural Networks with Short Circuits for Improved Gradient Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep neural networks have achieved great success both in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. However, mostly state-of-art methods highly rely on external training or computing to improve the performance. To alleviate the external reliance, we proposed a gradient enhancement approach, conducted by the short circuit neural connections, to improve the gradient learning of deep neural networks. The proposed short circuit is a unidirectional connection that single back propagates the sensitive from the deep layer to the shallows. Moreover, the short circuit formulates to be a gradient truncation of its crossing layers which can plug into the backbone deep neural networks without introducing external training parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate deep neural networks with our short circuit gain a large margin over the baselines on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
