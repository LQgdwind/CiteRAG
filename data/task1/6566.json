      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial-Time Power-Sum Decomposition of Polynomials\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We give efficient algorithms for finding power-sum decomposition of an input polynomial P​(x)=∑i⩽mpi​(x)d𝑃𝑥subscript𝑖𝑚subscript𝑝𝑖superscript𝑥𝑑P(x)=\\sum_{i\\leqslant m}p_{i}(x)^{d} with component pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}s. The case of linear pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}s is equivalent to the well-studied tensor decomposition problem while the quadratic case occurs naturally in studying identifiability of non-spherical Gaussian mixtures from low-order moments. Unlike tensor decomposition, both the unique identifiability and algorithms for this problem are not well-understood. For the simplest setting of quadratic pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}s and d=3𝑑3d=3, prior work of [GHK15] yields an algorithm only when m⩽O~​(n)𝑚~𝑂𝑛m\\leqslant\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}). On the other hand, the more general recent result of [GKS20] builds an algebraic approach to handle any m=nO​(1)𝑚superscript𝑛𝑂1m=n^{O(1)} components but only when d𝑑d is large enough (while yielding no bounds for d=3𝑑3d=3 or even d=100𝑑100d=100) and only handles an inverse exponential noise. Our results obtain a substantial quantitative improvement on both the prior works above even in the base case of d=3𝑑3d=3 and quadratic pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}s. Specifically, our algorithm succeeds in decomposing a sum of m∼O~​(n)similar-to𝑚~𝑂𝑛m\\sim\\widetilde{O}(n) generic quadratic pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}s for d=3𝑑3d=3 and more generally the d𝑑dth power-sum of m∼n2​d/15similar-to𝑚superscript𝑛2𝑑15m\\sim n^{2d/15} generic degree-K𝐾K polynomials for any K⩾2𝐾2K\\geqslant 2. Our algorithm relies only on basic numerical linear algebraic primitives, is exact (i.e., obtain arbitrarily tiny error up to numerical precision), and handles an inverse polynomial noise when the pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}s have random Gaussian coefficients. Our main tool is a new method for extracting the linear span of pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}s by studying the linear subspace of low-order partial derivatives of the input P𝑃P. For establishing polynomial stability of our algorithm in average-case, we prove inverse polynomial bounds on the smallest singular value of certain correlated random matrices with low-degree polynomial entries that arise in our analyses. Since previous techniques only yield significantly weaker bounds, we analyze the smallest singular value of matrices by studying the largest singular value of certain deviation matrices via graph matrix decomposition and the trace moment method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
