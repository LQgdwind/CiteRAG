      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-decentralized Inference in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Demand Forecasting: An Edge-Computing Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Prediction of taxi service demand and supply is essential for improving customer’s experience and provider’s profit. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown promising for this application. This approach models city regions as nodes in a transportation graph and their relations as edges. GNNs utilize local node features and the graph structure in the prediction. However, more efficient forecasting can still be achieved by following two main routes; enlarging the scale of the transportation graph, and simultaneously exploiting different types of nodes and edges in the graphs. However, both approaches are challenged by the scalability of GNNs. An immediate remedy to the scalability challenge is to decentralize the GNN operation. However, this creates excessive node-to-node communication. In this paper, we first characterize the excessive communication needs for the decentralized GNN approach. Then, we propose a semi-decentralized approach utilizing multiple cloudlets, moderately sized storage and computation devices, that can be integrated with the cellular base stations. This approach minimizes inter-cloudlet communication thereby alleviating the communication overhead of the decentralized approach while promoting scalability due to cloudlet-level decentralization. Also, we propose a heterogeneous GNN-LSTM algorithm for improved taxi-level demand and supply forecasting for handling dynamic taxi graphs where nodes are taxis. Extensive experiments over real data show the advantage of the semi-decentralized approach as tested over our heterogeneous GNN-LSTM algorithm. Also, the proposed semi-decentralized GNN approach is shown to reduce the overall inference time by about an order of magnitude compared to centralized and decentralized inference schemes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
