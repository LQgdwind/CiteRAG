Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Lost in Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Algorithms are becoming more capable, and with that comes hic sunt dracones (\\sayhere be dragons). The term symbolizes areas beyond our known maps. We use this term since we are stepping into an exciting, potentially dangerous, and unknown area with algorithms. Our curiosity to understand the natural world drives our search for new methods. For this reason, it is crucial to explore this subject. In this document, we look for future algorithms and styles. Each era in computing has had an algorithm focus. Examples include periods when military range prediction was necessary, weather prediction, and, more recently, machine learning. The 1940s saw the starting point when electronic machines replaced humans (Bhattacharya, 2022). Procedures became too complex to be handled by people. This time and other historical periods have accelerated additional specific algorithm development and the associated hardware architectures. The question for this paper is, what next? As we explore this question, we will introduce a set of practical terms to help classify the various algorithms and hopefully provide a straightforward method of understanding. At the highest level, algorithms are recipes for solving problems. Problems range from the small & simple to the large & complex. This project covers the behavior of algorithms and the hardware styles to execute those algorithms. In other words, we will cover what the algorithms do rather than how they do it. The world of algorithms is a large and complicated subject. To assist in the process, we will separate the world into three main areas: computer science, artificial intelligence, and finally quantum computing. The project‚Äôs objective is to overlay the information obtained, in conjunction with the state of hardware today, to see if we can determine the likely directions for future algorithms‚Äô. Even though we slightly cover non-classical computing in this paper, our primary focus is on classical computing (i.e., digital computers). It is worth noting that non-classical quantum computing requires classical computers to operate; they are not mutually exclusive.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
