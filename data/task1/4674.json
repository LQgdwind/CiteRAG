Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Clinical Evidence Engine: Proof-of-Concept For A Clinical-Domain-Agnostic Decision Support Infrastructure\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Abstruse learning algorithms and complex datasets increasingly characterize modern clinical decision support (CDS) systems. As a result, clinicians cannot easily or rapidly scrutinize the CDSS recommendation when facing a difficult diagnosis or treatment decision in practice. Over-trusting or under-trusting CDS recommendations are frequent, leading to preventable diagnostic or treatment errors. Prior research has explored supporting such assessments by explaining DST data inputs and algorithmic mechanisms. This paper explores a different approach: Providing precisely relevant, scientific evidence from biomedical literature. We present a proof-of-concept system, Clinical Evidence Engine, to demonstrate the technical and design feasibility of this approach across three domains (cardiovascular diseases, autism, cancer). Leveraging Clinical BioBERT, the system can effectively identify clinical trial reports based on lengthy clinical questions (e.g., ”risks of catheter infection among adult patients in intensive care unit who require arterial catheters, if treated with povidone iodine-alcohol”). This capability enables the system to identify clinical trials relevant to diagnostic/treatment hypotheses – a clinician’s or a CDS’s. Further, Clinical Evidence Engine can identify key parts of a clinical trial abstract, including patient population (e.g., adult patients in intensive care unit who require arterial catheters), intervention (povidone iodine-alcohol), and outcome (risks of catheter infection). This capability opens up the possibility of enabling clinicians to 1) rapidly determine the match between a clinical trial and a clinical question, and 2) understand the result and contexts of the trial without extensive reading. We demonstrate this potential by illustrating two example use scenarios of the system. We discuss future work that can advance the design and ML performances of this system. We discuss the idea of designing DST explanations not as specific to a DST or an algorithm, but as a domain-agnostic decision support infrastructure.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
