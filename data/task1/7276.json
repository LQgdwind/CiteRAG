Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A degree 4 sum-of-squares lower bound for the clique number of the Paley graph\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We prove that the degree 4 sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxation of the clique number of the Paley graph on a prime number pùëùp of vertices has value at least Œ©‚Äã(p1/3)Œ©superscriptùëù13\\Omega(p^{1/3}). This is in contrast to the widely believed conjecture that the actual clique number of the Paley graph is O‚Äã(polylog‚Äã(p))ùëÇpolylogùëùO(\\mathrm{polylog}(p)). Our result may be viewed as a derandomization of that of Deshpande and Montanari (2015), who showed the same lower bound (up to polylog‚Äã(p)polylogùëù\\mathrm{polylog}(p) terms) with high probability for the Erd≈ës-R√©nyi random graph on pùëùp vertices, whose clique number is with high probability O‚Äã(log‚Å°(p))ùëÇùëùO(\\log(p)). We also show that our lower bound is optimal for the Feige-Krauthgamer construction of pseudomoments, derandomizing an argument of Kelner. Finally, we present numerical experiments indicating that the value of the degree 4 SOS relaxation of the Paley graph may scale as O‚Äã(p1/2‚àíŒµ)ùëÇsuperscriptùëù12ùúÄO(p^{1/2-\\varepsilon}) for some Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0, and give a matrix norm calculation indicating that the pseudocalibration proof strategy for SOS lower bounds for random graphs will not immediately transfer to the Paley graph. Taken together, our results suggest that degree 4 SOS may break the ‚Äúpùëù\\sqrt{p} barrier‚Äù for upper bounds on the clique number of Paley graphs, but prove that it can at best improve the exponent from 1/2121/2 to 1/3131/3.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
