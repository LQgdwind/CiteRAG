      "content": "Paper Title: A micropolar peridynamics model with non-unified horizon for damage of solids with different non-local effects\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Most peridynamics models adopt regular point distribution and unified horizon, limiting their flexibility and engineering applications. In this work, a micropolar peridynamics approach with non-unified horizon (NHPD) is proposed. This approach is implemented in a conventional finite element framework, using element-based discretization. By modifying the dual horizon approach into the pre-processing part, point dependent horizon and non-unified beam-like bonds are built. By implementing a domain correction strategy, the equivalence of strain energy density is assured. Then, a novel energy density-based failure criterion is presented which directly bridges the critical stretch to the mechanical strength. The numerical results indicate the weak mesh dependency of NHPD and the effectiveness of the new failure criterion. Moreover, it is proven that damage of solid with different non-local effects can lead to similar results by only adjusting the mechanical strength.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
