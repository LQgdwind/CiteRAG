Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 66 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Settling the complexity of Nash equilibrium in congestion games\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider (i) the problem of finding a (possibly mixed) Nash equilibrium in congestion games, and (ii) the problem of finding an (exponential precision) fixed point of the gradient descent dynamics of a smooth function f:[0,1]n‚Üí‚Ñù:ùëì‚Üísuperscript01ùëõ‚Ñùf:[0,1]^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}. We prove that these problems are equivalent. Our result holds for various explicit descriptions of fùëìf, ranging from (almost general) arithmetic circuits, to degree-555 polynomials. By a very recent result of [FGHS20], this implies that these problems are \\PPAD‚à©\\PLS\\PPAD\\PLS\\PPAD\\cap\\PLS-complete. As a corollary, we also obtain the following equivalence of complexity classes: \\CCLS=\\PPAD‚à©\\PLS.\\CCLS\\PPAD\\PLS\\CCLS=\\PPAD\\cap\\PLS.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper.
