Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Joint Reconstruction and Calibration using Regularization by Denoising\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Regularization by denoising (RED) is a broadly applicable framework for solving inverse problems by using priors specified as denoisers. While RED has been shown to provide state-of-the-art performance in a number of applications, existing RED algorithms require exact knowledge of the measurement operator characterizing the imaging system, limiting their applicability in problems where the measurement operator has parametric uncertainties. We propose a new method, called Calibrated RED (Cal-RED), that enables joint calibration of the measurement operator along with reconstruction of the unknown image. Cal-RED extends the traditional RED methodology to imaging problems that require the calibration of the measurement operator. We validate Cal-RED on the problem of image reconstruction in computerized tomography (CT) under perturbed projection angles. Our results corroborate the effectiveness of Cal-RED for joint calibration and reconstruction using pre-trained deep denoisers as image priors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
