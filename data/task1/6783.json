Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dual Instrumental Method for Confounded Kernelized Bandits\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The contextual bandit problem is a theoretically justified framework with wide applications in various fields. While the previous study on this problem usually requires independence between noise and contexts, our work considers a more sensible setting where the noise becomes a latent confounder that affects both contexts and rewards. Such a confounded setting is more realistic and could expand to a broader range of applications. However, the unresolved confounder will cause a bias in reward function estimation and thus lead to a large regret. To deal with the challenges brought by the confounder, we apply the dual instrumental variable regression, which can correctly identify the true reward function. We prove the convergence rate of this method is near-optimal in two types of widely used reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Therefore, we can design computationally efficient and regret-optimal algorithms based on the theoretical guarantees for confounded bandit problems. The numerical results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms in the confounded bandit setting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
