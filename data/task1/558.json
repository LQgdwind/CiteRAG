      "content": "Paper Title: Robust testing of low-dimensional functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A natural problem in high-dimensional inference is to decide if a classifier f:ℝn→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛11f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{-1,1\\} depends on a small number of linear directions of its input data. Call a function g:ℝn→{−1,1}:𝑔→superscriptℝ𝑛11g:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{-1,1\\}, a linear k𝑘k-junta if it is completely determined by some k𝑘k-dimensional subspace of the input space. A recent work of the authors showed that linear k𝑘k-juntas are testable. Thus there exists an algorithm to distinguish between: 1. f:ℝn→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛11f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{-1,1\\} which is a linear k𝑘k-junta with surface area s𝑠s, 2. f𝑓f is ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-far from any linear k𝑘k-junta with surface area (1+ϵ)​s1italic-ϵ𝑠(1+\\epsilon)s, where the query complexity of the algorithm is independent of the ambient dimension n𝑛n. Following the surge of interest in noise-tolerant property testing, in this paper we prove a noise-tolerant (or robust) version of this result. Namely, we give an algorithm which given any c>0𝑐0c>0, ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, distinguishes between 1. f:ℝn→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛11f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{-1,1\\} has correlation at least c𝑐c with some linear k𝑘k-junta with surface area s𝑠s. 2. f𝑓f has correlation at most c−ϵ𝑐italic-ϵc-\\epsilon with any linear k𝑘k-junta with surface area at most s𝑠s. The query complexity of our tester is k𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(s/ϵ)superscript𝑘𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑠italic-ϵk^{\\mathsf{poly}(s/\\epsilon)}. Using our techniques, we also obtain a fully noise tolerant tester with the same query complexity for any class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of linear k𝑘k-juntas with surface area bounded by s𝑠s. As a consequence, we obtain a fully noise tolerant tester with query complexity kO​(𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(log⁡k/ϵ))superscript𝑘𝑂𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑘italic-ϵk^{O(\\mathsf{poly}(\\log k/\\epsilon))} for the class of intersection of k𝑘k-halfspaces (for constant k𝑘k) over the Gaussian space. Our query complexity is independent of the ambient dimension n𝑛n. Previously, no non-trivial noise tolerant testers were known even for a single halfspace.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
