      "content": "Paper Title: BanditPAM: Almost Linear Time ùëò-Medoids Clustering via Multi-Armed Bandits\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Clustering is a ubiquitous task in data science. Compared to the commonly used kùëòk-means clustering, kùëòk-medoids clustering requires the cluster centers to be actual data points and supports arbitrary distance metrics, which permits greater interpretability and the clustering of structured objects. Current state-of-the-art kùëòk-medoids clustering algorithms, such as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), are iterative and are quadratic in the dataset size nùëõn for each iteration, being prohibitively expensive for large datasets. We propose BanditPAM, a randomized algorithm inspired by techniques from multi-armed bandits, that reduces the complexity of each PAM iteration from O‚Äã(n2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2O(n^{2}) to O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõùëõO(n\\log n) and returns the same results with high probability, under assumptions on the data that often hold in practice. As such, BanditPAM matches state-of-the-art clustering loss while reaching solutions much faster. We empirically validate our results on several large real-world datasets, including a coding exercise submissions dataset from Code.org, the 10x Genomics 68k PBMC single-cell RNA sequencing dataset, and the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. In these experiments, we observe that BanditPAM returns the same results as state-of-the-art PAM-like algorithms up to 4x faster while performing up to 200x fewer distance computations. The improvements demonstrated by BanditPAM enable kùëòk-medoids clustering on a wide range of applications, including identifying cell types in large-scale single-cell data and providing scalable feedback for students learning computer science online. We also release highly optimized Python and C++ implementations of our algorithm111https://github.com/ThrunGroup/BanditPAM.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
