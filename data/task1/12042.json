Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2. Title: Glove: Global vectors for word representation\n   Abstract: We present a new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"titles\": [\n    \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Glove: Global vectors for word representation\",\n    \"Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks\",\n    \"A Comparative Study of Neural Network Models for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Deep lstm based feature mapping for query classification\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the paper's focus on question classification using neural networks, I predict these references because: 1) CNN paper is directly relevant to the convolutional approach used; 2) GloVe embeddings are mentioned as pre-trained features; 3) QRNN is one of the compared methods; 4) Comparative study papers are common in this field; 5) LSTM-based query classification is closely related to question classification. Additional references cover related neural network architectures, NLP applications, deep learning methodologies, optimization techniques, and advanced neural network methods that would be relevant for this research area.\"\n}\n\nReturn JSON object only."

      "content": "Paper Title: Ergodicity of Langevin Dynamics and its Discretizations for Non-smooth Potentials\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This article is concerned with sampling from Gibbs distributions œÄ‚Äã(x)‚àùe‚àíU‚Äã(x)proportional-toùúãùë•superscriptùëíùëàùë•\\pi(x)\\propto e^{-U(x)} using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In particular, we investigate Langevin dynamics in the continuous- and the discrete-time setting for such distributions with potentials U‚Äã(x)ùëàùë•U(x) which are strongly-convex but possibly non-differentiable. We show that the corresponding subgradient Langevin dynamics are exponentially ergodic to the target density œÄùúã\\pi in the continuous setting and that certain explicit as well as semi-implicit discretizations are geometrically ergodic and approximate œÄùúã\\pi for vanishing discretization step size. Moreover, we prove that the discrete schemes satisfy the law of large numbers allowing to use consecutive iterates of a Markov chain in order to compute statistics of the stationary distribution posing a significant reduction of computational complexity in practice. Numerical experiments are provided confirming the theoretical findings and showcasing the practical relevance of the proposed methods in imaging applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
