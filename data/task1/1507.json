Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dialogue-adaptive Language Model Pre-training From Quality Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Pre-trained language models (PrLMs) have achieved great success on a wide range of natural language processing tasks by virtue of the universal language representation ability obtained by self-supervised learning on a large corpus. These models are pre-trained on standard plain texts with general language model (LM) training objectives, which would be insufficient to model dialogue-exclusive attributes like specificity and informativeness reflected in these tasks that are not explicitly captured by the pre-trained universal language representations. In this work, we propose dialogue-adaptive pre-training objectives (DAPO) derived from quality estimation to simulate dialogue-specific features, namely coherence, specificity, and informativeness. As the foundation for model pre-training, we synthesize a new dialogue corpus and build our training set with two unsupervised methods: 1) coherence-oriented context corruption, including utterance ordering, insertion, and replacement, to help the model capture the coherence inside the dialogue contexts; and 2) specificity-oriented automatic rescoring, which encourages the model to measure the quality of the synthesized data for dialogue-adaptive pre-training by considering specificity and informativeness. Experimental results on widely used open-domain response selection and quality estimation benchmarks show that DAPO significantly improves the baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MuTual leaderboard, verifying the effectiveness of estimating quality evaluation factors into pre-training.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
