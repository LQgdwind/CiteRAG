Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reformulating Regression Test Suite Optimization using Quantum Annealing - an Empirical Study\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Maintaining software quality is crucial in the dynamic landscape of software development. Regression testing ensures that software works as expected after changes are implemented. However, re-executing all test cases for every modification is often impractical and costly, particularly for large systems. Although very effective, traditional test suite optimization techniques are often impractical in resource-constrained scenarios, as they are computationally expensive. Hence, quantum computing solutions have been developed to improve their efficiency but have shown drawbacks in terms of effectiveness. We propose reformulating the regression test case selection problem to use quantum computation techniques better. Our objectives are (i) to provide more efficient solutions than traditional methods and (ii) to improve the effectiveness of previously proposed quantum-based solutions. We propose SelectQA, a quantum annealing approach that can outperform the quantum-based approach BootQA in terms of effectiveness while obtaining results comparable to those of the classic Additional Greedy and DIV-GA approaches. Regarding efficiency, SelectQA outperforms DIV-GA and has similar results with the Additional Greedy algorithm but is exceeded by BootQA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
