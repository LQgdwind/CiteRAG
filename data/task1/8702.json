Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 42 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer-based model for monocular visual odometry: a video understanding approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Estimating the camera’s pose given images of a single camera is a traditional task in mobile robots and autonomous vehicles. This problem is called monocular visual odometry and it often relies on geometric approaches that require considerable engineering effort for a specific scenario. Deep learning methods have shown to be generalizable after proper training and a large amount of available data. Transformer-based architectures have dominated the state-of-the-art in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, such as image and video understanding. In this work, we deal with the monocular visual odometry as a video understanding task to estimate the 6-DoF camera’s pose. We contribute by presenting the TSformer-VO model based on spatio-temporal self-attention mechanisms to extract features from clips and estimate the motions in an end-to-end manner. Our approach achieved competitive state-of-the-art performance compared with geometry-based and deep learning-based methods on the KITTI visual odometry dataset, outperforming the DeepVO implementation highly accepted in the visual odometry community.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 42 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 42\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
