      "content": "Paper Title: AI-supported Framework of Semi-Automatic Monoplotting for Monocular Oblique Visual Data Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the last decades, the development of smartphones, drones, aerial patrols, and digital cameras enabled high-quality photographs available to large populations and, thus, provides an opportunity to collect massive data of the nature and society with global coverage. However, the data collected with new photography tools is usually oblique - they are difficult to be georeferenced, and huge amounts of data is often obsolete. Georeferencing oblique imagery data may be solved by a technique called monoplotting, which only requires a single image and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In traditional monoplotting, a human user has to manually choose a series of ground control point (GCP) pairs in the image and DEM and then determine the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the camera to establish a pixel-level correspondence between photos and the DEM to enable the mapping and georeferencing of objects in photos. This traditional method is difficult to scale due to several challenges including the labor-intensive inputs, the need of rich experience to identify well-defined GCPs, and limitations in camera pose estimation. Therefore, existing monoplotting methods are rarely used in analyzing large-scale databases or near-real-time warning systems. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a novel semi-automatic monoplotting framework that provides pixel-level correspondence between photos and DEMs requiring minimal human interventions. A pipeline of analyses was developed including key point detection in images and DEM rasters, retrieving georeferenced 3D DEM GCPs, regularized gradient-based optimization, pose estimation, ray tracing, and the correspondence identification between image pixels and real world coordinates. Two numerical experiments show that the framework is superior in georeferencing visual data in 3-D coordinates, paving a way toward fully automatic monoplotting methodology.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
