Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Planning for Temporally Extended Goals in Pure-Past Linear Temporal Logic: A Polynomial Reduction to Standard Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study temporally extended goals expressed in Pure-Past ltl (ppltl). ppltl is particularly interesting for expressing goals since it allows to express sophisticated tasks as in the Formal Methods literature, while the worst-case computational complexity of Planning in both deterministic and nondeterministic domains (FOND) remains the same as for classical reachability goals. However, while the theory of planning for ppltl goals is well understood, practical tools have not been specifically investigated. In this paper, we make a significant leap forward in the construction of actual tools to handle ppltl goals. We devise a technique to polynomially translate planning for ppltl goals into standard planning. We show the formal correctness of the translation, its complexity, and its practical effectiveness through some comparative experiments. As a result, our translation enables state-of-the-art tools, such as ùñ•ùñ£ùñ•ùñ£\\mathsf{FD} or ùñ¨ùóíùñ≠ùñ£ùñ¨ùóíùñ≠ùñ£\\mathsf{MyND}, to handle ppltl goals seamlessly, maintaining the impressive performances they have for classical reachability goals.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
