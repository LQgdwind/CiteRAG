Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Parallel Planar Subgraph Isomorphism and Vertex Connectivity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We present the first parallel fixed-parameter algorithm for subgraph isomorphism in planar graphs, bounded-genus graphs, and, more generally, all minor-closed graphs of locally bounded treewidth. Our randomized low depth algorithm has a near-linear work dependency on the size of the target graph. Existing low depth algorithms do not guarantee that the work remains asymptotically the same for any constant-sized pattern. By using a connection to certain separating cycles, our subgraph isomorphism algorithm can decide the vertex connectivity of a planar graph (with high probability) in asymptotically near-linear work and poly-logarithmic depth. Previously, no sub-quadratic work and poly-logarithmic depth bound was known in planar graphs (in particular for distinguishing between four-connected and five-connected planar graphs).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
