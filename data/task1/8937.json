Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Automated Search-Space Generation Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To search an optimal sub-network within a general deep neural network (DNN), existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods typically rely on handcrafting a search space beforehand. Such requirements make it challenging to extend them onto general scenarios without significant human expertise and manual intervention. To overcome the limitations, we propose Automated Search-Space Generation Neural Architecture Search (ASGNAS), perhaps the first automated system to train general DNNs that cover all candidate connections and operations and produce high-performing sub-networks in the one shot manner. Technologically, ASGNAS delivers three noticeable contributions to minimize human efforts: (i) automated search space generation for general DNNs; (ii) a Hierarchical Half-Space Projected Gradient (H2SPG) that leverages the hierarchy and dependency within generated search space to ensure the network validity during optimization, and reliably produces a solution with both high performance and hierarchical group sparsity; and (iii) automated sub-network construction upon the H2SPG solution. Numerically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ASGNAS on a variety of general DNNs, including RegNet, StackedUnets, SuperResNet, and DARTS, over benchmark datasets such as CIFAR10, Fashion-MNIST, ImageNet, STL-10, and SVNH. The sub-networks computed by ASGNAS achieve competitive even superior performance compared to the starting full DNNs and other state-of-the-arts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
