Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Divided Attention: Unsupervised Multi-Object Discovery with Contextually Separated Slots\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a method to segment the visual field into independently moving regions, trained with no ground truth or supervision. It consists of an adversarial conditional encoder-decoder architecture based on Slot Attention, modified to use the image as context to decode optical flow without attempting to reconstruct the image itself. In the resulting multi-modal representation, one modality (flow) feeds the encoder to produce separate latent codes (slots), whereas the other modality (image) conditions the decoder to generate the first (flow) from the slots. This design frees the representation from having to encode complex nuisance variability in the image due to, for instance, illumination and reflectance properties of the scene. Since customary autoencoding based on minimizing the reconstruction error does not preclude the entire flow from being encoded into a single slot, we modify the loss to an adversarial criterion based on Contextual Information Separation. The resulting min-max optimization fosters the separation of objects and their assignment to different attention slots, leading to Divided Attention, or DivA. DivA outperforms recent unsupervised multi-object motion segmentation methods while tripling run-time speed up to 104FPS and reducing the performance gap from supervised methods to 12% or less. DivA can handle different numbers of objects and different image sizes at training and test time, is invariant to permutation of object labels, and does not require explicit regularization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
