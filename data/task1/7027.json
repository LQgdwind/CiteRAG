Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: LARF: Two-level Attention-based Random Forests with a Mixture of Contamination Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract New models of the attention-based random forests called LARF (Leaf Attention-based Random Forest) are proposed. The first idea behind the models is to introduce a two-level attention, where one of the levels is the “leaf” attention and the attention mechanism is applied to every leaf of trees. The second level is the tree attention depending on the “leaf” attention. The second idea is to replace the softmax operation in the attention with the weighted sum of the softmax operations with different parameters. It is implemented by applying a mixture of the Huber’s contamination models and can be regarded as an analog of the multi-head attention with “heads” defined by selecting a value of the softmax parameter. Attention parameters are simply trained by solving the quadratic optimization problem. To simplify the tuning process of the models, it is proposed to make the tuning contamination parameters to be training and to compute them by solving the quadratic optimization problem. Many numerical experiments with real datasets are performed for studying LARFs. The code of proposed algorithms can be found in https://github.com/andruekonst/leaf-attention-forest. Keywords: attention mechanism, random forest, Nadaraya-Watson regression, quadratic programming, contamination model\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
