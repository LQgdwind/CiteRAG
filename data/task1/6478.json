Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: FakeCLR: Exploring Contrastive Learning for Solving Latent Discontinuity in Data-Efficient GANs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data-Efficient GANs (DE-GANs), which aim to learn generative models with a limited amount of training data, encounter several challenges for generating high-quality samples. Since data augmentation strategies have largely alleviated the training instability, how to further improve the generative performance of DE-GANs becomes a hotspot. Recently, contrastive learning has shown the great potential of increasing the synthesis quality of DE-GANs, yet related principles are not well explored. In this paper, we revisit and compare different contrastive learning strategies in DE-GANs, and identify (i) the current bottleneck of generative performance is the discontinuity of latent space; (ii) compared to other contrastive learning strategies, Instance-perturbation works towards latent space continuity, which brings the major improvement to DE-GANs. Based on these observations, we propose FakeCLR, which only applies contrastive learning on perturbed fake samples, and devises three related training techniques: Noise-related Latent Augmentation, Diversity-aware Queue, and Forgetting Factor of Queue. Our experimental results manifest the new state of the arts on both few-shot generation and limited-data generation. On multiple datasets, FakeCLR acquires more than 15%percent1515\\% FID improvement compared to existing DE-GANs.
