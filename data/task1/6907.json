Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Clustering-Induced Generative Incomplete Image-Text Clustering(CIGIT-C)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The target of image-text clustering (ITC) is to find correct clusters by integrating complementary and consistent information of multi-modalities for these heterogeneous samples. However, the majority of current studies analyse ITC on the ideal premise that the samples in every modality are complete. This presumption, however, is not always valid in real-world situations. The missing data issue degenerates the image-text feature learning performance and will finally affect the generalization abilities in ITC tasks. Although a series of methods have been proposed to address this incomplete image text clustering issue (IITC), the following problems still exist: 1) most existing methods hardly consider the distinct gap between heterogeneous feature domains. 2) For missing data, the representations generated by existing methods are rarely guaranteed to suit clustering tasks. 3) Existing methods do not tap into the latent connections both inter and intra modalities. In this paper, we propose a Clustering-Induced Generative Incomplete Image-Text Clustering(CIGIT-C) network to address the challenges above. More specifically, we first use modality-specific encoders to map original features to more distinctive subspaces. The latent connections between intra and inter-modalities are thoroughly explored by using the adversarial generating network to produce one modality conditional on the other modality. Finally, we update the corresponding modality-specific encoders using two KL divergence losses. Experiment results on public image-text datasets demonstrated that the suggested method outperforms and is more effective in the IITC job.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 43\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
