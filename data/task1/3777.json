      "content": "Paper Title: Exponential Lower Bounds for Threshold Circuits of Sub-Linear Depth and Energy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we investigate computational power of threshold circuits and other theoretical models of neural networks in terms of the following four complexity measures: size (the number of gates), depth, weight and energy. Here the energy complexity of a circuit measures sparsity of their computation, and is defined as the maximum number of gates outputting non-zero values taken over all the input assignments. As our main result, we prove that any threshold circuit C𝐶C of size s𝑠s, depth d𝑑d, energy e𝑒e and weight w𝑤w satisfies log⁡(r​k​(MC))≤e​d​(log⁡s+log⁡w+log⁡n)𝑟𝑘subscript𝑀𝐶𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑤𝑛\\log(rk(M_{C}))\\leq ed(\\log s+\\log w+\\log n), where r​k​(MC)𝑟𝑘subscript𝑀𝐶rk(M_{C}) is the rank of the communication matrix MCsubscript𝑀𝐶M_{C} of a 2​n2𝑛2n-variable Boolean function that C𝐶C computes. Thus, such a threshold circuit C𝐶C is able to compute only a Boolean function of which communication matrix has rank bounded by a product of logarithmic factors of s,w𝑠𝑤s,w and linear factors of d,e𝑑𝑒d,e. This implies an exponential lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuit if energy and weight are sufficiently small. For example, we can obtain an exponential lower bound s=2Ω​(n1/3)𝑠superscript2Ωsuperscript𝑛13s=2^{\\Omega(n^{1/3})} even for threshold circuits of depth n1/3superscript𝑛13n^{1/3}, energy n1/3superscript𝑛13n^{1/3} and weight 2o​(n1/3)superscript2𝑜superscript𝑛132^{o(n^{1/3})}. We also show that the inequality is tight up to a constant factor when the depth d𝑑d and energy e𝑒e satisfies e​d=o​(n/log⁡n)𝑒𝑑𝑜𝑛𝑛ed=o(n/\\log n). For other models of neural networks such as a discretized ReLE circuits and decretized sigmoid circuits, we prove that a similar inequality also holds for a discretized circuit C𝐶C: r​k​(MC)=O​(e​d​(log⁡s+log⁡w+log⁡n)3)𝑟𝑘subscript𝑀𝐶𝑂𝑒𝑑superscript𝑠𝑤𝑛3rk(M_{C})=O(ed(\\log s+\\log w+\\log n)^{3}). We obtain this inequality by showing that any discretized circuit can be simulated by a threshold circuit with moderate increase of size, depth, energy and weight. Thus, if we consider the number of non-zero output values as a measure for sparse activity of a neural network, our results suggest that larger depth linearly helps neural networks to acquire sparse activity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
