Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-end Semantic Role Labeling with Neural Transition-based Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract End-to-end semantic role labeling (SRL) has been received increasing interest. It performs the two subtasks of SRL: predicate identification and argument role labeling, jointly. Recent work is mostly focused on graph-based neural models, while the transition-based framework with neural networks which has been widely used in a number of closely-related tasks, has not been studied for the joint task yet. In this paper, we present the first work of transition-based neural models for end-to-end SRL. Our transition model incrementally discovers all sentential predicates as well as their arguments by a set of transition actions. The actions of the two subtasks are executed mutually for full interactions. Besides, we suggest high-order compositions to extract non-local features, which can enhance the proposed transition model further. Experimental results on CoNLL09 and Universal Proposition Bank show that our final model can produce state-of-the-art performance, and meanwhile keeps highly efficient in decoding. We also conduct detailed experimental analysis for a deep understanding of our proposed model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
