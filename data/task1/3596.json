Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We tackle the problem of goal-directed graph construction: given a starting graph, a budget of modifications, and a global objective function, the aim is to find a set of edges whose addition to the graph achieves the maximum improvement in the objective (e.g., communication efficiency). This problem emerges in many networks of great importance for society such as transportation and critical infrastructure networks. We identify two significant shortcomings with present methods. Firstly, they focus exclusively on network topology while ignoring spatial information; however, in many real-world networks, nodes are embedded in space, which yields different global objectives and governs the range and density of realizable connections. Secondly, existing RL methods scale poorly to large networks due to the high cost of training a model and the scaling factors of the action space and global objectives. In this work, we formulate this problem as a deterministic MDP. We adopt the Monte Carlo Tree Search framework for planning in this domain, prioritizing the optimality of final solutions over the speed of policy evaluation. We propose several improvements over the standard UCT algorithm for this family of problems, addressing their single-agent nature, the trade-off between the costs of edges and their contribution to the objective, and an action space linear in the number of nodes. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach for improving the global efficiency and attack resilience of a variety of synthetic and real-world networks, including Internet backbone networks and metro systems. Our approach obtains a 24% improvement in these metrics compared to UCT on the largest networks tested and scalability superior to previous methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
