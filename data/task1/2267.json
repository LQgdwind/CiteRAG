Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Reinforcement Learning Formulation of the Lyapunov Optimization: Application to Edge Computing Systems with Queue Stability\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to the Lyapunov optimization is considered to minimize the time-average penalty while maintaining queue stability. A proper construction of state and action spaces is provided to form a proper Markov decision process (MDP) for the Lyapunov optimization. A condition for the reward function of reinforcement learning (RL) for queue stability is derived. Based on the analysis and practical RL with reward discounting, a class of reward functions is proposed for the DRL-based approach to the Lyapunov optimization. The proposed DRL-based approach to the Lyapunov optimization does not required complicated optimization at each time step and operates with general non-convex and discontinuous penalty functions. Hence, it provides an alternative to the conventional drift-plus-penalty (DPP) algorithm for the Lyapunov optimization. The proposed DRL-based approach is applied to resource allocation in edge computing systems with queue stability and numerical results demonstrate its successful operation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
