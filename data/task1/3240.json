Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 69 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling Social Readers: Novel Tools for Addressing Reception from Online Book Reviews\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Readers’ responses to literature have received scant attention in computational literary studies. The rise of social media offers an opportunity to capture a segment of these responses while data-driven analysis of these responses can provide new critical insight into how people “read”. Posts discussing an individual book on Goodreads, a social media platform that hosts user discussions of popular literature, are referred to as “reviews”, and consist of plot summaries, opinions, quotes, or some mixture of these. Since these reviews are written by readers, computationally modeling them allows one to discover the overall non-professional discussion space about a work, including an aggregated summary of the work’s plot, an implicit ranking of the importance of events, and the readers’ impressions of main characters. We develop a pipeline of interlocking computational tools to extract a representation of this reader-generated shared narrative model. Using a corpus of reviews of five popular novels, we discover the readers’ distillation of the main storylines in a novel, their understanding of the relative importance of characters, as well as the readers’ varying impressions of these characters. In so doing, we make three important contributions to the study of infinite-vocabulary networks: (i) an automatically derived narrative network that includes meta-actants; (ii) a new sequencing algorithm, REV2SEQ, that generates a consensus sequence of events based on partial trajectories aggregated from the reviews; and (iii) a new “impressions” algorithm, SENT2IMP, that provides finer, non-trivial and multi-modal insight into readers’ opinions of characters.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 69 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 69\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
