Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: On Leveraging Variational Graph Embeddings for Open World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Humans are able to identify and categorize novel compositions of known concepts. The task in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL) is to learn composition of primitive concepts, i.e. objects and states, in such a way that even their novel compositions can be zero-shot classified. In this work, we do not assume any prior knowledge on the feasibility of novel compositions i.e.open-world setting, where infeasible compositions dominate the search space. We propose a Compositional Variational Graph Autoencoder (CVGAE) approach for learning the variational embeddings of the primitive concepts (nodes) as well as feasibility of their compositions (via edges). Such modelling makes CVGAE scalable to real-world application scenarios. This is in contrast to SOTA method, CGE (cge, ), which is computationally very expensive. e.g.for benchmark C-GQA dataset, CGE requires 3.94×1053.94E53.94\\text{\\times}{10}^{5} nodes, whereas CVGAE requires only 1323 nodes. We learn a mapping of the graph and image embeddings onto a common embedding space. CVGAE adopts a deep metric learning approach and learns a similarity metric in this space via bi-directional contrastive loss between projected graph and image embeddings. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on three benchmark datasets.We also demonstrate via an image retrieval task that the representations learnt by CVGAE are better suited for compositional generalization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
