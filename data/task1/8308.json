Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty Calibration for Counterfactual Propensity Estimation in Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recommendation systems, a large portion of the ratings are missing due to the selection biases, which is known as Missing Not At Random. The counterfactual inverse propensity scoring (IPS) was used to weight the imputation error of every observed rating. Although effective in multiple scenarios, we argue that the performance of IPS estimation is limited due to the uncertainty miscalibration of propensity estimation. In this paper, we propose the uncertainty calibration for the propensity estimation in recommendation systems with multiple representative uncertainty calibration techniques. Theoretical analysis on the bias and generalization bound shows the superiority of the calibrated IPS estimator over the uncalibrated one. Experimental results on the coat and yahoo datasets shows that the uncertainty calibration is improved and hence brings the better recommendation results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
