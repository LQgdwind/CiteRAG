Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: INTERPOLATION OF SUBDIVISION FEATURES FOR CURVED GEOMETRY MODELING\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a nodal interpolation method to approximate a subdivision model. The main application is to model and represent curved geometry without gaps and preserving the required simulation intent. Accordingly, we devise the technique to maintain the necessary sharp features and smooth the indicated ones. This sharp-to-smooth modeling capability handles unstructured configurations of the simulation points, curves, and surfaces. The surfaces correspond to initial linear triangulations that determine the sharp point and curve features. The method automatically suggests a subset of sharp features to smooth which the user modifies to obtain a limit model preserving the initial points. This model reconstructs the curvature by subdivision of the initial mesh, with no need of an underlying curved geometry model. Finally, given a polynomial degree and a nodal distribution, the method generates a piece-wise polynomial representation interpolating the limit model. We show numerical evidence that this approximation, naturally aligned to the subdivision features, converges to the model geometrically with the polynomial degree for nodal distributions with sub-optimal Lebesgue constant. We also apply the method to prescribe the curved boundary of a high-order volume mesh. We conclude that our sharp-to-smooth modeling capability leads to curved geometry representations with enhanced preservation of the simulation intent.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
