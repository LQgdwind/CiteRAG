Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 63 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generation of microbial colonies dataset with deep learning style transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce an effective strategy to generate an annotated synthetic dataset of microbiological images of Petri dishes that can be used to train deep learning models in a fully supervised fashion. The developed generator employs traditional computer vision algorithms together with a neural style transfer method for data augmentation. We show that the method is able to synthesize a dataset of realistic looking images that can be used to train a neural network model capable of localising, segmenting, and classifying five different microbial species. Our method requires significantly fewer resources to obtain a useful dataset than collecting and labeling a whole large set of real images with annotations. We show that starting with only 100 real images, we can generate data to train a detector that achieves comparable results (detection mAP =0.416absent0.416=0.416, and counting MAE =4.49absent4.49=4.49) to the same detector but trained on a real, several dozen times bigger dataset (mAP =0.520absent0.520=0.520, MAE =4.31absent4.31=4.31), containing over 7k images. We prove the usefulness of the method in microbe detection and segmentation, but we expect that it is general and flexible and can also be applicable in other domains of science and industry to detect various objects.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
