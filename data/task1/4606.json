      "content": "Paper Title: AuxAdapt: Stable and Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Temporally Consistent Video Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In video segmentation, generating temporally consistent results across frames is as important as achieving frame-wise accuracy. Existing methods rely either on optical flow regularization or fine-tuning with test data to attain temporal consistency. However, optical flow is not always avail-able and reliable. Besides, it is expensive to compute. Fine-tuning the original model in test time is cost sensitive. This paper presents an efficient, intuitive, and unsupervised online adaptation method, AuxAdapt, for improving the temporal consistency of most neural network models. It does not require optical flow and only takes one pass of the video. Since inconsistency mainly arises from the modelâ€™s uncertainty in its output, we propose an adaptation scheme where the model learns from its own segmentation decisions as it streams a video, which allows producing more confident and temporally consistent labeling for similarly-looking pixels across frames. For stability and efficiency, we leverage a small auxiliary segmentation network (AuxNet) to assist with this adaptation. More specifically, AuxNet readjusts the decision of the original segmentation network (Main-Net) by adding its own estimations to that of MainNet. At every frame, only AuxNet is updated via back-propagation while keeping MainNet fixed. We extensively evaluate our test-time adaptation approach on standard video benchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and KITTI. The results demonstrate that our approach provides label-wise accurate, temporally consistent, and computationally efficient adaptation (5+ folds overhead reduction comparing to state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
