Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Ultrasound Scanning Skills from Human Demonstrations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, the robotic ultrasound system has become an emerging topic owing to the widespread use of medical ultrasound. However, it is still a challenging task to model and to transfer the ultrasound skill from an ultrasound physician. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework to acquire ultrasound scanning skills from human demonstrations. First, the ultrasound scanning skills are encapsulated into a high-dimensional multi-modal model in terms of interactions among ultrasound images, the probe pose and the contact force. The parameters of the model are learned using the data collected from skilled sonographers’ demonstrations. Second, a sampling-based strategy is proposed with the learned model to adjust the extracorporeal ultrasound scanning process to guide a newbie sonographer or a robot arm. Finally, the robustness of the proposed framework is validated with the experiments on real data from sonographers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
