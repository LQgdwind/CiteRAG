      "content": "Paper Title: Difficulty-Net: Learning to Predict Difficulty for Long-Tailed Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Long-tailed datasets, where head classes comprise much more training samples than tail classes, cause recognition models to get biased towards the head classes. Weighted loss is one of the most popular ways of mitigating this issue, and a recent work has suggested that class-difficulty might be a better clue than conventionally used class-frequency to decide the distribution of weights. A heuristic formulation was used in the previous work for quantifying the difficulty, but we empirically find that the optimal formulation varies depending on the characteristics of datasets. Therefore, we propose Difficulty-Net, which learns to predict the difficulty of classes using the modelâ€™s performance in a meta-learning framework. To make it learn reasonable difficulty of a class within the context of other classes, we newly introduce two key concepts, namely the relative difficulty and the driver loss. The former helps Difficulty-Net take other classes into account when calculating difficulty of a class, while the latter is indispensable for guiding the learning to a meaningful direction. Extensive experiments on popular long-tailed datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-tailed datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
