Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SurvTRACE: Transformers for Survival Analysis with Competing Events\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In medicine, survival analysis studies the time duration to events of interest such as mortality. One major challenge is how to deal with multiple competing events (e.g., multiple disease diagnoses). In this work, we propose a transformer-based model that does not make the assumption for the underlying survival distribution and is capable of handling competing events, namely SurvTRACE. We account for the implicit confounders in the observational setting in multi-events scenarios, which causes selection bias as the predicted survival probability is influenced by irrelevant factors. To sufficiently utilize the survival data to train transformers from scratch, multiple auxiliary tasks are designed for multi-task learning. The model hence learns a strong shared representation from all these tasks and in turn serves for better survival analysis. We further demonstrate how to inspect the covariate relevance and importance through interpretable attention mechanisms of SurvTRACE, which suffices to great potential in enhancing clinical trial design and new treatment development. Experiments on METABRIC, SUPPORT, and SEER data with 470k patients validate the all-around superiority of our method. Software is available at https://github.com/RyanWangZf/SurvTRACE.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
