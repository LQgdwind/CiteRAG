Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Identity Testing for Radical Expressions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We study the Radical Identity Testing problem (RIT): Given an algebraic circuit representing a polynomial f∈ℤ​[x1,…,xk]𝑓ℤsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘f\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{k}] and nonnegative integers a1,…,aksubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘a_{1},\\dots,a_{k} and d1,…,subscript𝑑1…d_{1},\\dots, dksubscript𝑑𝑘d_{k}, written in binary, test whether the polynomial vanishes at the real radicals a1d1,…,akdksubscript𝑑1subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑑𝑘subscript𝑎𝑘\\sqrt[d_{1}]{a_{1}},\\dots,\\sqrt[d_{k}]{a_{k}}, i.e., test whether f​(a1d1,…,akdk)=0𝑓subscript𝑑1subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑑𝑘subscript𝑎𝑘0f(\\sqrt[d_{1}]{a_{1}},\\dots,\\sqrt[d_{k}]{a_{k}})=0. We place the problem in coNP assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), improving on the straightforward PSPACE upper bound obtained by reduction to the existential theory of reals. Next we consider a restricted version, called 222-RIT, where the radicals are square roots of prime numbers, written in binary. It was known since the work of Chen and Kao [16] that 222-RIT is at least as hard as the polynomial identity testing problem, however no better upper bound than PSPACE was known prior to our work. We show that 222-RIT is in coRP assuming GRH and in coNP unconditionally. Our proof relies on theorems from algebraic and analytic number theory, such as the Chebotarev density theorem and quadratic reciprocity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
