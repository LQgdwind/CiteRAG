Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploitation of material consolidation trade-offs in multi-tier complex supply networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While consolidation strategies form the backbone of many supply chain optimisation problems, exploitation of multi-tier material relationships through consolidation remains an understudied area, despite being a prominent feature of industries that produce complex made-to-order products. In this paper, we propose an optimisation framework for exploiting multi-to-multi relationship between tiers of a supply chain. The resulting formulation is flexible such that quantity discounts, inventory holding, and transport costs can be included. The framework introduces a new trade-off between tiers, leading to cost reductions in one tier but increased costs in the other, which helps to reduce the overall procurement cost in the supply chain. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed and tested with a range of small to large-scale test problems from aerospace manufacturing. Our comparison to benchmark results shows that there is indeed a cost trade-off between two tiers, and that its reduction can be achieved using a holistic approach to reconfiguration. Costs are decreased when second tier fixed ordering costs and the number of machining options increase. Consolidation results in reduced inventory holding costs in all scenarios. Several secondary effects such as simplified supplier selection may also be observed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
