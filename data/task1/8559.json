Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Augmentation-based Domain Generalization for Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and domain generalization (DG) are two research areas that aim to tackle the lack of generalization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) towards unseen domains. While UDA methods have access to unlabeled target images, domain generalization does not involve any target data and only learns generalized features from a source domain. Image-style randomization or augmentation is a popular approach to improve network generalization without access to the target domain. Complex methods are often proposed that disregard the potential of simple image augmentations for out-of-domain generalization. For this reason, we systematically study the in- and out-of-domain generalization capabilities of simple, rule-based image augmentations like blur, noise, color jitter and many more. Based on a full factorial design of experiment design we provide a systematic statistical evaluation of augmentations and their interactions. Our analysis provides both, expected and unexpected, outcomes. Expected, because our experiments confirm the common scientific standard that combination of multiple different augmentations outperforms single augmentations. Unexpected, because combined augmentations perform competitive to state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches, while being significantly simpler and without training overhead. On the challenging synthetic-to-real domain shift between Synthia and Cityscapes we reach 39.5% mIoU compared to 40.9% mIoU of the best previous work. When additionally employing the recent vision transformer architecture DAFormer we outperform these benchmarks with a performance of 44.2% mIoU.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
