Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: LIGHTEN: Learning Interactions with Graph and Hierarchical TEmporal Networks for HOI in videos\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Analyzing the interactions between humans and objects from a video includes identification of the relationships between humans and the objects present in the video. It can be thought of as a specialized version of Visual Relationship Detection, wherein one of the objects must be a human. While traditional methods formulate the problem as inference on a sequence of video segments, we present a hierarchical approach, LIGHTEN, to learn visual features to effectively capture spatio-temporal cues at multiple granularities in a video. Unlike current approaches, LIGHTEN avoids using ground truth data like depth maps or 3D human pose, thus increasing generalization across non-RGBD datasets as well. Furthermore, we achieve the same using only the visual features, instead of the commonly used hand-crafted spatial features. We achieve state-of-the-art results in human-object interaction detection (88.9% and 92.6%) and anticipation tasks of CAD-120 and competitive results on image based HOI detection in V-COCO dataset, setting a new benchmark for visual features based approaches. Code for LIGHTEN is available at https://github.com/praneeth11009/LIGHTEN-Learning-Interactions-with-Graphs-and-Hierarchical-TEmporal-Networks-for-HOI\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
