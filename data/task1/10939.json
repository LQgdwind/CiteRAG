      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Algorithms in a Superposition of Spacetimes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize our ability to process information. The advancement from classical to quantum computing is a product of our advancement from classical to quantum physics – the more our understanding of the universe grows, so does our ability to use it for computation. A natural question that arises is, what will physics allow in the future? Can more advanced theories of physics increase our computational power, beyond quantum computing? An active field of research in physics studies theoretical phenomena outside the scope of explainable quantum mechanics, that form when attempting to combine Quantum Mechanics (QM) with General Relativity (GR) into a unified theory of Quantum Gravity (QG). One expected phenomenon in QG is quantum uncertainty in the structure of spacetime: QM and GR together may imply that spacetime can be in superposition of curvatures. Under GR, gravitational time dilation asserts that the geometry of spacetime determines the order of events occurring. Accordingly, a superposition of curvatures is known to present the possibility of a superposition of event orderings. In the literature of quantum information theory, the most natural model for a superposition of event orders, is a superposition of unitary evolution orders: For unitaries U0subscript𝑈0U_{0}, U1subscript𝑈1U_{1} and state |ψ⟩ket𝜓|{\\psi}\\rangle, execution in a superposition of orders aims to generate the normalization of the state U1​U0⋅|ψ⟩+U0​U1⋅|ψ⟩⋅subscript𝑈1subscript𝑈0ket𝜓⋅subscript𝑈0subscript𝑈1ket𝜓U_{1}U_{0}\\cdot|{\\psi}\\rangle+U_{0}U_{1}\\cdot|{\\psi}\\rangle. Costa (Quantum 2022) proves that a model with such power cannot produce a valid process matrix (a generalization of standard quantum processes), and leaves the analysis of any relaxation of the model as an open question. In this work we show a first example of a natural computational model based on QG, that provides an exponential speedup over standard quantum computation (under standard hardness assumptions). Formally, we define a relaxation of the previous model of superposition of unitary orders, where we do allow the generation of the state U1​U0⋅|ψ⟩+U0​U1⋅|ψ⟩⋅subscript𝑈1subscript𝑈0ket𝜓⋅subscript𝑈0subscript𝑈1ket𝜓U_{1}U_{0}\\cdot|{\\psi}\\rangle+U_{0}U_{1}\\cdot|{\\psi}\\rangle, but with computational complexity inversely proportional to the state’s norm (unlike the previous model, considering unconditional generation). We further provide physical intuition and assumptions behind our model. We show that a quantum computer with the ability to create a superposition of unitary orders is able to solve in polynomial time two fundamental problems in computer science: The Graph Isomorphism Problem (𝖦𝖨𝖦𝖨\\mathsf{GI}) and the Gap Closest Vector Problem (𝖦𝖺𝗉𝖢𝖵𝖯𝖦𝖺𝗉𝖢𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{GapCVP}), with gap O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O\\left(n^{2}\\right). These problems are believed by experts to be hard to solve for a regular quantum computer. Interestingly, our model does not seem overpowered, and we found no obvious way to solve entire complexity classes that are considered hard in computer science, like the classes NP and SZK. As part of our work we develop a new parameterization technique for the invertibility of classical circuits, which raises new questions in the analysis of probability distributions and induces a new parameter for hardness inside the complexity class SZK. These new techniques are independent of any non-classical computation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
