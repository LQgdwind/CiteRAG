Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Biological Neuronal Correlations with Quantum Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Understanding of how biological neural networks process information is one of the biggest open scientific questions of our time. Advances in machine learning and artificial neural networks have enabled the modeling of neuronal behavior, but classical models often require a large number of parameters, complicating interpretability. Quantum computing offers an alternative approach through quantum machine learning, which can achieve efficient training with fewer parameters. In this work, we introduce a quantum generative model framework for generating synthetic data that captures the spatial and temporal correlations of biological neuronal activity. Our model demonstrates the ability to achieve reliable outcomes with fewer trainable parameters compared to classical methods. These findings highlight the potential of quantum generative models to provide new tools for modeling and understanding neuronal behavior, offering a promising avenue for future research in neuroscience.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
