      "content": "Paper Title: Noise Stability Regularization for Improving BERT Fine-tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Fine-tuning pre-trained language models such as BERT has become a common practice dominating leaderboards across various NLP tasks. Despite its recent success and wide adoption, this process is unstable when there are only a small number of training samples available. The brittleness of this process is often reflected by the sensitivity to random seeds. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem based on the noise stability property of deep nets, which is investigated in recent literature Arora et al. (2018); Sanyal et al. (2020). Specifically, we introduce a novel and effective regularization method to improve fine-tuning on NLP tasks, referred to as Layer-wise Noise Stability Regularization (LNSR). We extend the theories about adding noise to the input and prove that our method gives a stabler regularization effect. We provide supportive evidence by experimentally confirming that well-performing models show a low sensitivity to noise and fine-tuning with LNSR exhibits clearly higher generalizability and stability. Furthermore, our method also demonstrates advantages over other state-of-the-art algorithms including L2superscriptL2\\text{L}^{2}-SP Li et al. (2018), Mixout Lee et al. (2020) and SMART Jiang et al. (2020).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
