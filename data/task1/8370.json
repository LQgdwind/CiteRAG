Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Implicit Visual Bias Mitigation by Posterior Estimate Sharpening of a Bayesian Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The fairness of a deep neural network is strongly affected by dataset bias and spurious correlations, both of which are usually present in modern feature-rich and complex visual datasets. Due to the difficulty and variability of the task, no single de-biasing method has been universally successful. In particular, implicit methods not requiring explicit knowledge of bias variables are especially relevant for real-world applications. We propose a novel implicit mitigation method using a Bayesian neural network, allowing us to leverage the relationship between epistemic uncertainties and the presence of bias or spurious correlations in a sample. Our proposed posterior estimate sharpening procedure encourages the network to focus on core features that do not contribute to high uncertainties. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bayesian networks with sharpened posterior estimates perform comparably to prior existing methods and show potential worthy of further exploration.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
