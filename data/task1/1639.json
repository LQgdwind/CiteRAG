Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Beneficial Perturbation Network for designing general adaptive artificial intelligence systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The human brain is the gold standard of adaptive learning. It not only can learn and benefit from experience, but also can adapt to new situations. In contrast, deep neural networks only learn one sophisticated but fixed mapping from inputs to outputs. This limits their applicability to more dynamic situations, where the input to output mapping may change with different contexts. A salient example is continual learning - learning new independent tasks sequentially without forgetting previous tasks. Continual learning of multiple tasks in artificial neural networks using gradient descent leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereby a previously learned mapping of an old task is erased when learning new mappings for new tasks. Here, we propose a new biologically plausible type of deep neural network with extra, out-of-network, task-dependent biasing units to accommodate these dynamic situations. This allows, for the first time, a single network to learn potentially unlimited parallel input to output mappings, and to switch on the fly between them at runtime. Biasing units are programmed by leveraging beneficial perturbations (opposite to well-known adversarial perturbations) for each task. Beneficial perturbations for a given task bias the network toward that task, essentially switching the network into a different mode to process that task. This largely eliminates catastrophic interference between tasks. Our approach is memory-efficient and parameter-efficient, can accommodate many tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across different tasks and domains.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
