Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Integrating Symmetry into Differentiable Planning with Steerable Convolutions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we study a principled approach on incorporating group symmetry into end-to-end differentiable planning algorithms and explore the benefits of symmetry in planning. To achieve this, we draw inspiration from equivariant convolution networks and model the path planning problem as a set of signals over grids. We demonstrate that value iteration can be treated as a linear equivariant operator, which is effectively a steerable convolution. Building upon Value Iteration Networks (VIN), we propose a new Symmetric Planning (SymPlan) framework that incorporates rotation and reflection symmetry using steerable convolution networks. We evaluate our approach on four tasks: 2D navigation, visual navigation, 2 degrees of freedom (2-DOF) configuration space manipulation, and 2-DOF workspace manipulation. Our experimental results show that our symmetric planning algorithms significantly improve training efficiency and generalization performance compared to non-equivariant baselines, including VINs and GPPN.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
