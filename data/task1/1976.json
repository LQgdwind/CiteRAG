Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Solver for Quasi-Periodic 2D-Helmholtz Scattering in Layered MediaThis work was partially funded by Fondecyt Regular 1171491 and by grants Conicyt-PFCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2017-21171791 and 2017-21171479.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a fast spectral Galerkin scheme for the discretization of boundary integral equations arising from two-dimensional Helmholtz transmission problems in multi-layered periodic structures or gratings. Employing suitably parametrized Fourier basis and excluding Rayleigh-Wood anomalies, we rigorously establish the well-posedness of both continuous and discrete problems, and prove super-algebraic error convergence rates for the proposed scheme. Through several numerical examples, we confirm our findings and show performances competitive to those attained via Nyström methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
