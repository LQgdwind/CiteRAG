Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Tackling Visual Control via Multi-View Exploration Maximization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present MEM: Multi-view Exploration Maximization for tackling complex visual control tasks. To the best of our knowledge, MEM is the first approach that combines multi-view representation learning and intrinsic reward-driven exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, MEM first extracts the specific and shared information of multi-view observations to form high-quality features before performing RL on the learned features, enabling the agent to fully comprehend the environment and yield better actions. Furthermore, MEM transforms the multi-view features into intrinsic rewards based on entropy maximization to encourage exploration. As a result, MEM can significantly promote the sample-efficiency and generalization ability of the RL agent, facilitating solving real-world problems with high-dimensional observations and spare-reward space. We evaluate MEM on various tasks from DeepMind Control Suite and Procgen games. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that MEM can achieve superior performance and outperform the benchmarking schemes with simple architecture and higher efficiency.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
