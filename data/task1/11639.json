Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Non-Traditional Approach to Assisting Data Address Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes a novel way to assist conventional data address translation. The approach, PC-Indexed Data Address Translation (PCAX), uses the PC of a load instruction, and not a data virtual address, to obtain the page table entry (PTE) for the data accessed by a load instruction. PCAX is intended to be used for a small subset of the static loads in a program. We observe that: (i) a small subset of static loads is responsible for most of the misses in a data translation lookaside buffer (DTLB), and (ii) often a dynamic instance of a static load instruction accesses the same PTE as the last dynamic instance, and consider PCAX for this subset. With PCAX the effective miss rate of a conventional DTLB can be cut down by a factor of 2-3X in many cases, and even more in some cases. PCAX is also beneficial in reducing the number of secondary TLB (STLB) misses. Since the tables used for PCAX can be accessed alongside instruction fetch, they can be slow, yet frequently provide a valid PTE even before the data address calculation. This results in a performance improvement, and reduced data address translation energy, in most cases.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
