Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 65 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sequential Learning in the Dense Associative Memory\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Sequential learning involves learning tasks in a sequence, and proves challenging for most neural networks. Biological neural networks regularly conquer the sequential learning challenge and are even capable of transferring knowledge both forward and backwards between tasks. Artificial neural networks often totally fail to transfer performance between tasks, and regularly suffer from degraded performance or catastrophic forgetting on previous tasks. Models of associative memory have been used to investigate the discrepancy between biological and artificial neural networks due to their biological ties and inspirations, of which the Hopfield network is perhaps the most studied model. The Dense Associative Memory, or modern Hopfield network, generalizes the Hopfield network, allowing for greater capacities and prototype learning behaviors, while still retaining the associative memory structure. We investigate the performance of the Dense Associative Memory in sequential learning problems, and benchmark various sequential learning techniques in the network. We give a substantial review of the sequential learning space with particular respect to the Hopfield network and associative memories, as well as describe the techniques we implement in detail. We also draw parallels between the classical and Dense Associative Memory in the context of sequential learning, and discuss the departures from biological inspiration that may influence the utility of the Dense Associative Memory as a tool for studying biological neural networks. We present our findings, and show that existing sequential learning methods can be applied to the Dense Associative Memory to improve sequential learning performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper.
