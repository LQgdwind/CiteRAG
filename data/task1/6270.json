      "content": "Paper Title: TCJA-SNN: Temporal-Channel Joint Attention for Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting widespread interest due to their biological plausibility, energy efficiency, and powerful spatio-temporal information representation ability. Given the critical role of attention mechanisms in enhancing neural network performance, the integration of SNNs and attention mechanisms exhibits tremendous potential to deliver energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. In this paper, we present a novel Temporal-Channel Joint Attention mechanism for SNNs, referred to as TCJA-SNN. The proposed TCJA-SNN framework can effectively assess the significance of spike sequence from both spatial and temporal dimensions. More specifically, our essential technical contribution lies on: 1) We employ the squeeze operation to compress the spike stream into an average matrix. Then, we leverage two local attention mechanisms based on efficient 1-D convolutions to facilitate comprehensive feature extraction at the temporal and channel levels independently. 2) We introduce the Cross Convolutional Fusion (CCF) layer as a novel approach to model the inter-dependencies between the temporal and channel scopes. This layer effectively breaks the independence of these two dimensions and enables the interaction between features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TCJA-SNN outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by up to 15.7% classification accuracy on all standard static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech 101, and DVS128 Gesture. Furthermore, we effectively apply the TCJA-SNN framework to image generation tasks by leveraging a variation autoencoder. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first instance where the SNN-attention mechanism has been employed for high-level classification and low-level generation tasks. Notably, our approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance in both domains, establishing a significant advancement in the field. Our implementation codes are available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/TCJA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
