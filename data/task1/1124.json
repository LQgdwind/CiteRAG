Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Topic-based Community Search over Spatial-Social Networks (Technical Report)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, the community search problem has attracted significant attention, due to its wide spectrum of real-world applications such as event organization, friend recommendation, advertisement in e-commence, and so on. Given a query vertex, the community search problem finds dense subgraph that contains the query vertex. In social networks, users have multiple check-in locations, influence score, and profile information (keywords). Most previous studies that solve the CS problem over social networks usually neglect such information in a community. In this paper, we propose a novel problem, named community search over spatial-social networks (TCS-SSN), which retrieves community with high social influence, small traveling time, and covering certain keywords. In order to tackle the TCS-SSN problem over the spatial-social networks, we design effective pruning techniques to reduce the problem search space. We also propose an effective indexing mechanism, namely social-spatial index, to facilitate the community query, and develop an efficient query answering algorithm via index traversal. We verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our pruning techniques, indexing mechanism, and query processing algorithm through extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data sets under various parameter settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
