Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Healing Unsafe Dialogue Responses with Weak Supervision Signals\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent years have seen increasing concerns about the unsafe response generation of large-scale dialogue systems, where agents will learn offensive or biased behaviors from the real-world corpus. Some methods are proposed to address the above issue by detecting and replacing unsafe training examples in a pipeline style. Though effective, they suffer from a high annotation cost and adapt poorly to unseen scenarios as well as adversarial attacks. Besides, the neglect of providing safe responses (e.g. simply replacing with templates) will cause the information-missing problem of dialogues. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised pseudo-label sampling method, TEMP, that can automatically assign potential safe responses. Specifically, our TEMP method groups responses into several clusters and samples multiple labels with an adaptively sharpened sampling strategy, inspired by the observation that unsafe samples in the clusters are usually few and distribute in the tail. Extensive experiments in chitchat and task-oriented dialogues show that our TEMP outperforms state-of-the-art models with weak supervision signals and obtains comparable results under unsupervised learning settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
