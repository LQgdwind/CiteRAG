      "content": "Paper Title: Language-Based Causal Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Consider the finite state graph that results from a simple, discrete, dynamical system in which an agent moves in a rectangular grid picking up and dropping packages. Can the state variables of the problem, namely, the agent location and the package locations, be recovered from the structure of the state graph alone without having access to information about the objects, the structure of the states, or any background knowledge? We show that this is possible provided that the dynamics is learned over a suitable domain-independent first-order causal language that makes room for objects and relations that are not assumed to be known. The preference for the most compact representation in the language that is compatible with the data provides a strong and meaningful learning bias that makes this possible. The language of structured causal models (SCMs) is the standard language for representing (static) causal models but in dynamic worlds populated by objects, first-order causal languages such as those used in “classical AI planning” are required. While “classical AI” requires handcrafted representations, similar representations can be learned from unstructured data over the same languages. Indeed, it is the languages and the preference for compact representations in those languages that provide structure to the world, uncovering objects, relations, and causes.∗00footnotetext: The paper was written for a workshop on causal representation learning. A valid criticism of “classical AI”, mentioned in the call, from the perspective of the “new AI” based on deep learning, is that representations should be learned and not handcrafted. One of the aims of the paper was to distinguish representation languages from the actual representations that they support, as it is only the latter that should be learned. Another aim was to emphasize that structural causal models (SCMs) provide one language to talk about causal models but not the only one. Action and planning languages have been used to describe causal models in AI for a long time too. Our attempt, however, was not successful, as the paper was rejected. Not clear if reviewers agreed with these two premises, or found them irrelevant or vacuous. For us, the two premises are direct but their implications, explored in this and other papers, are not.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
