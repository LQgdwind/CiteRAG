      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Quantum-inspired Experience Replay\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, a novel training paradigm inspired by quantum computation is proposed for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with experience replay. In contrast to traditional experience replay mechanism in DRL, the proposed deep reinforcement learning with quantum-inspired experience replay (DRL-QER) adaptively chooses experiences from the replay buffer according to the complexity and the replayed times of each experience (also called transition), to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. In DRL-QER, transitions are first formulated in quantum representations, and then the preparation operation and the depreciation operation are performed on the transitions. In this progress, the preparation operation reflects the relationship between the temporal difference errors (TD-errors) and the importance of the experiences, while the depreciation operation is taken into account to ensure the diversity of the transitions. The experimental results on Atari 2600 games show that DRL-QER outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as DRL-PER and DCRL on most of these games with improved training efficiency, and is also applicable to such memory-based DRL approaches as double network and dueling network.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
