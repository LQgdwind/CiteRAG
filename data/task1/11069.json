      "content": "Paper Title: Semialgebraic Range Stabbing, Ray Shooting, and Intersection Counting in the Plane\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Polynomial partitioning techniques have recently led to improved geometric data structures for a variety of fundamental problems related to semialgebraic range searching and intersection searching in 3D and higher dimensions (e.g., see [Agarwal, Aronov, Ezra, and Zahl, SoCG 2019; Ezra and Sharir, SoCG 2021; Agarwal, Aronov, Ezra, Katz, and Sharir, SoCG 2022]). They have also led to improved algorithms for offline versions of semialgebraic range searching in 2D, via lens-cutting [Sharir and Zahl (2017)]. In this paper, we show that these techniques can yield new data structures for a number of other 2D problems even for online queries: 1. Semialgebraic range stabbing. We present a data structure for n𝑛n semialgebraic ranges in 2D of constant description complexity with O​(n3/2+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛32𝜀O(n^{3/2+\\varepsilon}) preprocessing time and space, so that we can count the number of ranges containing a query point in O​(n1/4+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛14𝜀O(n^{1/4+\\varepsilon}) time, for an arbitrarily small constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. (The query time bound is likely close to tight for this space bound.) 2. Ray shooting amid algebraic arcs. We present a data structure for n𝑛n algebraic arcs in 2D of constant description complexity with O​(n3/2+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛32𝜀O(n^{3/2+\\varepsilon}) preprocessing time and space, so that we can find the first arc hit by a query (straight-line) ray in O​(n1/4+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛14𝜀O(n^{1/4+\\varepsilon}) time. (The query bound is again likely close to tight for this space bound, and they improve a result by Ezra and Sharir with near n3/2superscript𝑛32n^{3/2} space and near n𝑛\\sqrt{n} query time.) 3. Intersection counting amid algebraic arcs. We present a data structure for n𝑛n algebraic arcs in 2D of constant description complexity with O​(n3/2+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛32𝜀O(n^{3/2+\\varepsilon}) preprocessing time and space, so that we can count the number of intersection points with a query algebraic arc of constant description complexity in O​(n1/2+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛12𝜀O(n^{1/2+\\varepsilon}) time. In particular, this implies an O​(n3/2+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛32𝜀O(n^{3/2+\\varepsilon})-time algorithm for counting intersections between two sets of n𝑛n algebraic arcs in 2D. (This generalizes a classical O​(n3/2+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛32𝜀O(n^{3/2+\\varepsilon})-time algorithm for circular arcs by Agarwal and Sharir from SoCG 1991.)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
