Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Reasoning: from State to Transformation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, ignore an important factor, i.e. transformation. They are solely defined to test how well machines understand concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. Such state driven visual reasoning has limitations in reflecting the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has shown to be equally important for human cognition in Piaget’s theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel transformation driven visual reasoning (TVR) task. Given both the initial and final states, the target becomes to infer the corresponding intermediate transformation. Following this definition, a new synthetic dataset namely TRANCE is first constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e. Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Next, we build another real dataset called TRANCO based on COIN, to cover the loss of transformation diversity on TRANCE. Inspired by human reasoning, we propose a three-staged reasoning framework called TranNet, including observing, analyzing, and concluding, to test how recent advanced techniques perform on TVR. Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event, View, and TRANCO. We believe the proposed new paradigm will boost the development of machine visual reasoning. More advanced methods and new problems need to be investigated in this direction. The resource of TVR is available at https://hongxin2019.github.io/TVR/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
