Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On Generalization of Adversarial Imitation Learning and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite massive empirical evaluations, one of the fundamental questions in imitation learning is still not fully settled: does AIL (adversarial imitation learning) provably generalize better than BC (behavioral cloning)? We study this open problem with tabular and episodic MDPs. For vanilla AIL that uses the direct maximum likelihood estimation, we provide both negative and positive answers under the known transition setting. For some MDPs, we show that vanilla AIL has a worse sample complexity than BC. The key insight is that the state-action distribution matching principle is weak so that AIL may generalize poorly even on visited states from the expert demonstrations. For another class of MDPs, vanilla AIL is proved to generalize well even on non-visited states. Interestingly, its sample complexity is horizon-free, which provably beats BC by a wide margin. Finally, we establish a framework in the unknown transition scenario, which allows AIL to explore via reward-free exploration strategies. Compared with the best-known online apprenticeship learning algorithm, the resulting algorithm improves the sample complexity and interaction complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
