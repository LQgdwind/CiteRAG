Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: MM-Point: Multi-View Information-Enhanced Multi-Modal Self-Supervised 3D Point Cloud Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In perception, multiple sensory information is integrated to map visual information from 2D views onto 3D objects, which is beneficial for understanding in 3D environments. But in terms of a single 2D view rendered from different angles, only limited partial information can be provided. The richness and value of Multi-view 2D information can provide superior self-supervised signals for 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised point cloud representation learning method, MM-Point, which is driven by intra-modal and inter-modal similarity objectives. The core of MM-Point lies in the Multi-modal interaction and transmission between 3D objects and multiple 2D views at the same time. In order to more effectively simultaneously perform the consistent cross-modal objective of 2D multi-view information based on contrastive learning, we further propose Multi-MLP and Multi-level Augmentation strategies. Through carefully designed transformation strategies, we further learn Multi-level invariance in 2D Multi-views. MM-Point demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various downstream tasks. For instance, it achieves a peak accuracy of 92.4%percent92.492.4\\% on the synthetic dataset ModelNet40, and a top accuracy of 87.8%percent87.887.8\\% on the real-world dataset ScanObjectNN, comparable to fully supervised methods. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in tasks such as few-shot classification, 3D part segmentation and 3D semantic segmentation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
