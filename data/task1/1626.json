Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reliability-Performance Trade-offs in Neuromorphic Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neuromorphic architectures built with Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) can significantly improve the energy efficiency of machine learning tasks designed with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). A major source of voltage drop in a crossbar of these architectures are the parasitic components on the crossbarâ€™s bitlines and wordlines, which are deliberately made longer to achieve lower cost-per-bit. We observe that the parasitic voltage drops create a significant asymmetry in programming speed and reliability of NVM cells in a crossbar. Specifically, NVM cells that are on shorter current paths are faster to program but have lower endurance than those on longer current paths, and vice versa. This asymmetry in neuromorphic architectures create reliability-performance trade-offs, which can be exploited efficiently using SNN mapping techniques. In this work, we demonstrate such trade-offs using a previously-proposed SNN mapping technique with 10 workloads from contemporary machine learning tasks for a state-of-the art neuromoorphic hardware.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
