Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Anticipatory Planning: Improving Long-Lived Planning by Estimating Expected Cost of Future Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider a service robot in a household environment given a sequence of high-level tasks one at a time. Most existing task planners, lacking knowledge of what they may be asked to do next, solve each task in isolation and so may unwittingly introduce side effects that make subsequent tasks more costly. In order to reduce the overall cost of completing all tasks, we consider that the robot must anticipate the impact its actions could have on future tasks. Thus, we propose anticipatory planning: an approach in which estimates of the expected future cost, from a graph neural network, augment model-based task planning. Our approach guides the robot towards behaviors that encourage preparation and organization, reducing overall costs in long-lived planning scenarios. We evaluate our method on blockworld environments and show that our approach reduces the overall planning costs by 5% as compared to planning without anticipatory planning. Additionally, if given an opportunity to prepare the environment in advance (a special case of anticipatory planning), our planner improves overall cost by 11%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
