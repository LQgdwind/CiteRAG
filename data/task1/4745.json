      "content": "Paper Title: FinRL-Podracer: High Performance and Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Quantitative Finance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Machine learning techniques are playing more and more important roles in finance market investment. However, finance quantitative modeling with conventional supervised learning approaches has a number of limitations, including the difficulty in defining appropriate labels, lack of consistency in modeling and trading execution, and lack of modeling the dynamic nature of the finance market. The development of deep reinforcement learning techniques is partially addressing these issues. Unfortunately, the steep learning curve and the difficulty in quick modeling and agile development are impeding finance researchers from using deep reinforcement learning in quantitative trading. In this paper, we propose an RLOps in finance paradigm and present a FinRL-Podracer framework to accelerate the development pipeline of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven trading strategy and to improve both trading performance and training efficiency. FinRL-Podracer is a cloud solution that features high performance and high scalability and promises continuous training, continuous integration, and continuous delivery of DRL-driven trading strategies, facilitating a rapid transformation from algorithmic innovations into a profitable trading strategy. First, we propose a generational evolution mechanism with an ensemble strategy to improve the trading performance of a DRL agent, and schedule the training of a DRL algorithm onto a GPU cloud via multi-level mapping. Then, we carry out the training of DRL components with high-performance optimizations on GPUs. Finally, we evaluate the FinRL-Podracer framework for a stock trend prediction task on an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD cloud. FinRL-Podracer outperforms three popular DRL libraries Ray RLlib, Stable Baseline 3 and FinRL, i.e., 12%∼35%similar-topercent12percent3512\\%\\sim 35\\% improvements in annual return, 0.1∼0.6similar-to0.10.60.1\\sim 0.6 improvements in Sharpe ratio and 3×∼7×3\\times\\sim 7\\times speed-up in training time. We show the high scalability by training a trading agent in 101010 minutes with 808080 A100 GPUs, on NASDAQ-100 constituent stocks with minute-level data over 101010 years.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
