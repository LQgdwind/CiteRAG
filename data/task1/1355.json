Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking of the Image Salient Object Detection: Object-level Semantic Saliency Re-ranking First, Pixel-wise Saliency Refinement Latter\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The real human attention is an interactive activity between our visual system and our brain, using both low-level visual stimulus and high-level semantic information. Previous image salient object detection (SOD) works conduct their saliency predictions in a multi-task manner, i.e., performing pixel-wise saliency regression and segmentation-like saliency refinement at the same time, which degenerates their feature backbones in revealing semantic information. However, given an image, we tend to pay more attention to those regions which are semantically salient even in the case that these regions are perceptually not the most salient ones at first glance. In this paper, we divide the SOD problem into two sequential tasks: 1) we propose a lightweight, weakly supervised deep network to coarsely locate those semantically salient regions first; 2) then, as a post-processing procedure, we selectively fuse multiple off-the-shelf deep models on these semantically salient regions as the pixel-wise saliency refinement. In sharp contrast to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that focus on learning pixel-wise saliency in “single image” using perceptual clues mainly, our method has investigated the “object-level semantic ranks between multiple images”, of which the methodology is more consistent with the real human attention mechanism. Our method is simple yet effective, which is the first attempt to consider the salient object detection mainly as an object-level semantic re-ranking problem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
