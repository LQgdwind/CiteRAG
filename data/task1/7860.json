Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Molecular Geometry-aware Transformer for accurate 3D Atomic System modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Molecular dynamic simulations are important in computational physics, chemistry, material, and biology. Machine learning-based methods have shown strong abilities in predicting molecular energy and properties and are much faster than DFT calculations. Molecular energy is at least related to atoms, bonds, bond angles, torsion angles, and nonbonding atom pairs. Previous Transformer models only use atoms as inputs which lack explicit modeling of the aforementioned factors. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Moleformer, a novel Transformer architecture that takes nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds and nonbonding atom pairs) as inputs and models the interactions among them using rotational and translational invariant geometry-aware spatial encoding. Proposed spatial encoding calculates relative position information including distances and angles among nodes and edges. We benchmark Moleformer on OC20 and QM9 datasets, and our model achieves state-of-the-art on the initial state to relaxed energy prediction of OC20 and is very competitive in QM9 on predicting quantum chemical properties compared to other Transformer and Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods which proves the effectiveness of the proposed geometry-aware spatial encoding in Moleformer.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
