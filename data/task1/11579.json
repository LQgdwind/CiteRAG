Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Longest cycles in vertex-transitive and highly connected graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We present progress on two old conjectures about longest cycles in graphs. The first conjecture, due to Thomassen from 1978, states that apart from a finite number of exceptions, all connected vertex-transitive graphs contain a Hamiltonian cycle. The second conjecture, due to Smith from 1984, states that for r‚â•2ùëü2r\\geq 2 in every rùëür-connected graph any two longest cycles intersect in at least rùëür vertices. In this paper, we prove a new lemma about the intersection of longest cycles in a graph which can be used to improve the best known bounds towards both of the aforementioned conjectures: First, we show that every connected vertex-transitive graph on n‚â•3ùëõ3n\\geq 3 vertices contains a cycle of length at least Œ©‚Äã(n13/21)Œ©superscriptùëõ1321\\Omega(n^{13/21}), improving on Œ©‚Äã(n3/5)Œ©superscriptùëõ35\\Omega(n^{3/5}) from [De Vos, arXiv:2302:04255, 2023]. Second, we show that in every rùëür-connected graph with r‚â•2ùëü2r\\geq 2, any two longest cycles meet in at least Œ©‚Äã(r5/8)Œ©superscriptùëü58\\Omega(r^{5/8}) vertices, improving on Œ©‚Äã(r3/5)Œ©superscriptùëü35\\Omega(r^{3/5}) from [Chen, Faudree and Gould, J. Combin. Theory, Ser. B, 1998]. Our proof combines combinatorial arguments, computer-search and linear programming.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
