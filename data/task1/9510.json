Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: U-CE: Uncertainty-aware Cross-Entropy for Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep neural networks have shown exceptional performance in various tasks, but their lack of robustness, reliability, and tendency to be overconfident pose challenges for their deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. In this regard, quantifying the uncertainty inherent to a model’s prediction is a promising endeavour to address these shortcomings. In this work, we present a novel Uncertainty-aware Cross-Entropy loss (U-CE) that incorporates dynamic predictive uncertainties into the training process by pixel-wise weighting of the well-known cross-entropy loss (CE). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the superiority of U-CE over regular CE training on two benchmark datasets, Cityscapes and ACDC, using two common backbone architectures, ResNet-18 and ResNet-101. With U-CE, we manage to train models that not only improve their segmentation performance but also provide meaningful uncertainties after training. Consequently, we contribute to the development of more robust and reliable segmentation models, ultimately advancing the state-of-the-art in safety-critical applications and beyond. 111Code will be made available once the publication process is complete.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
