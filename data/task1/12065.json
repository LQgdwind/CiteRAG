Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Lower Bounds for all Odd-Query Locally Decodable Codes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We prove that for every odd q⩾3𝑞3q\\geqslant 3, any q𝑞q-query binary, possibly non-linear locally decodable code (q𝑞q-LDC) E:{±1}k→{±1}n:𝐸→superscriptplus-or-minus1𝑘superscriptplus-or-minus1𝑛E:\\{\\pm 1\\}^{k}\\rightarrow\\{\\pm 1\\}^{n} must satisfy k⩽O~​(n1−2/q)𝑘~𝑂superscript𝑛12𝑞k\\leqslant\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-2/q}). For even q𝑞q, this bound was established in a sequence of works [KT00, GKST06, KW04]. For q=3𝑞3q=3, the above bound was achieved in a recent work [AGKM23] using an argument that crucially exploits known exponential lower bounds for 222-LDCs. Their strategy hits an inherent bottleneck for q⩾5𝑞5q\\geqslant 5. Our key insight is identifying a general sufficient condition on the hypergraph of local decoding sets called t𝑡t-approximate strong regularity. This condition demands that 1) the number of hyperedges containing any given subset of vertices of size t𝑡t (i.e., its co-degree) be equal to the same but arbitrary value dtsubscript𝑑𝑡d_{t} up to a multiplicative constant slack, and 2) all other co-degrees be upper-bounded relative to dtsubscript𝑑𝑡d_{t}. This condition significantly generalizes related proposals in prior works [GKM22, HKM23, AGKM23, HKM+24] that demand absolute upper bounds on all co-degrees. We give an argument based on spectral bounds on Kikuchi Matrices that lower bounds the blocklength of any LDC whose local decoding sets satisfy t𝑡t-approximate strong regularity for any t⩽q𝑡𝑞t\\leqslant q. Crucially, unlike prior works, our argument works despite having no non-trivial absolute upper bound on the co-degrees of any set of vertices. To apply our argument to arbitrary q𝑞q-LDCs, we give a new, greedy, approximate strong regularity decomposition that shows that arbitrary, dense enough hypergraphs can be partitioned (up to a small error) into approximately strongly regular pieces satisfying the required relative bounds on the co-degrees.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
