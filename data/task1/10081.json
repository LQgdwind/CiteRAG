      "content": "Paper Title: GD2-NeRF: Generative Detail Compensation via GAN and Diffusion for One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we focus on the One-shot Novel View Synthesis (O-NVS) task which targets synthesizing photo-realistic novel views given only one reference image per scene. Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (OG-NeRF) methods solve this task in an inference-time finetuning-free manner, yet suffer the blurry issue due to the encoder-only architecture that highly relies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent diffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious per-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD2-NeRF, a Generative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both inference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details. In detail, following a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD2-NeRF is mainly composed of a One-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer (Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model into the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue with in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a good balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at the fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion models to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D consistency. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that GD2-NeRF noticeably improves the details while without per-scene finetuning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
