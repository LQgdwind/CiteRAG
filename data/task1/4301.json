Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Compressed Oblivious Encoding for Homomorphically Encrypted Search\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables a simple, attractive framework for secure search. Compared to other secure search systems, no costly setup procedure is necessary; it is sufficient for the client merely to upload the encrypted database to the server. Confidentiality is provided because the server works only on the encrypted query and records. While the search functionality is enabled by the full homomorphism of the encryption scheme. For this reason, researchers have been paying increasing attention to this problem. Since Akavia et al. (CCS 2018) presented a framework for secure search on FHE encrypted data and gave a working implementation called SPiRiT, several more efficient realizations have been proposed. In this paper, we identify the main bottlenecks of this framework and show how to significantly improve the performance of FHE-base secure search. In particular, ‚Ä¢ To retrieve ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell matching items, the existing framework needs to repeat the protocol ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell times sequentially. In our new framework, all matching items are retrieved in parallel in a single protocol execution. ‚Ä¢ The most recent work by Wren et al. (CCS 2020) requires O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n) multiplications to compute the first matching index. Our solution requires no homomorphic multiplication, instead using only additions and scalar multiplications to encode all matching indices. ‚Ä¢ Our implementation and experiments show that to fetch 16 matching records, our system gives an 1800X speed-up over the state of the art in fetching the query results resulting in a 26X speed-up for the full search functionality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
