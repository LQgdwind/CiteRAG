Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding Time Variations of DNN Inference in Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in autonomous driving due to their high accuracy for perception, decision, and control. In safety-critical systems like autonomous driving, executing tasks like sensing and perception in real-time is vital to the vehicle’s safety, which requires the application’s execution time to be predictable. However, non-negligible time variations are observed in DNN inference. Current DNN inference studies either ignore the time variation issue or rely on the scheduler to handle it. None of the current work explains the root causes of DNN inference time variations. Understanding the time variations of the DNN inference becomes a fundamental challenge in real-time scheduling for autonomous driving. In this work, we analyze the time variation in DNN inference in fine granularity from six perspectives: data, I/O, model, runtime, hardware, and end-to-end perception system. Six insights are derived in understanding the time variations for DNN inference.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
