      "content": "Paper Title: Larger Corner-Free Sets from Combinatorial Degenerations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract There is a large and important collection of Ramsey-type combinatorial problems, closely related to central problems in complexity theory, that can be formulated in terms of the asymptotic growth of the size of the maximum independent sets in powers of a fixed small (directed or undirected) hypergraph, also called the Shannon capacity. An important instance of this is the corner problem studied in the context of multiparty communication complexity in the Number On the Forehead (NOF) model (and other important instances are the cap set problem in additive combinatorics and the USP capacity problem in the complexity theory of matrix multiplication). Versions of this problem and the NOF connection have seen much interest (and progress) in recent works of Linial, Pitassi and Shraibman (ITCS 2019) and Linial and Shraibman (CCC 2021). We introduce and study a general algebraic method for lower bounding the Shannon capacity of directed hypergraphs via combinatorial degenerations, a combinatorial kind of “approximation” of subgraphs that originates from the study of matrix multiplication in algebraic complexity theory (and which play an important role there) but which we use in a novel way. Using the combinatorial degeneration method, we make progress on the corner problem by explicitly constructing a corner-free subset in 𝔽2n×𝔽2nsuperscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n} of size Ω​(3.39n/poly​(n))Ωsuperscript3.39𝑛poly𝑛\\Omega(3.39^{n}/\\mathrm{poly}(n)), which improves the previous lower bound Ω​(2.82n)Ωsuperscript2.82𝑛\\Omega(2.82^{n}) of Linial, Pitassi and Shraibman (ITCS 2019) and which gets us closer to the best upper bound 4n−o​(n)superscript4𝑛𝑜𝑛4^{n-o(n)}. Our new construction of corner-free sets implies an improved NOF protocol for the Eval problem. In the Eval problem over a group G𝐺G, three players need to determine whether their inputs x1,x2,x3∈Gsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3𝐺x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\in G sum to zero. We find that the NOF communication complexity of the Eval problem over 𝔽2nsuperscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n} is at most 0.24​n+𝒪​(log⁡n)0.24𝑛𝒪𝑛0.24n+\\mathcal{O}(\\log n), which improves the previous upper bound 0.5​n+𝒪​(log⁡n)0.5𝑛𝒪𝑛0.5n+\\mathcal{O}(\\log n). Finally, we investigate the existing tensor methods for upper bounding the Shannon capacity (including slice rank, subrank, analytic rank, geometric rank, and G-stable rank). We find that these methods have strong limitations caused by the existence of large induced matchings. In particular, this implies a strong barrier for these methods to prove nontrivial upper bounds for the corner problem over any group G𝐺G (and in particular for G=𝔽2n𝐺superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛G=\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n} to get an upper bound below 4n−o​(n)superscript4𝑛𝑜𝑛4^{n-o(n)}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
