Existing research is dominated by its time-invariant solving methods, but lacks proposed theories for solving its time-variant version. Moreover, artificial neural networks are rarely studied for solving CCME. In this paper, starting with the earliest CCME, zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) is applied to solve its time-variant version. Firstly, the vectorization and Kronecker product in the complex field are defined uniformly. Secondly, Con-CZND1 model and Con-CZND2 model are proposed and theoretically prove convergence and effectiveness. Thirdly, three numerical experiments are designed to illustrate the effectiveness of the two models, compare their differences, highlight the significance of neural dynamics in the complex field, and refine the theory related to ZND.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
