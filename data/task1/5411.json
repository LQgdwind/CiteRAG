Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: VLAD-VSA: Cross-Domain Face Presentation Attack Detection with Vocabulary Separation and Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. For face presentation attack detection (PAD), most of the spoofing cues are subtle, local image patterns (e.g., local image distortion, 3D mask edge and cut photo edges). The representations of existing PAD works with simple global pooling method, however, lose the local feature discriminability. In this paper, the VLAD aggregation method is adopted to quantize local features with visual vocabulary locally partitioning the feature space, and hence preserve the local discriminability. We further propose the vocabulary separation and adaptation method to modify VLAD for cross-domain PAD task. The proposed vocabulary separation method divides vocabulary into domain-shared and domain-specific visual words to cope with the diversity of live and attack faces under the cross-domain scenario. The proposed vocabulary adaptation method imitates the maximization step of the k-means algorithm in the end-to-end training, which guarantees the visual words be close to the center of assigned local features and thus brings robust similarity measurement. We give illustrations and extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VLAD with the proposed vocabulary separation and adaptation method on standard cross-domain PAD benchmarks. The codes are available at https://github.com/Liubinggunzu/VLAD-VSA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
