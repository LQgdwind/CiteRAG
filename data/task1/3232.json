Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: VECA : A Toolkit for Building Virtual Environments to Train and Test Human-like Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Building human-like agent, which aims to learn and think like human intelligence, has long been an important research topic in AI. To train and test human-like agents, we need an environment that imposes the agent to rich multimodal perception and allows comprehensive interactions for the agent, while also easily extensible to develop custom tasks. However, existing approaches do not support comprehensive interaction with the environment or lack variety in modalities. Also, most of the approaches are difficult or even impossible to implement custom tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel VR-based toolkit, VECA, which enables building fruitful virtual environments to train and test human-like agents. In particular, VECA provides a humanoid agent and an environment manager, enabling the agent to receive rich human-like perception and perform comprehensive interactions. To motivate VECA, we also provide 24 interactive tasks, which represent (but are not limited to) four essential aspects in early human development: joint-level locomotion and control, understanding contexts of objects, multimodal learning, and multi-agent learning. To show the usefulness of VECA on training and testing human-like learning agents, we conduct experiments on VECA and show that users can build challenging tasks for engaging human-like algorithms, and the features supported by VECA are critical on training human-like agents.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
