Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: EPIC: Graph Augmentation with Edit Path Interpolation via Learnable Cost\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph-based models have become increasingly important in various domains, but the limited size and diversity of existing graph datasets often limit their performance. To address this issue, we propose EPIC (Edit Path Interpolation via learnable Cost), a novel interpolation-based method for augmenting graph datasets. Our approach leverages graph edit distance to generate new graphs that are similar to the original ones but exhibit some variation in their structures. To achieve this, we learn the graph edit distance through a comparison of labeled graphs and utilize this knowledge to create graph edit paths between pairs of original graphs. With randomly sampled graphs from a graph edit path, we enrich the training set to enhance the generalization capability of classification models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms existing augmentation methods in graph classification tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
