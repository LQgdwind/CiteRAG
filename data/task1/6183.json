Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Attention-based Representations from Multiple Patterns for Relation Prediction in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge bases, and their representations in the form of knowledge graphs (KGs), are naturally incomplete. Since scientific and industrial applications have extensively adopted them, there is a high demand for solutions that complete their information. Several recent works tackle this challenge by learning embeddings for entities and relations, then employing them to predict new relations among the entities. Despite their aggrandizement, most of those methods focus only on the local neighbors of a relation to learn the embeddings. As a result, they may fail to capture the KGs’ context information by neglecting long-term dependencies and the propagation of entities’ semantics. In this manuscript, we propose ÆMP (Attention-based Embeddings from Multiple Patterns), a novel model for learning contextualized representations by: (i) acquiring entities context information through an attention-enhanced message-passing scheme, which captures the entities local semantics while focusing on different aspects of their neighborhood; and (ii) capturing the semantic context, by leveraging the paths and their relationships between entities. Our empirical findings draw insights into how attention mechanisms can improve entities’ context representation and how combining entities and semantic path contexts improves the general representation of entities and the relation predictions. Experimental results on several large and small knowledge graph benchmarks show that ÆMP either outperforms or competes with state-of-the-art relation prediction methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
