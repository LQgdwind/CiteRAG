Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distantly supervised end-to-end medical entity extraction from electronic health records with human-level quality\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Medical entity extraction (EE) is a standard procedure used as a first stage in medical texts processing. Usually Medical EE is a two-step process: named entity recognition (NER) and named entity normalization (NEN). We propose a novel method of doing medical EE from electronic health records (EHR) as a single-step multi-label classification task by fine-tuning a transformer model pretrained on a large EHR dataset. Our model is trained end-to-end in an distantly supervised manner using targets automatically extracted from medical knowledge base. We show that our model learns to generalize for entities that are present frequently enough, achieving human-level classification quality for most frequent entities. Our work demonstrates that medical entity extraction can be done end-to-end without human supervision and with human quality given the availability of a large enough amount of unlabeled EHR and a medical knowledge base.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
