      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Accuracy and Scalability: Combining Isogeometric Analysis with Deflation to Obtain Scalable Convergence for the Helmholtz Equation.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract [Abstract]Finding fast yet accurate numerical solutions to the Helmholtz equation remains a challenging task. The pollution error (i.e. the discrepancy between the numerical and analytical wave number kùëòk) requires the mesh resolution to be kept fine enough to obtain accurate solutions. A recent study showed that the use of Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) for the spatial discretization significantly reduces the pollution error. However, solving the resulting linear systems by means of a direct solver remains computationally expensive when large wave numbers or multiple dimensions are considered. An alternative lies in the use of (preconditioned) Krylov subspace methods. Recently, the use of the exact Complex Shifted Laplacian Preconditioner (CSLP) with a small complex shift has shown to lead to wave number independent convergence while obtaining more accurate numerical solutions using IgA. In this paper, we propose the use of deflation techniques combined with an approximated inverse of the CSLP using a geometric multigrid method. Numerical results obtained for both one- and two-dimensional model problems, including constant and non-constant wave numbers, show scalable convergence with respect to the wave number and approximation order pùëùp of the spatial discretization. Furthermore, when k‚Äãhùëò‚Ñékh is kept constant, the proposed approach leads to a significant reduction of the computational time compared to the use of the exact inverse of the CSLP with a small shift.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
