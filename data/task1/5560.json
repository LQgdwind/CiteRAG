Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Decoupled Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract State-of-the-art distillation methods are mainly based on distilling deep features from intermediate layers, while the significance of logit distillation is greatly overlooked. To provide a novel viewpoint to study logit distillation, we reformulate the classical KD loss into two parts, i.e., target class knowledge distillation (TCKD) and non-target class knowledge distillation (NCKD). We empirically investigate and prove the effects of the two parts: TCKD transfers knowledge concerning the “difficulty” of training samples, while NCKD is the prominent reason why logit distillation works. More importantly, we reveal that the classical KD loss is a coupled formulation, which (1) suppresses the effectiveness of NCKD and (2) limits the flexibility to balance these two parts. To address these issues, we present Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), enabling TCKD and NCKD to play their roles more efficiently and flexibly. Compared with complex feature-based methods, our DKD achieves comparable or even better results and has better training efficiency on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets for image classification and object detection tasks. This paper proves the great potential of logit distillation, and we hope it will be helpful for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/mdistiller.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
