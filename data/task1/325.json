      "content": "Paper Title: TopologyGAN: Topology Optimization Using Generative Adversarial Networks Based on Physical Fields Over the Initial Domain\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In topology optimization using deep learning, load and boundary conditions represented as vectors or sparse matrices often miss the opportunity to encode a rich view of the design problem, leading to less than ideal generalization results. We propose a new data-driven topology optimization model called TopologyGAN that takes advantage of various physical fields computed on the original, unoptimized material domain, as inputs to the generator of a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). Compared to a baseline cGAN, TopologyGAN achieves a nearly 3×3\\times reduction in the mean squared error and a 2.5×2.5\\times reduction in the mean absolute error on test problems involving previously unseen boundary conditions. Built on several existing network models, we also introduce a hybrid network called U-SE(Squeeze-and-Excitation)-ResNet for the generator that further increases the overall accuracy. We publicly share our full implementation and trained network. Keywords: TopologyGAN, Deep Learning, Topology Optimization, U-SE-ResNet, Physical Fields\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
