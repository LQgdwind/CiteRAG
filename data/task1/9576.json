Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Co-attention Graph Pooling for Efficient Pairwise Graph Interaction Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be effective in processing and learning from graph-structured data. However, previous works mainly focused on understanding single graph inputs while many real-world applications require pair-wise analysis for graph-structured data (e.g., scene graph matching, code searching, and drug-drug interaction prediction). To this end, recent works have shifted their focus to learning the interaction between pairs of graphs. Despite their improved performance, these works were still limited in that the interactions were considered at the node-level, resulting in high computational costs and suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel and efficient graph-level approach for extracting interaction representations using co-attention in graph pooling. Our method, Co-Attention Graph Pooling (CAGPool), exhibits competitive performance relative to existing methods in both classification and regression tasks using real-world datasets, while maintaining lower computational complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
