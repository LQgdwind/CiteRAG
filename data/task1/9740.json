Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: LongDanceDiff: Long-term Dance Generation with Conditional Diffusion Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Dancing with music is always an essential human art form to express emotion. Due to the high temporal-spacial complexity, long-term 3D realist dance generation synchronized with music is challenging. Existing methods suffer from the freezing problem when generating long-term dances due to error accumulation and training-inference discrepancy. To address this, we design a conditional diffusion model, LongDanceDiff, for this sequence-to-sequence long-term dance generation, addressing the challenges of temporal coherency and spatial constraint. LongDanceDiff contains a transformer-based diffusion model, where the input is a concatenation of music, past motions, and noised future motions. This partial noising strategy leverages the full-attention mechanism and learns the dependencies among music and past motions. To enhance the diversity of generated dance motions and mitigate the freezing problem, we introduce a mutual information minimization objective that regularizes the dependency between past and future motions. We also address common visual quality issues in dance generation, such as foot sliding and unsmooth motion, by incorporating spatial constraints through a Global-Trajectory Modulation (GTM) layer and motion perceptual losses, thereby improving the smoothness and naturalness of motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in our approach over the existing state-of-the-art methods. We plan to release our codes and models soon.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
