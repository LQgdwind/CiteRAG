Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum state testing with restricted measurements\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study quantum state testing where the goal is to test whether œÅ=œÅ0‚àà‚ÑÇd√ódùúåsubscriptùúå0superscript‚ÑÇùëëùëë\\rho=\\rho_{0}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{d\\times d} or ‚ÄñœÅ‚àíœÅ0‚Äñ1>Œµsubscriptnormùúåsubscriptùúå01ùúÄ\\|\\rho-\\rho_{0}\\|_{1}>\\varepsilon, given nùëõn copies of œÅùúå\\rho and a known state description œÅ0subscriptùúå0\\rho_{0}. In practice, not all measurements can be easily applied, even using unentangled measurements where each copy is measured separately. We develop an information-theoretic framework that yields unified copy complexity lower bounds for restricted families of non-adaptive measurements through a novel measurement information channel. Using this framework, we obtain the optimal bounds for a natural family of kùëòk-outcome measurements with fixed and randomized schemes. We demonstrate a separation between these two schemes, showing the power of randomized measurement schemes over fixed ones. Previously, little was known for fixed schemes, and tight bounds were only known for randomized schemes with k‚â•dùëòùëëk\\geq d and Pauli observables, a special class of 2-outcome measurements. Our work bridges this gap in the literature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
