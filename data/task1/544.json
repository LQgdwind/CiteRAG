Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scaling through abstractions – high-performance vectorial wave simulations for seismic inversion with Devito\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Devito is an open-source Python project based on domain-specific language and compiler technology. Driven by the requirements of rapid HPC applications development in exploration seismology, the language and compiler have evolved significantly since inception. Sophisticated boundary conditions, tensor contractions, sparse operations and features such as staggered grids and sub-domains are all supported; operators of essentially arbitrary complexity can be generated. To accommodate this flexibility whilst ensuring performance, data dependency analysis is utilized to schedule loops and detect computational-properties such as parallelism. In this article, the generation and simulation of MPI-parallel propagators (along with their adjoints) for the pseudo-acoustic wave-equation in tilted transverse isotropic media and the elastic wave-equation are presented. Simulations are carried out on industry scale synthetic models in a HPC Cloud system and reach a performance of 28TFLOP/s, hence demonstrating Devito’s suitability for production-grade seismic inversion problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
