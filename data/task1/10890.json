Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Two-Stage Recommender Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Production-grade recommender systems rely heavily on a large-scale corpus used by online media services, including Netflix, Pinterest, and Amazon. These systems enrich recommendations by learning users’ and items’ embeddings projected in a low-dimensional space with two-stage models (two deep neural networks), which facilitate their embedding constructs to predict users’ feedback associated with items. Despite its popularity for recommendations, its theoretical behaviors remain comprehensively unexplored. We study the asymptotic behaviors of the two-stage recommender that entail a strong convergence to the optimal recommender system. We establish certain theoretical properties and statistical assurance of the two-stage recommender. In addition to asymptotic behaviors, we demonstrate that the two-stage recommender system attains faster convergence by relying on the intrinsic dimensions of the input features. Finally, we show numerically that the two-stage recommender enables encapsulating the impacts of items’ and users’ attributes on ratings, resulting in better performance compared to existing methods conducted using synthetic and real-world data experiments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
