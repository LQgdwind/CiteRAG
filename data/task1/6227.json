      "content": "Paper Title: Lattice Convolutional Networks for Learning Ground States of Quantum Many-Body Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning methods have been shown to be effective in representing ground-state wave functions of quantum many-body systems. Existing methods use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for square lattices due to their image-like structures. For non-square lattices, existing method uses graph neural network (GNN) in which structure information is not precisely captured, thereby requiring additional hand-crafted sublattice encoding. In this work, we propose lattice convolutions in which a set of proposed operations are used to convert non-square lattices into grid-like augmented lattices on which regular convolution can be applied. Based on the proposed lattice convolutions, we design lattice convolutional networks (LCN) that use self-gating and attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance on par or better than existing methods on spin 1/2 J1subscriptùêΩ1J_{1}-J2subscriptùêΩ2J_{2} Heisenberg model over the square, honeycomb, triangular, and kagome lattices while without using hand-crafted encoding.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
