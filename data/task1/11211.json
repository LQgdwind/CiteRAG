Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Certifying Euclidean Sections and Finding Planted Sparse Vectors Beyond the √𝑛 Dimension Threshold\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the task of certifying that a random d𝑑d-dimensional subspace X𝑋X in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} is well-spread — every vector x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X satisfies c​n​‖x‖2⩽‖x‖1⩽n​‖x‖2𝑐𝑛subscriptnorm𝑥2subscriptnorm𝑥1𝑛subscriptnorm𝑥2c\\sqrt{n}\\|x\\|_{2}\\leqslant\\|x\\|_{1}\\leqslant\\sqrt{n}\\|x\\|_{2}. In a seminal work, Barak et. al. [BBH+12] showed a polynomial-time certification algorithm when d⩽O​(n)𝑑𝑂𝑛d\\leqslant O(\\sqrt{n}). On the other hand, when d≫nmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑛d\\gg\\sqrt{n}, the certification task is information-theoretically possible but there is evidence that it is computationally hard [MW21, Cd22], a phenomenon known as the information-computation gap. In this paper, we give subexponential-time certification algorithms in the d≫nmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑛d\\gg\\sqrt{n} regime. Our algorithm runs in time exp⁡(O~​(nε))~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜀\\exp(\\widetilde{O}(n^{\\varepsilon})) when d⩽O~​(n1+ε2)𝑑~𝑂superscript𝑛1𝜀2d\\leqslant\\widetilde{O}(n^{\\frac{1+\\varepsilon}{2}}), establishing a smooth trade-off between runtime and the dimension. Our techniques naturally extend to the related planted problem, where the task is to recover a sparse vector planted in a random subspace. Our algorithm achieves the same runtime and dimension trade-off for this task.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
