Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A unified framework for dataset shift diagnostics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Supervised learning techniques typically assume training data originates from the target population. Yet, in reality, dataset shift frequently arises, which, if not adequately taken into account, may decrease the performance of their predictors. In this work, we propose a novel and flexible framework called DetectShift111Our implementation for DetectShift can be found in https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/detectshift. that quantifies and tests for multiple dataset shifts, encompassing shifts in the distributions of (ùêó,Y)ùêóùëå(\\mathbf{X},Y), ùêóùêó\\mathbf{X}, YùëåY, ùêó|Yconditionalùêóùëå\\mathbf{X}|Y, and Y|ùêóconditionalùëåùêóY|\\mathbf{X}. DetectShift equips practitioners with insights into data shifts, facilitating the adaptation or retraining of predictors using both source and target data. This proves extremely valuable when labeled samples in the target domain are limited. The framework utilizes test statistics with the same nature to quantify the magnitude of the various shifts, making results more interpretable. It is versatile, suitable for regression and classification tasks, and accommodates diverse data forms‚Äîtabular, text, or image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DetectShift in detecting dataset shifts even in higher dimensions222Corresponding author: Felipe Maia Polo ¬°felipemaiapolo@gmail.com¬ø..\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
