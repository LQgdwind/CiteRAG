      "content": "Paper Title: Hopcroft’s Problem, Log-Star Shaving, 2D Fractional Cascading, and Decision Trees1footnote 11footnote 1A preliminary version of this paper has appeared in Proc. 33rd ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), pages 190–210, 2022.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We revisit Hopcroft’s problem and related fundamental problems about geometric range searching. Given n𝑛n points and n𝑛n lines in the plane, we show how to count the number of point-line incidence pairs or the number of point-above-line pairs in O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) time, which matches the conjectured lower bound and improves the best previous time bound of n4/3​2O​(log∗⁡n)superscript𝑛43superscript2𝑂superscript𝑛n^{4/3}2^{O(\\log^{*}n)} obtained almost 30 years ago by Matoušek. We describe two interesting and different ways to achieve the result: the first is randomized and uses a new 2D version of fractional cascading for arrangements of lines; the second is deterministic and uses decision trees in a manner inspired by the sorting technique of Fredman (1976). The second approach extends to any constant dimension. Many consequences follow from these new ideas: for example, we obtain an O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3})-time algorithm for line segment intersection counting in the plane, O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3})-time randomized algorithms for distance selection in the plane and bichromatic closest pair and Euclidean minimum spanning tree in three or four dimensions, and a randomized data structure for halfplane range counting in the plane with O​(n4/3)𝑂superscript𝑛43O(n^{4/3}) preprocessing time and space and O​(n1/3)𝑂superscript𝑛13O(n^{1/3}) query time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 69 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 69\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
