      "content": "Paper Title: An automatic-adaptivity stabilized finite element method via residual minimization for heterogeneous, anisotropic advection-diffusion-reaction problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we describe a stable finite element formulation for advection-diffusion-reaction problems that allows for robust automatic adaptive strategies to be easily implemented. We consider locally vanishing, heterogeneous, and anisotropic diffusivities, as well as advection-dominated diffusion problems. The general stabilized finite element framework was described and analyzed in [1] for linear problems in general, and tested for pure advection problems. The method seeks for the discrete solution through a residual minimization process on a proper stable discontinuous Galerkin (dG) dual norm. This technique leads to a saddle-point problem that delivers a stable discrete solution and a robust error estimate that can drive mesh adaptivity. In this work, we demonstrate the efficiency of the method in extreme scenarios, delivering stable solutions. The quality and performance of the solutions are comparable to classical discontinuous Galerkin formulations in the respective discrete space norm on each mesh. Meanwhile, this technique allows us to solve on coarse meshes and adapt the solution to achieve a user-specified solution quality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
