      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerated Stochastic Gradient-free and Projection-free Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the paper, we propose a class of accelerated stochastic gradient-free and projection-free (a.k.a., zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe) methods to solve the constrained stochastic and finite-sum nonconvex optimization. Specifically, we propose an accelerated stochastic zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe (Acc-SZOFW) method based on the variance reduced technique of SPIDER/SpiderBoost and a novel momentum accelerated technique. Moreover, under some mild conditions, we prove that the Acc-SZOFW has the function query complexity of O​(d​n​ϵ−2)𝑂𝑑𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ2O(d\\sqrt{n}\\epsilon^{-2}) for finding an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-stationary point in the finite-sum problem, which improves the exiting best result by a factor of O​(n​ϵ−2)𝑂𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ2O(\\sqrt{n}\\epsilon^{-2}), and has the function query complexity of O​(d​ϵ−3)𝑂𝑑superscriptitalic-ϵ3O(d\\epsilon^{-3}) in the stochastic problem, which improves the exiting best result by a factor of O​(ϵ−1)𝑂superscriptitalic-ϵ1O(\\epsilon^{-1}). To relax the large batches required in the Acc-SZOFW, we further propose a novel accelerated stochastic zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe (Acc-SZOFW*) based on a new variance reduced technique of STORM, which still reaches the function query complexity of O​(d​ϵ−3)𝑂𝑑superscriptitalic-ϵ3O(d\\epsilon^{-3}) in the stochastic problem without relying on any large batches. In particular, we present an accelerated framework of the Frank-Wolfe methods based on the proposed momentum accelerated technique. The extensive experimental results on black-box adversarial attack and robust black-box classification demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
