Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Log-linear Gradient Descent Algorithm for Unbalanced Binary Classification using the All Pairs Squared Hinge Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are plots of true positive rate versus false positive rate which are used to evaluate binary classification algorithms. Because the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a constant function of the predicted values, learning algorithms instead optimize convex relaxations which involve a sum over all pairs of labeled positive and negative examples. Naïve learning algorithms compute the gradient in quadratic time, which is too slow for learning using large batch sizes. We propose a new functional representation of the square loss and squared hinge loss, which results in algorithms that compute the gradient in either linear or log-linear time, and makes it possible to use gradient descent learning with large batch sizes. In our empirical study of supervised binary classification problems, we show that our new algorithm can achieve higher test AUC values on imbalanced data sets than previous algorithms, and make use of larger batch sizes than were previously feasible.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
