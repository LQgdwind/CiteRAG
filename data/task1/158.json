Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 65 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: PULSE: Optical Circuit Switched Data Center Architecture Operating at Nanosecond Timescales\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce PULSE, a sub-Œºùúá\\mus optical circuit switched data centre network architecture controlled by distributed hardware schedulers. PULSE is a flat architecture that uses parallel passive coupler-based broadcast and select networks. We employ a novel transceiver architecture, for dynamic wavelength-timeslot selection, to achieve a reconfiguration time down to O(100ps), establishing timeslots of O(10ns). A novel scheduling algorithm that has a clock period of 2.3ns performs multiple iterations to maximize throughput, wavelength usage and reduce latency, enhancing the overall performance. In order to scale, the single-hop PULSE architecture uses sub-networks that are disjoint by using multiple transceivers for each node in 64 node racks. At the reconfiguration circuit duration (epoch = 120 ns), the scheduling algorithm is shown to achieve up to 93% throughput and 100% wavelength usage of 64 wavelengths, incurring an average latency that ranges from 0.7-1.2 Œºùúá\\mus with best-case 0.4 Œºùúá\\mus median and 5 Œºùúá\\mus tail latency, limited by the timeslot (20 ns) and epoch size (120 ns). We show how the 4096-node PULSE architecture allows up to 260k optical channels to be re-used across sub-networks achieving a capacity of 25.6 Pbps with an energy consumption of 82 pJ/bit when using coherent receiver.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
