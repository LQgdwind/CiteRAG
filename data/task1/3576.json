Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Generative-Contrastive Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Unsupervised representation learning has recently received lots of interest due to its powerful generalizability through effectively leveraging large-scale unlabeled data. There are two prevalent approaches for this, contrastive learning and generative pre-training, where the former learns representations from instance-wise discrimination tasks and the latter learns them from estimating the likelihood. These seemingly orthogonal approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses. Contrastive learning tends to extract semantic information and discards details irrelevant for classifying objects, making the representations effective for discriminative tasks while degrading robustness to out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, the generative pre-training directly estimates the data distribution, so the representations tend to be robust but not optimal for discriminative tasks. In this paper, we show that we could achieve the best of both worlds by a hybrid training scheme. Specifically, we demonstrated that a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture trained with both contrastive and generative losses can learn highly discriminative and robust representations without hurting the generative performance. We extensively validate our approach on various tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/kakaobrain/gcrl.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
