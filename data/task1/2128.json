      "content": "Paper Title: A Boundary Regression Model for Nested Named Entity Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recognizing named entities (NEs) is commonly conducted as a classification problem that predicts a class tag for a word or a NE candidate in a sentence. In shallow structures, categorized features are weighted to support the prediction. Recent developments in neural networks have adopted deep structures that map categorized features into continuous representations. This approach unfolds a dense space saturated with high-order abstract semantic information, where the prediction is based on distributed feature representations. In this paper, positions of NEs in a sentence are represented as continuous values. Then, a regression operation is introduced to regress boundaries of NEs in a sentence. Based on boundary regression, we design a boundary regression model to support nested NE recognition. It is a multiobjective learning framework, which simultaneously predicts the classification score of a NE candidate and refine its spatial location in a sentence. It has the advantage to resolve nested NEs and support boundary regression for locating NEs in a sntence. By sharing parameters for predicting and locating, this model enables more potent nonlinear function approximators to enhance model discriminability. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for nested NE recognition111Our codes to implement the BR model are available at: https://github.com/wuyuefei3/BR..\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
