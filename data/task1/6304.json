Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Guided Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Monte Carlo Critic Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The class of deep deterministic off-policy algorithms is effectively applied to solve challenging continuous control problems. However, current approaches use random noise as a common exploration method that has several weaknesses, such as a need for manual adjusting on a given task and the absence of exploratory calibration during the training process. We address these challenges by proposing a novel guided exploration method that uses a differential directional controller to incorporate scalable exploratory action correction. An ensemble of Monte Carlo Critics that provides exploratory direction is presented as a controller. The proposed method improves the traditional exploration scheme by changing exploration dynamically. We then present a novel algorithm exploiting the proposed directional controller for both policy and critic modification. The presented algorithm outperforms modern reinforcement learning algorithms across a variety of problems from DMControl suite.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
