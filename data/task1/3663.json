Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: QFCNN: Quantum Fourier Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The neural network and quantum computing are both significant and appealing fields, with their interactive disciplines promising for large-scale computing tasks that are untackled by conventional computers. However, both developments are restricted by the scope of the hardware development. Nevertheless, many neural network algorithms had been proposed before GPUs become powerful enough for running very deep models. Similarly, quantum algorithms can also be proposed as knowledge reserve before real quantum computers are easily accessible. Specifically, taking advantage of both the neural networks and quantum computation and designing quantum deep neural networks (QDNNs) for acceleration on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors is also an important research problem. As one of the most widely used neural network architectures, covolutional neural network (CNN) remains to be accelerated by quantum mechanisms, with only a few attempts have been demonstrated. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid quantum-classical circuit, namely Quantum Fourier Convolutional Network (QFCN). Our model achieves exponential speed-up compared with classical CNN theoretically and improves over the existing best result of quantum CNN. We demonstrate the potential of this architecture by applying it on different deep learning tasks, including traffic prediction and image classification.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
