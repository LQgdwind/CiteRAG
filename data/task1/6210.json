Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: FibeRed: Fiberwise Dimensionality Reduction of Topologically Complex Data with Vector Bundles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Datasets with non-trivial large scale topology can be hard to embed in low-dimensional Euclidean space with existing dimensionality reduction algorithms. We propose to model topologically complex datasets using vector bundles, in such a way that the base space accounts for the large scale topology, while the fibers account for the local geometry. This allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the fibers, while preserving the large scale topology. We formalize this point of view and, as an application, we describe a dimensionality reduction algorithm based on topological inference for vector bundles. The algorithm takes as input a dataset together with an initial representation in Euclidean space, assumed to recover part of its large scale topology, and outputs a new representation that integrates local representations obtained through local linear dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate this algorithm on examples coming from dynamical systems and chemistry. In these examples, our algorithm is able to learn topologically faithful embeddings of the data in lower target dimension than various well known metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
