Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exponential tractability of ùêø‚ÇÇ-approximation with function values\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We study the complexity of high-dimensional approximation in the L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}-norm when different classes of information are available; we compare the power of function evaluations with the power of arbtirary continuous linear measurements. Here, we discuss the situation when the number of linear measurements required to achieve an error Œµ‚àà(0,1)ùúÄ01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1) in dimension d‚àà‚Ñïùëë‚Ñïd\\in\\mathbb{N} depends only poly-logarithmically on Œµ‚àí1superscriptùúÄ1\\varepsilon^{-1}. This corresponds to an exponential order of convergence of the approximation error, which often happens in applications. However, it does not mean that the high-dimensional approximation problem is easy, the main difficulty usually lies within the dependence on the dimension dùëëd. We determine to which extent the required amount of information changes if we allow only function evaluation instead of arbitrary linear information. It turns out that in this case we only lose very little, and we can even restrict to linear algorithms. In particular, several notions of tractability hold simultaneously for both types of available information. Keywords.
