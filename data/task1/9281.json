      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Optimal Effective Resistance Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We provide new algorithms and conditional hardness for the problem of estimating effective resistances in n𝑛n-node, m𝑚m-edge, undirected, expander graphs. We provide an O~​(m​ϵ−1)~𝑂𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ1\\widetilde{O}(m\\epsilon^{-1})-time algorithm that produces with high probability, an O~​(n​ϵ−1)~𝑂𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ1\\widetilde{O}(n\\epsilon^{-1})-bit sketch from which the effective resistance between any pair of nodes can be estimated, to (1±ϵ)plus-or-minus1italic-ϵ(1\\pm\\epsilon)-multiplicative accuracy, in O~​(1)~𝑂1\\widetilde{O}(1)-time. Consequently, we obtain an O~​(m​ϵ−1)~𝑂𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ1\\widetilde{O}(m\\epsilon^{-1})-time algorithm for estimating the effective resistance of all edges in such graphs, improving (for sparse graphs) on the previous fastest runtimes of O~​(m​ϵ−3/2)~𝑂𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ32\\widetilde{O}(m\\epsilon^{-3/2}) [1] and O~​(n2​ϵ−1)~𝑂superscript𝑛2superscriptitalic-ϵ1\\widetilde{O}(n^{2}\\epsilon^{-1}) [2] for general graphs and O~​(m+n​ϵ−2)~𝑂𝑚𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\widetilde{O}(m+n\\epsilon^{-2}) for expanders [3]. We complement this result by showing a conditional lower bound that a broad set of algorithms for computing such estimates of the effective resistances between all pairs of nodes require Ω~​(n2​ϵ−1/2)~Ωsuperscript𝑛2superscriptitalic-ϵ12\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{2}\\epsilon^{-1/2})-time, improving upon the previous best such lower bound of Ω~​(n2​ϵ−1/13)~Ωsuperscript𝑛2superscriptitalic-ϵ113\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{2}\\epsilon^{-1/13}) [4]. Further, we leverage the tools underlying these results to obtain improved algorithms and conditional hardness for more general problems of sketching the pseudoinverse of positive semidefinite matrices and estimating functions of their eigenvalues.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
