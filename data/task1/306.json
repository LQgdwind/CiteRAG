Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Modified Bee Colony optimization algorithm for computational parameter identification for pore scale transport in periodic porous media\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper discusses an optimization method called Modified Bee Colony algorithm (MBC) based on a particular intelligent behavior of honeybee swarms. The algorithm was checked in a few benchmarks like Shekel, Rozenbroke, Himmelblau and Rastrigin functions, then was applied to parameter identification for reactive flow problems in periodic porous media. The simulation results show that the performance and efficiency of MBC algorithm are comparable to the other parameter identification methods and strategies, at the same time it is able to better capture local minima for the considered class of problems. The proposed identification approach is applicable for different geometries (random and periodic) and for a range of process parameters. In this paper the potential of the approach is demonstrated in identifying parameters of Langmuir isotherm for low Peclet and high Damkoler numbers reactive flow in a 2D periodic porous media with circular inclusions. Finite element approximation in space and implicit time discretization are exploited.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
