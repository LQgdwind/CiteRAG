Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty estimation for time series forecasting via Gaussian process regression surrogates\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Machine learning models are widely used to solve real-world problems in science and industry. To build robust models, we should quantify the uncertainty of the model’s predictions on new data. This study proposes a new method for uncertainty estimation based on the surrogate Gaussian process model. Our method can equip any base model with an accurate uncertainty estimate produced by a separate surrogate. Compared to other approaches, the estimate remains computationally effective with training only one additional model and doesn’t rely on data-specific assumptions. The only requirement is the availability of the base model as a black box, which is typical. Experiments for challenging time-series forecasting data show that surrogate model-based methods provide more accurate confidence intervals than bootstrap-based methods in both medium and small-data regimes and different families of base models, including linear regression, ARIMA, and gradient boosting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
