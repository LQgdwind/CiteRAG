Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Distributed learning, particularly variants of distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD), are widely employed to speed up training by leveraging computational resources of several workers. However, in practise, communication delay becomes a bottleneck due to the significant amount of information that needs to be exchanged between the workers and the parameter server. One of the most efficient strategies to mitigate the communication bottleneck is top-KùêæK sparsification. However, top-KùêæK sparsification requires additional communication load to represent the sparsity pattern, and the mismatch between the sparsity patterns of the workers prevents exploitation of efficient communication protocols. To address these issues, we introduce a novel majority voting based sparse communication strategy, in which the workers first seek a consensus on the structure of the sparse representation. This strategy provides a significant reduction in the communication load and allows using the same sparsity level in both communication directions. Through extensive simulations on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we show that it is possible to achieve up to √ó4000absent4000\\times 4000 compression without any loss in the test accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
