Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Local consistency as a reduction between constraint satisfaction problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We study the use of local consistency methods as reductions between constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), and promise version thereof, with the aim to classify these reductions in a similar way as the algebraic approach classifies gadget reductions between CSPs. This research is motivated by the requirement of more expressive reductions in the scope of promise CSPs. While gadget reductions are enough to provide all necessary hardness in the scope of (finite domain) non-promise CSP, in promise CSPs a wider class of reductions needs to be used. We provide a general framework of reductions, which we call consistency reductions, that covers most (if not all) reductions recently used for proving NP-hardness of promise CSPs. We prove some basic properties of these reductions, and provide the first steps towards understanding the power of consistency reductions by characterizing a fragment associated to arc-consistency in terms of polymorphisms of the template. In addition to showing hardness, consistency reductions can also be used to provide feasible algorithms by reducing to a fixed tractable (promise) CSP, for example, to solving systems of affine equations. In this direction, among other results, we describe the well-known Sherali-Adams hierarchy for CSP in terms of a consistency reduction to linear programming.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
