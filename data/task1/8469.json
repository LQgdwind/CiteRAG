Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Automotive Case Study on the Limits of Approximation for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The accuracy of camera-based object detection (CBOD) built upon deep learning is often evaluated against the real objects in frames only. However, such simplistic evaluation ignores the fact that many unimportant objects are small, distant, or background, and hence, their misdetections have less impact than those for closer, larger, and foreground objects in domains such as autonomous driving. Moreover, sporadic misdetections are irrelevant since confidence on detections is typically averaged across consecutive frames, and detection devices (e.g. cameras, LiDARs) are often redundant, thus providing fault tolerance. This paper exploits such intrinsic fault tolerance of the CBOD process, and assesses in an automotive case study to what extent CBOD can tolerate approximation coming from multiple sources such as lower precision arithmetic, approximate arithmetic units, and even random faults due to, for instance, low voltage operation. We show that the accuracy impact of those sources of approximation is within 1% of the baseline even when considering the three approximate domains simultaneously, and hence, multiple sources of approximation can be exploited to build highly efficient accelerators for CBOD in cars.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
