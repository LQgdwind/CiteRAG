      "content": "Paper Title: Replicability in Reinforcement LearningAuthors are listed alphabetically.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We initiate the mathematical study of replicability as an algorithmic property in the context of reinforcement learning (RL). We focus on the fundamental setting of discounted tabular MDPs with access to a generative model. Inspired by Impagliazzo et al. (2022), we say that an RL algorithm is replicable if, with high probability, it outputs the exact same policy after two executions on i.i.d. samples drawn from the generator when its internal randomness is the same. We first provide an efficient ρ𝜌\\rho-replicable algorithm for (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-optimal policy estimation with sample and time complexity O~​(N3⋅log⁡(1/δ)(1−γ)5⋅ε2⋅ρ2)~𝑂⋅superscript𝑁31𝛿⋅superscript1𝛾5superscript𝜀2superscript𝜌2\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{N^{3}\\cdot\\log(1/\\delta)}{(1-\\gamma)^{5}\\cdot\\varepsilon^{2}\\cdot\\rho^{2}}\\right), where N𝑁N is the number of state-action pairs. Next, for the subclass of deterministic algorithms, we provide a lower bound of order Ω​(N3(1−γ)3⋅ε2⋅ρ2)Ωsuperscript𝑁3⋅superscript1𝛾3superscript𝜀2superscript𝜌2\\Omega\\left(\\frac{N^{3}}{(1-\\gamma)^{3}\\cdot\\varepsilon^{2}\\cdot\\rho^{2}}\\right). Then, we study a relaxed version of replicability proposed by Kalavasis et al. (2023) called TVTV\\mathrm{TV} indistinguishability. We design a computationally efficient TV indistinguishable algorithm for policy estimation whose sample complexity is O~​(N2⋅log⁡(1/δ)(1−γ)5⋅ε2⋅ρ2)~𝑂⋅superscript𝑁21𝛿⋅superscript1𝛾5superscript𝜀2superscript𝜌2\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{N^{2}\\cdot\\log(1/\\delta)}{(1-\\gamma)^{5}\\cdot\\varepsilon^{2}\\cdot\\rho^{2}}\\right). At the cost of exp⁡(N)𝑁\\exp(N) running time, we transform these TV indistinguishable algorithms to ρ𝜌\\rho-replicable ones without increasing their sample complexity. Finally, we introduce the notion of approximate-replicability where we only require that two outputted policies are close under an appropriate statistical divergence (e.g., Renyi) and show an improved sample complexity of O~​(N⋅log⁡(1/δ)(1−γ)5⋅ε2⋅ρ2)~𝑂⋅𝑁1𝛿⋅superscript1𝛾5superscript𝜀2superscript𝜌2\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{N\\cdot\\log(1/\\delta)}{(1-\\gamma)^{5}\\cdot\\varepsilon^{2}\\cdot\\rho^{2}}\\right).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
