      "content": "Paper Title: Tight (Double) Exponential Bounds for Identification Problems: Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We investigate fine-grained algorithmic aspects of identification problems in graphs and set systems, with a focus on Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover. In the first problem, an input is a graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices and an integer k𝑘k, and the objective is to decide whether there is a subset S𝑆S of k𝑘k vertices such that every vertex not in S𝑆S is dominated by a unique subset of S𝑆S. In the second problem, an input is a set of items U𝑈U, a collection of subsets ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} of U𝑈U called tests, and an integer k𝑘k, and the objective is to select at most k𝑘k tests such that for each pair of items, there is a test that contains exactly one of the two items. We prove, among other things, the following three (tight) conditional lower bounds. 1. Locating-Dominating Set does not admit an algorithm running in time 2o​(k2)⋅p​o​l​y​(n)⋅superscript2𝑜superscript𝑘2𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛2^{o(k^{2})}\\cdot poly(n), nor a polynomial time kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with 2o​(k)superscript2𝑜𝑘2^{o(k)} vertices, unless the ETH fails. To the best of our knowledge, Locating-Dominating Set is the first problem that admits such an algorithmic lower-bound (with a quadratic function in the exponent) when parameterized by the solution size. The other such results known to us are for structural parameterizations like vertex cover [Agrawal et al., ACM Trans. Comput. Theory 2019; Foucaud et.al., arXiv 2023] or pathwidth [M. Pilipczuk, MFCS 2011; Sau and Souza, Inf. Comput., 2021]. 2. Test Cover does not admit an algorithm running in time 22o​(k)⋅p​o​l​y​(|U|+|ℱ|)⋅superscript2superscript2𝑜𝑘𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑈ℱ2^{2^{o(k)}}\\cdot poly(|U|+|\\mathcal{F}|). After Edge Clique Cover [Cygan et al., SIAM J. Comput. 2016] and BiClique Cover [Chandran et al., IPEC 2016], this is the only example that we know of that admits a double exponential lower bound when parameterized by the solution size. 3. Locating-Dominating Set (respectively, Test Cover) parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph (respectively, of the natural auxiliary graph) does not admit an algorithm running in time 22o​(tw)⋅p​o​l​y​(n)⋅superscript2superscript2𝑜tw𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛2^{2^{o(\\textsf{tw})}}\\cdot poly(n) (respectively, 22o​(tw)⋅poly(|U|+|ℱ|))2^{2^{o(\\textsf{tw})}}\\cdot poly(|U|+|\\mathcal{F}|)). This result augments the small list of NP-Complete problem that admit double exponential lower bounds when parameterized by treewidth [Foucaud et al. arXiv 2023; Chalopin et al. arXiv 2023]. We also present algorithms whose running times match the above lower bounds. We also investigate the incompressibility of these problems, and parameterizations by several other structural graph parameters, such as vertex cover number and feedback edge set number. Our results regarding these parameters answer some open problems from the literature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
