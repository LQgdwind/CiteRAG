      "content": "Paper Title: Pushing the limits of raw waveform speaker recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, speaker recognition systems based on raw waveform inputs have received increasing attention. However, the performance of such systems are typically inferior to the state-of-the-art handcrafted feature-based counterparts, which demonstrate equal error rates under 1% on the popular VoxCeleb1 test set. This paper proposes a novel speaker recognition model based on raw waveform inputs. The model incorporates recent advances in machine learning and speaker verification, including the Res2Net backbone module and multi-layer feature aggregation. Our best model achieves an equal error rate of 0.89%, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art models based on handcrafted features, and outperforms the best model based on raw waveform inputs by a large margin. We also explore the application of the proposed model in the context of self-supervised learning framework. Our self-supervised model outperforms single phase-based existing works in this line of research. Finally, we show that self-supervised pre-training is effective for the semi-supervised scenario where we only have a small set of labelled training data, along with a larger set of unlabelled examples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
