      "content": "Paper Title: On the Role of Entanglement and Statistics in Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We make progress in understanding the relationship between learning models with access to entangled, separable and statistical measurements in the quantum statistical query (𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ}) model. We show the following results. Entangled versus separable measurements. The goal is to learn an unknown f𝑓f from the concept class 𝒞⊆{f:{0,1}n→[k]}𝒞conditional-set𝑓→superscript01𝑛delimited-[]𝑘{\\mathcal{C}}\\subseteq\\{f:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow[k]\\} given copies of 12n​∑x|x,f​(x)⟩1superscript2𝑛subscript𝑥ket𝑥𝑓𝑥\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n}}}\\sum_{x}|x,f(x)\\rangle. We show that, if T𝑇T copies suffice to learn f𝑓f using entangled measurements, O​(n​T2)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑇2O(nT^{2}) copies suffice to learn f𝑓f using only separable measurements. Entangled versus statistical measurements The goal is to learn a function f∈𝒞𝑓𝒞f\\in{\\mathcal{C}} given access to separable measurements or statistical measurements. We exhibit a concept class 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}} based of degree-222 functions with exponential separation between 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} learning and quantum learning with entangled measurements (even in the presence of noise). This proves the “quantum analogue” of the seminal result of Blum et al. [BKW03] that separates classical 𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{SQ} learning from classical 𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖯𝖠𝖢\\mathsf{PAC} learning with classification noise. 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} lower bounds for learning states. We introduce a quantum statistical query dimension (𝖰𝖲𝖣𝖰𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{QSD}), and use it to give lower bounds on the 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} complexity of learning. We prove superpolynomial 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} lower bounds for testing purity of quantum states, shadow tomography, learning coset states for the Abelian hidden subgroup problem, degree-222 functions, planted bi-clique states and learning output states of Clifford circuits of depth polylog⁡(n)polylog𝑛\\operatorname{polylog}(n). We also show that an extension of 𝖰𝖲𝖣𝖰𝖲𝖣\\mathsf{QSD} characterizes the complexity of general search problems. Further applications. We give unconditional separation between weak and strong error mitigation and prove lower bounds for learning distributions in the 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} model. Prior works by Quek et al. [QFK+22], Hinsche et al. [HIN+22] and Nietner et al. [NIS+23] proved analogous results assuming diagonal measurements and our work removes this assumption.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
