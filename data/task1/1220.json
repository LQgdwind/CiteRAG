      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games for Adaptive Moving Target Defense\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The field of cybersecurity has mostly been a cat-and-mouse game with the discovery of new attacks leading the way. To take away an attackerâ€™s advantage of reconnaissance, researchers have proposed proactive defense methods such as Moving Target Defense (MTD). To find good movement strategies, researchers have modeled MTD as leader-follower games between the defender and a cyber-adversary. We argue that existing models are inadequate in sequential settings when there is incomplete information about a rational adversary and yield sub-optimal movement strategies. Further, while there exists an array of work on learning defense policies in sequential settings for cyber-security, they are either unpopular due to scalability issues arising out of incomplete information or tend to ignore the strategic nature of the adversary simplifying the scenario to use single-agent reinforcement learning techniques. To address these concerns, we propose (1) a unifying game-theoretic model, called the Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games (BSMGs), that can model uncertainty over attacker types and the nuances of an MTD system and (2) a Bayesian Strong Stackelberg Q-learning (BSS-Q) approach that can, via interaction, learn the optimal movement policy for BSMGs within a reasonable time. We situate BSMGs in the landscape of incomplete-information Markov games and characterize the notion of Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) in them. We show that our learning approach converges to an SSE of a BSMG and then highlight that the learned movement policy (1) improves the state-of-the-art in MTD for web-application security and (2) converges to an optimal policy in MTD domains with incomplete information about adversaries even when prior information about rewards and transitions is absent.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
