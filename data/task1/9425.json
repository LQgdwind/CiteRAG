      "content": "Paper Title: Model-Driven Engineering Method to Support the Formalization of Machine Learning using SysML\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivation: Systems Engineering is a transdisciplinary and integrative approach, that enables the design, integration, and management of complex systems in systems engineering life cycles. In order to use data generated by cyber-physical systems (CPS), systems engineers cooperate with data scientists, to develop customized mechanisms for data extraction, data preparation, and/or data transformation. While interfaces in CPS systems may be generic, data generated for custom applications must be transformed and merged in specific ways so that insights into the data can be interpreted by system engineers or dedicated applications to gain additional insights. To foster efficient cooperation between systems engineers and data scientists, the systems engineers have to provide a fine-grained specification that describes (a) all parts of the CPS, (b) how the CPS might interact, (c) what data is exchanged between them, (d) how the data interrelates, and (e) what are the requirements and goals of the data extraction. A data scientist can then iteratively (including further refinements of the specification) prepare the necessary custom machine-learning models and components. Methods: This work introduces a method supporting the collaborative definition of machine learning tasks by leveraging model-based engineering in the formalization of the systems modeling language SysML. The method supports the identification and integration of various data sources, the required definition of semantic connections between data attributes, and the definition of data processing steps within the machine learning support. Results: By consolidating the knowledge of domain and machine learning experts, a powerful tool to describe machine learning tasks by formalizing knowledge using the systems modeling language SysML is introduced. The method is evaluated based on two use cases, i.e., a smart weather system that allows to predict weather forecasts based on sensor data, and a waste prevention case for 3D printer filament that cancels the printing if the intended result cannot be achieved (image processing). Further, a user study is conducted to gather insights of potential users regarding perceived workload and usability of the elaborated method. Conclusion: Integrating machine learning-specific properties in systems engineering techniques allows non-data scientists to understand formalized knowledge and define specific aspects of a machine learning problem, document knowledge on the data, and to further support data scientists to use the formalized knowledge as input for an implementation using (semi-) automatic code generation. In this respect, this work contributes by consolidating knowledge from various domains and therefore, fosters the integration of machine learning in industry by involving several stakeholders.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 38 most likely reference titles for this paper.
