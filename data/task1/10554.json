      "content": "Paper Title: Linearizing Models for Efficient yet Robust Private Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The growing concern about data privacy has led to the development of private inference (PI) frameworks in client-server applications which protects both data privacy and model IP. However, the cryptographic primitives required yield significant latency overhead which limits its wide-spread application. At the same time, changing environments demand the PI service to be robust against various naturally occurring and gradient-based perturbations. Despite several works focused on the development of latency-efficient models suitable for PI, the impact of these models on robustness has remained unexplored. Towards this goal, this paper presents RLNet, a class of robust linearized networks that can yield latency improvement via reduction of high-latency ReLU operations while improving the model performance on both clean and corrupted images. In particular, RLNet models provide a “triple win ticket” of improved classification accuracy on clean, naturally perturbed, and gradient-based perturbed images using a shared-mask shared-weight architecture with over an order of magnitude fewer ReLUs than baseline models. To demonstrate the efficacy of RLNet, we perform extensive experiments with ResNet and WRN models on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Our experimental evaluations show that RLNet can yield models with up to 11.14×11.14\\times fewer ReLUs, with accuracy close to the all-ReLU models, on clean, naturally perturbed, and gradient-based perturbed images. Compared with the SoTA non-robust linearized models at similar ReLU budgets, RLNet achieves an improvement in adversarial accuracy of up to ∼​47%similar-topercent47\\mathord{\\sim}47\\%, naturally perturbed accuracy up to ∼​16.4%similar-topercent16.4\\mathord{\\sim}16.4\\%, while improving clean image accuracy up to ∼​1.5%similar-topercent1.5\\mathord{\\sim}1.5\\%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
