      "content": "Paper Title: Strong Algebras and Radical Sylvester-Gallai Configurations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we prove the following non-linear generalization of the classical Sylvester-Gallai theorem. Let 𝕂𝕂{\\mathbb{K}} be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 00 and ℱ={F1,⋯,Fm}⊂𝕂​[x1,⋯,xN]ℱsubscript𝐹1⋯subscript𝐹𝑚𝕂subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑁\\mathcal{F}=\\{F_{1},\\cdots,F_{m}\\}\\subset{\\mathbb{K}}[x_{1},\\cdots,x_{N}] be a set of irreducible homogeneous polynomials of degree at most d𝑑d such that Fisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i} is not a scalar multiple of Fjsubscript𝐹𝑗F_{j} for i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j.

We prove that such radical SG configurations must be low dimensional. More precisely, we show that there exists a function λ:ℕ→ℕ:𝜆→ℕℕ\\lambda:{\\mathbb{N}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{N}}, independent of 𝕂,N𝕂𝑁{\\mathbb{K}},N and m𝑚m, such that any such configuration ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} must satisfy dim(span𝕂​{ℱ})≤λ​(d).dimensionsubscriptspan𝕂ℱ𝜆𝑑\\dim(\\textnormal{span}_{\\mathbb{K}}\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}\\right\\})\\leq\\lambda(d). Our result confirms a conjecture of Gupta [35, Conjecture 2] and generalizes the quadratic and cubic Sylvester-Gallai theorems of [56, 49]. Our result takes us one step closer towards the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem for depth-4 circuits of bounded top and bottom fanins. Our result, when combined with the Stillman uniformity type results of [3, 15, 23], yields uniform bounds for several algebraic invariants such as projective dimension, Betti numbers and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of ideals generated by radical SG configurations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 64 most likely reference titles for this paper.
