      "content": "Paper Title: LatticeOPT: A heuristic topology optimization framework for thin-walled, 2D extruded lattices\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper introduces a heuristic topology optimization framework for thin-walled, 2D extruded lattice structures subject to complex high-speed loading. The proposed framework optimizes the wall thickness distribution in the lattice cross section through different thickness update schemes, inspired by the idea of equalization of absorbed energy density across all lattice walls. The proposed framework is ubiquitous and can be used in explicit dynamic simulations, which is the primary numerical method used in crashworthiness studies. No information on the material tangent stiffness matrix is required, and complex material behaviors and complex loading conditions can be handled. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate framework capabilities: (1) Optimization of a long, slender column under axial compression to maximize specific energy absorption, (2) Optimization of a lattice-filled sandwich panel under off-center blast loading to minimize material damage, (3) Generation of a periodic lattice core design under blast loading. The results show that the framework can effectively increase specific energy absorption or minimize material damage with as few as 25 finite element simulations and optimization iterations.
