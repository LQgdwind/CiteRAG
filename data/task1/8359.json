Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: TSEN: Transformer and Snowball Graph Convolution Learning for Brain Functional Network Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Advanced deep learning methods, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), are increasingly expected to learn from brain functional network data and predict brain disorders. In this paper, we proposed a novel Transformer and snowball encoding networks (TSEN) for brain functional network classification, which introduced Transformer architecture with graph snowball connection into GNNs for learning whole-graph representation. TSEN combined graph snowball connection with graph Transformer by snowball encoding layers, which enhanced the power to capture multi-scale information and global patterns of brain functional networks. TSEN also introduced snowball graph convolution as position embedding in Transformer structure, which was a simple yet effective method for capturing local patterns naturally. We evaluated the proposed model by two large-scale brain functional network datasets from autism spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder respectively, and the results demonstrated that TSEN outperformed the state-of-the-art GNN models and the graph-transformer based GNN models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
