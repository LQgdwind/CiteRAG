Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Extensional and Non-extensional Functions as Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Following Milner’s seminal paper, the representation of functions as processes has received considerable attention. For pure λ𝜆\\lambda-calculus, the process representations yield (at best) non-extensional λ𝜆\\lambda-theories (i.e., β𝛽\\beta rule holds, whereas η𝜂\\eta does not). In the paper, we study how to obtain extensional representations, and how to move between extensional and non-extensional representations. Using Internal π𝜋\\pi, Iπ𝜋\\pi (a subset of the π𝜋\\pi-calculus in which all outputs are bound), we develop a refinement of Milner’s original encoding of functions as processes that is parametric on certain abstract components called wires. These are, intuitively, processes whose task is to connect two end-point channels. We show that when a few algebraic properties of wires hold, the encoding yields a λ𝜆\\lambda-theory. Exploiting the symmetries and dualities of Iπ𝜋\\pi, we isolate three main classes of wires. The first two have a sequential behaviour and are dual of each other; the third has a parallel behaviour and is the dual of itself. We show the adoption of the parallel wires yields an extensional λ𝜆\\lambda-theory; in fact, it yields an equality that coincides with that of Böhm trees with infinite η𝜂\\eta. In contrast, the other two classes of wires yield non-extensional λ𝜆\\lambda-theories whose equalities are those of the Lévy-Longo and Böhm trees.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
