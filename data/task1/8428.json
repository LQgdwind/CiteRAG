Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: AMS-DRL: Learning Multi-Pursuit Evasion for Safe Targeted Navigation of Drones\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Safe navigation of drones in the presence of adversarial physical attacks from multiple pursuers is a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach, asynchronous multi-stage deep reinforcement learning (AMS-DRL), to train an adversarial neural network that can learn from the actions of multiple pursuers and adapt quickly to their behavior, enabling the drone to avoid attacks and reach its target. Our approach guarantees convergence by ensuring Nash Equilibrium among agents from the game-theory analysis. We evaluate our method in extensive simulations and show that it outperforms baselines with higher navigation success rates. We also analyze how parameters such as the relative maximum speed affect navigation performance. Furthermore, we have conducted physical experiments and validated the effectiveness of the trained policies in real-time flights. A success rate heatmap is introduced to elucidate how spatial geometry influences navigation outcomes. Project website: https://github.com/NTU-UAVG/AMS-DRL-for-Pursuit-Evasion.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
