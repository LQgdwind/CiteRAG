Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Unbiased Representations via R√©nyi Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, significant work has been done to include fairness constraints in the training objective of machine learning algorithms. Many state-of the-art algorithms tackle this challenge by learning a fair representation which captures all the relevant information to predict the output YùëåY while not containing any information about a sensitive attribute SùëÜS. In this paper, we propose an adversarial algorithm to learn unbiased representations via the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi (HGR) maximal correlation coefficient. We leverage recent work which has been done to estimate this coefficient by learning deep neural network transformations and use it as a min-max game to penalize the intrinsic bias in a multi dimensional latent representation. Compared to other dependence measures, the HGR coefficient captures more information about the non-linear dependencies with the sensitive variable, making the algorithm more efficient in mitigating bias in the representation. We empirically evaluate and compare our approach and demonstrate significant improvements over existing works in the field.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
