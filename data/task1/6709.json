Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robot Active Neural Sensing and Planning in Unknown Cluttered Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Active sensing and planning in unknown, cluttered environments is an open challenge for robots intending to provide home service, search and rescue, narrow-passage inspection, and medical assistance. Although many active sensing methods exist, they often consider open spaces, assume known settings, or mostly do not generalize to real-world scenarios. We present the active neural sensing approach that generates the kinematically feasible viewpoint sequences for the robot manipulator with an in-hand camera to gather the minimum number of observations needed to reconstruct the underlying environment. Our framework actively collects the visual RGBD observations, aggregates them into scene representation, and performs object shape inference to avoid unnecessary robot interactions with the environment. We train our approach on synthetic data with domain randomization and demonstrate its successful execution via sim-to-real transfer in reconstructing narrow, covered, real-world cabinet environments cluttered with unknown objects. The natural cabinet scenarios impose significant challenges for robot motion and scene reconstruction due to surrounding obstacles and low ambient lighting conditions. However, despite unfavorable settings, our method exhibits high performance compared to its baselines in terms of various environment reconstruction metrics, including planning speed, the number of viewpoints, and overall scene coverage.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
