      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Multimodal Composite Editing and Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the real world, where information is abundant and diverse across different modalities, understanding and utilizing various data types to improve retrieval systems is a key focus of research. Multimodal composite retrieval integrates diverse modalities such as text, image and audio, etc. to provide more accurate, personalized, and contextually relevant results. To facilitate a deeper understanding of this promising direction, this survey explores multimodal composite editing and retrieval in depth, covering image-text composite editing, image-text composite retrieval, and other multimodal composite retrieval. In this survey, we systematically organize the application scenarios, methods, benchmarks, experiments, and future directions. Multimodal learning is a hot topic in large model era, and have also witnessed some surveys in multimodal learning and vision-language models with transformers published in the PAMI journal. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review of the literature on multimodal composite retrieval, which is a timely complement of multimodal fusion to existing reviews. To help readers’ quickly track this field, we build the project page for this survey, which can be found at https://github.com/fuxianghuang1/Multimodal-Composite-Editing-and-Retrieval.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 240 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 240\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
