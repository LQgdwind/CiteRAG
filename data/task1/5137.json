      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Capacitance: A New Perspective of Neural Network Selection via Edge Dynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Efficient model selection for identifying a suitable pre-trained neural network to a downstream task is a fundamental yet challenging task in deep learning. Current practice requires expensive computational costs in model training for performance prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for neural network selection by analyzing the governing dynamics over synaptic connections (edges) during training. Our framework is built on the fact that back-propagation during neural network training is equivalent to the dynamical evolution of synaptic connections. Therefore, a converged neural network is associated with an equilibrium state of a networked system composed of those edges. To this end, we construct a network mapping œïitalic-œï\\phi, converting a neural network GAsubscriptùê∫ùê¥G_{A} to a directed line graph GBsubscriptùê∫ùêµG_{B} that is defined on those edges in GAsubscriptùê∫ùê¥G_{A}. Next, we derive a neural capacitance metric Œ≤effsubscriptùõΩeff\\beta_{\\rm eff} as a predictive measure universally capturing the generalization capability of GAsubscriptùê∫ùê¥G_{A} on the downstream task using only a handful of early training results. We carried out extensive experiments using 17 popular pre-trained ImageNet models and five benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, Fashion MNIST and Birds, to evaluate the fine-tuning performance of our framework. Our neural capacitance metric is shown to be a powerful indicator for model selection based only on early training results and is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
