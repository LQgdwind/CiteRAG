Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural ODEs as Feedback Policies for Nonlinear Optimal Control\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) define continuous time dynamical systems with neural networks. The interest in their application for modelling has sparked recently, spanning hybrid system identification problems and time series analysis. In this work we propose the use of a neural control policy capable of satisfying state and control constraints to solve nonlinear optimal control problems. The control policy optimization is posed as a Neural ODE problem to efficiently exploit the availability of a dynamical system model. We showcase the efficacy of this type of deterministic neural policies in two constrained systems: the controlled Van der Pol system and a bioreactor control problem. This approach represents a practical approximation to the intractable closed-loop solution of nonlinear control problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
