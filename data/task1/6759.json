Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Data Provenance via Differential Auditing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Auditing Data Provenance (ADP), i.e., auditing if a certain piece of data has been used to train a machine learning model, is an important problem in data provenance. The feasibility of the task has been demonstrated by existing auditing techniques, e.g., shadow auditing methods, under certain conditions such as the availability of label information and the knowledge of training protocols for the target model. Unfortunately, both of these conditions are often unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we introduce Data Provenance via Differential Auditing (DPDA), a practical framework for auditing data provenance with a different approach based on statistically significant differentials, i.e., after carefully designed transformation, perturbed input data from the target model’s training set would result in much more drastic changes in the output than those from the model’s non-training set. This framework allows auditors to distinguish training data from non-training ones without the need of training any shadow models with the help of labeled output data. Furthermore, we propose two effective auditing function implementations, an additive one and a multiplicative one. We report evaluations on real-world data sets demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed auditing technique.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
