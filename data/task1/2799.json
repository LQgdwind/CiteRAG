Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In precision crop protection, (target-orientated) object detection in image processing can help navigate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV, crop protection drones) to the right place to apply the pesticide. Unnecessary application of non-target areas could be avoided. Deep learning algorithms dominantly use in modern computer vision tasks which require high computing time, memory footprint, and power consumption. Based on the Edge Artificial Intelligence, we investigate the main three paths that lead to dealing with this problem, including hardware accelerators, efficient algorithms, and model compression. Finally, we integrate them and propose a solution based on a light deep neural network (DNN), called Ag-YOLO, which can make the crop protection UAV have the ability to target detection and autonomous operation. This solution is restricted in size, cost, flexible, fast, and energy-effective. The hardware is only 18 grams in weight and 1.5 watts in energy consumption, and the developed DNN model needs only 838 kilobytes of disc space. We tested the developed hardware and software in comparison to the tiny version of the state-of-art YOLOv3 framework, known as YOLOv3-Tiny to detect individual palm in a plantation. An average F1 score of 0.9205 at the speed of 36.5 frames per second (in comparison to similar accuracy at 18 frames per second and 8.66 megabytes of the YOLOv3-Tiny algorithm) was reached. This developed detection system is easily plugged into any machines already purchased as long as the machines have USB ports and run Linux Operating System.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
