Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dimensionality-Aware Outlier Detection: Theoretical and Experimental Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a nonparametric method for outlier detection that takes full account of local variations in intrinsic dimensionality within the dataset. Using the theory of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID), our ‚Äòdimensionality-aware‚Äô outlier detection method, DAODAO\\operatorname{\\textrm{DAO}}, is derived as an estimator of an asymptotic local expected density ratio involving the query point and a close neighbor drawn at random. The dimensionality-aware behavior of DAODAO\\operatorname{\\textrm{DAO}} is due to its use of local estimation of LID values in a theoretically-justified way. Through comprehensive experimentation on more than 800 synthetic and real datasets, we show that DAODAO\\operatorname{\\textrm{DAO}} significantly outperforms three popular and important benchmark outlier detection methods: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Simplified LOF, and k‚ÄãNNùëòNN\\operatorname{\\mathit{k}\\textrm{NN}}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
