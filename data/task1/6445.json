Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Nash Equilibrium Learning for n-Player Markov Games in Dynamic Pricing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We investigate Nash equilibrium learning in a competitive Markov Game (MG) environment, where multiple agents compete, and multiple Nash equilibria can exist. In particular, for an oligopolistic dynamic pricing environment, exact Nash equilibria are difficult to obtain due to the curse-of-dimensionality. We develop a new model-free method to find approximate Nash equilibria. Gradient-free black box optimization is then applied to estimate ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, the maximum reward advantage of an agent unilaterally deviating from any joint policy, and to also estimate the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-minimizing policy for any given state. The policy-ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon correspondence and the state to ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-minimizing policy are represented by neural networks, the latter being the Nash Policy Net. During batch update, we perform Nash Q learning on the system, by adjusting the action probabilities using the Nash Policy Net. We demonstrate that an approximate Nash equilibrium can be learned, particularly in the dynamic pricing domain where exact solutions are often intractable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
