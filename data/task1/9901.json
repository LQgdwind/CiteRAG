Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Real Image Editing with Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite all recent progress, it is still challenging to edit and manipulate natural images with modern generative models. When using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), one major hurdle is in the inversion process mapping a real image to its corresponding noise vector in the latent space, since it is necessary to be able to reconstruct an image to edit its contents. Likewise for Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), the linearization assumption in each inversion step makes the whole deterministic inversion process unreliable. Existing approaches that have tackled the problem of inversion stability often incur in significant trade-offs in computational efficiency. In this work we propose an Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion method, dubbed AIDI, that significantly improves reconstruction accuracy with minimal additional overhead in space and time complexity. By using a novel blended guidance technique, we show that effective results can be obtained on a large range of image editing tasks without large classifier-free guidance in inversion. Furthermore, when compared with other diffusion inversion based works, our proposed process is shown to be more robust for fast image editing in the 10 and 20 diffusion stepsâ€™ regimes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
