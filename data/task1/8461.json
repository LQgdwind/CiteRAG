Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Are Large Language Models Ready for Healthcare? A Comparative Study on Clinical Language Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various domains, including healthcare. However, the specialized nature of clinical language understanding tasks presents unique challenges and limitations that warrant further investigation. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard, within the realm of clinical language understanding tasks. These tasks span a diverse range, including named entity recognition, relation extraction, natural language inference, semantic textual similarity, document classification, and question-answering. We also introduce a novel prompting strategy, self-questioning prompting (SQP), tailored to enhance the performance of LLMs by eliciting informative questions and answers pertinent to the clinical scenarios at hand. Our evaluation highlights the importance of employing task-specific learning strategies and prompting techniques, such as SQP, to maximize the effectiveness of LLMs in healthcare-related tasks. Our study emphasizes the need for cautious implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings, ensuring a collaborative approach with domain experts and continuous verification by human experts to achieve responsible and effective use, ultimately contributing to improved patient care. Our code is available at https://github.com/EternityYW/LLM_healthcare.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
