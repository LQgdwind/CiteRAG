      "content": "Paper Title: Ergonomic Design of Computer Laboratory Furniture: Mismatch Analysis Utilizing Anthropometric Data of University Students\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many studies have shown how ergonomically designed furniture improves productivity and well-being. As computers have become a part of students’ academic lives, they will grow further in the future. We propose anthropometric-based furniture dimensions suitable for university students to improve computer laboratory ergonomics. We collected data from 380 participants and analyzed 11 anthropometric measurements, correlating them to 11 furniture dimensions. Two types of furniture were found and studied in different university computer laboratories: (1) a non-adjustable chair with a non-adjustable table and (2) an adjustable chair with a non-adjustable table. The mismatch calculation showed a significant difference between existing furniture dimensions and anthropometric measurements, indicating that 7 of 11 existing furniture dimensions need improvements. The one-way ANOVA test with a significance level of 5% also showed a significant difference between anthropometric data and existing furniture dimensions. All 11 dimensions were determined to match the student’s anthropometric data. The proposed dimensions were found to be more compatible and showed reduced mismatch percentages for 9 furniture dimensions and nearly zero mismatches for SW, BH, and UTH for both males and females compared to existing furniture dimensions. The proposed dimensions of the furniture set with adjustable seat height showed slightly improved results for SH and STC, which showed zero mismatches compared to the non-adjustable furniture set. The TW and TD dimensions were suggested according to Barnes and Squires’ ergonomic work envelope model, considering hand reach. The position for the keyboard and mouse was also suggested according to the work envelope. The monitor position and viewing angle were proposed according to OSHA guidelines. This study suggests that the proposed dimensions can improve comfort levels, reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders among students. Further studies on the implementation and long-term effects of these proposed dimensions in real-world computer laboratory settings are recommended.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
