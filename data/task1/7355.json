      "content": "Paper Title: Interacting Hand-Object Pose Estimation via Dense Mutual Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract 3D hand-object pose estimation is the key to the success of many computer vision applications. The main focus of this task is to effectively model the interaction between the hand and an object. To this end, existing works either rely on interaction constraints in a computationally-expensive iterative optimization, or consider only a sparse correlation between sampled hand and object keypoints. In contrast, we propose a novel dense mutual attention mechanism that is able to model fine-grained dependencies between the hand and the object. Specifically, we first construct the hand and object graphs according to their mesh structures. For each hand node, we aggregate features from every object node by the learned attention and vice versa for each object node. Thanks to such dense mutual attention, our method is able to produce physically plausible poses with high quality and real-time inference speed. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on large benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/rongakowang/DenseMutualAttention.git.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
