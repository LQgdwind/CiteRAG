Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Entity Alignment in the Open World: An Unsupervised Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Entity alignment (EA) aims to discover the equivalent entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs). It is a pivotal step for integrating KGs to increase knowledge coverage and quality. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase of EA frameworks. However, state-of-the-art solutions tend to rely on labeled data for model training. Additionally, they work under the closed-domain setting and cannot deal with entities that are unmatchable. To address these deficiencies, we offer an unsupervised framework that performs entity alignment in the open world. Specifically, we first mine useful features from the side information of KGs. Then, we devise an unmatchable entity prediction module to filter out unmatchable entities and produce preliminary alignment results. These preliminary results are regarded as the pseudo-labeled data and forwarded to the progressive learning framework to generate structural representations, which are integrated with the side information to provide a more comprehensive view for alignment. Finally, the progressive learning framework gradually improves the quality of structural embeddings and enhances the alignment performance by enriching the pseudo-labeled data with alignment results from the previous round. Our solution does not require labeled data and can effectively filter out unmatchable entities. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate its superiority.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
