      "content": "Paper Title: Further Results on Colored Range Searching\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a number of new results about range searching for colored (or “categorical”) data: 1. For a set of n𝑛n colored points in three dimensions, we describe randomized data structures with O​(n​polylogn)𝑂𝑛polylog𝑛O(n\\mathop{\\rm polylog}n) space that can report the distinct colors in any query orthogonal range (axis-aligned box) in O​(k​polyloglogn)𝑂𝑘polyloglog𝑛O(k\\mathop{\\rm polyloglog}n) expected time, where k𝑘k is the number of distinct colors in the range, assuming that coordinates are in {1,…,n}1…𝑛\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}. Previous data structures require O​(log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n+k)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑘O(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}+k) query time. Our result also implies improvements in higher constant dimensions. 2. Our data structures can be adapted to halfspace ranges in three dimensions (or circular ranges in two dimensions), achieving O​(k​log⁡n)𝑂𝑘𝑛O(k\\log n) expected query time. Previous data structures require O​(k​log2⁡n)𝑂𝑘superscript2𝑛O(k\\log^{2}n) query time. 3. For a set of n𝑛n colored points in two dimensions, we describe a data structure with O​(n​polylogn)𝑂𝑛polylog𝑛O(n\\mathop{\\rm polylog}n) space that can answer colored “type-2” range counting queries: report the number of occurrences of every distinct color in a query orthogonal range. The query time is O​(log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n+k​log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑘𝑛O(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}+k\\log\\log n), where k𝑘k is the number of distinct colors in the range. Naively performing k𝑘k uncolored range counting queries would require O​(k​log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑘𝑛𝑛O(k\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}) time. Our data structures are designed using a variety of techniques, including colored variants of randomized incremental construction (which may be of independent interest), colored variants of shallow cuttings, and bit-packing tricks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
