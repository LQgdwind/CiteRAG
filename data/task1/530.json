      "content": "Paper Title: SOS: Socially Omitting Selfishness in IoT for Smart and Connected Communities\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract [Summary]Smart and Connected Communities (SCC) is an emerging field of Internet of Things (IoT), and it is having potential applications to improve human life. The improvement may be in terms of preservation, revitalization, livability, and sustainability of a community. The resources of the nodes and devices in the SCC have certain constraints that may not allow the devices and nodes to cooperate to save their resources such as memory, energy, and buffer, or simply maximize their performance. Thus, to stimulate the nodes to avoid selfish behavior, SSC needs a novel and well-organized solution to motivate nodes for cooperation. This article aims to resolve the issue of selfish behaviors in SCC and to encourage the nodes for cooperation. A novel mechanism Socially Omitting Selfishness (SOS) has been proposed to manage/eradicate selfishness using a socially-oriented election process. The election process elects different heads based on weight and cooperation (using VCG model). The election of heads and incentive mechanism encourages the nodes to show participation and behave as highly cooperative members of the community. Furthermore, an extended version of the Dempster-Shafer model has been used to discourage the selfish behavior of the participating nodes in the SOS scheme. It uses different monitoring and gateway nodes to efficiently employ the proposed scheme. A mathematical model has been developed for the aforementioned aspects and simulated through NS2 simulation environment to analyze the performance of SOS. The results of the proposed scheme outperform the contemporary schemes in terms of average delivery delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and average energy. \\jnlcitation\\cname , , , , and (\\cyear2019), \\ctitleSOS: Socially Omitting Selfishness in IoT for Smart and Connected Communities, \\cjournalInternational Journal of ABC, XYZ, \\cvol2019;00:1–16\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
