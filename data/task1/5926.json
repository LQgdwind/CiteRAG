      "content": "Paper Title: Non-Isometric Shape Matching via Functional Maps on Landmark-Adapted Bases\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a principled approach for non-isometric landmark-preserving non-rigid shape matching. Our method is based on the functional maps framework, but rather than promoting isometries we focus instead on near-conformal maps that preserve landmarks exactly. We achieve this, first, by introducing a novel landmark-adapted basis using an intrinsic Dirichlet-Steklov eigenproblem. Second, we establish the functional decomposition of conformal maps expressed in this basis. Finally, we formulate a conformally-invariant energy that promotes high-quality landmark-preserving maps, and show how it can be solved via a variant of the recently proposed ZoomOut method that we extend to our setting. Our method is descriptor-free, efficient and robust to significant mesh variability. We evaluate our approach on a range of benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on non-isometric benchmarks and near state-of-the-art performance on isometric ones. {CCSXML} <ccs2012> <concept> <concept_id>10010147.10010371.10010352.10010381</concept_id> <concept_desc>Computing methodologies Collision detection</concept_desc> <concept_significance>300</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10010583.10010588.10010559</concept_id> <concept_desc>Hardware Sensors and actuators</concept_desc> <concept_significance>300</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10010583.10010584.10010587</concept_id> <concept_desc>Hardware PCB design and layout</concept_desc> <concept_significance>100</concept_significance> </concept> </ccs2012> \\ccsdesc [300]Computing methodologies Shape analysis \\printccsdesc\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper.
