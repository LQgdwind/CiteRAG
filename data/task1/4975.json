Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-CPR: Generalize to Unseen Large Number of Agents with Communication Pattern Recognition Module\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Designing an effective communication mechanism among agents in reinforcement learning has been a challenging task, especially for real-world applications. The number of agents can grow or an environment sometimes needs to interact with a changing number of agents in real-world scenarios. To this end, a multi-agent framework needs to handle various scenarios of agents, in terms of both scales and dynamics, for being practical to real-world applications. We formulate the multi-agent environment with a different number of agents as a multi-tasking problem and propose a meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework to tackle this problem. The proposed framework employs a meta-learned Communication Pattern Recognition (CPR) module to identify communication behavior and extract information that facilitates the training process. Experimental results are poised to demonstrate that the proposed framework (a) generalizes to an unseen larger number of agents and (b) allows the number of agents to change between episodes. The ablation study is also provided to reason the proposed CPR design and show such design is effective.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
