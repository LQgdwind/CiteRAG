      "content": "Paper Title: Unraveling Retraction Dynamics in COVID-19 Research: Patterns, Reasons, and Implications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, while the world sought solutions, some scholars exploited the situation for personal gains through deceptive studies and manipulated data. This paper presents the extent of 400 retracted COVID-19 papers listed by the Retraction Watch database until the month of February 2024. The primary purpose of the research was to analyze journal quality and retractions trends. For all stakeholders involved, such as editors, relevant researchers, and policymakers, evaluating the journal’s quality is crucial information since it could help them effectively stop such incidents and their negative effects in the future. The present research results imply that the one-fourth of publications were retracted within the first month of their publication, followed by an additional 6% within six months of publication. One-third of the retractions originated from Q1 journals, with another significant portion coming from Q2 (29.8%). A notable percentage of the retracted papers (23.2%) lacked publishing impact, signifying their publication as conference papers or in journals not indexed by Scopus. An examination of the retraction reasons reveals that one-fourth of retractions were due to numerous causes, mostly in Q2 journals, and another quarter were due to data problems, with the majority happening in Q1 publications. Elsevier retracted 31% of papers, with the majority published as Q1, followed by Springer (11.5%), predominantly as Q2. On average, retractions from Q1 journals took 7.74 months, Q2 retractions took 10.44 months, and case reports had the longest duration at 12.3 months. Papers with specific reasons for retraction averaged over a year: fake-biased reviews took 15.08 months, multiple reasons took 14.64 months, and authorship issues took 12.63 months. Retracted papers were mainly associated with the USA, China, and India. In the USA, retractions were primarily from Q1 journals followed by no-impact publications; in China, it was Q1 followed by Q2, and in India, it was Q2 followed by no-impact publications. The study also examined author contributions, revealing that 69.3% were male contributors, with females (30.7%) mainly holding middle author positions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
