Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MixSearch: Searching for Domain Generalized Medical Image Segmentation Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Considering the scarcity of medical data, most datasets in medical image analysis are an order of magnitude smaller than those of natural images. However, most Network Architecture Search (NAS) approaches in medical images focused on specific datasets and did not take into account the generalization ability of the learned architectures on unseen datasets as well as different domains. In this paper, we address this point by proposing to search for generalizable U-shape architectures on a composited dataset that mixes medical images from multiple segmentation tasks and domains creatively, which is named “MixSearch”. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to mix multiple small-scale datasets from multiple domains and segmentation tasks to produce a large-scale dataset. Then, a novel weaved encoder-decoder structure is designed to search for a generalized segmentation network in both cell-level and network-level. The network produced by the proposed MixSearch framework achieves state-of-the-art results compared with advanced encoder-decoder networks across various datasets. Moreover, we also evaluate the learned network architectures on three additional datasets, which are unseen in the searching process. Extensive experiments show that the architectures automatically learned by our proposed MixSearch surpass U-Net and its variants by a significant margin, verifying the generalization ability and practicability of our proposed method. We make our code and learned network architectures available at: https://github.com/lswzjuer/NAS-WDAN/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
