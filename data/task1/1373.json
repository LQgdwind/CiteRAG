Part of the results in this paper was presented at the International Symposium on Information Theory 2020 [1].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider three different variants of differential privacy (DP), namely approximate DP, R√©nyi DP (RDP), and hypothesis test DP. In the first part, we develop a machinery for optimally relating approximate DP to RDP based on the joint range of two fùëìf-divergences that underlie the approximate DP and RDP. In particular, this enables us to derive the optimal approximate DP parameters of a mechanism that satisfies a given level of RDP. As an application, we apply our result to the moments accountant framework for characterizing privacy guarantees of noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD). When compared to the state-of-the-art, our bounds may lead to about 100 more stochastic gradient descent iterations for training deep learning models for the same privacy budget. In the second part, we establish a relationship between RDP and hypothesis test DP which allows us to translate the RDP constraint into a tradeoff between type I and type II error probabilities of a certain binary hypothesis test. We then demonstrate that for noisy SGD our result leads to tighter privacy guarantees compared to the recently proposed fùëìf-DP framework for some range of parameters.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
