Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Restore Anything Pipeline: Segment Anything Meets Image Restoration\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent image restoration methods have produced significant advancements using deep learning. However, existing methods tend to treat the whole image as a single entity, failing to account for the distinct objects in the image that exhibit individual texture properties. Existing methods also typically generate a single result, which may not suit the preferences of different users. In this paper, we introduce the Restore Anything Pipeline (RAP), a novel interactive and per-object level image restoration approach that incorporates a controllable model to generate different results that users may choose from. RAP incorporates image segmentation through the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a controllable image restoration model to create a user-friendly pipeline for several image restoration tasks. We demonstrate the versatility of RAP by applying it to three common image restoration tasks: image deblurring, image denoising, and JPEG artifact removal. Our experiments show that RAP produces superior visual results compared to state-of-the-art methods. RAP represents a promising direction for image restoration, providing users with greater control, and enabling image restoration at an object level.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
