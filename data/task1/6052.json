Versions: v1.0 (May 25, 2022), v2.0 (February 11, 2023), v3.0 (September 17, 2023), v4.0 (February 9, 2024)\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper develops and analyzes an accelerated proximal descent method for finding stationary points of nonconvex composite optimization problems. The objective function is of the form f+hùëì‚Ñéf+h where h‚Ñéh is a proper closed convex function, fùëìf is a differentiable function on the domain of h‚Ñéh, and ‚àáf‚àáùëì\\nabla f is Lipschitz continuous on the domain of h‚Ñéh. The main advantage of this method is that it is ‚Äúparameter-free‚Äù in the sense that it does not require knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of ‚àáf‚àáùëì\\nabla f or of any global topological properties of fùëìf. It is shown that the proposed method can obtain an ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-approximate stationary point with iteration complexity bounds that are optimal, up to logarithmic terms over ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon, in both the convex and nonconvex settings. Some discussion is also given about how the proposed method can be leveraged in other existing optimization frameworks, such as min-max smoothing and penalty frameworks for constrained programming, to create more specialized parameter-free methods. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to support the practical viability of the method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
