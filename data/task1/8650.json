Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Simple Noisy Environment Augmentation for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Data augmentation is a widely used technique for improving model performance in machine learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing. Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying augmentation techniques to reinforcement learning (RL) problems, with a focus on image-based augmentation. In this paper, we explore a set of generic wrappers designed to augment RL environments with noise and encourage agent exploration and improve training data diversity which are applicable to a broad spectrum of RL algorithms and environments. Specifically, we concentrate on augmentations concerning states, rewards, and transition dynamics and introduce two novel augmentation techniques. In addition, we introduce a noise rate hyperparameter for control over the frequency of noise injection. We present experimental results on the impact of these wrappers on return using three popular RL algorithms, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), across five MuJoCo environments. To support the choice of augmentation technique in practice, we also present analysis that explores the performance these techniques across environments. Lastly, we publish the wrappers in our noisyenv repository for use with gym environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
