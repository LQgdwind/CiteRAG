      "content": "Paper Title: One-Way Functions and Polynomial Time Dimension\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work solves an open problem regarding the rate of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and polynomial-time dimension, conditioned on a hardness assumption. Hitchcock and Vinodchandran in 2004 [HV04] show that the polynomial-time dimension of infinite sequences (denoted cdimPsubscriptcdimP{\\mathrm{cdim}}_{\\mathrm{P}}) defined using betting algorithms called sùë†s-gales, is greater than or equal to the asymptotic lower rate of polynomial-time Kolmogorov complexity (denoted ùí¶polysubscriptùí¶poly\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{poly}}). They asked ([HV04], see also Stull [Stu20]) whether the converse relationship, cdimP‚â§ùí¶polysubscriptcdimPsubscriptùí¶poly{\\mathrm{cdim}}_{\\mathrm{P}}\\leq\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{poly}} also holds. This question has thus far resisted resolution. The corresponding unbounded notions, namely, the constructive dimension and the asymptotic lower rate of unbounded Kolmogorov complexity are equal for every sequence. Analogous notions are equal even at finite-state level [BHV05]. In view of these results, it is reasonable to conjecture that the polynomial-time quantities are identical for every sequence and set of sequences. However, under a plausible assumption which underlies modern cryptography - namely the existence of one-way functions, we refute the conjecture thereby giving a negative answer to the open question posed by Hitchcock and Vinodchandran [HV04] and Stull [Stu20]. We show the following, conditioned on the existence of one-way functions: ‚Ä¢ There are sets ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} of infinite sequences whose polytime dimension strictly exceeds ùí¶poly‚Äã(‚Ñ±)subscriptùí¶poly‚Ñ±\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{poly}}(\\mathcal{F}), that is cdimP‚Äã(‚Ñ±)>ùí¶poly‚Äã(‚Ñ±)subscriptcdimP‚Ñ±subscriptùí¶poly‚Ñ±{\\mathrm{cdim}}_{\\mathrm{P}}(\\mathcal{F})>\\mathcal{K}_{{\\mathrm{poly}}}(\\mathcal{F}). ‚Ä¢ We establish a stronger version of this result, that there are individual sequences XùëãX whose poly-time dimension strictly exceeds ùí¶poly‚Äã(X)subscriptùí¶polyùëã\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{poly}}(X), that is cdimP‚Äã(X)>ùí¶poly‚Äã(X)subscriptcdimPùëãsubscriptùí¶polyùëã{\\mathrm{cdim}}_{\\mathrm{P}}(X)>\\mathcal{K}_{{\\mathrm{poly}}}(X). ‚Ä¢ Further, we show that the gap between these quantities can be made as large as possible (i.e. close to 1). ‚Ä¢ We also establish similar bounds for strong poly-time dimension (denoted cDimPsubscriptcDimP{{\\mathrm{cDim}}}_{\\mathrm{P}}) versus asymptotic upper Kolmogorov complexity rates (denoted ùí¶polystrsubscriptsuperscriptùí¶strpoly\\mathcal{K}^{\\mathrm{str}}_{{\\mathrm{poly}}}). Thus, if one-way functions exist, there are infinite sequences whose prefixes are output by short polynomial time algorithms, but polytime betting algorithms are unable to capitalize on this to succeed over them. Our proof techniques involve explicit constructions by concatenating the outputs of pseudorandom generators to form sequences whose prefixes are output by short polynomial time algorithms, but resist betting by polytime sùë†s-gales. Our proof uses several new constructions and arguments involving probabilistic tools such as the Borel-Cantelli Lemma and the Kolmogorov inequality for martingales. This work shows that the question of non-robustness of polynomial-time information density notions, which is prima facie different, is intimately related to questions which are of current interest in cryptography and meta-complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
