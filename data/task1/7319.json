Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Certified Numerical Real Root Isolation of Zero-dimensional Multivariate Real Nonlinear Systems11footnote 1This work was partially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China grant 2022YFC3802102.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Using the local geometrical properties of a given zero-dimensional square multivariate nonlinear system inside a box, we provide a simple but effective and new criterion for the uniqueness and the existence of a real simple zero of the system inside the box. Based on the result, we design an algorithm based on subdivision and interval arithmetics to isolate all the real zeros of a general real nonlinear system inside a given box. Our method is complete for systems with only finite isolated simple real zeros inside a box. A termination precision is given for general zero-dimensional systems. Multiple zeros of the system are output in bounded boxes. A variety of benchmarks show the effectivity and efficiency of our implementation (in C++). It works for polynomial systems with Bezout bound more than 100 million. It also works for non-polynomial nonlinear systems. We also discuss the limitations of our method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
