Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Stress-Free Sum-of-Squares Lower Bound for Coloring\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We prove that with high probability over the choice of a random graph G𝐺G from the Erdős-Rényi distribution G​(n,1/2)𝐺𝑛12G(n,1/2), a natural nO​(ε2​log⁡n)superscript𝑛𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑛n^{O(\\varepsilon^{2}\\log n)}-time, degree O​(ε2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑛O(\\varepsilon^{2}\\log n) sum-of-squares semidefinite program cannot refute the existence of a valid k𝑘k-coloring of G𝐺G for k=n1/2+ε𝑘superscript𝑛12𝜀k=n^{1/2+\\varepsilon}. Our result implies that the refutation guarantee of the basic semidefinite program (a close variant of the Lovász theta function) cannot be appreciably improved by a natural o​(log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\log n)-degree sum-of-squares strengthening, and this is tight up to a no​(1)superscript𝑛𝑜1n^{o(1)} slack in k𝑘k. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lower bound for coloring G​(n,1/2)𝐺𝑛12G(n,1/2) for even a single round strengthening of the basic SDP in any SDP hierarchy. Our proof relies on a new variant of instance-preserving non-pointwise complete reduction within SoS from coloring a graph to finding large independent sets in it. Our proof is (perhaps surprisingly) short, simple and does not require complicated spectral norm bounds on random matrices with dependent entries that have been otherwise necessary in the proofs of many similar results [BHK+16, HKP+17, KB19, GJJ+20, MRX20]. Our result formally holds for a constraint system where vertices are allowed to belong to multiple color classes; we leave the extension to the formally stronger formulation of coloring, where vertices must belong to unique colors classes, as an outstanding open problem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
