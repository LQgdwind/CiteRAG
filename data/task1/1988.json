Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Linear Span Network for Object Skeleton Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Conventional networks for object skeleton detection are usually hand-crafted. Although effective, they require intensive priori knowledge to configure representative features for objects in different scale granularity. In this paper, we propose adaptive linear span network (AdaLSN), driven by neural architecture search (NAS), to automatically configure and integrate scale-aware features for object skeleton detection. AdaLSN is formulated with the theory of linear span, which provides one of the earliest explanations for multi-scale deep feature fusion. AdaLSN is materialized by defining a mixed unit-pyramid search space, which goes beyond many existing search spaces using unit-level or pyramid-level features. Within the mixed space, we apply genetic architecture search to jointly optimize unit-level operations and pyramid-level connections for adaptive feature space expansion. AdaLSN substantiates its versatility by achieving significantly higher accuracy and latency trade-off compared with state-of-the-arts. It also demonstrates general applicability to image-to-mask tasks such as edge detection and road extraction. Code is available at github.com/sunsmarterjie/SDL-Skeleton.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
