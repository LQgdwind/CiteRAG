      "content": "Paper Title: Advances of the Python‚Äìbased Fluid‚ÄìStructure Interaction capabilities included in SU2\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Current research efforts in aeroelasticity aim at including higher fidelity aerodynamic results into the simulation frameworks. In the present effort, the Python‚Äìbased Fluid‚ÄìStructure Interaction framework of the well known SU2 code has been updated and extended to allow for efficient and fully open-source simulations of detailed aeroelastic phenomena. The interface has been standardised for easier inclusion of other external solvers and the comunication scheme between processors revisited. A native solver has been introduced to solve the structural equations coming from a Nastran‚Äìlike Finite Element Model. The use of high level programming allows to perform simulations with ease and minimum human work. On the other hand, the Computational Fluid Dynamics code of choice has efficient lower level functions that provide a quick turnaround time. Further, the aerodynamic code is currently actively developed and exhibits interesting features for computational aeroelasticity, including an effective means of deforming the mesh. The developed software has been assessed against three different test cases, of increasing complexity. The first test involved the comparison with analytical results for a pitching-plunging airfoil. The second tackled a three-dimensional transonic wing, comparing experimental results. Finally, an entire wind tunnel test, with a flexible half-plane model, has been simulated. In all these tests the code performed well, increasing the confidence that it will be useful for a large range of applications, even in industrial settings. The final goal of the research is to provide with an excellent and free alternative for aeroelastic simulations, that will leverage the use of high-fidelity in the common practise.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
