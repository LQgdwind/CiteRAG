Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning ECG signal features without backpropagation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Representation learning has become a crucial area of research in machine learning, as it aims to discover efficient ways of representing raw data with useful features to increase the effectiveness, scope and applicability of downstream tasks such as classification and prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate representations for time series-type data. This method relies on ideas from theoretical physics to construct a compact representation in a data-driven way, and it can capture both the underlying structure of the data and task-specific information while still remaining intuitive, interpretable and verifiable. This novel methodology aims to identify linear laws that can effectively capture a shared characteristic among samples belonging to a specific class. By subsequently utilizing these laws to generate a classifier-agnostic representation in a forward manner, they become applicable in a generalized setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of ECG signal classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
