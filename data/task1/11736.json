      "content": "Paper Title: Classical Simulability of Quantum Circuits with Shallow Magic Depth\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum magic is a resource that allows quantum computation to surpass classical simulation. Previous results have linked the amount of quantum magic, characterized by the number of TùëáT gates or stabilizer rank, to classical simulability. However, the effect of the distribution of quantum magic on the hardness of simulating a quantum circuit remains open. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of quantum circuits with alternating Clifford and TùëáT layers across three tasks: amplitude estimation, sampling, and evaluating Pauli observables. In the case where all TùëáT gates are distributed in a single layer, performing amplitude estimation and sampling to multiplicative error are already classically intractable under reasonable assumptions, but Pauli observables are easy to evaluate. Surprisingly, with the addition of just one TùëáT gate layer or merely replacing all TùëáT gates with T12superscriptùëá12T^{\\frac{1}{2}}, the Pauli evaluation task reveals a sharp complexity transition from P to GapP-complete. Nevertheless, when the precision requirement is relaxed to 1/poly(n) additive error, we are able to give a polynomial time classical algorithm to compute amplitudes, Pauli observable, and sampling from log‚Å°(n)ùëõ\\log(n) sized marginal distribution for any magic-depth-one circuit that is decomposable into a product of diagonal gates. Our research provides new techniques to simulate highly magical circuits while shedding light on their complexity and their significant dependence on the magic depth.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
