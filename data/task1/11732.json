Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Local Search for Max 𝑐-Cut\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the NP-hard Max c𝑐c-Cut problem, one is given an undirected edge-weighted graph G𝐺G and aims to color the vertices of G𝐺G with c𝑐c colors such that the total weight of edges with distinctly colored endpoints is maximal. The case with c=2𝑐2c=2 is the famous Max Cut problem. To deal with the NP-hardness of this problem, we study parameterized local search algorithms. More precisely, we study LS Max c𝑐c-Cut where we are also given a vertex coloring and an integer k𝑘k and the task is to find a better coloring that changes the color of at most k𝑘k vertices, if such a coloring exists; otherwise, the given coloring is k𝑘k-optimal. We show that, for all c≥2𝑐2c\\geq 2, LS Max c𝑐c-Cut presumably cannot be solved in f​(k)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝒪1f(k)\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} time even on bipartite graphs. We then present an algorithm for LS Max c𝑐c-Cut with running time 𝒪​((3​e​Δ)k⋅c⋅k3⋅Δ⋅n)𝒪⋅superscript3𝑒Δ𝑘𝑐superscript𝑘3Δ𝑛\\mathcal{O}((3e\\Delta)^{k}\\cdot c\\cdot k^{3}\\cdot\\Delta\\cdot n), where ΔΔ\\Delta is the maximum degree of the input graph. Finally, we evaluate the practical performance of this algorithm in a hill-climbing approach as a post-processing for a state-of-the-art heuristic for Max c𝑐c-Cut. We show that using parameterized local search, the results of this state-of-the-art heuristic can be further improved on a set of standard benchmark instances.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
