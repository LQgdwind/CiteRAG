Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding and Testing Generalization of Deep Networks on Out-of-Distribution Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep network models perform excellently on In-Distribution (ID) data, but can significantly fail on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. While developing methods focus on improving OOD generalization, few attention has been paid to evaluating the capability of models to handle OOD data. This study is devoted to analyzing the problem of experimental ID test and designing OOD test paradigm to accurately evaluate the practical performance. Our analysis is based on an introduced categorization of three types of distribution shift to generate OOD data. Main observations include: (1) ID test fails in neither reflecting the actual performance of a single model nor comparing between different models under OOD data. (2) The ID test failure can be ascribed to the learned marginal and conditional spurious correlations resulted from the corresponding distribution shifts. Based on this, we propose novel OOD test paradigms to evaluate the generalization capacity of models to unseen data, and discuss how to use OOD test results to find bugs of models to guide model debugging.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
