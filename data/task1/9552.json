Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robustness Verification of Deep Neural Networks using Star-Based Reachability Analysis with Variable-Length Time Series Input\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data-driven, neural network (NN) based anomaly detection and predictive maintenance are emerging research areas. NN-based analytics of time-series data offer valuable insights into past behaviors and estimates of critical parameters like remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment and state-of-charge (SOC) of batteries. However, input time series data can be exposed to intentional or unintentional noise when passing through sensors, necessitating robust validation and verification of these NNs. This paper presents a case study of the robustness verification approach for time series regression NNs (TSRegNN) using set-based formal methods. It focuses on utilizing variable-length input data to streamline input manipulation and enhance network architecture generalizability. The method is applied to two data sets in the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) application areas: (1) SOC estimation of a Lithium-ion battery and (2) RUL estimation of a turbine engine. The NNs’ robustness is checked using star-based reachability analysis, and several performance measures evaluate the effect of bounded perturbations in the input on network outputs, i.e., future outcomes. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive case study for validating and verifying NN-based analytics of time-series data in real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of robustness testing for accurate and reliable predictions, especially considering the impact of noise on future outcomes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
