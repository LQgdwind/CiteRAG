      "content": "Paper Title: Exact and Approximate Pattern Counting in Degenerate Graphs: New Algorithms, Hardness Results, and Complexity Dichotomies\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problem of counting the copies of a k𝑘k-node graph H𝐻H in an n𝑛n-node graph G𝐺G. Due to the sparsity of real-world graphs, there is considerable interest in understanding the complexity of this problem when the degeneracy d𝑑d of G𝐺G is small. In this work we present several results on this topic. Our main contributions are: • We fully classify the complexity of counting the copies and the induced copies of H𝐻H in d𝑑d-degenerate graphs G𝐺G, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. We prove that the copies of H𝐻H in G𝐺G can be counted in time f​(k,d)⋅nmax⁡(𝗂𝗆𝗇​(H),1)⋅log⁡n⋅𝑓𝑘𝑑superscript𝑛𝗂𝗆𝗇𝐻1𝑛f(k,d)\\cdot n^{\\max(\\mathsf{imn}(H),1)}\\cdot\\log n, where 𝗂𝗆𝗇​(H)𝗂𝗆𝗇𝐻\\mathsf{imn}(H) is the size of the largest induced matching of H𝐻H, and that this is essentially optimal: if the class of allowed patterns has unbounded induced matching number, the problem cannot be solved in time f​(k,d)⋅no​(𝗂𝗆𝗇​(H)/log⁡𝗂𝗆𝗇​(H))⋅𝑓𝑘𝑑superscript𝑛𝑜𝗂𝗆𝗇𝐻𝗂𝗆𝗇𝐻f(k,d)\\cdot n^{o(\\mathsf{imn}(H)/\\log\\mathsf{imn}(H))} for any f𝑓f. We show a similar result for counting induced copies, in which case the relevant parameter of H𝐻H turns out to be its independence number α​(H)𝛼𝐻\\alpha(H). In the language of parameterized complexity, this gives dichotomies in tractable and hard cases when the parameter is k+d𝑘𝑑k+d, and implies that, unless ETH fails, several patterns cannot be counted in time f​(k,d)⋅no​(k/log⁡k)⋅𝑓𝑘𝑑superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘𝑘f(k,d)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}, including k𝑘k-matchings, k𝑘k-independent sets, (induced) k𝑘k-paths, (induced) k𝑘k-cycles, and induced (k,k)𝑘𝑘(k,k)-bicliques. • We introduce a novel family of obstructions, that we call F-gadgets, which are at the heart of our hardness results. We show that counting the homomorphisms from H𝐻H to a graph of bounded degeneracy is hard when H𝐻H has an F𝐹F-gadget of unbounded treewidth. From this result, the hardness results for subgraphs and induced subgraphs above are derived using the complexity monotonicity principle of Curticapean, Dell and Marx (STOC 17) and Chen and Mengel (PODS 16), via a recent approach of Gishboliner, Levanzov and Shapira (ECCC 20). We conjecture that F-gadgets actually characterise the hardness of counting homomorphisms in graphs of bounded degeneracy. Our work proves one part of this conjecture, leaving the other part as an open problem. • We give novel algorithms for approximate counting of subgraphs and induced subgraphs, based on recent reductions to the colourful decision version of the problem by Dell, Lapinskas and Meeks (SODA 20). We show an algorithm that computes an expected ε𝜀\\varepsilon-multiplicative approximation of the number of copies of H𝐻H in G𝐺G in time f​(k,d)⋅ε−2⋅nτ1​(H)+o​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘𝑑superscript𝜀2superscript𝑛subscript𝜏1𝐻𝑜1f(k,d)\\cdot\\varepsilon^{-2}\\cdot n^{\\tau_{1}(H)+o(1)}, where τ1​(H)subscript𝜏1𝐻\\tau_{1}(H) is the dag-treewidth of H𝐻H. For induced copies, we give an algorithm with running time (k​d)O​(k)​ε−2⋅n𝗂𝗆𝗇​(H)+1+o​(1)⋅superscript𝑘𝑑𝑂𝑘superscript𝜀2superscript𝑛𝗂𝗆𝗇𝐻1𝑜1(kd)^{O(k)}\\varepsilon^{-2}\\cdot n^{\\mathsf{imn}(H)+1+o(1)}. This implies, for instance, that we can efficiently approximate the number of induced (k,k)𝑘𝑘(k,k)-bicliques in a degenerate graph, which for non-degenerate graphs is impossible under standard parameterized complexity assumptions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
