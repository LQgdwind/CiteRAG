Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Reminder of its Brittleness: Language Reward Shaping May Hinder Learning for Instruction Following Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Teaching agents to follow complex written instructions has been an important yet elusive goal. One technique for enhancing learning efficiency is language reward shaping (LRS). Within a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, LRS involves training a reward function that rewards behaviours precisely aligned with given language instructions. We argue that the apparent success of LRS is brittle, and prior positive findings can be attributed to weak RL baselines. Specifically, we identified suboptimal LRS designs that reward partially matched trajectories, and we characterised a novel reward perturbation to capture this issue using the concept of loosening task constraints. We provided theoretical and empirical evidence that agents trained using LRS rewards converge more slowly compared to pure RL agents. Our work highlights the brittleness of existing LRS methods, which has been overlooked in the previous studies. 111Code and replication materials is released at Github https://github.com/sino-huang/brittleness˙of˙lrs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
