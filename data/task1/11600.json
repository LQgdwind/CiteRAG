      "content": "Paper Title: Palette Sparsification for Graphs with Sparse Neighborhoods\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A celebrated palette sparsification result of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna states that in every n𝑛n-vertex graph of maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta, sampling Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log n) colors per vertex from {1,…,Δ+1}1…Δ1\\{1,\\ldots,\\Delta+1\\} almost certainly allows for a proper coloring from the sampled colors. Alon and Assadi extended this work proving a similar result for O​(Δ/log⁡Δ)𝑂ΔΔO\\left(\\Delta/\\log\\Delta\\right)-coloring triangle-free graphs. Apart from being interesting results from a combinatorial standpoint, their results have various applications to the design of graph coloring algorithms in different models of computation. In this work, we focus on locally sparse graphs, i.e., graphs with sparse neighborhoods. We say a graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) is k𝑘k-locally-sparse if for each vertex v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, the subgraph G​[N​(v)]𝐺delimited-[]𝑁𝑣G[N(v)] contains at most k𝑘k edges. A celebrated result of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov shows that such graphs are O​(Δ/log⁡(Δ/k))𝑂ΔΔ𝑘O(\\Delta/\\log(\\Delta/\\sqrt{k}))-colorable. For any α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1) and k≪Δ2​αmuch-less-than𝑘superscriptΔ2𝛼k\\ll\\Delta^{2\\alpha}, let G𝐺G be a k𝑘k-locally-sparse graph. We show the following for q=Θ​(Δ/log⁡(Δα/k))𝑞ΘΔsuperscriptΔ𝛼𝑘q=\\Theta\\left(\\Delta/\\log\\left(\\Delta^{\\alpha}/\\sqrt{k}\\right)\\right): • Sampling O​(Δα+log⁡n)𝑂superscriptΔ𝛼𝑛O\\left(\\Delta^{\\alpha}+\\sqrt{\\log n}\\right) colors per vertex is sufficient to obtain a proper q𝑞q-coloring of G𝐺G from the sampled colors. • There exists a single-pass streaming algorithm which computes a proper q𝑞q-coloring of G𝐺G with high probability using O~​(n​Δ2​α)~𝑂𝑛superscriptΔ2𝛼\\tilde{O}\\left(n\\,\\Delta^{2\\alpha}\\right) space. • There exists a randomized non-adaptive sublinear-time algorithm which computes a proper q𝑞q-coloring of G𝐺G with high probability using at most O~​(n32+α2​(1−α))~𝑂superscript𝑛32𝛼21𝛼\\tilde{O}\\left(n^{\\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{\\alpha}{2(1-\\alpha)}}\\right) queries. Setting k=1𝑘1k=1 recovers the aforementioned result of Alon and Assadi for triangle-free graphs. For larger k𝑘k, our algorithmic results are an improvement over earlier work of Alon and Assadi. We establish our palette sparsification result in the more general setting of correspondence coloring where the structural constraints are placed on the correspondence cover as opposed to on the underlying graph. Such a notion has gathered much interest in recent years. A key element in our proof is a proposition which determines sufficient conditions on the correspondence cover ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} for G𝐺G to admit a proper ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-coloring. This result improves upon recent work of Anderson, Kuchukova, and the author and is of independent interest.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
