Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

More precisely, given a set of n𝑛n points in a metric space (P,d)𝑃𝑑(P,d) where each point belongs to one of the ℓℓ\\ell different demographics (i.e., P=P1⊎P2⊎⋯⊎Pℓ𝑃⊎subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2⋯subscript𝑃ℓP=P_{1}\\uplus P_{2}\\uplus\\cdots\\uplus P_{\\ell}) and a set of ℓℓ\\ell intervals [α1,β1],⋯,[αℓ,βℓ]subscript𝛼1subscript𝛽1⋯subscript𝛼ℓsubscript𝛽ℓ[\\alpha_{1},\\beta_{1}],\\cdots,[\\alpha_{\\ell},\\beta_{\\ell}] on desired number of centers from each group, the goal is to pick a set of k𝑘k centers C𝐶C with minimum ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-clustering cost (i.e., (∑v∈Pd​(v,C)p)1/psuperscriptsubscript𝑣𝑃𝑑superscript𝑣𝐶𝑝1𝑝(\\sum_{v\\in P}d(v,C)^{p})^{1/p}) such that for each group i∈ℓ𝑖ℓi\\in\\ell, |C∩Pi|∈[αi,βi]𝐶subscript𝑃𝑖subscript𝛼𝑖subscript𝛽𝑖|C\\cap P_{i}|\\in[\\alpha_{i},\\beta_{i}]. In particular, the fair range ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-clustering captures fair range k𝑘k-center, k𝑘k-median and k𝑘k-means as its special cases. In this work, we provide efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for fair range ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-clustering for all values of p∈[1,∞)𝑝1p\\in[1,\\infty).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
