Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Study of the performance and scalability of federated learning for medical imaging with intermittent clients\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning is a data decentralization privacy-preserving technique used to perform machine or deep learning in a secure way. In this paper we present theoretical aspects about federated learning, such as the presentation of an aggregation operator, different types of federated learning, and issues to be taken into account in relation to the distribution of data from the clients, together with the exhaustive analysis of a use case where the number of clients varies. Specifically, a use case of medical image analysis is proposed, using chest X-Ray images obtained from an open data repository. In addition to the advantages related to privacy, improvements in predictions (in terms of accuracy, loss and area under the curve) and reduction of execution times will be studied with respect to the classical case (the centralized approach). Different clients will be simulated from the training data, selected in an unbalanced manner. The results of considering three or ten clients are exposed and compared between them and against the centralized case. Two different problems related to intermittent clients are discussed, together with two approaches to be followed for each of them. Specifically, this type of problems may occur because in a real scenario some clients may leave the training, and others enter it, and on the other hand because of client technical or connectivity problems. Finally, improvements and future work in the field are proposed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
