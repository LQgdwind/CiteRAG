      "content": "Paper Title: Near-Optimal Explainable 𝑘-Means for All Dimensions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many clustering algorithms are guided by certain cost functions such as the widely-used k𝑘k-means cost. These algorithms divide data points into clusters with often complicated boundaries, creating difficulties in explaining the clustering decision. In a recent work, Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian (ICML 2020) introduced explainable clustering, where the cluster boundaries are axis-parallel hyperplanes and the clustering is obtained by applying a decision tree to the data. The central question here is: how much does the explainability constraint increase the value of the cost function? Given d𝑑d-dimensional data points, we show an efficient algorithm that finds an explainable clustering whose k𝑘k-means cost is at most k1−2/d​poly​(d​log⁡k)superscript𝑘12𝑑poly𝑑𝑘k^{1-2/d}\\,\\mathrm{poly}(d\\log k) times the minimum cost achievable by a clustering without the explainability constraint, assuming k,d≥2𝑘𝑑2k,d\\geq 2. Taking the minimum of this bound and the k​polylog​(k)𝑘polylog𝑘k\\,\\mathrm{polylog}(k) bound in independent work by Makarychev-Shan (ICML 2021), Gamlath-Jia-Polak-Svensson (2021), or Esfandiari-Mirrokni-Narayanan (2021), we get an improved bound of k1−2/d​polylog​(k)superscript𝑘12𝑑polylog𝑘k^{1-2/d}\\,\\mathrm{polylog}(k), which we show is optimal for every choice of k,d≥2𝑘𝑑2k,d\\geq 2 up to a poly-logarithmic factor in k𝑘k. For d=2𝑑2d=2 in particular, we show an O​(log⁡k​log⁡log⁡k)𝑂𝑘𝑘O(\\log k\\log\\log k) bound, improving near-exponentially over the previous best bound of O​(k​log⁡k)𝑂𝑘𝑘O(k\\log k) by Laber and Murtinho (ICML 2021).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
