Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Prototype-Based Self-Explainable Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great ability in modeling graph-structured data for various domains. However, GNNs are known as black-box models that lack interpretability. Without understanding their inner working, we cannot fully trust them, which largely limits their adoption in high-stake scenarios. Though some initial efforts have been taken to interpret the predictions of GNNs, they mainly focus on providing post-hoc explanations using an additional explainer, which could misrepresent the true inner working mechanism of the target GNN. The works on self-explainable GNNs are rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of learning prototype-based self-explainable GNNs that can simultaneously give accurate predictions and prototype-based explanations on predictions. We design a framework which can learn prototype graphs that capture representative patterns of each class as class-level explanations. The learned prototypes are also used to simultaneously make prediction for for a test instance and provide instance-level explanation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both prediction accuracy and explanation quality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
