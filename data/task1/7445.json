Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: HouseDiffusion: Vector Floorplan Generation via a Diffusion Model with Discrete and Continuous Denoising\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The paper presents a novel approach for vector-floorplan generation via a diffusion model, which denoises 2D coordinates of room/door corners with two inference objectives: 1) a single-step noise as the continuous quantity to precisely invert the continuous forward process; and 2) the final 2D coordinate as the discrete quantity to establish geometric incident relationships such as parallelism, orthogonality, and corner-sharing. Our task is graph-conditioned floorplan generation, a common workflow in floorplan design. We represent a floorplan as 1D polygonal loops, each of which corresponds to a room or a door. Our diffusion model employs a Transformer architecture at the core, which controls the attention masks based on the input graph-constraint and directly generates vector-graphics floorplans via a discrete and continuous denoising process. We have evaluated our approach on RPLAN dataset. The proposed approach makes significant improvements in all the metrics against the state-of-the-art with significant margins, while being capable of generating non-Manhattan structures and controlling the exact number of corners per room.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
