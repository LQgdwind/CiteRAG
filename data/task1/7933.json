Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: CRL+: A Novel Semi-Supervised Deep Active Contrastive Representation Learning-Based Text Classification Model for Insurance Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Financial sector and especially the insurance industry collect vast volumes of text on a daily basis and through multiple channels (their agents, customer care centers, emails, social networks, and web in general). The information collected includes policies, expert and health reports, claims and complaints, results of surveys, and relevant social media posts. It is difficult to effectively extract label, classify, and interpret the essential information from such varied and unstructured material. Therefore, the Insurance Industry is among the ones that can benefit from applying technologies for the intelligent analysis of free text through Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, CRL+, a novel text classification model combining Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) and Active Learning is proposed to handle the challenge of using semi-supervised learning for text classification. In this method, supervised (CRL) is used to train a RoBERTa transformer model to encode the textual data into a contrastive representation space and then classify using a classification layer. This (CRL)-based transformer model is used as the base model in the proposed Active Learning mechanism to classify all the data in an iterative manner. The proposed model is evaluated using unstructured obituary data with objective to determine the cause of the death from the data. This model is compared with the CRL model and an Active Learning model with the RoBERTa base model. The experiment shows that the proposed method can outperform both methods for this specific task.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
