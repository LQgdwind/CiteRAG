      "content": "Paper Title: Metaheuristic conditional neural network for harvesting skyrmionic metastable states\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a metaheuristic conditional neural-network-based method aimed at identifying physically interesting metastable states in a potential energy surface of high rugosity. To demonstrate how this method works, we identify and analyze spin textures with topological charge QùëÑQ ranging from 1 to ‚àí1313-13 (where antiskyrmions have Q<0ùëÑ0Q<0) in the Pd/Fe/Ir(111) system, which we model using a classical atomistic spin Hamiltonian based on parameters computed from density functional theory. To facilitate the harvest of relevant spin textures, we make use of the newly developed Segment Anything Model (SAM). Spin textures with QùëÑQ ranging from ‚àí33-3 to ‚àí66-6 are further analyzed using finite-temperature spin-dynamics simulations. We observe that for temperatures up to around 20 K, lifetimes longer than 200 ps are predicted, and that when these textures decay, new topological spin textures are formed. We also find that the relative stability of the spin textures depend linearly on the topological charge, but only when comparing the most stable antiskyrmions for each topological charge. In general, the number of holes (i.e., non-self-intersecting curves that define closed domain walls in the structure) in the spin texture is an important predictor of stability ‚Äì the more holes, the less stable is the texture. Methods for systematic identification and characterization of complex metastable skyrmionic textures ‚Äì such as the one demonstrated here ‚Äì are highly relevant for advancements in the field of topological spintronics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
