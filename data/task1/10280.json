      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Analyses Applied to Computer System Performance: Review and Call for Further Studies\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We review studies based on analytic (A) and simulation (S) methods for hierarchical performance analysis of Queueing Network - QN models. A at lower and S at higher level have been applied most. The proposed methods result in an order of magnitude reduction in performance evaluation cost with respect to simulation. The computational cost at the lower level to obtain an exact solution is reduced when the computer system can be modeled as a product-form QN amenable to a low cost solution. A Continuous Time Markov Chain - CTMC or discrete-event simulation can then be used at the higher level. We first consider a multiprogrammed transaction - txn processing system with Poisson arrivals and predeclared lock requests. Txns with lock conflicts with active txns are held in a FCFS queue and txns are activated after they acquire all requested locks. Txn throughputs obtained by the analysis of multiprogrammed computer systems serve as the transition rates in a higher level CTMC to determine txn response times. We next analyze a task system where task precedence relationships are specified by a directed acyclic graph to determine its makespan. Task service demands are specified on the devices of a computer system. The composition of tasks in execution determines their processing time and throughputs, which serve as transition rates among the states of the CTMC model. To reduce memory space requirements the CTMC is built and solved one set of task completions at a time. As a third example we consider the hierarchical simulation of a timesharing system with two user classes. Txn throughputs in processing various combinations of requests are obtained by analyzing a closed product-form QN model. A discrete event simulator is provided. More detailed QN modeling parameters, such as the distribution of the number of cycles of tasks consisting of Fork/Join (F/J) requests affect performance. This detail can be taken into account in Schwetmanâ€™s hybrid simulation method, which counts remaining number of cycles in CSM-like queueing model. We discuss an extension to hybrid simulation to adjust job service demands according to elapsed time, rather than counting cycles. A section reviewing related studies is provided. Equilibrium Point Analysis to reduce the computational cost in applying hierarchical analysis is presented in the Appendix. The discussion is applicable to performance modeling of manufacturing systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 69 most likely reference titles for this paper.
