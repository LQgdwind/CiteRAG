Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Capsule networks with non-iterative cluster routing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Capsule networks use routing algorithms to flow information between consecutive layers. In the existing routing procedures, capsules produce predictions (termed votes) for capsules of the next layer. In a nutshell, the next-layer capsule’s input is a weighted sum over all the votes it receives. In this paper, we propose non-iterative cluster routing for capsule networks. In the proposed cluster routing, capsules produce vote clusters instead of individual votes for next-layer capsules, and each vote cluster sends its centroid to a next-layer capsule. Generally speaking, the next-layer capsule’s input is a weighted sum over the centroid of each vote cluster it receives. The centroid that comes from a cluster with a smaller variance is assigned a larger weight in the weighted sum process. Compared with the state-of-the-art capsule networks, the proposed capsule networks achieve the best accuracy on the Fashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets with fewer parameters, and achieve the best accuracy on the smallNORB and CIFAR-10 datasets with a moderate number of parameters. The proposed capsule networks also produce capsules with disentangled representation and generalize well to images captured at novel viewpoints. The proposed capsule networks also preserve 2D spatial information of an input image in the capsule channels: if the capsule channels are rotated, the object reconstructed from these channels will be rotated by the same transformation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
