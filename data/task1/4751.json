      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Attention-guided Graph Clustering with Dual Self-supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing deep embedding clustering methods fail to sufficiently utilize the available off-the-shelf information from feature embeddings and cluster assignments, limiting their performance. To this end, we propose a novel method, namely deep attention-guided graph clustering with dual self-supervision (DAGC). Specifically, DAGC first utilizes a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to adaptively integrate the features of the auto-encoder and the graph convolutional network in each layer and then uses a scale-wise fusion module to dynamically concatenate the multi-scale features in different layers. Such modules are capable of learning an informative feature embedding via an attention-based mechanism. In addition, we design a distribution-wise fusion module that leverages cluster assignments to acquire clustering results directly. To better explore the off-the-shelf information from the cluster assignments, we develop a dual self-supervision solution consisting of a soft self-supervision strategy with a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss and a hard self-supervision strategy with a pseudo supervision loss. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets validate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Especially, our method improves the ARI by more than 10.29% over the best baseline. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/ZhihaoPENG-CityU/DAGC.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
