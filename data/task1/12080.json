      "content": "Paper Title: Hindi audio-video-Deepfake (HAV-DF): A Hindi language-based Audio-video Deepfake Dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deepfakes, while technologically impressive, present a dual-edged sword. On the one hand, they have potential for innovation and creativity. However, their misuse poses significant risks to privacy, trust, and security, making it essential to develop detection tools and ethical frameworks to mitigate harm. With a vast Hindi-speaking population, India is particularly vulnerable to deepfake-driven misinformation campaigns. Fake videos or speeches in Hindi can have an enormous impact on rural and semi-urban communities, where digital literacy tends to be lower and people are more inclined to trust video content. The development of effective frameworks and detection tools to combat deepfake misuse requires high-quality, diverse, and extensive datasets. The existing popular datasets like FF-DF (FaceForensics++), and DFDC (DeepFake Detection Challenge) are based on English language, and there is a lack of regional language datasets. Hence, the aim of this paper is to create a first novel Hindi deep fake dataset, named “Hindi audio-video-Deepfake” (HAV-DF). The dataset has been generated using the faceswap, lipsyn and voice cloning methods. This multistep process allows us to create a rich, varied dataset that captures the nuances of Hindi speech and facial expressions, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating deepfake detection models in a Hindi language context. It is unique of its kind as all of the previous datasets contain either deepfake videos or synthesized audio. This type of deepfake dataset can be used for training a detector for both deepfake video and audio datasets. Notably, the newly introduced HAV-DF dataset demonstrates lower detection accuracy’s across existing detection methods like Headpose, Xception-c40 Mesonet, etc. Compared to other well-known datasets FF-DF (FaceForensics++), and DFDC (DeepFake Detection Challenge). This trend suggests that the HAV-DF dataset presents deeper challenges to detect, possibly due to its focus on Hindi language content and diverse manipulation techniques. Furthermore, the HAV-DF dataset represents a significant contribution to the field, addressing the previous lack of Hindi-specific deepfake datasets and enabling more effective development of multilingual deepfake identification systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
