Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning: A Fully Distributed Cooperative Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Privacy-sensitive data is stored in autonomous vehicles, smart devices, or sensor nodes that can move around with making opportunistic contact with each other. Federation among such nodes was mainly discussed in the context of federated learning with a centralized mechanism in many works. However, because of multi-vendor issues, those nodes do not want to rely on a specific server operated by a third party for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a wireless ad hoc federated learning (WAFL) – a fully distributed cooperative machine learning organized by the nodes physically nearby. WAFL can develop generalized models from Non-IID datasets stored in distributed nodes locally by exchanging and aggregating them with each other over opportunistic node-to-node contacts. In our benchmark-based evaluation with various opportunistic networks, WAFL has achieved higher accuracy of 94.8-96.3% than the self-training case of 84.7%. All our evaluation results show that WAFL can train and converge the model parameters from highly-partitioned Non-IID datasets over opportunistic networks without any centralized mechanisms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
