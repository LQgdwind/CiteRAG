Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Special-case Algorithms for Blackbox Radical Membership, Nullstellensatz and Transcendence Degree\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Radical membership testing, resp. its special case of Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz (HN), is a fundamental computational algebra problem. It is NP-hard; and has a famous PSPACE algorithm due to effective Nullstellensatz bounds. We identify a useful case of these problems where practical algorithms, & improved bounds, could be given— When transcendence degree r𝑟r of the input polynomials is smaller than the number of variables n𝑛n. If d𝑑d is the degree bound on the input polynomials, then we solve radical membership (even if input polynomials are blackboxes) in around drsuperscript𝑑𝑟d^{r} time. The prior best was >dnabsentsuperscript𝑑𝑛>d^{n} time (always, dn≥drsuperscript𝑑𝑛superscript𝑑𝑟d^{n}\\geq d^{r}). Also, we significantly improve effective Nullstellensatz degree-bound, when r≪nmuch-less-than𝑟𝑛r\\ll n. Structurally, our proof shows that these problems reduce to the case of r+1𝑟1r+1 polynomials of transcendence degree ≥rabsent𝑟\\geq r. This input instance (corresponding to none or a unique annihilator) is at the core of HN’s hardness. Our proof methods invoke basic algebraic-geometry.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
