However, while recent voltage references can meet most of these requirements with a handful of transistors, current references remain rather complex, requiring significant design time and silicon area. In this paper, we present a family of simple current references consisting of a two-transistor (2T) ultra-low-power voltage reference, buffered onto a voltage-to-current converter by a single transistor. Two topologies are fabricated in a 0.18-μ𝜇\\mum partially-depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology and measured over 10 dies. First, a 7T nA-range proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) reference intended for constant-gmsubscript𝑔𝑚g_{m} biasing of subthreshold operational amplifiers demonstrates a 0.096-nA current with a line sensitivity (LS) of 1.48 %percent\\%/V, a temperature coefficient (TC) of 0.75 %percent\\%/∘C, and a variability (σ/μ)𝜎𝜇(\\sigma/\\mu) of 1.66 %percent\\%. Then, two 4T+1R μ𝜇\\muA-range constant-with-temperature (CWT) references with (resp. without) TC calibration exhibit a 1.09-μ𝜇\\muA (resp. 0.99-μ𝜇\\muA) current with a 0.21-%percent\\%/V (resp. 0.20-%percent\\%/V) LS, a 38-ppm/∘C (resp. 290-ppm/∘C) TC, and a 0.87-%percent\\% (resp. 0.65-%percent\\%) (σ/μ)𝜎𝜇(\\sigma/\\mu). In addition, portability to common scaled CMOS technologies, such as 65-nm bulk and 28-nm fully-depleted SOI, is discussed and validated through post-layout simulations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
