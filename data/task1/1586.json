Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Horizon Value Estimation for Model-based Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing model-based value expansion methods typically leverage a world model for value estimation with a fixed rollout horizon to assist policy learning. However, the fixed rollout with an inaccurate model has a potential to harm the learning process. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using the model knowledge for value expansion adaptively. We propose a novel method called Dynamic-horizon Model-based Value Expansion (DMVE) to adjust the world model usage with different rollout horizons. Inspired by reconstruction-based techniques that can be applied for visual data novelty detection, we utilize a world model with a reconstruction module for image feature extraction, in order to acquire more precise value estimation. The raw and the reconstructed images are both used to determine the appropriate horizon for adaptive value expansion. On several benchmark visual control tasks, experimental results show that DMVE outperforms all baselines in sample efficiency and final performance, indicating that DMVE can achieve more effective and accurate value estimation than state-of-the-art model-based methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
