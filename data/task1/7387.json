      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Collaborative Learning via Representation Sharing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Privacy-preserving machine learning has become a key conundrum for multi-party artificial intelligence. Federated learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) are two frameworks that enable collaborative learning while keeping the data private (on device). In FL, each data holder trains a model locally and releases it to a central server for aggregation. In SL, the clients must release individual cut-layer activations (smashed data) to the server and wait for its response (during both inference and back propagation). While relevant in several settings, both of these schemes have a high communication cost, rely on server-level computation algorithms and do not allow for tunable levels of collaboration. In this work, we present a novel approach for privacy-preserving machine learning, where the clients collaborate via online knowledge distillation using a contrastive loss (contrastive w.r.t. the labels). The goal is to ensure that the participants learn similar features on similar classes without sharing their input data. To do so, each client releases averaged last hidden layer activations of similar labels to a central server that only acts as a relay (i.e., is not involved in the training or aggregation of the models). Then, the clients download these last layer activations (feature representations) of the ensemble of users and distill their knowledge in their personal model using a contrastive objective. For cross-device applications (i.e., small local datasets and limited computational capacity), this approach increases the utility of the models compared to independent learning and other federated knowledge distillation (FD) schemes, is communication efficient and is scalable with the number of clients. We prove theoretically that our framework is well-posed, and we benchmark its performance against standard FD and FL on various datasets using different model architectures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
