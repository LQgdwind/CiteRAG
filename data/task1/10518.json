Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Diverse Policies with Soft Self-Generated Guidance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) with sparse and deceptive rewards is challenging because non-zero rewards are rarely obtained. Hence, the gradient calculated by the agent can be stochastic and without valid information. Recent studies that utilize memory buffers of previous experiences can lead to a more efficient learning process. However, existing methods often require these experiences to be successful and may overly exploit them, which can cause the agent to adopt suboptimal behaviors. This paper develops an approach that uses diverse past trajectories for faster and more efficient online RL, even if these trajectories are suboptimal or not highly rewarded. The proposed algorithm combines a policy improvement step with an additional exploration step using offline demonstration data. The main contribution of this paper is that by regarding diverse past trajectories as guidance, instead of imitating them, our method directs its policy to follow and expand past trajectories while still being able to learn without rewards and approach optimality. Furthermore, a novel diversity measurement is introduced to maintain the team’s diversity and regulate exploration. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and deceptive rewards. Compared with the existing RL methods, the experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithm is significantly better than the baseline methods regarding diverse exploration and avoiding local optima.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
