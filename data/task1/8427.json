Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: CoT-MAE v2: Contextual Masked Auto-Encoder with Multi-view Modeling for Passage Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Growing techniques have been emerging to improve the performance of passage retrieval. As an effective representation bottleneck pre-training technique, the contextual masked auto-encoder utilizes contextual embedding to assist in the reconstruction of passages. However, it only uses a single auto-encoding pre-task for dense representation pre-training. This study brings multi-view modeling to the contextual masked auto-encoder. Firstly, multi-view representation utilizes both dense and sparse vectors as multi-view representations, aiming to capture sentence semantics from different aspects. Moreover, multi-view decoding paradigm utilizes both auto-encoding and auto-regressive decoders in representation bottleneck pre-training, aiming to provide both reconstructive and generative signals for better contextual representation pre-training. We refer to this multi-view pre-training method as CoT-MAE v2. Through extensive experiments, we show that CoT-MAE v2 is effective and robust on large-scale passage retrieval benchmarks and out-of-domain zero-shot benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
