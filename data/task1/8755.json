Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scale-Adaptive Balancing of Exploration and Exploitation in Classical Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Balancing exploration and exploitation has been an important problem in both adversarial games and automated planning. While it has been extensively analyzed in the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) literature, and the game community has achieved great success with MAB-based Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods, the symbolic planning community has struggled to advance in this area. We describe how Upper Confidence Bound 1‚Äôs (UCB1‚Äôs) assumption of reward distributions with known bounded support shared among siblings (arms) is violated when MCTS/Trial-based Heuristic Tree Search (THTS) in previous work uses heuristic values of search nodes in classical planning problems as rewards. To address this issue, we propose a new Gaussian bandit, UCB1-Normal2, and analyze its regret bound. It is variance-aware like UCB1-Normal and UCB-V, but has a distinct advantage: it neither shares UCB-V‚Äôs assumption of known bounded support nor relies on UCB1-Normal‚Äôs unfounded conjectures on Student‚Äôs tùë°t and œá2superscriptùúí2\\chi^{2} distributions. Our theoretical analysis predicts that UCB1-Normal2 will perform well when the estimated variance is accurate, which can be expected in deterministic, discrete, finite state-space search, as in classical planning. Our empirical evaluation confirms that MCTS combined with UCB1-Normal2 outperforms Greedy Best First Search (traditional baseline) as well as MCTS with other bandits.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
