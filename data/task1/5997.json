Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Representation Power of Graph Neural Networks: Improved Expressivity via Algebraic Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite the remarkable success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the common belief is that their representation power is limited and that they are at most as expressive as the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm. In this paper, we argue the opposite and show that standard GNNs, with anonymous inputs, produce more discriminative representations than the WL algorithm. Our novel analysis employs linear algebraic tools and characterizes the representation power of GNNs with respect to the eigenvalue decomposition of the graph operators. We prove that GNNs are able to generate distinctive outputs from white uninformative inputs, for, at least, all graphs that have different eigenvalues. We also show that simple convolutional architectures with white inputs, produce equivariant features that count the closed paths in the graph and are provably more expressive than the WL representations. Thorough experimental analysis on graph isomorphism and graph classification datasets corroborates our theoretical results and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
