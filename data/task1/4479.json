Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Local and Global Context-Based Pairwise Models for Sentence Ordering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Sentence Ordering refers to the task of rearranging a set of sentences into the appropriate coherent order. For this task, most previous approaches have explored global context-based end-to-end methods using Sequence Generation techniques. In this paper, we put forward a set of robust local and global context-based pairwise ordering strategies, leveraging which our prediction strategies outperform all previous works in this domain. Our proposed encoding method utilizes the paragraph’s rich global contextual information to predict the pairwise order using novel transformer architectures. Analysis of the two proposed decoding strategies helps better explain error propagation in pairwise models. This approach is the most accurate pure pairwise model and our encoding strategy also significantly improves the performance of other recent approaches that use pairwise models, including the previous state-of-the-art, demonstrating the research novelty and generalizability of this work. Additionally, we show how the pre-training task for ALBERT helps it to significantly outperform BERT, despite having considerably lesser parameters. The extensive experimental results, architectural analysis and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed models compared to the previous state-of-the-art, besides providing a much better understanding of the functioning of pairwise models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
