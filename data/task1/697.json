      "content": "Paper Title: Rigid Matrices From Rectangular PCPs or: Hard Claims Have Complex Proofs A conference version of this paper appeared in Proc. 61st FOCS, 2020 [BHPT20].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a variant of PCPs, that we refer to as rectangular PCPs, wherein proofs are thought of as square matrices, and the random coins used by the verifier can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, one determining the row of each query and the other determining the column. We construct PCPs that are efficient, short, smooth and (almost-)rectangular. As a key application, we show that proofs for hard languages in 𝖭𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤​(2n)𝖭𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤superscript2𝑛\\mathsf{NTIME}(2^{n}), when viewed as matrices, are rigid infinitely often. This strengthens and simplifies a recent result of Alman and Chen [FOCS, 2019] constructing explicit rigid matrices in 𝖥𝖭𝖯𝖥𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{FNP}. Namely, we prove the following theorem: • There is a constant δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1) such that there is an 𝖥𝖭𝖯𝖥𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{FNP}-machine that, for infinitely many N𝑁N, on input 1Nsuperscript1𝑁1^{N} outputs N×N𝑁𝑁N\\times N matrices with entries in 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}_{2} that are δ​N2𝛿superscript𝑁2\\delta N^{2}-far (in Hamming distance) from matrices of rank at most 2log⁡N/Ω​(log⁡log⁡N)superscript2𝑁Ω𝑁2^{\\log N/\\Omega(\\log\\log N)}. Our construction of rectangular PCPs starts with an analysis of how randomness yields queries in the Reed–Muller-based outer PCP of Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan and Vadhan [SICOMP, 2006; CCC, 2005]. We then show how to preserve rectangularity under PCP composition and a smoothness-inducing transformation. This warrants refined and stronger notions of rectangularity, which we prove for the outer PCP and its transforms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
