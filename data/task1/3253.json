      "content": "Paper Title: One-way communication complexity and non-adaptive decision trees1footnote 11footnote 1This paper includes and improves upon results from an earlier unpublished manuscript of one of the authors [San17].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the relationship between various one-way communication complexity measures of a composed function with the analogous decision tree complexity of the outer function. We consider two gadgets: the AND function on 2 inputs, and the Inner Product on a constant number of inputs. More generally, we show the following when the gadget is Inner Product on 2​b2𝑏2b input bits for all b≥2𝑏2b\\geq 2, denoted 𝖨𝖯𝖨𝖯\\mathsf{IP}. • If f𝑓f is a total Boolean function that depends on all of its n𝑛n input bits, then the bounded-error one-way quantum communication complexity of f∘𝖨𝖯𝑓𝖨𝖯f\\circ\\mathsf{IP} equals Ω​(n​(b−1))Ω𝑛𝑏1\\Omega(n(b-1)). • If f𝑓f is a partial Boolean function, then the deterministic one-way communication complexity of f∘𝖨𝖯𝑓𝖨𝖯f\\circ\\mathsf{IP} is at least Ω​(b⋅𝖣dt→​(f))Ω⋅𝑏superscriptsubscript𝖣dt→𝑓\\Omega(b\\cdot\\mathsf{D}_{\\mathrm{dt}}^{\\rightarrow}(f)), where 𝖣dt→​(f)superscriptsubscript𝖣dt→𝑓\\mathsf{D}_{\\mathrm{dt}}^{\\rightarrow}(f) denotes non-adaptive decision tree complexity of f𝑓f. To prove our quantum lower bound, we first show a lower bound on the VC-dimension of f∘𝖨𝖯𝑓𝖨𝖯f\\circ\\mathsf{IP}. We then appeal to a result of Klauck [STOC’00], which immediately yields our quantum lower bound. Our deterministic lower bound relies on a combinatorial result independently proven by Ahlswede and Khachatrian [Adv. Appl. Math.’98], and Frankl and Tokushige [Comb.’99]. It is known due to a result of Montanaro and Osborne [arXiv’09] that the deterministic one-way communication complexity of f∘𝖷𝖮𝖱𝑓𝖷𝖮𝖱f\\circ\\mathsf{XOR} equals the non-adaptive parity decision tree complexity of f𝑓f. In contrast, we show the following when the inner gadget is the AND function on 2 input bits. • There exists a function for which even the quantum non-adaptive AND decision tree complexity of f𝑓f is exponentially large in the deterministic one-way communication complexity of f∘𝖠𝖭𝖣𝑓𝖠𝖭𝖣f\\circ\\mathsf{AND}. • However, for symmetric functions f𝑓f, the non-adaptive AND decision tree complexity of f𝑓f is at most quadratic in the (even two-way) communication complexity of f∘𝖠𝖭𝖣𝑓𝖠𝖭𝖣f\\circ\\mathsf{AND}. In view of the first bullet, a lower bound on non-adaptive AND decision tree complexity of f𝑓f does not lift to a lower bound on one-way communication complexity of f∘𝖠𝖭𝖣𝑓𝖠𝖭𝖣f\\circ\\mathsf{AND}. The proof of the first bullet above uses the well-studied Odd-Max-Bit function. For the second bullet, we first observe a connection between the one-way communication complexity of f𝑓f and the Möbius sparsity of f𝑓f, and then give a lower bound on the Möbius sparsity of symmetric functions. An upper bound on the non-adaptive AND decision tree complexity of symmetric functions follows implicitly from prior work on combinatorial group testing; for the sake of completeness, we include a proof of this result. It is well known that the rank of the communication matrix of a function F𝐹F is an upper bound on its deterministic one-way communication complexity. This bound is known to be tight for some F𝐹F. However, in our final result we show that this is not the case when F=f∘𝖠𝖭𝖣𝐹𝑓𝖠𝖭𝖣F=f\\circ\\mathsf{AND}. More precisely we show that for all f𝑓f, the deterministic one-way communication complexity of F=f∘𝖠𝖭𝖣𝐹𝑓𝖠𝖭𝖣F=f\\circ\\mathsf{AND} is at most (rank​(MF))​(1−Ω​(1))ranksubscript𝑀𝐹1Ω1(\\mathrm{rank}(M_{F}))(1-\\Omega(1)), where MFsubscript𝑀𝐹M_{F} denotes the communication matrix of F𝐹F.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
