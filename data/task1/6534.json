      "content": "Paper Title: Finite-Time Analysis of Asynchronous Q-learning under Diminishing Step-Size from Control-Theoretic View\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Q-learning has long been one of the most popular reinforcement learning algorithms, and theoretical analysis of Q-learning has been an active research topic for decades. Although researches on asymptotic convergence analysis of Q-learning have a long tradition, non-asymptotic convergence has only recently come under active study. The main goal of this paper is to investigate new finite-time analysis of asynchronous Q-learning under Markovian observation models via a control system viewpoint. In particular, we introduce a discrete-time time-varying switching system model of Q-learning with diminishing step-sizes for our analysis, which significantly improves recent development of the switching system analysis with constant step-sizes, and leads to ùí™‚Äã(log‚Å°kk)ùí™ùëòùëò\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log k}{k}}\\right) convergence rate that is comparable to or better than most of the state of the art results in the literature. In the mean while, a technique using the similarly transformation is newly applied to avoid the difficulty in the analysis posed by diminishing step-sizes. The proposed analysis brings in additional insights, covers different scenarios, and provides new simplified templates for analysis to deepen our understanding on Q-learning via its unique connection to discrete-time switching systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
