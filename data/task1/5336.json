Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness Results for Laplacians of Simplicial Complexes via Sparse-Linear Equation Complete Gadgets\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study linear equations in combinatorial Laplacians of kùëòk-dimensional simplicial complexes (kùëòk-complexes), a natural generalization of graph Laplacians. Combinatorial Laplacians play a crucial role in homology and are a central tool in topology. Beyond this, they have various applications in data analysis and physical modeling problems. It is known that nearly-linear time solvers exist for graph Laplacians. However, nearly-linear time solvers for combinatorial Laplacians are only known for restricted classes of complexes. This paper shows that linear equations in combinatorial Laplacians of 2-complexes are as hard to solve as general linear equations. More precisely, for any constant c‚â•1ùëê1c\\geq 1, if we can solve linear equations in combinatorial Laplacians of 2-complexes up to high accuracy in time O~‚Äã((#‚Äã of nonzero coefficients)c)~ùëÇsuperscript# of nonzero coefficientsùëê\\tilde{O}((\\#\\text{ of nonzero coefficients})^{c}), then we can solve general linear equations with polynomially bounded integer coefficients and condition numbers up to high accuracy in time O~‚Äã((#‚Äã of nonzero coefficients)c)~ùëÇsuperscript# of nonzero coefficientsùëê\\tilde{O}((\\#\\text{ of nonzero coefficients})^{c}). We prove this by a nearly-linear time reduction from general linear equations to combinatorial Laplacians of 2-complexes. Our reduction preserves the sparsity of the problem instances up to poly-logarithmic factors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
