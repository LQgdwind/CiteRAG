      "content": "Paper Title: GMKF: Generalized Moment Kalman Filter for Polynomial Systems with Arbitrary Noise\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper develops a new filtering approach for state estimation in polynomial systems corrupted by arbitrary noise, which commonly arise in robotics. We first consider a batch setup where we perform state estimation using all data collected from the initial to the current time. We formulate the batch state estimation problem as a Polynomial Optimization Problem (POP) and relax the assumption of Gaussian noise by specifying a finite number of moments of the noise. We solve the resulting POP using a moment relaxation and prove that under suitable conditions on the rank of the relaxation, (i) we can extract a provably optimal estimate from the moment relaxation, and (ii) we can obtain a belief representation from the dual (sum-of-squares) relaxation. We then turn our attention to the filtering setup and apply similar insights to develop a Generalized Moment Kalman Filter (GMKF) for recursive state estimation in polynomial systems with arbitrary noise. The GMKF formulates the prediction and update steps as POPs and solves them using moment relaxations, carrying over a possibly non-Gaussian belief. In the linear-Gaussian case, GMKF reduces to the standard Kalman Filter. We demonstrate that GMKF performs well under highly non-Gaussian noise and outperforms common alternatives, including the Extended and Unscented Kalman Filter, and their variants on matrix Lie group.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
