Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Static and Animated 3D Scene Generation from Free-form Text Descriptions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generating coherent and useful image/video scenes from a free-form textual description is technically a very difficult problem to handle. Textual description of the same scene can vary greatly from person to person, or sometimes even for the same person from time to time. As the choice of words and syntax vary while preparing a textual description, it is challenging for the system to reliably produce a consistently desirable output from different forms of language input. The prior works of scene generation have been mostly confined to rigorous sentence structures of text input which restrict the freedom of users to write description. In our work, we study a new pipeline that aims to generate static as well as animated 3D scenes from different types of free-form textual scene description without any major restriction. In particular, to keep our study practical and tractable, we focus on a small subspace of all possible 3D scenes, containing various combinations of cube, cylinder and sphere. We design a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we encode the free-form text using an encoder-decoder neural architecture. In the second stage, we generate a 3D scene based on the generated encoding. Our neural architecture exploits state-of-the-art language model as encoder to leverage rich contextual encoding and a new multi-head decoder to predict multiple features of an object in the scene simultaneously. For our experiments, we generate a large synthetic data-set which contains 13,00,000 and 14,00,000 samples of unique static and animated scene descriptions, respectively. We achieve 98.427% accuracy on test data set in detecting the 3D objects features successfully. Our work shows a proof of concept of one approach towards solving the problem, and we believe with enough training data, the same pipeline can be expanded to handle even broader set of 3D scene generation problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
