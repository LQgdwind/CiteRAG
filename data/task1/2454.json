Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Empirical Evaluation of Supervision Signals for Style Transfer Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Text style transfer has gained increasing attention from the research community over the recent years. However, the proposed approaches vary in many ways, which makes it hard to assess the individual contribution of the model components. In style transfer, the most important component is the optimization technique used to guide the learning in the absence of parallel training data. In this work we empirically compare the dominant optimization paradigms which provide supervision signals during training: backtranslation, adversarial training and reinforcement learning. We find that backtranslation has model-specific limitations, which inhibits training style transfer models. Reinforcement learning shows the best performance gains, while adversarial training, despite its popularity, does not offer an advantage over the latter alternative. In this work we also experiment with Minimum Risk Training Och (2003), a popular technique in the machine translation community, which, to our knowledge, has not been empirically evaluated in the task of style transfer. We fill this research gap and empirically show its efficacy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
