Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Large Language Models Vote: Prompting for Rare Disease Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasizes the need for accurate and efficient prompting approaches. The use of LLMs in Few-Shot Learning (FSL) settings, where data is scarce, has become a standard practice. FSL has also become popular in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) subdomains, including AI for health. Rare diseases affect a small fraction of the population, and due to limited data availability, their identification from clinical notes inherently requires FSL techniques. Manual data collection and annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose Models-Vote Prompting (MVP), an ensemble prompting approach for improving the performance of LLM queries in FSL settings. MVP works by prompting several LLMs to perform the same task and then conducting a majority vote on the resulting outputs. The proposed method achieves improved results to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare disease identification and classification tasks. MVP performance rivals that of well-known Self-Consistency (SC) prompting. In addition, we introduce a novel rare disease dataset for FSL, reproducible to those who signed the MIMIC-IV Data Use Agreement (DUA). Furthermore, we also assess the feasibility of using JSON-augmented prompts for automating generative LLM evaluation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
