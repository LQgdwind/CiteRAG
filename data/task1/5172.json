Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Frequent Itemset-driven Search for Finding Minimum Node Separators in Complex Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Finding an optimal set of critical nodes in a complex network has been a long-standing problem in the fields of both artificial intelligence and operations research. Potential applications include epidemic control, network security, carbon emission monitoring, emergence response, drug design, and vulnerability assessment. In this work, we consider the problem of finding a minimal node separator whose removal separates a graph into multiple different connected components with fewer than a limited number of vertices in each component. To solve it, we propose a frequent itemset-driven search approach, which integrates the concept of frequent itemset mining in data mining into the well-known memetic search framework. Starting from a high-quality population built by the solution construction and population repair procedures, it iteratively employs the frequent itemset recombination operator (to generate promising offspring solution based on itemsets that frequently occur in high-quality solutions), tabu search-based simulated annealing (to find high-quality local optima), population repair procedure (to modify the population), and rank-based population management strategy (to guarantee a healthy population). Extensive evaluations on 50 widely used benchmark instances show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, it discovers 29 new upper bounds and matches 18 previous best-known bounds. Finally, experimental analyses are performed to confirm the effectiveness of key algorithmic modules of the proposed method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
