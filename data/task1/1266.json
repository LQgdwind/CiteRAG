Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Defense Against Byzantine Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning, as a distributed learning that conducts the training on the local devices without accessing to the training data, is vulnerable to Byzatine poisoning adversarial attacks. We argue that the federated learning model has to avoid those kind of adversarial attacks through filtering out the adversarial clients by means of the federated aggregation operator. We propose a dynamic federated aggregation operator that dynamically discards those adversarial clients and allows to prevent the corruption of the global learning model. We assess it as a defense against adversarial attacks deploying a deep learning classification model in a federated learning setting on the Fed-EMNIST Digits, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets. The results show that the dynamic selection of the clients to aggregate enhances the performance of the global learning model and discards the adversarial and poor (with low quality models) clients.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
