Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Special Session: Approximation and Fault Resiliency of DNN Accelerators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep Learning, and in particular, Deep Neural Network (DNN) is nowadays widely used in many scenarios, including safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. In this context, besides energy efficiency and performance, reliability plays a crucial role since a system failure can jeopardize human life. As with any other device, the reliability of hardware architectures running DNNs has to be evaluated, usually through costly fault injection campaigns. This paper explores approximation and fault resiliency of DNN accelerators. We propose to use approximate (AxC) arithmetic circuits to agilely emulate errors in hardware without performing fault injection on the DNN. To allow fast evaluation of AxC DNN, we developed an efficient GPU-based simulation framework. Further, we propose a fine-grain analysis of fault resiliency by examining fault propagation and masking in networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
