Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sinc Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and Its Applications on Physics-informed Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose to use Sinc interpolation in the context of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, neural networks with learnable activation functions, which recently gained attention as alternatives to multilayer perceptron. Many different function representations have already been tried, but we show that Sinc interpolation proposes a viable alternative, since it is known in numerical analysis to represent well both smooth functions and functions with singularities. This is important not only for function approximation but also for the solutions of partial differential equations with physics-informed neural networks. Through a series of experiments, we show that SincKANs provide better results in almost all of the examples we have considered.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
