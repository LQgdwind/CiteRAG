Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Novel Policy Seeking with Constrained Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In problem-solving, we humans tend to come up with different novel solutions to the same problem. However, conventional reinforcement learning algorithms ignore such a feat and only aim at producing a set of monotonous policies that maximize the cumulative reward. The resulting policies usually lack diversity and novelty. In this work, we aim at enabling the learning algorithms with the capacity of solving the task with multiple solutions through a practical novel policy generation workflow that can generate a set of diverse and well-performing policies. Specifically, we begin by introducing a new metric to evaluate the difference between policies. On top of this well-defined novelty metric, we propose to rethink the novelty-seeking problem through the lens of constrained optimization, to address the dilemma between the task performance and the behavioral novelty in existing multi-objective optimization approaches, we then propose a practical novel policy-seeking algorithm, Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD), which is derived from the interior point method commonly known in the constrained optimization literature. Experimental comparisons on benchmark environments show IPD can achieve a substantial improvement over previous novelty-seeking methods in terms of both novelties of generated policies and their performances in the primal task. 111Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/holarissun/NPSCO\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
