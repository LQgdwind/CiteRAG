Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Manthan: A Data Driven Approach for Boolean Function SynthesisThe open source tool is available at https://github.com/meelgroup/manthan\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Boolean functional synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science with wide-ranging applications and has witnessed a surge of interest resulting in progressively improved techniques over the past decade. Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan}, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, 𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖬𝖺𝗇𝗍𝗁𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Manthan} solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
