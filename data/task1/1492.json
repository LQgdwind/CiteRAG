Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantifying Explainability of Saliency Methods in Deep Neural Networks with a Synthetic Dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Post-hoc analysis is a popular category in eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) study. In particular, methods that generate heatmaps have been used to explain the deep neural network (DNN), a black-box model. Heatmaps can be appealing due to the intuitive and visual ways to understand them but assessing their qualities might not be straightforward. Different ways to assess heatmaps’ quality have their own merits and shortcomings. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset that can be generated adhoc along with the ground-truth heatmaps for more objective quantitative assessment. Each sample data is an image of a cell with easily recognized features that are distinguished from localization ground-truth mask, hence facilitating a more transparent assessment of different XAI methods. Comparison and recommendations are made, shortcomings are clarified along with suggestions for future research directions to handle the finer details of select post-hoc analysis methods. Furthermore, mabCAM is introduced as the heatmap generation method compatible with our ground-truth heatmaps. The framework is easily generalizable and uses only standard deep learning components.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
