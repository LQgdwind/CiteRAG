      "content": "Paper Title: QKSA: Quantum Knowledge Seeking Agent resource-optimized reinforcement learning using quantum process tomography\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this research, we extend the universal reinforcement learning (URL) agent models of artificial general intelligence to quantum environments. The utility function of a classical exploratory stochastic Knowledge Seeking Agent, KL-KSA, is generalized to distance measures from quantum information theory on density matrices. Quantum process tomography (QPT) algorithms form the tractable subset of programs for modeling environmental dynamics. The optimal QPT policy is selected based on a mutable cost function based on algorithmic complexity as well as computational resource complexity. Instead of Turing machines, we estimate the cost metrics on a high-level language to allow realistic experimentation. The entire agent design is encapsulated in a self-replicating quine which mutates the cost function based on the predictive value of the optimal policy choosing scheme. Thus, multiple agents with pareto-optimal QPT policies evolve using genetic programming, mimicking the development of physical theories each with different resource trade-offs. This formal framework is termed Quantum Knowledge Seeking Agent (QKSA). A proof-of-concept is implemented and available as an open-sourced software. Despite its importance, few quantum reinforcement learning models exist in contrast to the current thrust in quantum machine learning. QKSA is the first proposal for a framework that resembles the classical URL models. Similar to how AIXI-tl is a resource-bounded active version of Solomonoff universal induction, QKSA is a resource-bounded participatory observer framework to the recently proposed algorithmic information-based reconstruction of quantum mechanics. Besides its theoretical impact, QKSA can be applied for simulating and studying aspects of quantum information theory like control automation, multiple observers, course-graining, distance measures, resource complexity trade-offs, etc. Specifically, we demonstrate that it can be used to accelerate quantum variational algorithms which include tomographic reconstruction as its integral subroutine.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
