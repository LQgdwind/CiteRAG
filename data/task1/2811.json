      "content": "Paper Title: An FFT framework for simulating non-local ductile failure in heterogeneous materials11footnote 1Accepted in Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The simulation of fracture using continuum ductile damage models attains a pathological discretization dependence caused by strain localization, after loss of ellipticity of the problem, in regions whose size is connected to the spatial discretization. Implicit gradient techniques suppress this problem introducing some inelastic non-local fields and solving an enriched formulation where the classical balance of linear momentum is fully coupled with a Helmholtz-type equation for each of the non-local variable. Such Helmholtz-type equations determine the distribution of the non-local fields in bands whose width is controlled by a characteristic length, independently on the spatial discretization. The numerical resolution of this coupled problem using the Finite Element method is computationally very expensive and its use to simulate the damage process in 3D multi-phase microstructures becomes prohibitive. In this work, we propose a novel FFT-based iterative algorithm for simulating gradient ductile damage in computational homogenization problems. In particular, the Helmholtz-type equation of the implicit gradient approach is properly generalized to model the regularization of damage in multi-phase media, where multiple damage variables and different characteristic lengths may come into play. In the proposed iterative algorithm, two distinct problems are solved in a staggered fashion: (i) a conventional mechanical problem via a FFT-Galerkin solver with mixed macroscopic loading control and (ii) the generalized Helmholtz-type equation using a Krylov-based algorithm combined with an efficient pre-conditioner. The numerical implementation is firstly validated on simple two-dimensional microstructures, showing identical responses for different spatial discretizations and reproducing a ductility change dependent on the characteristic length. Finally, the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated in the simulation of failure of complex 3D particle reinforced composites characterized by millions of degrees of freedom.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
