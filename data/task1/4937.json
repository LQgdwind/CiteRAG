      "content": "Paper Title: Almost Polynomial Factor Inapproximability for Parameterized 𝑘-Clique\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The k𝑘k-Clique problem is a canonical hard problem in parameterized complexity. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of approximating the k𝑘k-Clique problem where an integer k𝑘k and a graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices are given as input, and the goal is to find a clique of size at least k/F​(k)𝑘𝐹𝑘k/F(k) whenever the graph G𝐺G has a clique of size k𝑘k. When such an algorithm runs in time T​(k)⋅poly​(n)⋅𝑇𝑘poly𝑛T(k)\\cdot\\text{poly}(n) (i.e., FPT-time) for some computable function T𝑇T, it is said to be an F​(k)𝐹𝑘F(k)-FPT-approximation algorithm for the k𝑘k-Clique problem. Although, the non-existence of an F​(k)𝐹𝑘F(k)-FPT-approximation algorithm for any computable sublinear function F𝐹F is known under gap-ETH [Chalermsook et al., FOCS 2017], it has remained a long standing open problem to prove the same inapproximability result under the more standard and weaker assumption, W[1]≠\\neqFPT. In a recent breakthrough, Lin [STOC 2021] ruled out constant factor (i.e., F​(k)=O​(1)𝐹𝑘𝑂1F(k)=O(1)) FPT-approximation algorithms under W[1]≠\\neqFPT. In this paper, we improve this inapproximability result (under the same assumption) to rule out every F​(k)=k1/H​(k)𝐹𝑘superscript𝑘1𝐻𝑘F(k)=k^{1/H(k)} factor FPT-approximation algorithm for any increasing computable function H𝐻H (for example H​(k)=log∗⁡k𝐻𝑘superscript∗𝑘H(k)=\\log^{\\ast}k). Our main technical contribution is introducing list decoding of Hadamard codes over large prime fields into the proof framework of Lin.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
