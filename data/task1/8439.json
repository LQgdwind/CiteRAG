Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 63 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Ensemble Modeling for Time Series Forecasting: an Adaptive Robust Optimization Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Accurate time series forecasting is critical for a wide range of problems with temporal data. Ensemble modeling is a well-established technique for leveraging multiple predictive models to increase accuracy and robustness, as the performance of a single predictor can be highly variable due to shifts in the underlying data distribution. This paper proposes a new methodology for building robust ensembles of time series forecasting models. Our approach utilizes Adaptive Robust Optimization (ARO) to construct a linear regression ensemble in which the models’ weights can adapt over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a series of synthetic experiments and real-world applications, including air pollution management, energy consumption forecasting, and tropical cyclone intensity forecasting. Our results show that our adaptive ensembles outperform the best ensemble member in hindsight by 16-26% in root mean square error and 14-28% in conditional value at risk and improve over competitive ensemble techniques.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
