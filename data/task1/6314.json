Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Constrained Mass Optimal Transport\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Optimal mass transport, also known as the earth mover’s problem, is an optimization problem with important applications in various disciplines, including economics, probability theory, fluid dynamics, cosmology and geophysics to cite a few. Optimal transport has also found successful applications in image registration, content-based image retrieval, and more generally in pattern recognition and machine learning as a way to measure dissimilarity among data. This paper introduces the problem of constrained optimal transport. The time-dependent formulation, more precisely, the fluid dynamics approach is used as a starting point from which the constrained problem is defined by imposing a soft constraint on the density and momentum fields or restricting them to a subset of curves that satisfy some prescribed conditions. A family of algorithms is introduced to solve a class of constrained saddle point problems, which has convexly constrained optimal transport on closed convex subsets of the Euclidean space as a special case. Convergence proofs and numerical results are presented.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
