Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Overcome Anterograde Forgetting with Cycle Memory Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Learning from a sequence of tasks for a lifetime is essential for an agent towards artificial general intelligence. This requires the agent to continuously learn and memorize new knowledge without interference. This paper first demonstrates a fundamental issue of lifelong learning using neural networks, named anterograde forgetting, i.e., preserving and transferring memory may inhibit the learning of new knowledge. This is attributed to the fact that the learning capacity of a neural network will be reduced as it keeps memorizing historical knowledge, and the fact that the conceptual confusion may occur as it transfers irrelevant old knowledge to the current task. This work proposes a general framework named Cycled Memory Networks (CMN) to address the anterograde forgetting in neural networks for lifelong learning. The CMN consists of two individual memory networks to store short-term and long-term memories to avoid capacity shrinkage. A transfer cell is designed to connect these two memory networks, enabling knowledge transfer from the long-term memory network to the short-term memory network to mitigate the conceptual confusion, and a memory consolidation mechanism is developed to integrate short-term knowledge into the long-term memory network for knowledge accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the CMN can effectively address the anterograde forgetting on several task-related, task-conflict, class-incremental and cross-domain benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
