      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing level set-based topology optimization with anisotropic graded meshes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a new algorithm for the design of topologically optimized lightweight structures, under a minimum compliance requirement. The new process enhances a standard level set formulation in terms of computational efficiency, thanks to the employment of a strategic computational mesh. We pursue a twofold goal, i.e., to deliver a final layout characterized by a smooth contour and reliable mechanical properties. The smoothness of the optimized structure is ensured by the employment of an anisotropic adapted mesh, which sharply captures the material/void interface. A robust mechanical performance is guaranteed by a uniform tessellation of the internal part of the optimized configuration. A thorough numerical investigation corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as a reliable and computationally affordable design tool, both in two- and three-dimensional contexts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
