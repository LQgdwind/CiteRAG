Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work we extend the robust version of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem, obtained by Barak, Dvir, Wigderson and Yehudayoff, and by Dvir, Saraf and Wigderson, to the case of quadratic polynomials. Specifically, we prove that if 𝒬⊂ℂ[x1.…,xn]{\\mathcal{Q}}\\subset\\mathbb{C}[x_{1}.\\ldots,x_{n}] is a finite set, |𝒬|=m𝒬𝑚|{\\mathcal{Q}}|=m, of irreducible quadratic polynomials that satisfy the following condition: • There is δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that for every Q∈𝒬𝑄𝒬Q\\in{\\mathcal{Q}} there are at least δ​m𝛿𝑚\\delta m polynomials P∈𝒬𝑃𝒬P\\in{\\mathcal{Q}} such that whenever Q𝑄Q and P𝑃P vanish then so does a third polynomial in 𝒬∖{Q,P}𝒬𝑄𝑃{\\mathcal{Q}}\\setminus\\{Q,P\\}, then dim(span⁡{𝒬})=\\poly​(1/δ)dimensionspan𝒬\\poly1𝛿\\dim(\\operatorname{span}\\{{{\\mathcal{Q}}}\\})=\\poly(1/\\delta). The work of Barak et al. and Dvir et al. studied the case of linear polynomials and proved an upper bound of O​(1/δ)𝑂1𝛿O(1/\\delta) on the dimension (in the first work an upper bound of O​(1/δ2)𝑂1superscript𝛿2O(1/\\delta^{2}) was given, which was improved to O​(1/δ)𝑂1𝛿O(1/\\delta) in the second work).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
