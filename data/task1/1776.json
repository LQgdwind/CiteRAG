Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: General stochastic separation theorems with optimal bounds\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Phenomenon of stochastic separability was revealed and used in machine learning to correct errors of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and analyze AI instabilities. In high-dimensional datasets under broad assumptions each point can be separated from the rest of the set by simple and robust Fisher’s discriminant (is Fisher separable). Errors or clusters of errors can be separated from the rest of the data. The ability to correct an AI system also opens up the possibility of an attack on it, and the high dimensionality induces vulnerabilities caused by the same stochastic separability that holds the keys to understanding the fundamentals of robustness and adaptivity in high-dimensional data-driven AI. To manage errors and analyze vulnerabilities, the stochastic separation theorems should evaluate the probability that the dataset will be Fisher separable in given dimensionality and for a given class of distributions. Explicit and optimal estimates of these separation probabilities are required, and this problem is solved in present work. The general stochastic separation theorems with optimal probability estimates are obtained for important classes of distributions: log-concave distribution, their convex combinations and product distributions. The standard i.i.d. assumption was significantly relaxed. These theorems and estimates can be used both for correction of high-dimensional data driven AI systems and for analysis of their vulnerabilities. The third area of application is the emergence of memories in ensembles of neurons, the phenomena of grandmother’s cells and sparse coding in the brain, and explanation of unexpected effectiveness of small neural ensembles in high-dimensional brain.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
