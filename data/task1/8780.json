      "content": "Paper Title: Use of Speech Impairment Severity for Dysarthric Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A key challenge in dysarthric speech recognition is the speaker-level diversity attributed to both speaker-identity associated factors such as gender, and speech impairment severity. Most prior researches on addressing this issue focused on using speaker-identity only. To this end, this paper proposes a novel set of techniques to use both severity and speaker-identity in dysarthric speech recognition: a) multitask training incorporating severity prediction error; b) speaker-severity aware auxiliary feature adaptation; and c) structured LHUC transforms separately conditioned on speaker-identity and severity. Experiments conducted on UASpeech suggest incorporating additional speech impairment severity into state-of-the-art hybrid DNN, E2E Conformer and pre-trained Wav2vec 2.0 ASR systems produced statistically significant WER reductions up to 4.78% (14.03% relative). Using the best system the lowest published WER of 17.82% (51.25% on very low intelligibility) was obtained on UASpeech.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
