Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Limits of Deep Learning: Sequence Modeling through the Lens of Complexity Theory\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning models have achieved significant success across various applications but continue to struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning over sequences, such as function composition and compositional tasks. Despite advancements, models like Structured State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformers underperform in deep compositionality tasks due to inherent architectural and training limitations. Maintaining accuracy over multiple reasoning steps remains a primary challenge, as current models often rely on shortcuts rather than genuine multi-step reasoning, leading to performance degradation as task complexity increases. Existing research highlights these shortcomings but lacks comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis for SSMs. Our contributions address this gap by providing a theoretical framework based on complexity theory to explain SSMs’ limitations. Moreover, we present extensive empirical evidence demonstrating how these limitations impair function composition and algorithmic task performance. Our experiments reveal significant performance drops as task complexity increases, even with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Models frequently resort to shortcuts, leading to errors in multi-step reasoning. This underscores the need for innovative solutions beyond current deep learning paradigms to achieve reliable multi-step reasoning and compositional task-solving in practical applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
