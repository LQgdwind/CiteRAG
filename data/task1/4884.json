Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Causal Homotopy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We characterize homotopical equivalences between causal DAG models, exploiting the close connections between partially ordered set representations of DAGs (posets) and finite Alexandroff topologies. Alexandroff spaces yield a directional topological space: the topology is defined by a unique minimal basis defined by open sets Uxsubscriptùëàùë•U_{x} for each variable xùë•x, specified as the intersection of all open sets containing xùë•x. Alexandroff spaces induce a (reflexive, transitive) preorder: a variable x‚â§yùë•ùë¶x\\leq y if x‚ààUyùë•subscriptùëàùë¶x\\in U_{y}. Alexandroff spaces satisfying the Kolmogorov T0subscriptùëá0T_{0} separation criterion, where open sets distinguish variables, converts the preordering into a partial ordering. Our approach broadly is to construct a topological representation of posets from data, and then use the poset representation to build a conventional DAG-oriented causal model. We illustrate our framework by showing how it unifies disparate algorithms and case studies proposed previously. Topology plays two key roles in causal discovery. First, topological separability constraints on datasets have been used in several previous approaches to infer causal structure from observations and interventions. Second, a diverse range of graphical models used to represent causal structures can be represented in a unified way in terms of a topological representation of the induced poset structure. We show that the homotopy theory of Alexandroff spaces can be exploited to significantly efficiently reduce the number of possible DAG structures, reducing the search space by several orders of magnitude.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
