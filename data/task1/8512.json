Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Study of Neural Collapse Phenomenon: Grassmannian Frame, Symmetry and Generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we extend original Neural Collapse Phenomenon by proving Generalized Neural Collapse hypothesis. We obtain Grassmannian Frame structure from the optimization and generalization of classification. This structure maximally separates features of every two classes on a sphere and does not require a larger feature dimension than the number of classes. Out of curiosity about the symmetry of Grassmannian Frame, we conduct experiments to explore if models with different Grassmannian Frames have different performance. As a result, we discover the Symmetric Generalization phenomenon. We provide a theorem to explain Symmetric Generalization of permutation. However, the question of why different directions of features can lead to such different generalization is still open for future investigation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
