Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: BoolNet: Minimizing the Energy Consumption of Binary Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent works on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have made promising progress in narrowing the accuracy gap of BNNs to their 32-bit counterparts. However, the accuracy gains are often based on specialized model designs using additional 32-bit components. Furthermore, almost all previous BNNs use 32-bit for feature maps and the shortcuts enclosing the corresponding binary convolution blocks, which helps to effectively maintain the accuracy, but is not friendly to hardware accelerators with limited memory, energy, and computing resources. Thus, we raise the following question: “How can accuracy and energy consumption be balanced in a BNN network design?” We extensively study this fundamental problem in this work and propose a novel BNN architecture without most commonly used 32-bit components: BoolNet. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate that BoolNet can achieve 4.6×4.6\\times energy reduction coupled with 1.2% higher accuracy than the commonly used BNN architecture Bi-RealNet [30]. Code and trained models are available at: https://github.com/hpi-xnor/BoolNet.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
