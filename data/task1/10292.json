Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Echos: Depthwise Convolutional Filters Replicate Biological Receptive Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this study, we present evidence suggesting that depthwise convolutional kernels are effectively replicating the structural intricacies of the biological receptive fields observed in the mammalian retina. We provide analytics of trained kernels from various state-of-the-art models substantiating this evidence. Inspired by this intriguing discovery, we propose an initialization scheme that draws inspiration from the biological receptive fields. Experimental analysis of the ImageNet dataset with multiple CNN architectures featuring depthwise convolutions reveals a marked enhancement in the accuracy of the learned model when initialized with biologically derived weights. This underlies the potential for biologically inspired computational models to further our understanding of vision processing systems and to improve the efficacy of convolutional networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
