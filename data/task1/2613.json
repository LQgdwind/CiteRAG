Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Untitled Document\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A core challenge in Machine Learning is to learn to disentangle natural factors of variation in data (e.g. object shape vs pose). A popular approach to disentanglement consists in learning to map each of these factors to distinct subspaces of a model’s latent representation. However, this approach has shown limited empirical success to date. Here, we show that, for a broad family of transformations acting on images—encompassing simple affine transformations such as rotations and translations—this approach to disentanglement introduces topological defects (i.e. discontinuities in the encoder). Motivated by classical results from group representation theory, we study an alternative, more flexible approach to disentanglement which relies on distributed latent operators, potentially acting on the entire latent space. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to disentangle affine transformations. Our work lays a theoretical foundation for the recent success of a new generation of models using distributed operators for disentanglement.111All code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/Addressing-the-Topological-Defects-of-Disentanglement\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
