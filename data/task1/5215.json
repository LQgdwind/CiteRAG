Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: CVAE-H: Conditionalizing Variational Autoencoders via Hypernetworks and Trajectory Forecasting for Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The task of predicting stochastic behaviors of road agents in diverse environments is a challenging problem for autonomous driving. To best understand scene contexts and produce diverse possible future states of the road agents adaptively in different environments, a prediction model should be probabilistic, multi-modal, context-driven, and general. We present Conditionalizing Variational AutoEncoders via Hypernetworks (CVAE-H); a conditional VAE that extensively leverages hypernetwork and performs generative tasks for high-dimensional problems like the prediction task. We first evaluate CVAE-H on simple generative experiments to show that CVAE-H is probabilistic, multi-modal, context-driven, and general. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed model effectively solves a self-driving prediction problem by producing accurate predictions of road agents in various environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
