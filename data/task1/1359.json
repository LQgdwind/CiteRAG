Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Visual Overlap of Images Through Interpretable Non-Metric Box Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To what extent are two images picturing the same 333D surfaces? Even when this is a known scene, the answer typically requires an expensive search across scale space, with matching and geometric verification of large sets of local features. This expense is further multiplied when a query image is evaluated against a gallery, e.g. in visual relocalization. While we don’t obviate the need for geometric verification, we propose an interpretable image-embedding that cuts the search in scale space to essentially a lookup. Our approach measures the asymmetric relation between two images. The model then learns a scene-specific measure of similarity, from training examples with known 333D visible-surface overlaps. The result is that we can quickly identify, for example, which test image is a close-up version of another, and by what scale factor. Subsequently, local features need only be detected at that scale. We validate our scene-specific model by showing how this embedding yields competitive image-matching results, while being simpler, faster, and also interpretable by humans.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
