Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Invariant and Transportable Representations for Anti-Causal Domain Shifts\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Real-world classification problems must contend with domain shift, the (potential) mismatch between the domain where a model is deployed and the domain(s) where the training data was gathered. Methods to handle such problems must specify what structure is common between the domains and what varies. A natural assumption is that causal (structural) relationships are invariant in all domains. Then, it is tempting to learn a predictor for label YùëåY that depends only on its causal parents. However, many real-world problems are ‚Äúanti-causal‚Äù in the sense that YùëåY is a cause of the covariates XùëãX‚Äîin this case, YùëåY has no causal parents and the naive causal invariance is useless. In this paper, we study representation learning under a particular notion of domain shift that both respects causal invariance and that naturally handles the ‚Äúanti-causal‚Äù structure. We show how to leverage the shared causal structure of the domains to learn a representation that both admits an invariant predictor and that also allows fast adaptation in new domains. The key is to translate causal assumptions into learning principles that disentangle ‚Äúinvariant‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-stable‚Äù features. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm.
