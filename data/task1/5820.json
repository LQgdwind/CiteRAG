Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Goal-driven Self-Attentive Recurrent Networks for Trajectory Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Human trajectory forecasting is a key component of autonomous vehicles, social-aware robots and advanced video-surveillance applications. This challenging task typically requires knowledge about past motion, the environment and likely destination areas. In this context, multi-modality is a fundamental aspect and its effective modeling can be beneficial to any architecture. Inferring accurate trajectories is nevertheless challenging, due to the inherently uncertain nature of the future. To overcome these difficulties, recent models use different inputs and propose to model human intentions using complex fusion mechanisms. In this respect, we propose a lightweight attention-based recurrent backbone that acts solely on past observed positions. Although this backbone already provides promising results, we demonstrate that its prediction accuracy can be improved considerably when combined with a scene-aware goal-estimation module. To this end, we employ a common goal module, based on a U-Net architecture, which additionally extracts semantic information to predict scene-compliant destinations. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly-available datasets (i.e. SDD, inD, ETH/UCY) and show that our approach performs on par with state-of-the-art techniques while reducing model complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
