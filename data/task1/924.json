      "content": "Paper Title: Tight Quantum Time-Space Tradeoffs for Function Inversion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In function inversion, we are given a function f:[N]↦[N]:𝑓maps-todelimited-[]𝑁delimited-[]𝑁f:[N]\\mapsto[N], and want to prepare some advice of size S𝑆S, such that we can efficiently invert any image in time T𝑇T. This is a well studied problem with profound connections to cryptography, data structures, communication complexity, and circuit lower bounds. Investigation of this problem in the quantum setting was initiated by Nayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015), who proved a lower bound of S​T2=Ω~​(N)𝑆superscript𝑇2~Ω𝑁ST^{2}=\\tilde{\\Omega}(N) for random permutations against classical advice, leaving open an intriguing possibility that Grover’s search can be sped up to time O~​(N/S)~𝑂𝑁𝑆\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{N/S}). Recent works by Hhan, Xagawa, and Yamakawa (2019), and Chung, Liao, and Qian (2019) extended the argument for random functions and quantum advice, but the lower bound remains S​T2=Ω~​(N)𝑆superscript𝑇2~Ω𝑁ST^{2}=\\tilde{\\Omega}(N). In this work, we prove that even with quantum advice, S​T+T2=Ω~​(N)𝑆𝑇superscript𝑇2~Ω𝑁ST+T^{2}=\\tilde{\\Omega}(N) is required for an algorithm to invert random functions. This demonstrates that Grover’s search is optimal for S=O~​(N)𝑆~𝑂𝑁S=\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{N}), ruling out any substantial speed-up for Grover’s search even with quantum advice. Further improvements to our bounds would imply new classical circuit lower bounds, as shown by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (2019). To prove this result, we develop a general framework for establishing quantum time-space lower bounds. We further demonstrate the power of our framework by proving the following results. • Yao’s box problem: We prove a tight quantum time-space lower bound for classical advice. For quantum advice, we prove a first time-space lower bound using shadow tomography. These results resolve two open problems posted by Nayebi et al (2015). • Salted cryptography: We show that “salting generically provably defeats preprocessing,” a result shown by Coretti, Dodis, Guo, and Steinberger (2018), also holds in the quantum setting. In particular, we prove quantum time-space lower bounds for a wide class of salted cryptographic primitives in the quantum random oracle model. This yields the first quantum time-space lower bound for salted collision-finding, which in turn implies that 𝖯𝖶𝖯𝖯𝒪⊈𝖥𝖡𝖰𝖯𝒪/𝗊𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒not-subset-of-or-equalssuperscript𝖯𝖶𝖯𝖯𝒪superscript𝖥𝖡𝖰𝖯𝒪𝗊𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{PWPP}^{\\mathcal{O}}\\not\\subseteq\\mathsf{FBQP}^{\\mathcal{O}}\\mathsf{/qpoly} relative to a random oracle 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
