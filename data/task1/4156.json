      "content": "Paper Title: Stagewise Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Self-Training for Road Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Road segmentation from remote sensing images is a challenging task with wide ranges of application potentials. Deep neural networks have advanced this field by leveraging the power of large-scale labeled data, which, however, are extremely expensive and time-consuming to acquire. One solution is to use cheap available data to train a model and deploy it to directly process the data from a specific application domain. Nevertheless, the well-known domain shift (DS) issue prevents the trained model from generalizing well on the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel stagewise domain adaptation model called RoadDA to address the DS issue in this field. In the first stage, RoadDA adapts the target domain features to align with the source ones via generative adversarial networks (GAN) based inter-domain adaptation. Specifically, a feature pyramid fusion module is devised to avoid information loss of long and thin roads and learn discriminative and robust features. Besides, to address the intra-domain discrepancy in the target domain, in the second stage, we propose an adversarial self-training method. We generate the pseudo labels of target domain using the trained generator and divide it to labeled easy split and unlabeled hard split based on the road confidence scores. The features of hard split are adapted to align with the easy ones using adversarial learning and the intra-domain adaptation process is repeated to progressively improve the segmentation performance. Experiment results on two benchmarks demonstrate that RoadDA can efficiently reduce the domain gap and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/LANMNG/RoadDA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
