      "content": "Paper Title: ReMAV: Reward Modeling of Autonomous Vehicles for Finding Likely Failure Events\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Autonomous vehicles are advanced driving systems that are well known to be vulnerable to various adversarial attacks, compromising vehicle safety and posing a risk to other road users. Rather than actively training complex adversaries by interacting with the environment, there is a need to first intelligently find and reduce the search space to only those states where autonomous vehicles are found to be less confident. In this paper, we propose a black-box testing framework ReMAV that uses offline trajectories first to analyze the existing behavior of autonomous vehicles and determine appropriate thresholds to find the probability of failure events. To this end, we introduce a three-step methodology which i) uses offline state action pairs of any autonomous vehicle under test, ii) builds an abstract behavior representation using our designed reward modeling technique to analyze states with uncertain driving decisions, and iii) uses a disturbance model for minimal perturbation attacks where the driving decisions are less confident. Our reward modeling technique helps in creating a behavior representation that allows us to highlight regions of likely uncertain behavior even when the standard autonomous vehicle performs well. This approach allows for more efficient testing without the need for computational and inefficient active adversarial learning techniques. We perform our experiments in a high-fidelity urban driving environment using three different driving scenarios containing single- and multi-agent interactions. Our experiment shows an increase in 35%, 23%, 48%, and 50% in the occurrences of vehicle collision, road object collision, pedestrian collision, and offroad steering events, respectively by the autonomous vehicle under test, demonstrating a significant increase in failure events. We compare ReMAV with two baselines and show that ReMAV demonstrates significantly better effectiveness in generating failure events compared to the baselines in all evaluation metrics. We also perform an additional analysis with prior testing frameworks and show that they underperform in terms of training-testing efficiency, finding total infractions, and simulation steps to identify the first failure compared to our approach. The results show that the proposed framework can be used to understand the existing weaknesses of the autonomous vehicles under test to only attack those regions, starting with the simplistic perturbation models. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of finding failure events in terms of increased collision and offroad steering errors compared to standard AV driving behavior.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
