Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Flexible Music-Conditioned Dance Generation with Style Description Prompts\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Dance plays an important role as an artistic form and expression in human culture, yet the creation of dance remains a challenging task. Most dance generation methods primarily rely solely on music, seldom taking into consideration intrinsic attributes such as music style or genre. In this work, we introduce Flexible Dance Generation with Style Description Prompts (DGSDP), a diffusion-based framework suitable for diversified tasks of dance generation by fully leveraging the semantics of music style. The core component of this framework is Music-Conditioned Style-Aware Diffusion (MCSAD), which comprises a Transformer-based network and a music Style Modulation module. The MCSAD seemly integrates music conditions and style description prompts into the dance generation framework, ensuring that generated dances are consistent with the music content and style. To facilitate flexible dance generation and accommodate different tasks, a spatial-temporal masking strategy is effectively applied in the backward diffusion process. The proposed framework successfully generates realistic dance sequences that are accurately aligned with music for a variety of tasks such as long-term generation, dance in-betweening, dance inpainting, and etc. We hope that this work has the potential to inspire dance generation and creation, with promising applications in entertainment, art, and education.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
