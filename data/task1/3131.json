Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Few-shot Learning for Topic Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Topic models have been successfully used for analyzing text documents. However, with existing topic models, many documents are required for training. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based few-shot learning method that can learn a topic model from just a few documents. The neural networks in our model take a small number of documents as inputs, and output topic model priors. The proposed method trains the neural networks such that the expected test likelihood is improved when topic model parameters are estimated by maximizing the posterior probability using the priors based on the EM algorithm. Since each step in the EM algorithm is differentiable, the proposed method can backpropagate the loss through the EM algorithm to train the neural networks. The expected test likelihood is maximized by a stochastic gradient descent method using a set of multiple text corpora with an episodic training framework. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better perplexity than existing methods using three real-world text document sets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
