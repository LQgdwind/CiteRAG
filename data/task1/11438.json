      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating MRI Uncertainty Estimation with Mask-based Bayesian Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Accurate and reliable Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis is particularly important for adaptive radiotherapy, a recent medical advance capable of improving cancer diagnosis and treatment. Recent studies have shown that IVIM-NET, a deep neural network (DNN), can achieve high accuracy in MRI analysis, indicating the potential of deep learning to enhance diagnostic capabilities in healthcare. However, IVIM-NET does not provide calibrated uncertainty information needed for reliable and trustworthy predictions in healthcare. Moreover, the expensive computation and memory demands of IVIM-NET reduce hardware performance, hindering widespread adoption in realistic scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm–hardware co-optimization flow for high-performance and reliable MRI analysis. At the algorithm level, a transformation design flow is introduced to convert IVIM-NET to a mask-based Bayesian Neural Network (BayesNN), facilitating reliable and efficient uncertainty estimation. At the hardware level, we propose an FPGA-based accelerator with several hardware optimizations, such as mask-zero skipping and operation reordering. Experimental results demonstrate that our co-design approach can satisfy the uncertainty requirements of MRI analysis, while achieving 7.5 times and 32.5 times speedup on an Xilinx VU13P FPGA compared to GPU and CPU implementations with reduced power consumption.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
