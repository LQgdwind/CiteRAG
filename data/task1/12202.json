Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: VividFace: A Diffusion-Based Hybrid Framework for High-Fidelity Video Face Swapping\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Video face swapping is becoming increasingly popular across various applications, yet existing methods primarily focus on static images and struggle with video face swapping because of temporal consistency and complex scenarios. In this paper, we present the first diffusion-based framework specifically designed for video face swapping. Our approach introduces a novel image-video hybrid training framework that leverages both abundant static image data and temporal video sequences, addressing the inherent limitations of video-only training. The framework incorporates a specially designed diffusion model coupled with a VidFaceVAE that effectively processes both types of data to better maintain temporal coherence of the generated videos. To further disentangle identity and pose features, we construct the Attribute-Identity Disentanglement Triplet (AIDT) Dataset, where each triplet has three face images, with two images sharing the same pose and two sharing the same identity. Enhanced with a comprehensive occlusion augmentation, this dataset also improves robustness against occlusions. Additionally, we integrate 3D reconstruction techniques as input conditioning to our network for handling large pose variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and visual quality compared to existing methods, while requiring fewer inference steps. Our approach effectively mitigates key challenges in video face swapping, including temporal flickering, identity preservation, and robustness to occlusions and pose variations.
