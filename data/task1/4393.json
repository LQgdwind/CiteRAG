Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Extracting Attentive Social Temporal Excitation for Sequential Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In collaborative filtering, it is an important way to make full use of social information to improve the recommendation quality, which has been proved to be effective because user behavior will be affected by her friends. However, existing works leverage the social relationship to aggregate user features from friends’ historical behavior sequences in a user-level indirect paradigm. A significant defect of the indirect paradigm is that it ignores the temporal relationships between behavior events across users. In this paper, we propose a novel time-aware sequential recommendation framework called Social Temporal Excitation Networks (STEN), which introduces temporal point processes to model the fine-grained impact of friends’ behaviors on the user’s dynamic interests in an event-level direct paradigm. Moreover, we propose to decompose the temporal effect in sequential recommendation into social mutual temporal effect and ego temporal effect. Specifically, we employ a social heterogeneous graph embedding layer to refine user representation via structural information. To enhance temporal information propagation, STEN directly extracts the fine-grained temporal mutual influence of friends’ behaviors through the mutually exciting temporal network. Besides, user’s dynamic interests are captured through the self-exciting temporal network. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that STEN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods. Moreover, STEN provides event-level recommendation explainability, which is also illustrated experimentally.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
