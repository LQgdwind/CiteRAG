Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Biomimetic Frontend for Differentiable Audio ProcessingSupported by ONR Award N00014-23-1-2086 and a Dolby gift to UMD.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While models in audio and speech processing are becoming deeper and more end-to-end, they as a consequence need expensive training on large data, and are often brittle. We build on a classical model of human hearing and make it differentiable, so that we can combine traditional explainable biomimetic signal processing approaches with deep-learning frameworks. This allows us to arrive at an expressive and explainable model that is easily trained on modest amounts of data. We apply this model to audio processing tasks, including classification and enhancement. Results show that our differentiable model surpasses black-box approaches in terms of computational efficiency and robustness, even with little training data. We also discuss other potential applications.
