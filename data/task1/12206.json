Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Contextual Generative Auction with Permutation-level Externalities for Online Advertising\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Online advertising has become a core revenue driver for the internet industry, with ad auctions playing a crucial role in ensuring platform revenue and advertiser incentives. Traditional auction mechanisms, like GSP, rely on the independent CTR assumption and fail to account for the influence of other displayed items, termed externalities. Recent advancements in learning-based auctions have enhanced the encoding of high-dimensional contextual features. However, existing methods are constrained by the “allocation-after-prediction” design paradigm, which models set-level externalities within candidate ads and fails to consider the sequential context of the final allocation, leading to suboptimal results. This paper introduces the Contextual Generative Auction (CGA), a novel framework that incorporates permutation-level externalities in multi-slot ad auctions. Built on the structure of our theoretically derived optimal solution, CGA decouples the optimization of allocation and payment. We construct an autoregressive generative model for allocation and reformulate the incentive compatibility (IC) constraint into minimizing ex-post regret that supports gradient computation, enabling end-to-end learning of the optimal payment rule. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that CGA significantly enhances platform revenue and CTR compared to existing methods, while effectively approximating the optimal auction with nearly maximal revenue and minimal regret.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
