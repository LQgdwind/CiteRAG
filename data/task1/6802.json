      "content": "Paper Title: Non-iterative generation of an optimal mesh for a blade passage using deep reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to non-iteratively generate an optimal mesh for an arbitrary blade passage is developed. Despite automation in mesh generation using either an empirical approach or an optimization algorithm, repeated tuning of meshing parameters is still required for a new geometry. The method developed herein employs a DRL-based multi-condition optimization technique to define optimal meshing parameters as a function of the blade geometry, attaining automation, minimization of human intervention, and computational efficiency. The meshing parameters are optimized by training an elliptic mesh generator which generates a structured mesh for a blade passage with an arbitrary blade geometry. During each episode of the DRL process, the mesh generator is trained to produce an optimal mesh for a randomly selected blade passage by updating the meshing parameters until the mesh quality, as measured by the ratio of determinants of the Jacobian matrices and the skewness, reaches the highest level. Once the training is completed, the mesh generator create an optimal mesh for a new arbitrary blade passage in a single try without an repetitive process for the parameter tuning for mesh generation from the scratch. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through the generation of meshes for various blade passages.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
