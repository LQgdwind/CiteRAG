Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Protocol for Intelligible Interaction Between Agents That Learn and Explain\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent engineering developments have seen the emergence of Machine Learning (ML) as a powerful form of data analysis with widespread applicability beyond its historical roots in the design of autonomous agents. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the interaction between people and ML systems. Recent developments on Explainable ML address this by providing visual and textual information on how the ML system arrived at a conclusion. In this paper we view the interaction between humans and ML systems within the broader context of interaction between agents capable of learning and explanation. Within this setting, we argue that it is more helpful to view the interaction as characterised by two-way intelligibility of information rather than once-off explanation of a prediction. We formulate two-way intelligibility as a property of a communication protocol. Development of the protocol is motivated by a set of ‘Intelligibility Axioms’ for decision-support systems that use ML with a human-in-the-loop. The axioms are intended as sufficient criteria to claim that: (a) information provided by a human is intelligible to an ML system; and (b) information provided by an ML system is intelligible to a human. The axioms inform the design of a general synchronous interaction model between agents capable of learning and explanation. We identify conditions of compatibility between agents that result in bounded communication, and define Weak and Strong Two-Way Intelligibility between agents as properties of the communication protocol.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
