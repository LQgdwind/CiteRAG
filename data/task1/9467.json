Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep reinforcement learning for the dynamic vehicle dispatching problem: An event-based approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The dynamic vehicle dispatching problem corresponds to deciding which vehicles to assign to requests that arise stochastically over time and space. It emerges in diverse areas, such as in the assignment of trucks to loads to be transported; in emergency systems; and in ride-hailing services. In this paper, we model the problem as a semi-Markov decision process, which allows us to treat time as continuous. In this setting, decision epochs coincide with discrete events whose time intervals are random. We argue that an event-based approach substantially reduces the combinatorial complexity of the decision space and overcomes other limitations of discrete-time models often proposed in the literature. In order to test our approach, we develop a new discrete-event simulator and use double deep q-learning to train our decision agents. Numerical experiments are carried out in realistic scenarios using data from New York City. We compare the policies obtained through our approach with heuristic policies often used in practice. Results show that our policies exhibit better average waiting times, cancellation rates and total service times, with reduction in average waiting times of up to 50% relative to the other tested heuristic policies.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
