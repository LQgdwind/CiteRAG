Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scheduling Periodic Messages on a Shared Link without Buffering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cloud-RAN, a novel architecture for modern mobile networks, relocates processing units from antenna to distant data centers. This shift introduces the challenge of ensuring low latency for the periodic messages exchanged between antennas and their respective processing units. In this study, we tackle the problem of devising an efficient periodic message assignment scheme under the constraints of fixed message size and period without contention nor buffering. We address this problem by modeling it on a common network topology, wherein contention arises from a single shared link servicing multiple antennas. While reminiscent of coupled-task scheduling, the introduction of periodicity adds a unique dimension to the problem. We study how the problem behaves with regard to the load of the shared link, and we focus on proving that, for load as high as possible, a solution always exists and it can be found in polynomial time. The main contributions of this article are two polynomial-time algorithms, which find a solution for messages of any size and load at most 2/5252/5 or for messages of size one and load at most ϕ−1italic-ϕ1\\phi-1, the golden ratio conjugate. We also prove that a randomized greedy algorithm finds a solution on almost all instances with high probability, shedding light on the effectiveness of greedy algorithms in practical applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
