Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Organic Priors in Non-Rigid Structure from Motion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract \\justify This paper advocates the use of organic priors in classical non-rigid structure from motion (NRSfM). By organic priors, we mean invaluable intermediate prior information intrinsic to the NRSfM matrix factorization theory. It is shown that such priors reside in the factorized matrices, and quite surprisingly, existing methods generally disregard them. The paper’s main contribution is to put forward a simple, methodical, and practical method that can effectively exploit such organic priors to solve NRSfM. The proposed method does not make assumptions other than the popular one on the low-rank shape and offers a reliable solution to NRSfM under orthographic projection. Our work reveals that the accessibility of organic priors is independent of the camera motion and shape deformation type. Besides that, the paper provides insights into the NRSfM factorization—both in terms of shape and motion—and is the first approach to show the benefit of single rotation averaging for NRSfM. Furthermore, we outline how to effectively recover motion and non-rigid 3D shape using the proposed organic prior based approach and demonstrate results that outperform prior-free NRSfM performance by a significant margin. Finally, we present the benefits of our method via extensive experiments and evaluations on several benchmark datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
