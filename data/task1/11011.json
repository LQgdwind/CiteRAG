      "content": "Paper Title: Hamiltonicity, Path Cover, and Independence Number: An FPT Perspective The research leading to these results has been supported by the Research Council of Norway via the project BWCA (grant no. 314528) and DFG Research Group ADYN via grant DFG 411362735.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The connection between Hamiltonicity and the independence numbers of graphs has been a fundamental aspect of Graph Theory since the seminal works of the 1960s. This paper presents a novel algorithmic perspective on these classical problems. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish that a wide array of problems in undirected graphs, encompassing problems such as Hamiltonian Path and Cycle, Path Cover, Largest Linkage, and Topological Minor Containment are fixed-parameter tractable (𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\operatorname{{\\sf FPT}}) parameterized by the independence number of a graph. To the best of our knowledge, these results mark the first instances of 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\operatorname{{\\sf FPT}} problems for such parameterization. Second, we extend the algorithmic scope of the Gallai-Milgram theorem. The original theorem by Gallai and Milgram, asserts that for a graph G𝐺G with the independence number α​(G)𝛼𝐺\\alpha(G), the vertex set of G𝐺G can be covered by at most α​(G)𝛼𝐺\\alpha(G) vertex-disjoint paths. We show that determining whether a graph can be covered by fewer than α​(G)−k𝛼𝐺𝑘\\alpha(G)-k vertex-disjoint paths is 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\operatorname{{\\sf FPT}} parameterized by k𝑘k. Notably, the independence number parameterization, which describes graph’s density, departs from the typical flow of research in parameterized complexity, which focuses on parameters describing graph’s sparsity, like treewidth or vertex cover.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
