Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Investigating the Interplay between Features and Structures in Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the past, the dichotomy between homophily and heterophily has inspired research contributions toward a better understanding of Deep Graph Networks’ inductive bias. In particular, it was believed that homophily strongly correlates with better node classification predictions of message-passing methods. More recently, however, researchers pointed out that such dichotomy is too simplistic as we can construct node classification tasks where graphs are completely heterophilic but the performances remain high. Most of these works have also proposed new quantitative metrics to understand when a graph structure is useful, which implicitly or explicitly assume the correlation between node features and target labels. Our work empirically investigates what happens when this strong assumption does not hold, by formalising two generative processes for node classification tasks that allow us to build and study ad-hoc problems. To quantitatively measure the influence of the node features on the target labels, we also use a metric we call Feature Informativeness. We construct six synthetic tasks and evaluate the performance of six models, including structure-agnostic ones. Our findings reveal that previously defined metrics are not adequate when we relax the above assumption. Our contribution to the workshop aims at presenting novel research findings that could help advance our understanding of the field.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
