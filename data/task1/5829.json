Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Discrete-Continuous Smoothing and Mapping\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We describe a general approach for maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in a class of discrete-continuous factor graphs commonly encountered in robotics applications. While there are openly available tools providing flexible and easy-to-use interfaces for specifying and solving inference problems formulated in terms of either discrete or continuous graphical models, at present, no similarly general tools exist enabling the same functionality for hybrid discrete-continuous problems. We aim to address this problem. In particular, we provide a library, DC-SAM, extending existing tools for inference problems defined in terms of factor graphs to the setting of discrete-continuous models. A key contribution of our work is a novel solver for efficiently recovering approximate solutions to discrete-continuous inference problems. The key insight to our approach is that while joint inference over continuous and discrete state spaces is often hard, many commonly encountered discrete-continuous problems can naturally be split into a “discrete part” and a “continuous part” that can individually be solved easily. Leveraging this structure, we optimize discrete and continuous variables in an alternating fashion. In consequence, our proposed work enables straightforward representation of and approximate inference in discrete-continuous graphical models. We also provide a method to approximate the uncertainty in estimates of both discrete and continuous variables. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through its application to distinct robot perception applications, including robust pose graph optimization, and object-based mapping and localization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
