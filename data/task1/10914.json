      "content": "Paper Title: FreeA: Human-object Interaction Detection using Free Annotation Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent human-object interaction (HOI) detection approaches rely on high cost of manpower and require comprehensive annotated image datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel self-adaption language-driven HOI detection method, termed as FreeA, without labeling by leveraging the adaptability of CLIP to generate latent HOI labels. To be specific, FreeA matches image features of human-object pairs with HOI text templates, and a priori knowledge-based mask method is developed to suppress improbable interactions. In addition, FreeA utilizes the proposed interaction correlation matching method to enhance the likelihood of actions related to a specified action, further refine the generated HOI labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that FreeA achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised HOI models. Our approach is +8.58 mean Average Precision (mAP) on HICO-DET and +1.23 mAP on V-COCO more accurate in localizing and classifying the interactive actions than the newest weakly model, and +1.68 mAP and +7.28 mAP than the latest weakly+ model, respectively. Code will be available at https://drliuqi.github.io/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
