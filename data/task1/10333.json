Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A two-circuit approach to reducing quantum resources for the quantum lattice Boltzmann method\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases, lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit algorithm we form solves the Navier–Stokes equations with a marked reduction in CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream function–vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier–Stokes equations and verified and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific interest.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
