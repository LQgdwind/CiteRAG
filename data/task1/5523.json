Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Transitive Information Theory and its Application to Deep Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Paradoxically, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) could be pushed in two opposite directions, utilizing powerful decoder model for generating realistic images but collapsing the learned representation, or increasing regularization coefficient for disentangling representation but ultimately generating blurry examples. Existing methods narrow the issues to the rate-distortion trade-off between compression and reconstruction. We argue that a good reconstruction model does learn high capacity latents that encode more details, however, its use is hindered by two major issues: the prior is random noise which is completely detached from the posterior and allow no controllability in the generation; mean-field variational inference doesn‚Äôt enforce hierarchy structure which makes the task of recombining those units into plausible novel output infeasible. As a result, we develop a system that learns a hierarchy of disentangled representation together with a mechanism for recombining the learned representation for generalization. This is achieved by introducing a minimal amount of inductive bias to learn controllable prior for the VAE. The idea is supported by here developed transitive information theory, that is, the mutual information between two target variables could alternately be maximized through the mutual information to the third variable, thus bypassing the rate-distortion bottleneck in VAE design. In particular, we show that our model, named SemafoVAE (inspired by the similar concept in computer science), could generate high-quality examples in a controllable manner, perform smooth traversals of the disentangled factors and intervention at a different level of representation hierarchy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
