Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Computing a Stable Distance on Merge Trees\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Distances on merge trees facilitate visual comparison of collections of scalar fields. Two desirable properties for these distances to exhibit are 1) the ability to discern between scalar fields which other, less complex topological summaries cannot and 2) to still be robust to perturbations in the dataset. The combination of these two properties, known respectively as stability and discriminativity, has led to theoretical distances which are either thought to be or shown to be computationally complex and thus their implementations have been scarce. In order to design similarity measures on merge trees which are computationally feasible for more complex merge trees, many researchers have elected to loosen the restrictions on at least one of these two properties. The question still remains, however, if there are practical situations where trading these desirable properties is necessary. Here we construct a distance between merge trees which is designed to retain both discriminativity and stability. While our approach can be expensive for large merge trees, we illustrate its use in a setting where the number of nodes is small. This setting can be made more practical since we also provide a proof that persistence simplification increases the outputted distance by at most half of the simplified value. We demonstrate our distance measure on applications in shape comparison and on detection of periodicity in the von Kármán vortex street.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
