Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A massively parallel Eulerian-Lagrangian method for advection-dominated transport in viscous fluids\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivated by challenges in Earth mantle convection, we present a massively parallel implementation of an Eulerian-Lagrangian method for the advection-diffusion equation in the advection-dominated regime. The advection term is treated by a particle-based, characteristics method coupled to a block-structured finite-element framework. Its numerical and computational performance is evaluated in multiple, two- and three-dimensional benchmarks, including curved geometries, discontinuous solutions, pure advection, and it is applied to a coupled non-linear system modeling buoyancy-driven convection in Stokes flow. We demonstrate the parallel performance in a strong and weak scaling experiment, with scalability to up to 147,456147456147,456 parallel processes, solving for more than 5.2×10105.2superscript10105.2\\times 10^{10} (52 billion) degrees of freedom per time-step.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
