      "content": "Paper Title: TuRaN: True Random Number Generation Using Supply Voltage Underscaling in SRAMs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract True random number generators (TRNGs) rely on unpredictable physical entropy sources such as electrical noise, thermal noise, and clock jitters. However, not all computing devices are equipped with dedicated hardware to extract entropy from these sources. Thus, it is costly to provide true random number generation capability to computing systems via dedicated hardware. Prior works propose SRAM-based TRNGs that extract entropy from SRAM arrays. SRAM arrays are widely used in a majority of specialized or general-purpose chips that perform computation to store data inside the chip. Thus, SRAM-based TRNGs present a low-cost alternative to dedicated hardware TRNGs. However, existing SRAM-based TRNGs suffer from 1) low TRNG throughput, 2) high energy consumption, 3) high TRNG latency, and 4) the inability to generate true random numbers continuously, which limits the application space of SRAM-based TRNGs. Our goal in this paper is to design an SRAM-based TRNG that overcomes these four key limitations and thus, extends the application space of SRAM-based TRNGs. To this end, we propose TuRaN, a new high-throughput, energy-efficient, and low-latency SRAM-based TRNG that can sustain continuous operation. TuRaN leverages the key observation that accessing SRAM cells results in random access failures when the supply voltage is reduced below the manufacturer-recommended supply voltage. TuRaN generates random numbers at high throughput by repeatedly accessing SRAM cells with reduced supply voltage and post-processing the resulting random faults using the SHA-256 hash function. To demonstrate the feasibility of TuRaN, we conduct SPICE simulations on different process nodes and analyze the potential of access failure for use as an entropy source. We verify and support our simulation results by conducting real-world experiments on two commercial off-the-shelf FPGA boards. We evaluate the quality of the random numbers generated by TuRaN using the widely-adopted NIST standard randomness tests and observe that TuRaN passes all tests. TuRaN generates true random numbers with (i) an average (maximum) throughput of 1.6​G​b​p​s1.6𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠1.6Gbps (1.812​G​b​p​s1.812𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠1.812Gbps), (ii) 0.11​n​J/b​i​t0.11𝑛𝐽𝑏𝑖𝑡0.11nJ/bit energy consumption, and (iii) 278.46​μ​s278.46𝜇𝑠278.46\\mu s latency. TuRaN outperforms the state-of-the-art SRAM-based TRNGs by 2.26×2.26\\times, 5.09×5.09\\times, and 5.39×5.39\\times in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, and latency, respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 121 most likely reference titles for this paper.
