Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: High-Contrast Reflection Tomography with Total-Variation Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Inverse scattering is the process of estimating the spatial distribution of the scattering potential of an object by measuring the scattered wavefields around it. In this paper, we consider reflection tomography of high contrast objects that commonly occurs in ground-penetrating radar, exploration geophysics, terahertz imaging, ultrasound, and electron microscopy. Unlike conventional transmission tomography, the reflection regime is severely ill-posed since the measured wavefields contain far less spatial frequency information of the target object. We propose a constrained incremental frequency inversion framework that requires no side information from a background model of the object. Our framework solves a sequence of regularized least-squares subproblems that ensure consistency with the measured scattered wavefield while imposing total-variation and non-negativity constraints. We propose a proximal Quasi-Newton method to solve the resulting subproblem and devise an automatic parameter selection routine to determine the constraint of each subproblem. We validate the performance of our approach on synthetic low-resolution phantoms and with a mismatched forward model test on a high-resolution phantom.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
