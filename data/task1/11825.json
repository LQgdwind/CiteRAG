Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Methods for Few-View CT Image Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computed Tomography (CT) is an essential non-destructive three dimensional imaging modality used in medicine, security screening, and inspection of manufactured components. Typical CT data acquisition entails the collection of a thousand or more projections through the object under investigation through a range of angles covering one hundred eighty degrees or more. It may be desirable or required that the number of projections angles be reduced by one or two orders of magnitude for reasons such as acquisition time or dose. Unless specialized reconstruction algorithms are applied, reconstructing with fewer views will result in streak artifacts and failure to resolve object boundaries at certain orientations. These artifacts may substantially diminish the usefulness of the reconstructed CT volumes. Here we develop constrained and regularized numerical optimization methods to reconstruct CT volumes from 4-28 projections. These methods entail utilization of novel data fidelity and convex and non-convex regularization terms. In addition, the methods outlined here are usually carried out by a sequence of two or three numerical optimization methods in sequence. The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated on four measured and three simulated few-view CT data sets. We show that these methods outperform other state of the art few-view numerical optimization methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
