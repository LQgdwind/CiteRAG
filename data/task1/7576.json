Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MoDem: Accelerating Visual Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Demonstrations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Poor sample efficiency continues to be the primary challenge for deployment of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for real-world applications, and in particular for visuo-motor control. Model-based RL has the potential to be highly sample efficient by concurrently learning a world model and using synthetic rollouts for planning and policy improvement. However, in practice, sample-efficient learning with model-based RL is bottlenecked by the exploration challenge. In this work, we find that leveraging just a handful of demonstrations can dramatically improve the sample-efficiency of model-based RL. Simply appending demonstrations to the interaction dataset, however, does not suffice. We identify key ingredients for leveraging demonstrations in model learning ‚Äì policy pretraining, targeted exploration, and oversampling of demonstration data ‚Äì which forms the three phases of our model-based RL framework. We empirically study three complex visuo-motor control domains and find that our method is ùüèùüîùüé%‚àíùüêùüìùüé%percent160percent250\\mathbf{160}\\%-\\mathbf{250}\\% more successful in completing sparse reward tasks compared to prior approaches in the low data regime (ùüèùüéùüé‚Äãùêä100ùêä\\mathbf{100K} interaction steps, ùüì5\\mathbf{5} demonstrations).
