Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Intent Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Users’ interactions with items are driven by various intents (e.g., preparing for holiday gifts, shopping for fishing equipment, etc.). However, users’ underlying intents are often unobserved/latent, making it challenging to leverage such latent intents for Sequential recommendation (SR). To investigate the benefits of latent intents and leverage them effectively for recommendation, we propose Intent Contrastive Learning (ICL), a general learning paradigm that leverages a latent intent variable into SR. The core idea is to learn users’ intent distribution functions from unlabeled user behavior sequences and optimize SR models with contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) by considering the learnt intents to improve recommendation. Specifically, we introduce a latent variable to represent users’ intents and learn the distribution function of the latent variable via clustering. We propose to leverage the learnt intents into SR models via contrastive SSL, which maximizes the agreement between a view of sequence and its corresponding intent. The training is alternated between intent representation learning and the SR model optimization steps within the generalized expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Fusing user intent information into SR also improves model robustness. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed learning paradigm, which improves performance, and robustness against data sparsity and noisy interaction issues 111Code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/ICLRec.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
