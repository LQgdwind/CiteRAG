Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Segregated Lipschitz Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. This paper presents an approach to semi-supervised learning for the classification of data using the Lipschitz Learning on graphs. We develop a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework that leverages the properties of the infinity Laplacian to propagate labels in a dataset where only a few samples are labeled. By extending the theory of spatial segregation from the Laplace operator to the infinity Laplace operator, both in continuum and discrete settings, our approach provides a robust method for dealing with class imbalance, a common challenge in machine learning. Experimental validation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method not only improves classification accuracy compared to existing methods but also ensures efficient label propagation in scenarios with limited labeled data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
