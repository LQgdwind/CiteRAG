Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Prior-informed uncertainty modelling with Bayesian polynomial approximations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Orthogonal polynomial approximations form the foundation to a set of well-established methods for uncertainty quantification known as polynomial chaos. These approximations deliver models for emulating physical systems in a variety of computational engineering applications. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian formulation of polynomial approximations capable of incorporating uncertainties in input data. Through different priors in a hierarchical structure, this enables us to incorporate expert knowledge on the inference task via different approaches. These include beliefs of sparsity in the model, approximate knowledge of the polynomial coefficients (e.g., through low-fidelity estimates) or output mean, and correlated models that share similar functional and/or physical behaviours. We show that, through a Bayesian framework, such prior knowledge can be leveraged to produce orthogonal polynomial approximations with enhanced predictive accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
