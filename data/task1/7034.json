Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: EDGE: Knowledge-Driven New Drug Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Drug recommendation assists doctors in prescribing personalized medications to patients based on their health conditions. Existing drug recommendation solutions adopt the supervised multi-label classification setup and only work with existing drugs with sufficient prescription data from many patients. However, newly approved drugs do not have much historical prescription data and cannot leverage existing drug recommendation methods. To address this, we formulate the new drug recommendation as a few-shot learning problem. Yet, directly applying existing few-shot learning algorithms faces two challenges: (1) complex relations among diseases and drugs and (2) numerous false-negative patients who were eligible but did not yet use the new drugs. To tackle these challenges, we propose EDGE, which can quickly adapt to the recommendation for a new drug with limited prescription data from a few support patients. EDGE maintains a drug-dependent multi-phenotype few-shot learner to bridge the gap between existing and new drugs. Specifically, EDGE leverages the drug ontology to link new drugs to existing drugs with similar treatment effects and learns ontology-based drug representations. Such drug representations are used to customize the metric space of the phenotype-driven patient representations, which are composed of a set of phenotypes capturing complex patient health status. Lastly, EDGE eliminates the false-negative supervision signal using an external drug-disease knowledge base. We evaluate EDGE on two real-world datasets: the public EHR data (MIMIC-IV) and private industrial claims data. Results show that EDGE achieves 7.3% improvement on the ROC-AUC score over the best baseline.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
