Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Network connectivity optimization: An evaluation of heuristics applied to complex networks and a transportation case study\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Network optimization has generally been focused on solving network flow problems, but recently there have been investigations into optimizing network characteristics. Optimizing network connectivity to maximize the number of nodes within a given distance to a focal node and then minimizing the number and length of additional connections has not been as thoroughly explored, yet is important in several domains including transportation planning, telecommunications networks, and geospatial analysis. We compare several heuristics to explore this network connectivity optimization problem with the use of random networks, including the introduction of two planar random networks that are useful for spatial network simulation research, and a real-world case study from urban planning and public health. We observe significant variation between nodal characteristics and optimal connections across network types. This result along with the computational costs of the search for optimal solutions highlights the difficulty of finding effective heuristics. A novel genetic algorithm is proposed and we find this optimization heuristic outperforms existing techniques and describe how it can be applied to other combinatorial and dynamic problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
