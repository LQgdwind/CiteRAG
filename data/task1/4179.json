Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Working Memory Connections for LSTM\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) make use of gating mechanisms to mitigate exploding and vanishing gradients when learning long-term dependencies. For this reason, LSTMs and other gated RNNs are widely adopted, being the standard de facto for many sequence modeling tasks. Although the memory cell inside the LSTM contains essential information, it is not allowed to influence the gating mechanism directly. In this work, we improve the gate potential by including information coming from the internal cell state. The proposed modification, named Working Memory Connection, consists in adding a learnable nonlinear projection of the cell content into the network gates. This modification can fit into the classical LSTM gates without any assumption on the underlying task, being particularly effective when dealing with longer sequences. Previous research effort in this direction, which goes back to the early 2000s, could not bring a consistent improvement over vanilla LSTM. As part of this paper, we identify a key issue tied to previous connections that heavily limits their effectiveness, hence preventing a successful integration of the knowledge coming from the internal cell state. We show through extensive experimental evaluation that Working Memory Connections constantly improve the performance of LSTMs on a variety of tasks. Numerical results suggest that the cell state contains useful information that is worth including in the gate structure.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
