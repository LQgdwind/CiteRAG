      "content": "Paper Title: A New Meshless “Fragile Points Method” and A Local Variational Iteration Method for General Transient Heat Conduction in Anisotropic Nonhomogeneous Media\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A new and effective computational approach is presented for analyzing transient heat conduction problems. The approach consists of a meshless Fragile Points Method (FPM) being utilized for spatial discretization, and a Local Variational Iteration (LVI) scheme for time discretization. Anisotropy and nonhomogeneity do not give rise to any difficulties in the present implementation. The meshless FPM is based on a Galerkin weak-form formulation and thus leads to symmetric matrices. Local, very simple, polynomial and discontinuous trial and test functions are employed. In the meshless FPM, Interior Penalty Numerical Fluxes are introduced to ensure the consistency of the method. The LVIM in the time domain is generated as a combination of the Variational Iteration Method (VIM) applied over a large time interval and numerical algorithms. A set of collocation nodes are employed in each finitely large time interval. The FPM + LVIM approach is capable of solving transient heat transfer problems in complex geometries with mixed boundary conditions, including pre-existing cracks. Numerical examples are presented in 2D and 3D domains. Both functionally graded materials and composite materials are considered. It is shown that, with suitable computational parameters, the FPM + LVIM approach is not only accurate, but also efficient, and has reliable stability under relatively large time intervals. The present methodology represents a considerable improvement to the current state of science in computational transient heat conduction in anisotropic nonhomogeneous media.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
