Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cognitively-Inspired Model for Incremental Learning Using a Few Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Incremental learning attempts to develop a classifier which learns continuously from a stream of data segregated into different classes. Deep learning approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning classes incrementally, while most incremental learning approaches require a large amount of training data per class. We examine the problem of incremental learning using only a few training examples, referred to as Few-Shot Incremental Learning (FSIL). To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach inspired by the concept learning model of the hippocampus and the neocortex that represents each image class as centroids and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our approach on three class-incremental learning benchmarks: Caltech-101, CUBS-200-2011 and CIFAR-100 for incremental and few-shot incremental learning and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of classification accuracy over all learned classes.111Code available at: https://github.com/aliayub7/CBCL\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
