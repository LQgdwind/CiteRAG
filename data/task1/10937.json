Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Spintronic Implementation of UNet for Image Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Image segmentation plays a crucial role in computer vision applications like self-driving cars, satellite imagery analysis, and medical diagnosis. Implementing these complex deep neural networks on conventional hardware is highly inefficient. In this work, we propose hardware implementation of UNet for segmentation tasks, using spintronic devices. Our approach involves designing hardware for convolution, deconvolution, ReLU, and max pooling layers of the UNet architecture. We demonstrate the synaptic behavior of the domain wall MTJ, and design convolution and deconvolution layers using the domain wall-based crossbar array. We utilize the orthogonal current injected MTJ with its continuous resistance change and showcase the ReLU and max pooling functions. We employ a hybrid simulation setup by coupling micromagnetic simulation, non-equilibrium Greenâ€™s function, Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equations, and circuit simulation with Python programming to incorporate the diverse physics of spin-transport, magnetization dynamics, and CMOS elements in our proposed designs. We evaluate our UNet design on the CamVid dataset and achieve segmentation accuracies that are comparable to software implementation. During training, our design consumes 43.59pJ of energy for synaptic weight updates.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
