Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithmic Decorrelation and Planted Clique in Dependent Random Graphs: The Case of Extra Triangles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We aim to understand the extent to which the noise distribution in a planted signal-plus-noise problem impacts its computational complexity. To that end, we consider the planted clique and planted dense subgraph problems, but in a different ambient graph. Instead of Erd≈ës-R√©nyi G‚Äã(n,p)ùê∫ùëõùëùG(n,p), which has independent edges, we take the ambient graph to be the random graph with triangles (RGT) obtained by adding triangles to G‚Äã(n,p)ùê∫ùëõùëùG(n,p). We show that the RGT can be efficiently mapped to the corresponding G‚Äã(n,p)ùê∫ùëõùëùG(n,p), and moreover, that the planted clique (or dense subgraph) is approximately preserved under this mapping. This constitutes the first average-case reduction transforming dependent noise to independent noise. Together with the easier direction of mapping the ambient graph from Erd≈ës-R√©nyi to RGT, our results yield a strong equivalence between models. In order to prove our results, we develop a new general framework for reasoning about the validity of average-case reductions based on low sensitivity to perturbations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
