Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Offline Learning for Planning: A Summary\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The training of autonomous agents often requires expensive and unsafe trial-and-error interactions with the environment. Nowadays several data sets containing recorded experiences of intelligent agents performing various tasks, spanning from the control of unmanned vehicles to human-robot interaction and medical applications are accessible on the internet. With the intention of limiting the costs of the learning procedure it is convenient to exploit the information that is already available rather than collecting new data. Nevertheless, the incapability to augment the batch can lead the autonomous agents to develop far from optimal behaviours when the sampled experiences do not allow for a good estimate of the true distribution of the environment. Offline learning is the area of machine learning concerned with efficiently obtaining an optimal policy with a batch of previously collected experiences without further interaction with the environment. In this paper we adumbrate the ideas motivating the development of the state-of-the-art offline learning baselines. The listed methods consist in the introduction of epistemic uncertainty dependent constraints during the classical resolution of a Markov Decision Process, with and without function approximators, that aims to alleviate the bad effects of the distributional mismatch between the available samples and real world. We provide comments on the practical utility of the theoretical bounds that justify the application of these algorithms and suggest the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks to estimate the distributional shift that affects all of the proposed model-free and model-based approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
