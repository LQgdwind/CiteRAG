The author list has been sorted alphabetically by last name; this should not be used to determine the extent of authors’ contributions.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge compilation concerns with the compilation of representation languages to target languages supporting a wide range of tractable operations arising from diverse areas of computer science. Tractable target compilation languages are usually achieved by restrictions on the internal nodes (∧\\land or ∨\\lor) of the 𝖭𝖭𝖥𝖭𝖭𝖥\\mathsf{NNF}. In this paper, we propose a new representation language 𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣\\mathsf{CCDD}, which introduces new restrictions on conjunction nodes to capture equivalent literals. We show that 𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣\\mathsf{CCDD} supports two key queries, model counting and uniform samping, in polytime. We present algorithms and a compiler to compile propositional formulas expressed in 𝖢𝖭𝖥𝖢𝖭𝖥\\mathsf{CNF} into 𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣𝖢𝖢𝖣𝖣\\mathsf{CCDD}. Experiments over a large set of benchmarks show that our compilation times are better with smaller representations than state-of-art Decision-𝖣𝖭𝖭𝖥𝖣𝖭𝖭𝖥\\mathsf{DNNF}, 𝖲𝖣𝖣𝖲𝖣𝖣\\mathsf{SDD} and 𝖮𝖡𝖣𝖣​[∧]𝖮𝖡𝖣𝖣delimited-[]\\mathsf{OBDD[\\wedge]} compilers. We apply our techniques to model counting and uniform sampling, and develop model counter and uniform sampler on 𝖢𝖭𝖥𝖢𝖭𝖥\\mathsf{CNF}. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the following significant improvements: our model counter can solve 885 instances while the prior state of the art solved only 843 instances, representing an improvement of 43 instances; and our uniform sampler can solve 780 instances while the prior state of the art solved only 648 instances, representing an improvement of 132 instances.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
