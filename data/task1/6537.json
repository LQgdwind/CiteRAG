Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: AutoCellLibX: Automated Standard Cell Library Extension Based on Pattern Mining\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Custom standard cell libraries can improve the final quality of the corresponding VLSI designs but properly customizing standard cell libraries remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of the VLSI designs. This paper presents an automatic standard-cell library extension framework, AutoCellLibX. It can find a set of standard cell cluster pattern candidates from the post-technology mapping gate-level netlist, with the consideration of standard cell characteristics and technology mapping constraints, based on our high-efficiency frequent subgraph mining algorithm. Meanwhile, to maximize the area benefit of standard cell customization for the given gate-level netlist, AutoCellLibX includes our proposed pattern combination algorithm which can iteratively find a set of gate-level patterns from numerous candidates as the extension part of the given initial standard cell library. To the best of our knowledge, AutoCellLibX is the first automated standard cell extension framework that closes the optimization loop between the analysis of gate-level netlist and standard cell library customization for VLSI design productivity. The experiments with FreePDK45 library and benchmarks from various domains show that AutoCellLibX can generate the library extension with up to 5 custom standard cells within 1.1 hours for each of the 31 benchmark designs and the resultant extension of the standard cell library can save design area by 4.49% averagely.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
