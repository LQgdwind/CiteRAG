An extended abstract of the paper appeared in the proceedings of WADS 2021 [7].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A bipartite graph G=(A,B,E)𝐺𝐴𝐵𝐸G=(A,B,E) is ℋℋ{\\cal H}-convex, for some family of graphs ℋℋ{\\cal H}, if there exists a graph H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in{\\cal H} with V​(H)=A𝑉𝐻𝐴V(H)=A such that the set of neighbours in A𝐴A of each b∈B𝑏𝐵b\\in B induces a connected subgraph of H𝐻H. Many 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete problems, including problems such as Dominating Set, Feedback Vertex Set, Induced Matching and List k𝑘k-Colouring, become polynomial-time solvable for ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}}-convex graphs when ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} is the set of paths. In this case, the class of ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}}-convex graphs is known as the class of convex graphs. The underlying reason is that the class of convex graphs has bounded mim-width. We extend the latter result to families of ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}}-convex graphs where (i) ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} is the set of cycles, or (ii) ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} is the set of trees with bounded maximum degree and a bounded number of vertices of degree at least 333. As a consequence, we can strengthen a large number of results on generalized convex graphs known in the literature via one general and relatively short proof. To complement result (ii), we show that the mim-width of ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}}-convex graphs is unbounded if ℋℋ{\\mathcal{H}} is the set of trees with arbitrarily large maximum degree or an arbitrarily large number of vertices of degree at least 333. In this way we are able to determine complexity dichotomies for the aforementioned graph problems. We prove our results via a more refined width-parameter analysis. This yields an even clearer picture of which width parameters are bounded for classes of ℋℋ{\\cal H}-convex graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
