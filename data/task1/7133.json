      "content": "Paper Title: Black Box Model Explanations and the Human Interpretability Expectations - An Analysis in the Context of Homicide Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Strategies based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence - XAI have promoted better human interpretability of the results of black box machine learning models. This sets a precedent for questioning whether or not human expectations are being met when faced with the explanations of this type of model. The XAI measures being currently used (Ciu, Dalex, Eli5, Lofo, Shap, and Skater) provide various forms of explanations, including global rankings of relevance of attributes, which allow for an overview of how the model is explained as a result of its inputs and outputs. These measures provide for an increase in the explainability of the model and a greater interpretability grounded on the context of the problem. Current research points to the need for further studies (within a specific context/problem) on how these explanations meet the Interpretability Expectations of human experts and how they can be used to make the model even more transparent while taking into account specific complexities of the model and dataset being analyzed, as well as important human factors of sensitive real-world contexts/problems. Intending to shed light on the explanations generated by XAI measures and their interpretabilities, this research addresses a real-world classification problem related to homicide prediction, duly endorsed by the scientific community, replicated its proposed black box model and used 6 different XAI measures to generate explanations and 6 different human experts to generate what this research referred to as Interpretability Expectations - IE. The results were computed by means of comparative analysis and identification of relationships among all the attribute ranks produced, and 49% concordance was found among attributes indicated by means of XAI measures and human experts, 41% exclusively by XAI measures and 10% exclusively by human experts. The results allow for answering questions such as: “Do the different XAI measures generate similar explanations for the proposed problem?”, “Are the interpretability expectations generated among different human experts similar?”,“Do the explanations generated by XAI measures meet the interpretability expectations of human experts?” and “Can Interpretability Explanations and Expectations work together?”, all of which concerning the context of homicide prediction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
