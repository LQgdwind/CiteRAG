Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty-Aware Explainable Recommendation with Large Language Models † Co-first authors. ∗ Corresponding authors.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Providing explanations within the recommendation system would boost user satisfaction and foster trust, especially by elaborating on the reasons for selecting recommended items tailored to the user. The predominant approach in this domain revolves around generating text-based explanations, with a notable emphasis on applying large language models (LLMs). However, refining LLMs for explainable recommendations proves impractical due to time constraints and computing resource limitations. As an alternative, the current approach involves training the prompt rather than the LLM. In this study, we developed a model that utilizes the ID vectors of user and item inputs as prompts for GPT-2. We employed a joint training mechanism within a multi-task learning framework to optimize both the recommendation task and explanation task. This strategy enables a more effective exploration of users’ interests, improving recommendation effectiveness and user satisfaction. Through the experiments, our method achieving 1.59 DIV, 0.57 USR and 0.41 FCR on the Yelp, TripAdvisor and Amazon dataset respectively, demonstrates superior performance over four SOTA methods in terms of explainability evaluation metric. In addition, we identified that the proposed model is able to ensure stable textual quality on the three public datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
