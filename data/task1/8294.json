Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: How does SSD Cluster Perform for Distributed File Systems: An Empirical Study\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract [Summary]As the capacity of Solid-State Drives (SSDs) is constantly being optimised and boosted with gradually reduced cost, the SSD cluster is now widely deployed as part of the hybrid storage system in various scenarios such as cloud computing and big data processing. However, despite its rapid developments, the performance of the SSD cluster remains largely under-investigated, leaving its sub-optimal applications in reality. To address this issue, in this paper we conduct extensive empirical studies for a comprehensive understanding of the SSD cluster in diverse settings. To this end, we configure a real SSD cluster and gather the generated trace data based on some often-used benchmarks, then adopt analytical methods to analyse the performance of the SSD cluster with different configurations. In particular, regression models are built to provide better performance predictability under broader configurations, and the correlations between influential factors and performance metrics with respect to different numbers of nodes are investigated, which reveal the high scalability of the SSD cluster. Additionally, the cluster’s network bandwidth is inspected to explain the performance bottleneck. Finally, the knowledge gained is summarised to benefit the SSD cluster deployment in practice.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
