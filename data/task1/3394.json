Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Not Far Away, Not So Close: Sample Efficient Nearest Neighbour Data Augmentation via MiniMax\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In Natural Language Processing (NLP), finding data augmentation techniques that can produce high-quality human-interpretable examples has always been challenging. Recently, leveraging kùëòkNN such that augmented examples are retrieved from large repositories of unlabelled sentences has made a step toward interpretable augmentation. Inspired by this paradigm, we introduce MiniMax-kùëòkNN, a sample efficient data augmentation strategy tailored for Knowledge Distillation (KD). We exploit a semi-supervised approach based on KD to train a model on augmented data. In contrast to existing kùëòkNN augmentation techniques that blindly incorporate all samples, our method dynamically selects a subset of augmented samples that maximizes KL-divergence between the teacher and student models. This step aims to extract the most efficient samples to ensure our augmented data covers regions in the input space with maximum loss value. We evaluated our technique on several text classification tasks and demonstrated that MiniMax-kùëòkNN consistently outperforms strong baselines. Our results show that MiniMax-kùëòkNN requires fewer augmented examples and less computation to achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art kùëòkNN-based augmentation techniques.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
