Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Optimization of ESG Financial Investments\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Financial experts and analysts seek to predict the variability of financial markets. In particular, the correct prediction of this variability ensures investors successful investments. However, there has been a big trend in finance in the last years, which are the ESG criteria. Concretely, ESG (Economic, Social and Governance) criteria have become more significant in finance due to the growing importance of investments being socially responsible, and because of the financial impact companies suffer when not complying with them. Consequently, creating a stock portfolio should not only take into account its performance but compliance with ESG criteria. Hence, this paper combines mathematical modelling, with ESG and finance. In more detail, we use Bayesian optimization (BO), a sequential state-of-the-art design strategy to optimize black-boxes with unknown analytical and costly-to compute expressions, to maximize the performance of a stock portfolio under the presence of ESG criteria soft constraints incorporated to the objective function. In an illustrative experiment, we use the Sharpe ratio, that takes into consideration the portfolio’s returns and its variance, in other words, it balances the trade-off between maximizing returns and minimizing risks. On the other hand, ESG considers a wide variety of criteria such as climate change, business ethics or corporate governance. In the present work, ESG criteria have been divided into fourteen independent categories used in a linear combination to estimate a firm’s total ESG score. Most importantly, our presented approach would scale to alternative black-box methods of estimating the performance and ESG compliance of the stock portfolio. In particular, this research has opened the door to many new research lines, as it has proved that a portfolio can be optimized using a BO that takes into consideration financial performance and the accomplishment of ESG criteria.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
