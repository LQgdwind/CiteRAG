Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: OTAvatar:One-shot Talking Face Avatar with Controllable Tri-plane Rendering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Controllability, generalizability and efficiency are the major objectives of constructing face avatars represented by neural implicit field. However, existing methods have not managed to accommodate the three requirements simultaneously. They either focus on static portraits, restricting the representation ability to a specific subject, or suffer from substantial computational cost, limiting their flexibility. In this paper, we propose One-shot Talking face Avatar (OTAvatar), which constructs face avatars by a generalized controllable tri-plane rendering solution so that each personalized avatar can be constructed from only one portrait as the reference. Specifically, OTAvatar first inverts a portrait image to a motion-free identity code. Second, the identity code and a motion code are utilized to modulate an efficient CNN to generate a tri-plane formulated volume, which encodes the subject in the desired motion. Finally, volume rendering is employed to generate an image in any view. The core of our solution is a novel decoupling-by-inverting strategy that disentangles identity and motion in the latent code via optimization-based inversion. Benefiting from the efficient tri-plane representation, we achieve controllable rendering of generalized face avatar at 353535 FPS on A100. Experiments show promising performance of cross-identity reenactment on subjects out of the training set and better 3D consistency. The code is available at https://github.com/theEricMa/OTAvatar.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
