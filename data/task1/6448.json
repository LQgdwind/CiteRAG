Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Proposal-Free Temporal Action Detection via Global Segmentation Mask Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on generating an overwhelmingly large number of proposals per video. This leads to complex model designs due to proposal generation and/or per-proposal action instance evaluation and the resultant high computational cost. In this work, for the first time, we propose a proposal-free Temporal Action detection model via Global Segmentation mask (TAGS). Our core idea is to learn a global segmentation mask of each action instance jointly at the full video length. The TAGS model differs significantly from the conventional proposal-based methods by focusing on global temporal representation learning to directly detect local start and end points of action instances without proposals. Further, by modeling TAD holistically rather than locally at the individual proposal level, TAGS needs a much simpler model architecture with lower computational cost. Extensive experiments show that despite its simpler design, TAGS outperforms existing TAD methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks. Importantly, it is ∼20×\\sim{20\\times} faster to train and ∼1.6×\\sim{1.6\\times} more efficient for inference. Our PyTorch implementation of TAGS is available at https://github.com/sauradip/TAGS.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
