Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: A large and natural Class of Œ£^ùëù‚ÇÇ- and Œ£^ùëù‚ÇÉ-complete Problems in Bilevel and Robust Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Because Œ£2psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}- and Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-hardness proofs are usually tedious and difficult, not so many complete problems for these classes are known. This is especially true in the areas of min-max regret robust optimization, network interdiction, most vital vertex problems, blocker problems, and two-stage adjustable robust optimization problems. Even though these areas are well-researched for over two decades and one would naturally expect many (if not most) of the problems occurring in these areas to be complete for the above classes, almost no completeness results exist in the literature. We address this lack of knowledge by introducing over 70 new Œ£2psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}-complete and Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete problems. We achieve this result by proving a new meta-theorem, which shows Œ£2psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}- and Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-completeness simultaneously for a huge class of problems. The majority of all earlier publications on Œ£2psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}- and Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-completeness in said areas are special cases of our meta-theorem. Our precise result is the following: We introduce a large list of problems for which the meta-theorem is applicable (including clique, vertex cover, knapsack, TSP, facility location and many more). For every problem on this list, we show: The interdiction/minimum cost blocker/most vital nodes problem (with element costs) is Œ£2psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}-complete. The min-max-regret problem with interval uncertainty is Œ£2psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}-complete. The two-stage adjustable robust optimization problem with discrete budgeted uncertainty is Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete. In summary, our work reveals the interesting insight that a large amount of NP-complete problems have the property that their min-max versions are ?automatically? Œ£2psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}-complete.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
