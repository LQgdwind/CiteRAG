      "content": "Paper Title: Memory-efficient model-based deep learning with convergence and robustness guarantees\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computational imaging has been revolutionized by compressed sensing algorithms, which offer guaranteed uniqueness, convergence, and stability properties. Model-based deep learning methods that combine imaging physics with learned regularization priors have emerged as more powerful alternatives for image recovery. The main focus of this paper is to introduce a memory efficient model-based algorithm with similar theoretical guarantees as CS methods. The proposed iterative algorithm alternates between a gradient descent involving the score function and a conjugate gradient algorithm to encourage data consistency. The score function is modeled as a monotone convolutional neural network. Our analysis shows that the monotone constraint is necessary and sufficient to enforce the uniqueness of the fixed point in arbitrary inverse problems. In addition, it also guarantees the convergence to a fixed point, which is robust to input perturbations. We introduce two implementations of the proposed MOL framework, which differ in the way the monotone property is imposed. The first approach enforces a strict monotone constraint, while the second one relies on an approximation. The guarantees are not valid for the second approach in the strict sense. However, our empirical studies show that the convergence and robustness of both approaches are comparable, while the less constrained approximate implementation offers better performance. The proposed deep equilibrium formulation is significantly more memory efficient than unrolled methods, which allows us to apply it to 3D or 2D+time problems that current unrolled algorithms cannot handle.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
