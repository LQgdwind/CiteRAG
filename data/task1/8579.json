      "content": "Paper Title: Discrepancy-Guided Reconstruction Learning for Image Forgery Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel image forgery detection paradigm for boosting the model learning capacity on both forgery-sensitive and genuine compact visual patterns. Compared to the existing methods that only focus on the discrepant-specific patterns (e.g., noises, textures, and frequencies), our method has a greater generalization. Specifically, we first propose a Discrepancy-Guided Encoder (DisGE) to extract forgery-sensitive visual patterns. DisGE consists of two branches, where the mainstream backbone branch is used to extract general semantic features, and the accessorial discrepant external attention branch is used to extract explicit forgery cues. Besides, a Double-Head Reconstruction (DouHR) module is proposed to enhance genuine compact visual patterns in different granular spaces. Under DouHR, we further introduce a Discrepancy-Aggregation Detector (DisAD) to aggregate these genuine compact visual patterns, such that the forgery detection capability on unknown patterns can be improved. Extensive experimental results on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method against state-of-the-art competitors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
