Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Outlier Robust Adversarial Training\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Supervised learning models are challenged by the intrinsic complexities of training data such as outliers and minority subpopulations and intentional attacks at inference time with adversarial samples. While traditional robust learning methods and the recent adversarial training approaches are designed to handle each of the two challenges, to date, no work has been done to develop models that are robust with regard to the low-quality training data and the potential adversarial attack at inference time simultaneously. It is for this reason that we introduce Outlier Robust Adversarial Training (ORAT) in this work. ORAT is based on a bi-level optimization formulation of adversarial training with a robust rank-based loss function. Theoretically, we show that the learning objective of ORAT satisfies the ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-consistency (Awasthi et al., 2021) in binary classification, which establishes it as a proper surrogate to adversarial 0/1 loss. Furthermore, we analyze its generalization ability and provide uniform convergence rates in high probability. ORAT can be optimized with a simple algorithm. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ORAT in handling outliers and adversarial attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/discovershu/ORAT.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
