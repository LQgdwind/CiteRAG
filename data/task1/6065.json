Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Source Transfer Learning for Deep Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A crucial challenge in reinforcement learning is to reduce the number of interactions with the environment that an agent requires to master a given task. Transfer learning proposes to address this issue by re-using knowledge from previously learned tasks. However, determining which source task qualifies as the most appropriate for knowledge extraction, as well as the choice regarding which algorithm components to transfer, represent severe obstacles to its application in reinforcement learning. The goal of this paper is to address these issues with modular multi-source transfer learning techniques. The proposed techniques automatically learn how to extract useful information from source tasks, regardless of the difference in state-action space and reward function. We support our claims with extensive and challenging cross-domain experiments for visual control.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
