Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Clifford wavelets for fetal ECG extraction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Analysis of the fetal heart rate during pregnancy is essential for monitoring the proper development of the fetus. Current fetal heart monitoring techniques lack the accuracy in fetal heart rate monitoring and features acquisition, resulting in diagnostic medical issues. The challenge lies in the extraction of the fetal ECG from the mother ECG during pregnancy. This approach has the advantage of being reliable and non-invasive technique. For this aim, we propose in this paper a wavelet/multi-wavelet method allowing to extract perfectly the feta ECG parameters from the abdominal mother ECG. The method is essentially due to the exploitation of Clifford wavelets as recent variants in the field. We prove that these wavelets are more efficient and performing against classical ones. The experimental results are therefore due to two basic classes of wavelets and multi-wavelets. A first class is the classical Haar-Schauder, and a second one is due to Clifford valued wavelets and multi-wavelets. These results showed that wavelets/multiwavelets are already good bases for the FECG processing, provided that Clifford ones are the best.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
