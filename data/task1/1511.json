Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: CounteRGAN: Generating Realistic Counterfactuals with Residual Generative Adversarial Nets\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The prevalence of machine learning models in various industries has led to growing demands for model interpretability and for the ability to provide meaningful recourse to users. For example, patients hoping to improve their diagnoses or loan applicants seeking to increase their chances of approval. Counterfactuals can help in this regard by identifying input perturbations that would result in more desirable prediction outcomes. Meaningful counterfactuals should be able to achieve the desired outcome, but also be realistic, actionable, and efficient to compute. Current approaches achieve desired outcomes with moderate actionability but are severely limited in terms of realism and latency. To tackle these limitations, we apply Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) toward counterfactual search. We also introduce a novel Residual GAN (RGAN) that helps to improve counterfactual realism and actionability compared to regular GANs. The proposed CounteRGAN method utilizes an RGAN and a target classifier to produce counterfactuals capable of providing meaningful recourse. Evaluations on two popular datasets highlight how the CounteRGAN is able to overcome the limitations of existing methods, including latency improvements of >>50x to >>90,000x, making meaningful recourse available in real-time and applicable to a wide range of domains.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
