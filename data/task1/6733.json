Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Qubit Mapping and Routing via MaxSAT\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Near-term quantum computers will operate in a noisy environment, without error correction. A critical problem for near-term quantum computing is laying out a logical circuit onto a physical device with limited connectivity between qubits. This is known as the qubit mapping and routing (qmr) problem, an intractable combinatorial problem. It is important to solve qmr as optimally as possible to reduce the amount of added noise, which may render a quantum computation useless. In this paper, we present a novel approach for optimally solving the qmr problem via a reduction to maximum satisfiability (maxsat). Additionally, we present two novel relaxation ideas that shrink the size of the maxsat constraints by exploiting the structure of a quantum circuit. Our thorough empirical evaluation demonstrates (1) the scalability of our approach compared to state-of-the-art optimal qmr techniques (solves more than 3x benchmarks with 40x speedup), (2) the significant cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art heuristic approaches (an average of ∼similar-to\\sim5x swap reduction), and (3) the power of our proposed constraint relaxations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
