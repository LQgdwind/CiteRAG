Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: GPolylla: Fully GPU-accelerated polygonal mesh generator\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work presents a fully GPU-accelerated algorithm for the polygonal mesh generator known as Polylla. Polylla is a tri-to-polygon mesh generator, which benefits from the half-edge data structure to manage any polygonal shape. The proposed parallel algorithm introduces a novel approach to modify triangulations to get polygonal meshes using the half-edge data structure in parallel on the GPU. By changing the adjacency values of each half-edge, the algorithm accomplish to unlink half-edges that are not used in the new polygonal mesh without the need neither removing nor allocating new memory in the GPU. The experimental results show a speedup, reaching up to ×83.2absent83.2\\times 83.2 when compared to the CPU sequential implementation. Additionally, the speedup is ×746.8absent746.8\\times 746.8 when the cost of copying the data structure from the host device and back is not included.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
