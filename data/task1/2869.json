Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Building Safer Autonomous Agents by Leveraging Risky Driving Behavior Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Simulation environments are good for learning different driving tasks like lane changing, parking or handling intersections etc. in an abstract manner. However, these simulation environments often restrict themselves to operate under conservative interaction behavior amongst different vehicles. But, as we know, real driving tasks often involve very high risk scenarios where other drivers often don’t behave in the expected sense. There can be many reasons for this behavior like being tired or inexperienced. The simulation environment doesn’t take this information into account while training the navigation agent. Therefore, in this study we especially focus on systematically creating these risk prone scenarios with heavy traffic and unexpected random behavior for creating better model-free learning agents. We generate multiple autonomous driving scenarios by creating new custom Markov Decision Process (MDP) environment iterations in the highway-env simulation package. The behavior policy is learnt by agents trained with the help from deep reinforcement learning models. Our behavior policy is deliberated to handle collisions and risky randomized driver behavior. We train model free learning agents with supplement information of risk prone driving scenarios and compare their performance with baseline agents. Finally, we casually measure the impact of adding these perturbations in the training process to precisely account for the performance improvement obtained from utilizing the learnings from these scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
