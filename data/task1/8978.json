Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Implementation of a Multi-Layer Gradient-Free Online-Trainable Spiking Neural Network on FPGA\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents an efficient hardware implementation of the recently proposed Optimized Deep Event-driven Spiking Neural Network Architecture (ODESA). ODESA is the first network to have end-to-end multi-layer online local supervised training without using gradients and has the combined adaptation of weights and thresholds in an efficient hierarchical structure. This research shows that the network architecture and the online training of weights and thresholds can be implemented efficiently on a large scale in hardware. The implementation consists of a multi-layer Spiking Neural Network (SNN) and individual training modules for each layer that enable online self-learning without using back-propagation. By using simple local adaptive selection thresholds, a Winner-Takes-All (WTA) constraint on each layer, and a modified weight update rule that is more amenable to hardware, the trainer module allocates neuronal resources optimally at each layer without having to pass high-precision error measurements across layers. All elements in the system, including the training module, interact using event-based binary spikes. The hardware-optimized implementation is shown to preserve the performance of the original algorithm across multiple spatial-temporal classification problems with significantly reduced hardware requirements.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
