Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: 4DSR-GCN: 4D Video Point Cloud Upsampling using Graph Convolutional Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Time varying sequences of 3D point clouds, or 4D point clouds, are now being acquired at an increasing pace in several applications (e.g., LiDAR in autonomous or assisted driving). In many cases, such volume of data is transmitted, thus requiring that proper compression tools are applied to either reduce the resolution or the bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a new solution for upscaling and restoration of time-varying 3D video point clouds after they have been heavily compressed. Our model consists of a specifically designed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that combines Dynamic Edge Convolution and Graph Attention Networks for feature aggregation in a Generative Adversarial setting. We present a different way to sample dense point clouds with the intent to make these modules work in synergy to provide each node enough features about its neighbourhood in order to later on generate new vertices. Compared to other solutions in the literature that address the same task, our proposed model is capable of obtaining comparable results in terms of quality of the reconstruction, while using a substantially lower number of parameters (≃similar-to-or-equals\\simeq 300KB), making our solution deployable in edge computing devices such as LiDAR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
