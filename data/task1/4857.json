      "content": "Paper Title: Anomaly Rule Detection in Sequence Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Analyzing sequence data usually leads to the discovery of interesting patterns and then anomaly detection. In recent years, numerous frameworks and methods have been proposed to discover interesting patterns in sequence data as well as detect anomalous behavior. However, existing algorithms mainly focus on frequency-driven analytic, and they are challenging to be applied in real-world settings. In this work, we present a new anomaly detection framework called DUOS that enables Discovery of Utility-aware Outlier Sequential rules from a set of sequences. In this pattern-based anomaly detection algorithm, we incorporate both the anomalousness and utility of a group, and then introduce the concept of utility-aware outlier sequential rule (UOSR). We show that this is a more meaningful way for detecting anomalies. Besides, we propose some efficient pruning strategies w.r.t. upper bounds for mining UOSR, as well as the outlier detection. An extensive experimental study conducted on several real-world datasets shows that the proposed DUOS algorithm has a better effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, DUOS outperforms the baseline algorithm and has a suitable scalability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
