Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Proof.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivated by modern applications, such as online advertisement and recommender systems, we study the top-k𝑘k eXtreme contextual bandits problem, where the total number of arms can be enormous, and the learner is allowed to select k𝑘k arms and observe all or some of the rewards for the chosen arms. We first propose an algorithm for the non-eXtreme realizable setting, utilizing the Inverse Gap Weighting strategy for selecting multiple arms. We show that our algorithm has a regret guarantee of O​(k​(A−k+1)​T​log⁡(|ℱ|​T))𝑂𝑘𝐴𝑘1𝑇ℱ𝑇O(k\\sqrt{(A-k+1)T\\log(|\\mathcal{F}|T)}), where A𝐴A is the total number of arms and ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is the class containing the regression function, while only requiring O~​(A)~𝑂𝐴\\tilde{O}(A) computation per time step. In the 𝖾𝖷𝗍𝗋𝖾𝗆𝖾𝖾𝖷𝗍𝗋𝖾𝗆𝖾{\\sf eXtreme} setting, where the total number of arms can be in the millions, we propose a practically-motivated arm hierarchy model that induces a certain structure in mean rewards to ensure statistical and computational efficiency. The hierarchical structure allows for an exponential reduction in the number of relevant arms for each context, thus resulting in a regret guarantee of O​(k​(log⁡A−k+1)​T​log⁡(|ℱ|​T))𝑂𝑘𝐴𝑘1𝑇ℱ𝑇O(k\\sqrt{(\\log A-k+1)T\\log(|\\mathcal{F}|T)}). Finally, we implement our algorithm using a hierarchical linear function class and show superior performance with respect to well-known benchmarks on simulated bandit feedback experiments using eXtreme multi-label classification datasets. On a dataset with three million arms, our reduction scheme has an average inference time of only 7.9 milliseconds, which is a 100x improvement.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
