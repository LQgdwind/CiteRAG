Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Symmetry Regularization and Saturating Nonlinearity for Robust Quantization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Robust quantization improves the tolerance of networks for various implementations, allowing reliable output in different bit-widths or fragmented low-precision arithmetic. In this work, we perform extensive analyses to identify the sources of quantization error and present three insights to robustify a network against quantization: reduction of error propagation, range clamping for error minimization, and inherited robustness against quantization. Based on these insights, we propose two novel methods called symmetry regularization (SymReg) and saturating nonlinearity (SatNL). Applying the proposed methods during training can enhance the robustness of arbitrary neural networks against quantization on existing post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) algorithms and enables us to obtain a single weight flexible enough to maintain the output quality under various conditions. We conduct extensive studies on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
