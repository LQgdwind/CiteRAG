Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Intrinsically Motivated Exploration in Continuous Control\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In continuous control, exploration is often performed through undirected strategies in which parameters of the networks or selected actions are perturbed by random noise. Although the deep setting of undirected exploration has been shown to improve the performance of on-policy methods, they introduce an excessive computational complexity and are known to fail in the off-policy setting. The intrinsically motivated exploration is an effective alternative to the undirected strategies, but they are usually studied for discrete action domains. In this paper, we investigate how intrinsic motivation can effectively be combined with deep reinforcement learning in the control of continuous systems to obtain a directed exploratory behavior. We adapt the existing theories on animal motivational systems into the reinforcement learning paradigm and introduce a novel and scalable directed exploration strategy. The introduced approach, motivated by the maximization of the value function’s error, can benefit from a collected set of experiences by extracting useful information and unify the intrinsic exploration motivations in the literature under a single exploration objective. An extensive set of empirical studies demonstrate that our framework extends to larger and more diverse state spaces, dramatically improves the baselines, and outperforms the undirected strategies significantly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
