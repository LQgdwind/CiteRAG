Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Investigating the Impact of Direct Punishment on the Emergence of Cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Solving the problem of cooperation is of fundamental importance to the creation and maintenance of functional societies, with examples of cooperative dilemmas ranging from navigating busy road junctions to negotiating carbon reduction treaties. As the use of AI becomes more pervasive throughout society, the need for socially intelligent agents that are able to navigate these complex cooperative dilemmas is becoming increasingly evident. In the natural world, direct punishment is an ubiquitous social mechanism that has been shown to benefit the emergence of cooperation within populations. However no prior work has investigated its impact on the development of cooperation within populations of artificial learning agents experiencing social dilemmas. Additionally, within natural populations the use of any form of punishment is strongly coupled with the related social mechanisms of partner selection and reputation. However, no previous work has considered the impact of combining multiple social mechanisms on the emergence of cooperation in multi-agent systems. Therefore, in this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the behaviours and learning dynamics associated with direct punishment in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems and how it compares to third-party punishment, when both are combined with the related social mechanisms of partner selection and reputation. We provide an extensive and systematic evaluation of the impact of these key mechanisms on the dynamics of the strategies learned by agents. Finally, we discuss the implications of the use of these mechanisms on the design of cooperative AI systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
