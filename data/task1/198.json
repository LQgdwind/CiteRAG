      "content": "Paper Title: Time-Space Tradeoffs for Distinguishing Distributions and Applications to Security of Goldreich’s PRG\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we establish lower-bounds against memory bounded algorithms for distinguishing between natural pairs of related distributions from samples that arrive in a streaming setting. Our first result applies to the problem of distinguishing the uniform distribution on {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} from uniform distribution on some unknown linear subspace of {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n}. As a specific corollary, we show that any algorithm that distinguishes between uniform distribution on {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} and uniform distribution on an n/2𝑛2n/2-dimensional linear subspace of {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} with non-negligible advantage needs 2Ω​(n)superscript2Ω𝑛2^{\\Omega(n)} samples or Ω​(n2)Ωsuperscript𝑛2\\Omega(n^{2}) memory (tight up to constants in the exponent). Our second result applies to distinguishing outputs of Goldreich’s local pseudorandom generator from the uniform distribution on the output domain. Specifically, Goldreich’s pseudorandom generator 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} fixes a predicate P:{0,1}k→{0,1}:𝑃→superscript01𝑘01P:\\{0,1\\}^{k}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\} and a collection of subsets S1,S2,…,Sm⊆[n]subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2…subscript𝑆𝑚delimited-[]𝑛S_{1},S_{2},\\ldots,S_{m}\\subseteq[n] of size k𝑘k. For any seed x∈{0,1}n𝑥superscript01𝑛x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}, it outputs P​(xS1),P​(xS2),…,P​(xSm)𝑃subscript𝑥subscript𝑆1𝑃subscript𝑥subscript𝑆2…𝑃subscript𝑥subscript𝑆𝑚P(x_{S_{1}}),P(x_{S_{2}}),\\ldots,P(x_{S_{m}}) where xSisubscript𝑥subscript𝑆𝑖x_{S_{i}} is the projection of x𝑥x to the coordinates in Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i}. We prove that whenever P𝑃P is t𝑡t-resilient (all non-zero Fourier coefficients of (−1)Psuperscript1𝑃(-1)^{P} are of degree t𝑡t or higher), then no algorithm, with <nεabsentsuperscript𝑛𝜀<n^{\\varepsilon} memory, can distinguish the output of 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} from the uniform distribution on {0,1}msuperscript01𝑚\\{0,1\\}^{m} with a large inverse polynomial advantage, for stretch m⩽(nt)(1−ε)36⋅t𝑚superscript𝑛𝑡⋅1𝜀36𝑡m\\leqslant\\left(\\frac{n}{t}\\right)^{\\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)}{36}\\cdot t} (barring some restrictions on k𝑘k). The lower bound holds in the streaming model where at each time step i𝑖i, Si⊆[n]subscript𝑆𝑖delimited-[]𝑛S_{i}\\subseteq[n] is a randomly chosen (ordered) subset of size k𝑘k and the distinguisher sees either P​(xSi)𝑃subscript𝑥subscript𝑆𝑖P(x_{S_{i}}) or a uniformly random bit along with Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i}. An important implication of our second result is the security of Goldreich’s generator with super linear stretch (in the streaming model), against memory-bounded adversaries, whenever the predicate P𝑃P satisfies the necessary condition of t-resiliency identified in various prior works. Our proof builds on the recently developed machinery for proving time-space trade-offs (Raz 2016 and follow-ups). Our key technical contribution is to adapt this machinery to work for distinguishing problems in contrast to prior works on similar results for search/learning problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
