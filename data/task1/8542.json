      "content": "Paper Title: Granular-ball computing: an efficient, robust, and interpretable adaptive multi-granularity representation and computation method\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Human cognition operates on a ‚ÄúGlobal-first‚Äù cognitive mechanism, prioritizing information processing based on coarse granularity details. This mechanism inherently possesses an adaptive multi-granularity description capacity, resulting in computational traits such as efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. While many existing artificial intelligence (AI) learning techniques exhibit some multi-granularity attributes, they often fall short of aligning with the ‚ÄúGlobal-first‚Äù cognitive principle. For example, classifiers traditionally rely on the finest granularity of \"point\" inputs; most clustering algorithms designed for non-convex data necessitate calculating the mutual relationships between every pair of points at the finest granularity. They then compute adjacency matrices (like in spectral clustering) based on these relationships, or search for single-granularity ‚Äúkùëòk‚Äù nearest neighbors to ascertain density (as seen in methods like density peak and DBSCAN). Existing neural networks for image recognition primarily scrutinize inputs at the pixel point level. The analysis pattern reliance on the finest granularity and single-granularity makes most existing computational methods less efficient, robust, and interpretable, which is an important reason for the current lack of interpretability in neural networks. Multi-granularity granular-ball computing is an important model method developed in the field of granular computing in recent years. It employs granular-balls of varying sizes to adaptively represent and envelop the sample space, facilitating learning based on these granular-balls. Given that the number of coarse granularity ‚Äúgranular-balls‚Äù is fewer than sample points, granular-ball computing proves more efficient. Moreover, the inherent coarse granularity nature of granular-balls reduces susceptibility to fine granularity sample disturbances, enhancing robustness. Furthermore, the multi-granularity construct of granular-balls generates topological structures and coarse granularity descriptions, naturally augmenting interpretability. Granular-ball computing has successfully ventured into diverse AI domains, fostering the development of innovative theoretical methods, including granular-ball classifiers, clustering techniques, neural networks, rough sets, and evolutionary computing. This has notably ameliorated the efficiency, noise robustness, and interpretability of traditional methods. Overall, granular-ball computing is a rare and innovative theoretical approach in AI that can adaptively and simultaneously enhance efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. It has good innovation, practicality, and development potential. This article endeavors to offer a comprehensive overview of these techniques, shedding light on the predominant challenges confronting granular-ball computing. It delves into the main application landscapes for granular-ball computing, aiming to equip future researchers with references and insights to refine and expand this promising theory.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
