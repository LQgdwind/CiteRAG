Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Principled Approach to Design Using High Fidelity Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A high fidelity fluid-structure interaction simulation may require many days to run, on hundreds of cores. This poses a serious burden, both in terms of time and economic considerations, when repetitions of such simulations may be required (e.g. for the purpose of design optimization). In this paper we present strategies based on (constrained) Bayesian optimization (BO) to alleviate this burden. BO is a numerical optimization technique based on Gaussian processes (GP) that is able to efficiently (with minimal calls to the expensive FSI models) converge towards some globally optimal design, as gauged using a black box objective function. In this study we present a principled design evolution that moves from FSI model verification, through a series of Bridge Simulations (bringing the verification case incrementally closer to the application), in order that we may identify material properties for an underwater, unmanned, autonomous vehicle (UUAV) sail plane. We are able to achieve fast convergence towards an optimal design, using a small number of FSI simulations (a dozen at most), even when selecting over several design parameters, and while respecting optimization constraints.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
