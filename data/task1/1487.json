Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reduction of Monetary Cost in Cloud Storage System by Using Extended Strict Timed Causal Consistency\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cloud storage systems have been introduced to provide a scalable, secure, reliable, and highly available data storage environment for the organizations and end-users. Therefore, the service provider should grow in a geographical extent. Consequently, extensive storage service provision requires a replication mechanism. Replication imposes many costs on the cloud storage, including the synchronization, communications, storage, etc., costs among the replicas. Moreover, the synchronization process among replicas is a major challenge in cloud storage. Therefore, consistency can be defined as the coordination among the replicas. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Strict Timed Causal Consistency (STCC) by adding the considerations for the monetary costs and the quantity of violations in the cloud storage systems and call it the Extended Strict Timed Causal Consistency (X-STCC). Our proposed supports monotonic read, read your write, monotonic write, and write follow read models by taking into account the causal relations between users’ operations, at the client-side. Besides, it supports timed causal at the server-side. We employed the Cassandra cloud database that supports various consistencies such as ALL, ONE, Quorum, etc. Our method performs better in reducing staleness rate, the severity of violations, and monetary cost in comparison with ALL, ONE, Quorum, and Causal.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
