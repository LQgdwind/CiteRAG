Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Causal Abstractions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The abilities of humans to understand the world in terms of cause and effect relationships, as well as to compress information into abstract concepts, are two hallmark features of human intelligence. These two topics have been studied in tandem in the literature under the rubric of causal abstractions theory. In practice, it remains an open problem how to best leverage abstraction theory in real-world causal inference tasks, where the true mechanisms are unknown and only limited data is available. In this paper, we develop a new family of causal abstractions by clustering variables and their domains. This approach refines and generalizes previous notions of abstractions to better accommodate individual causal distributions that are spawned by Pearl’s causal hierarchy. We show that such abstractions are learnable in practical settings through Neural Causal Models (Xia et al. 2021), enabling the use of the deep learning toolkit to solve various challenging causal inference tasks – identification, estimation, sampling – at different levels of granularity. Finally, we integrate these results with representation learning to create more flexible abstractions, moving these results closer to practical applications. Our experiments support the theory and illustrate how to scale causal inferences to high-dimensional settings involving image data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
