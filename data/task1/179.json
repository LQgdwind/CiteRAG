Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sensory Commutativity of Action Sequences for Embodied Agents: Theory and Practice\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Perception of artificial agents is one the grand challenges of AI research. Deep Learning and data-driven approaches are successful on constrained problems where perception can be learned using supervision, but do not scale to open-worlds. In such case, for autonomous embodied agents with first-person sensors, perception can be learned end-to-end to solve particular tasks. However, literature shows that perception is not a purely passive compression mechanism, and that actions play an important role in the formulation of abstract representations. We propose to study perception for these embodied agents, under the mathematical formalism of group theory in order to make the link between perception and action. In particular, we consider the commutative properties of continuous action sequences with respect to sensory information perceived by such an embodied agent. We introduce the Sensory Commutativity Probability (SCP) criterion which measures how much an agent’s degree of freedom affects the environment in embodied scenarios. We show how to compute this criterion in different environments, including realistic robotic setups. We empirically illustrate how SCP and the commutative properties of action sequences can be used to learn about objects in the environment and improve sample-efficiency in Reinforcement Learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
