Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Data Expansion using Back Translation and Paraphrasing for Hate Speech Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With proliferation of user generated contents in social media platforms, establishing mechanisms to automatically identify toxic and abusive content becomes a prime concern for regulators, researchers, and society. Keeping the balance between freedom of speech and respecting each other dignity is a major concern of social media platform regulators. Although, automatic detection of offensive content using deep learning approaches seems to provide encouraging results, training deep learning-based models requires large amounts of high-quality labeled data, which is often missing. In this regard, we present in this paper a new deep learning-based method that fuses a Back Translation method, and a Paraphrasing technique for data augmentation. Our pipeline investigates different word-embedding-based architectures for classification of hate speech. The back translation technique relies on an encoder-decoder architecture pre-trained on a large corpus and mostly used for machine translation. In addition, paraphrasing exploits the transformer model and the mixture of experts to generate diverse paraphrases. Finally, LSTM, and CNN are compared to seek enhanced classification results. We evaluate our proposal on five publicly available datasets; namely, AskFm corpus, Formspring dataset, Warner and Waseem dataset, Olid, and Wikipedia toxic comments dataset. The performance of the proposal together with comparison to some related state-of-art results demonstrate the effectiveness and soundness of our proposal.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
