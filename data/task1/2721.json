This research was supported in part by NSF under Grant CCF-2005323.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given a set of pairwise disjoint polygonal obstacles in the plane, finding an obstacle-avoiding Euclidean shortest path between two points is a classical problem in computational geometry and has been studied extensively. Previously, Hershberger and Suri [SIAM J. Comput. 1999] gave an algorithm of O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time and O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) space, where n𝑛n is the total number of vertices of all obstacles. Recently, by modifying Hershberger and Suri’s algorithm, Wang [SODA 2021] reduced the space to O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) while the runtime of the algorithm is still O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n). In this paper, we present a new algorithm of O​(n+h​log⁡h)𝑂𝑛ℎℎO(n+h\\log h) time and O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) space, provided that a triangulation of the free space is given, where hℎh is the number of obstacles. The algorithm, which improves the previous work when h=o​(n)ℎ𝑜𝑛h=o(n), is optimal in both time and space as Ω​(n+h​log⁡h)Ω𝑛ℎℎ\\Omega(n+h\\log h) is a lower bound on the runtime. Our algorithm builds a shortest path map for a source point s𝑠s, so that given any query point t𝑡t, the shortest path length from s𝑠s to t𝑡t can be computed in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time and a shortest s𝑠s-t𝑡t path can be produced in additional time linear in the number of edges of the path.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
