Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: ConDA: Contrastive Domain Adaptation for AI-generated Text Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for generating text in a variety of use cases, including journalistic news articles. Given the potential malicious nature in which these LLMs can be used to generate disinformation at scale, it is important to build effective detectors for such AI-generated text. Given the surge in development of new LLMs, acquiring labeled training data for supervised detectors is a bottleneck. However, there might be plenty of unlabeled text data available, without information on which generator it came from. In this work we tackle this data problem, in detecting AI-generated news text, and frame the problem as an unsupervised domain adaptation task. Here the domains are the different text generators, i.e. LLMs, and we assume we have access to only the labeled source data and unlabeled target data. We develop a Contrastive Domain Adaptation framework, called ConDA, that blends standard domain adaptation techniques with the representation power of contrastive learning to learn domain invariant representations that are effective for the final unsupervised detection task. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, resulting in average performance gains of 31.7%percent31.731.7\\% from the best performing baselines, and within 0.8%percent0.80.8\\% margin of a fully supervised detector. All our code and data is available here.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
