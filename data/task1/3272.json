Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-based Review Generation by Coherence Enhanced Text Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. As a natural language generation task, it is challenging to generate informative and coherent review text. In order to enhance the informativeness of the generated text, existing solutions typically learn to copy entities or triples from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, they lack overall consideration to select and arrange the incorporated knowledge, which tends to cause text incoherence. To address the above issue, we focus on improving entity-centric coherence of the generated reviews by leveraging the semantic structure of KGs. In this paper, we propose a novel Coherence Enhanced Text Planning model (CETP) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve both global and local coherence for review generation. The proposed model learns a two-level text plan for generating a document: (1) the document plan is modeled as a sequence of sentence plans in order, and (2) the sentence plan is modeled as an entity-based subgraph from KG. Local coherence can be naturally enforced by KG subgraphs through intra-sentence correlations between entities. For global coherence, we design a hierarchical self-attentive architecture with both subgraph- and node-level attention to enhance the correlations between subgraphs. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a KG-based text planning model to enhance text coherence for review generation. Extensive experiments on three datasets confirm the effectiveness of our model on improving the content coherence of generated texts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
