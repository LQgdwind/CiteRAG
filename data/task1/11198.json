      "content": "Paper Title: Internet of Paint (IoP): Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for Terahertz Electromagnetic Nanonetworks Embedded in Paint\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work opens a new chapter in the 100,000100000100,000 year-old concept of paint, by leveraging innovations in nano-technology in the sub-THz frequency range. More specifically, the groundbreaking concept of Internet of Paint (IoP) is introduced along with a comprehensive channel model and a capacity analysis for nano-scale radios embedded in paint and communicating through paint. Nano-network devices, integrated within a paint medium, communicate via a multipath strategy, encompassing direct waves, reflections from interfaces, and lateral wave propagation. The evaluation incorporates three distinct paint types to assess path losses, received powers, and channel capacity. Analysis of path loss indicates a slight non-linear increase with both frequency and Line of Sight (LoS) distance between transceivers. Notably, paints with high refractive indexes result in the highest path loss. Moreover, burying transceivers at similar depths near the Air-Paint interface showcases promising performance of lateral waves with increasing LoS distance. Increasing paint layer depth leads to amplified attenuation, while total received power exhibits promising results when in close proximity to the Air-Paint interface but steeply declines with burial depth. Additionally, a substantial reduction in channel capacity is observed with LoS distance and burial depth, so transceivers need to be close together and in proximity of the A-P interface to communicate effectively. Comparing paint and air mediums, IoP demonstrates approximately two orders of magnitude reduction in channel capacity compared to air-based communication channels. This paper provides valuable insights into the potential of IoP communication within paint mediums and offers a foundation for further advancements in this emerging field.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
