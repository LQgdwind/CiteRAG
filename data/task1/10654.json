      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Lower Bounds for Approximating Parameterized Nearest Codeword and Related Problems under ETH\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper we present a new gap-creating randomized self-reduction for parameterized Maximum Likelihood Decoding problem over 𝔽psubscript𝔽𝑝\\mathbb{F}_{p} (k𝑘k-MLDp). The reduction takes a k𝑘k-MLDp instance with k⋅n⋅𝑘𝑛k\\cdot n vectors as input, runs in time f​(k)​nO​(1)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑂1f(k)n^{O(1)} for some computable function f𝑓f, outputs a (3/2−ε)32𝜀(3/2-\\varepsilon)-Gap-k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime}-MLDp instance for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, where k′=O​(k2​log⁡k)superscript𝑘′𝑂superscript𝑘2𝑘k^{\\prime}=O(k^{2}\\log k). Using this reduction, we show that assuming the randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), no algorithms can approximate k𝑘k-MLDp (and therefore its dual problem k𝑘k-NCPp) within factor (3/2−ε)32𝜀(3/2-\\varepsilon) in f​(k)⋅no​(k/log⁡k)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘𝑘f(k)\\cdot n^{o(\\sqrt{k/\\log k})} time for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. We then use reduction by Bhattacharyya, Ghoshal, Karthik and Manurangsi (ICALP 2018) to amplify the (3/2−ε)32𝜀(3/2-\\varepsilon)-gap to any constant. As a result, we show that assuming ETH, no algorithms can approximate k𝑘k-NCPp and k𝑘k-MDPp within γ𝛾\\gamma-factor in f​(k)​no​(kεγ)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑜superscript𝑘subscript𝜀𝛾f(k)n^{o(k^{\\varepsilon_{\\gamma}})} time for some constant εγ>0subscript𝜀𝛾0\\varepsilon_{\\gamma}>0. Combining with the gap-preserving reduction by Bennett, Cheraghchi, Guruswami and Ribeiro (STOC 2023), we also obtain similar lower bounds for k𝑘k-MDPp, k𝑘k-CVPp and k𝑘k-SVPp. These results improve upon the previous f​(k)​nΩ​(𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​log⁡k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛Ω𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑘f(k)n^{\\Omega(\\mathsf{poly}\\log k)} lower bounds for these problems under ETH using reductions by Bhattacharyya et al.
