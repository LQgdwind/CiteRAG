Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Analyzing Commonsense Emergence in Few-shot Knowledge Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, commonsense knowledge models — pretrained language models (LM) fine-tuned on knowledge graph (KG) tuples — showed that considerable amounts of commonsense knowledge can be encoded in the parameters of large language models Bosselut et al. (2019). However, as parallel studies show that LMs are poor hypothesizers of declarative commonsense relationships Petroni et al. (2019) on their own, it remains unclear whether this knowledge is learned during pretraining or from fine-tuning on KG examples. To investigate this question, we train commonsense knowledge models in few-shot settings to study the emergence of their commonsense representation abilities. Our results show that commonsense knowledge models can rapidly adapt from limited examples, indicating that KG fine-tuning serves to learn an interface to encoded knowledge learned during pretraining. Importantly, our analysis of absolute, angular, and distributional parameter changes during few-shot fine-tuning provides novel insights into how this interface is learned.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
