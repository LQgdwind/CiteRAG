Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Metric Loss for Multimodal Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multimodal learning often outperforms its unimodal counterparts by exploiting unimodal contributions and cross-modal interactions. However, focusing only on integrating multimodal features into a unified comprehensive representation overlooks the unimodal characteristics. In real data, the contributions of modalities can vary from instance to instance, and they often reinforce or conflict with each other. In this study, we introduce a novel MultiModal loss paradigm for multimodal learning, which subgroups instances according to their unimodal contributions. MultiModal loss can prevent inefficient learning caused by overfitting and efficiently optimize multimodal models. On synthetic data, MultiModal loss demonstrates improved classification performance by subgrouping difficult instances within certain modalities. On four real multimodal datasets, our loss is empirically shown to improve the performance of recent models. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our loss. Additionally, we show that our loss generates a reliable prediction score for each modality, which is essential for subgrouping. Our MultiModal loss is a novel loss function to subgroup instances according to the contribution of modalities in multimodal learning and is applicable to a variety of multimodal models with unimodal decisions. Our code is available at https://github.com/SehwanMoon/MultiModalLoss.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
