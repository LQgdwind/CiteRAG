Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hard Negative Samples Emphasis Tracker without Anchors\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Trackers based on Siamese network have shown tremendous success, because of their balance between accuracy and speed. Nevertheless, with tracking scenarios becoming more and more sophisticated, most existing Siamese-based approaches ignore the addressing of the problem that distinguishes the tracking target from hard negative samples in the tracking phase. The features learned by these networks lack of discrimination, which significantly weakens the robustness of Siamese-based trackers and leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient hard negative samples emphasis method, which constrains Siamese network to learn features that are aware of hard negative samples and enhance the discrimination of embedding features. Through a distance constraint, we force to shorten the distance between exemplar vector and positive vectors, meanwhile, enlarge the distance between exemplar vector and hard negative vectors. Furthermore, we explore a novel anchor-free tracking framework in a per-pixel prediction fashion, which can significantly reduce the number of hyper-parameters and simplify the tracking process by taking full advantage of the representation of convolutional neural network. Extensive experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can perform favorable results against state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
