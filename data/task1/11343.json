Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: AIM: Let Any Multimodal Large Language Models Embrace Efficient In-Context Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In-context learning (ICL) advances Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibiting emergent ability on downstream tasks without updating billions of parameters. However, in the area of multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), two problems hinder the application of multimodal ICL: (1) Most primary MLLMs are only trained on single-image datasets, making them unable to read extra multimodal demonstrations. (2) With the demonstrations increasing, thousands of visual tokens highly challenge hardware and degrade ICL performance. During preliminary explorations, we discovered that the inner LLM focuses more on the linguistic modality within multimodal demonstrations during generation. Therefore, we propose a general and light-weighted framework AIM to tackle the mentioned problems through Aggregating Image information of Multimodal demonstrations to the latent space of the corresponding textual labels. In image information aggregation, AIM independently generates fused virtual tokens to substitute each demonstration whose length is the same length as its texts. Apart from significantly shortening length, fused virtual tokens modify the original multi-image prompts approximately to ones containing a single query image, effectively upgrading MLLMs pre-trained on single-image datasets to perform multimodal ICL. We build AIM upon QWen-VL and LLaVA-Next, and we comprehensively evaluate AIM on image caption, VQA, and hateful speech detection. Outstanding results reveal that AIM provides an efficient and effective solution in upgrading MLLMs for multimodal ICL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
