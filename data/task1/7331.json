      "content": "Paper Title: A Local-to-Global Theorem for Congested Shortest Paths\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Amiri and Wargalla proved the following local-to-global theorem about shortest paths in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs): if G𝐺G is a weighted DAG with the property that for each subset S𝑆S of 3 nodes there is a shortest path containing every node in S𝑆S, then there exists a pair (s,t)𝑠𝑡(s,t) of nodes such that there is a shortest s​t𝑠𝑡st-path containing every node in G𝐺G. We extend this theorem to general graphs. For undirected graphs, we prove that the same theorem holds (up to a difference in the constant 3). For directed graphs, we provide a counterexample to the theorem (for any constant). However, we prove a roundtrip analogue of the theorem which guarantees there exists a pair (s,t)𝑠𝑡(s,t) of nodes such that every node in G𝐺G is contained in the union of a shortest s​t𝑠𝑡st-path and a shortest t​s𝑡𝑠ts-path. The original local-to-global theorem for DAGs has an application to the k𝑘k-Shortest Paths with Congestion c𝑐c ((k,c𝑘𝑐k,c)-SPC) problem. In this problem, we are given a weighted graph G𝐺G, together with k𝑘k node pairs (s1,t1),…,(sk,tk)subscript𝑠1subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑠𝑘subscript𝑡𝑘(s_{1},t_{1}),\\dots,(s_{k},t_{k}), and a positive integer c≤k𝑐𝑘c\\leq k, and tasked with finding a collection of paths P1,…,Pksubscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑘P_{1},\\dots,P_{k} such that each Pisubscript𝑃𝑖P_{i} is a shortest path from sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} to tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i}, and every node in the graph is on at most c𝑐c paths Pisubscript𝑃𝑖P_{i}, or reporting that no such collection of paths exists. When c=k𝑐𝑘c=k, there are no congestion constraints, and the problem can be solved easily by running a shortest path algorithm for each pair (si,ti)subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖(s_{i},t_{i}) independently. At the other extreme, when c=1𝑐1c=1, the (k,c)𝑘𝑐(k,c)-SPC problem is equivalent to the k𝑘k-Disjoint Shortest Paths (k𝑘k-DSP) problem, where the collection of shortest paths must be node-disjoint. For fixed k𝑘k, k𝑘k-DSP is polynomial-time solvable on DAGs and undirected graphs. Amiri and Wargalla interpolated between these two extreme values of c𝑐c, to obtain an algorithm for (k,c)𝑘𝑐(k,c)-SPC on DAGs that runs in polynomial time when k−c𝑘𝑐k-c is constant. In the same way, we prove that (k,c)𝑘𝑐(k,c)-SPC can be solved in polynomial time on undirected graphs whenever k−c𝑘𝑐k-c is constant. For directed graphs, because of our counterexample to the original theorem statement, our roundtrip local-to-global result does not imply such an algorithm (k,c)𝑘𝑐(k,c)-SPC. Even without an algorithmic application, our proof for directed graphs may be of broader interest because it characterizes intriguing structural properties of shortest paths in directed graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
