Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: \\TITLE\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a new approach for data-driven automated discovery of material laws, which we call EUCLID (Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery), and we apply it here to the discovery of plasticity models, including arbitrarily shaped yield surfaces and isotropic and/or kinematic hardening laws. The approach is unsupervised, i.e., it requires no stress data but only full-field displacement and global force data; it delivers interpretable models, i.e., models that are embodied by parsimonious mathematical expressions discovered through sparse regression of a potentially large catalogue of candidate functions; it is one-shot, i.e., discovery only needs one experiment. The material model library is constructed by expanding the yield function with a Fourier series, whereas isotropic and kinematic hardening are introduced by assuming a yield function dependency on internal history variables that evolve with the plastic deformation. For selecting the most relevant Fourier modes and identifying the hardening behavior, EUCLID employs physics knowledge, i.e., the optimization problem that governs the discovery enforces the equilibrium constraints in the bulk and at the loaded boundary of the domain. Sparsity promoting regularization is deployed to generate a set of solutions out of which a solution with low cost and high parsimony is automatically selected. Through virtual experiments, we demonstrate the ability of EUCLID to accurately discover several plastic yield surfaces and hardening mechanisms of different complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
