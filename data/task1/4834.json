      "content": "Paper Title: Handling Inter-class and Intra-class Imbalance in Class-imbalanced Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Class-imbalance is a common problem in machine learning practice. Typical Imbalanced Learning (IL) methods balance the data via intuitive class-wise resampling or reweighting. However, previous studies suggest that beyond class-imbalance, intrinsic data difficulty factors like overlapping, noise, and small disjuncts also play critical roles. To handle them, many solutions have been proposed (e.g., noise removal, borderline sampling, hard example mining) but are still confined to a specific factor and cannot generalize to broader scenarios, which raises an interesting question: how to handle both the class-agnostic difficulties and the class-imbalance in a unified way? To answer this, we consider both class-imbalance and its orthogonal: intra-class imbalance, i.e., the imbalanced distribution over easy and hard samples. Such distribution naturally reflects the complex influence of class-agnostic intrinsic data difficulties thus providing a new unified view for identifying and handling these factors during learning. From this perspective, we discuss the pros and cons of existing IL solutions and further propose new balancing techniques for more robust and efficient IL. Finally, we wrap up all solutions into a generic ensemble IL framework, namely DuBE (Duple-Balanced Ensemble). It features explicit and efficient inter-&intra-class balancing as well as easy extension with standardized APIs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DuBE. Code, examples, and documentation are available at Github111https://github.com/AnonAuthorAI/duplebalance and ReadtheDocs222https://duplebalance.readthedocs.io.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
