Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Non-Contrastive Learning-based Behavioural Biometrics for Smart IoT Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Behaviour biometrics are being explored as a viable alternative to overcome the limitations of traditional authentication methods such as passwords and static biometrics. Also, they are being considered as a viable authentication method for IoT devices such as smart headsets with AR/VR capabilities, wearables, and erables, that do not have a large form factor or the ability to seamlessly interact with the user. Recent behavioural biometric solutions use deep learning models that require large amounts of annotated training data. Collecting such volumes of behaviour biometrics data raises privacy and usability concerns. To this end, we propose using SimSiam-based non-contrastive self-supervised learning to improve the label efficiency of behavioural biometric systems. The key idea is to use large volumes of unlabelled (and anonymised) data to build good feature extractors that can be subsequently used in supervised settings. Using two EEG datasets, we show that at lower amounts of labelled data, non-contrastive learning performs 4%–11% more than conventional methods such as supervised learning and data augmentation. We also show that, in general, self-supervised learning methods perform better than other baselines. Finally, through careful experimentation, we show various modifications that can be incorporated into the non-contrastive learning process to archive high performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
