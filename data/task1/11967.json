      "content": "Paper Title: Rescheduling after vehicle failures in the multi-depot rural postman problem with rechargeable and reusable vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a centralized auction algorithm to solve the Multi-Depot Rural Postman Problem with Rechargeable and Reusable Vehicles (MD-RPP-RRV), focusing on rescheduling arc routing after vehicle failures. The problem involves finding a heuristically obtained best feasible routes for multiple rechargeable and reusable vehicles with capacity constraints capable of performing multiple trips from multiple depots, with the possibility of vehicle failures. Our algorithm auctions the failed trips to active (non-failed) vehicles through local auctioning, modifying initial routes to handle dynamic vehicle failures efficiently. When a failure occurs, the algorithm searches for the best active vehicle to perform the failed trip and inserts the trip into that vehicle’s route, which avoids a complete rescheduling and reduces the computational effort. We compare the algorithm’s solutions against offline optimal solutions obtained from solving a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation using the Gurobi solver; this formulation assumes that perfect information about the vehicle failures and failure times are given. We derived a set of 257 failure scenarios from arc routing instances in the literature and used them to perform a competitive analysis. For each scenario we used a simulated annealing algorithm to generate an initial set of routes and then used the centralized auction algorithm to reschedule after each vehicle failure. The results demonstrate that the centralized auction algorithm produces solutions that are, in some cases, near-optimal; moreover the execution time for the proposed approach is much more consistent and is, for some instances, orders of magnitude less than the execution time of the Gurobi solver. The theoretical analysis provides an upper bound for the competitive ratio and computational complexity of our algorithm, offering a formal performance guarantee in dynamic failure scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
