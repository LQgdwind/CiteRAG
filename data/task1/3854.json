Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: DualVGR: A Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit for Video Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Video question answering is a challenging task, which requires agents to be able to understand rich video contents and perform spatial-temporal reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods fail to perform multi-step reasoning well, neglecting two properties of VideoQA: (1) Even for the same video, different questions may require different amount of video clips or objects to infer the answer with relational reasoning; (2) During reasoning, appearance and motion features have complicated interdependence which are correlated and complementary to each other. Based on these observations, we propose a Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit (DualVGR) which reasons over videos in an end-to-end fashion. The first contribution of our DualVGR is the design of an explainable Query Punishment Module, which can filter out irrelevant visual features through mutiple cycles of reasoning. The second contribution is the proposed Video-based Multi-view Graph Attention Network, which captures the relations between appearance and motion features. Our DualVGR network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark MSVD-QA and SVQA datasets, and demonstrates competitive results on benchmark MSRVTT-QA datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/MM-IR/DualVGR-VideoQA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
