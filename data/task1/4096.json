Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Understanding Theoretical Advantages of Complex-Reaction Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Complex-valued neural networks have attracted increasing attention in recent years, while it remains open on the advantages of complex-valued neural networks in comparison with real-valued networks. This work takes one step on this direction by introducing the complex-reaction network with fully-connected feed-forward architecture. We prove the universal approximation property for complex-reaction networks, and show that a class of radial functions can be approximated by a complex-reaction network using the polynomial number of parameters, whereas real-valued networks need at least exponential parameters to reach the same approximation level. For empirical risk minimization, our theoretical result shows that the critical point set of complex-reaction networks is a proper subset of that of real-valued networks, which may show some insights on finding the optimal solutions more easily for complex-reaction networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
