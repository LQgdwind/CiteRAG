Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: LocalDrop: A Hybrid Regularization for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In neural networks, developing regularization algorithms to settle overfitting is one of the major study areas. We propose a new approach for the regularization of neural networks by the local Rademacher complexity called LocalDrop. A new regularization function for both fully-connected networks (FCNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including drop rates and weight matrices, has been developed based on the proposed upper bound of the local Rademacher complexity by the strict mathematical deduction. The analyses of dropout in FCNs and DropBlock in CNNs with keep rate matrices in different layers are also included in the complexity analyses. With the new regularization function, we establish a two-stage procedure to obtain the optimal keep rate matrix and weight matrix to realize the whole training model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of LocalDrop in different models by comparing it with several algorithms and the effects of different hyperparameters on the final performances.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
