Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Membership Inference Attacks on Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Membership inference attacks (MIAs) infer whether a specific data record is used for target model training. MIAs have provoked many discussions in the information security community since they give rise to severe data privacy issues, especially for private and sensitive datasets. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which describe domain-specific subjects and relationships among them, are valuable and sensitive, such as medical KGs constructed from electronic health records. However, the privacy threat to knowledge graphs is critical but rarely explored. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical evaluation of privacy threats to knowledge graphs triggered by knowledge graph embedding methods (KGEs). We propose three types of membership inference attacks: transfer attacks (TAs), prediction loss-based attacks (PLAs), and prediction correctness-based attacks (PCAs), according to attack difficulty levels. In the experiments, we conduct three inference attacks against four standard KGE methods over three benchmark datasets. In addition, we also propose the attacks against medical KG and financial KG. The results demonstrate that the proposed attack methods can easily explore the privacy leakage of knowledge graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
