Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Aggregate Queries Defined by First-Order Logic with Counting1footnote 11footnote 1This is the extended version of the conference contribution [11].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur√°n (TOCS 2004) for Boolean classification problems, the instances to classify are tuples from a logical structure, and Boolean classifiers are described by parametric models based on logical formulas. This is a specific scenario for supervised passive learning, where classifiers should be learned based on labelled examples. Existing results in this scenario focus on Boolean classification. This paper presents learnability results beyond Boolean classification. We focus on multiclass classification problems where the task is to assign input tuples to arbitrary integers. To represent such integer-valued classifiers, we use aggregate queries specified by an extension of first-order logic with counting terms called FOC1subscriptFOC1\\textup{{FOC}}_{1}. Our main result shows the following: given a database of polylogarithmic degree, within quasi-linear time, we can build an index structure that makes it possible to learn FOC1subscriptFOC1\\textup{{FOC}}_{1}-definable integer-valued classifiers in time polylogarithmic in the size of the database and polynomial in the number of training examples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
