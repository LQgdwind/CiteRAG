Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the Equilibrium Elicitation of Markov Games Through Information Design\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work considers a novel information design problem and studies how the craft of payoff-relevant environmental signals solely can influence the behaviors of intelligent agents. The agents’ strategic interactions are captured by an incomplete-information Markov game, in which each agent first selects one environmental signal from multiple signal sources as additional payoff-relevant information and then takes an action. There is a rational information designer (designer) who possesses one signal source and aims to control the equilibrium behaviors of the agents by designing the information structure of her signals sent to the agents. An obedient principle is established which states that it is without loss of generality to focus on the direct information design when the information design incentivizes each agent to select the signal sent by the designer, such that the design process avoids the predictions of the agents’ strategic selection behaviors. We then introduce the design protocol given a goal of the designer referred to as obedient implementability (OIL) and characterize the OIL in a class of obedient perfect Bayesian Markov Nash equilibria (O-PBME). A new framework for information design is proposed based on an approach of maximizing the optimal slack variables. Finally, we formulate the designer’s goal selection problem and characterize it in terms of information design by establishing a relationship between the O-PBME and the Bayesian Markov correlated equilibria, in which we build upon the revelation principle in classic information design in economics. The proposed approach can be applied to elicit desired behaviors of multi-agent systems in competing as well as cooperating settings and be extended to heterogeneous stochastic games in the complete- and the incomplete-information environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
