      "content": "Paper Title: On the link between generative semi-supervised learning and generative open-set recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This study investigates the relationship between semi-supervised learning (SSL, which is training off partially labelled datasets) and open-set recognition (OSR, which is classification with simultaneous novelty detection) under the context of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Although no previous study has formally linked SSL and OSR, their respective methods share striking similarities. Specifically, SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs require their generators to produce ’bad-looking’ samples which are used to regularise their classifier networks. We hypothesise that the definitions of bad-looking samples in SSL and OSR represents the same concept and realises the same goal. More formally, bad-looking samples lie in the complementary space, which is the area between and around the boundaries of the labelled categories within the classifier’s embedding space. By regularising a classifier with samples in the complementary space, classifiers achieve improved generalisation for SSL and also generalise the open space for OSR. To test this hypothesis, we compare a foundational SSL-GAN with the state-of-the-art OSR-GAN under the same SSL-OSR experimental conditions. Our results find that SSL-GANs achieve near identical results to OSR-GANs, proving the SSL-OSR link. Subsequently, to further this new research path, we compare several SSL-GANs various SSL-OSR setups which this first benchmark results. A combined framework of SSL-OSR certainly improves the practicality and cost-efficiency of classifier training, and so further theoretical and application studies are also discussed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
