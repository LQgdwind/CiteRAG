Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Health Mentioning Classification of Tweets using Contrastive Adversarial Training\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Health mentioning classification (HMC) classifies an input text as health mention or not. Figurative and non-health mention of disease words makes the classification task challenging. Learning the context of the input text is the key to this problem. The idea is to learn word representation by its surrounding words and utilize emojis in the text to help improve the classification results. In this paper, we improve the word representation of the input text using adversarial training that acts as a regularizer during fine-tuning of the model. We generate adversarial examples by perturbing the embeddings of the model and then train the model on a pair of clean and adversarial examples. Additionally, we utilize contrastive loss that pushes a pair of clean and perturbed examples close to each other and other examples away in the representation space. We train and evaluate the method on an extended version of the publicly available PHM2017 dataset. Experiments show an improvement of 1.0%percent1.01.0\\% over BERTLarge baseline and 0.6%percent0.60.6\\% over RoBERTaLarge baseline, whereas 5.8%percent5.85.8\\% over the state-of-the-art in terms of F1 score. Furthermore, we provide a brief analysis of the results by utilizing the power of explainable AI.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
