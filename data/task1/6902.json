Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Phy-Taylor: Physics-Model-Based Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Purely data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to physical engineering systems can infer relations that violate physics laws, thus leading to unexpected consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-model-based DNN framework, called Phy-Taylor, that accelerates learning compliant representations with physical knowledge. The Phy-Taylor framework makes two key contributions; it introduces a new architectural physics-compatible neural network (PhN), and features a novel compliance mechanism, we call Physics-guided Neural Network Editing. The PhN aims to directly capture nonlinearities inspired by physical quantities, such as kinetic energy, potential energy, electrical power, and aerodynamic drag force. To do so, the PhN augments neural network layers with two key components: (i) monomials of Taylor series expansion of nonlinear functions capturing physical knowledge, and (ii) a suppressor for mitigating the influence of noise. The neural-network editing mechanism further modifies network links and activation functions consistently with physical knowledge. As an extension, we also propose a self-correcting Phy-Taylor framework that introduces two additional capabilities: (i) physics-model-based safety relationship learning, and (ii) automatic output correction when violations of safety occur. Through experiments, we show that (by expressing hard-to-learn nonlinearities directly and by constraining dependencies) Phy-Taylor features considerably fewer parameters, and a remarkably accelerated training process, while offering enhanced model robustness and accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
