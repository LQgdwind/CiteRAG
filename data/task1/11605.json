Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Adaptive Train Scheduling with Curriculum-Driven Continual DQN Expansion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A continual learning agent builds on previous experiences to develop increasingly complex behaviors by adapting to non-stationary and dynamic environments while preserving previously acquired knowledge. However, scaling these systems presents significant challenges, particularly in balancing the preservation of previous policies with the adaptation of new ones to current environments. This balance, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma, is especially pronounced in complex multi-agent domains such as the train scheduling problem, where environmental and agent behaviors are constantly changing, and the search space is vast. In this work, we propose addressing these challenges in the train scheduling problem using curriculum learning. We design a curriculum with adjacent skills that build on each other to improve generalization performance. Introducing a curriculum with distinct tasks introduces non-stationarity, which we address by proposing a new algorithm: Continual Deep Q-Network (DQN) Expansion (CDE). Our approach dynamically generates and adjusts Q-function subspaces to handle environmental changes and task requirements. CDE mitigates catastrophic forgetting through EWC while ensuring high plasticity using adaptive rational activation functions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in learning efficiency and adaptability compared to RL baselines and other adapted methods for continual learning, highlighting the potential of our method in managing the stability-plasticity dilemma in the adaptive train scheduling setting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
