Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Teaching MLP More Graph Information: A Three-stage Multitask Knowledge Distillation Framework.Supported by organization x.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the challenging problem for inference tasks on large-scale graph datasets of Graph Neural Networks: huge time and memory consumption, and try to overcome it by reducing reliance on graph structure. Even though distilling graph knowledge to student MLP is an excellent idea, it faces two major problems of positional information loss and low generalization. To solve the problems, we propose a new three-stage multitask distillation framework. In detail, we use Positional Encoding to capture positional information. Also, we introduce Neural Heat Kernels responsible for graph data processing in GNN and utilize hidden layer outputs matching for better performance of student MLPâ€™s hidden layers. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to include hidden layer distillation for student MLP on graphs and to combine graph Positional Encoding with MLP. We test its performance and robustness with several settings and draw the conclusion that our work can outperform well with good stability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
