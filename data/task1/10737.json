Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Manipulating Hidden-Markov-Model Inferences by Corrupting Batch Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Time-series models typically assume untainted and legitimate streams of data. However, a self-interested adversary may have incentive to corrupt this data, thereby altering a decision makerâ€™s inference. Within the broader field of adversarial machine learning, this research provides a novel, probabilistic perspective toward the manipulation of hidden Markov model inferences via corrupted data. In particular, we provision a suite of corruption problems for filtering, smoothing, and decoding inferences leveraging an adversarial risk analysis approach. Multiple stochastic programming models are set forth that incorporate realistic uncertainties and varied attacker objectives. Three general solution methods are developed by alternatively viewing the problem from frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. The efficacy of each method is illustrated via extensive, empirical testing. The developed methods are characterized by their solution quality and computational effort, resulting in a stratification of techniques across varying problem-instance architectures. This research highlights the weaknesses of hidden Markov models under adversarial activity, thereby motivating the need for robustification techniques to ensure their security.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
