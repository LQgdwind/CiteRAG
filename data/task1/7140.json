Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Entire Space Counterfactual Learning: Tuning, Analytical Properties and Industrial Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As a basic research problem for building effective recommender system, post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimation has long been plagued by data sparsity and sample selection bias issues. To mitigate the data sparsity issue, prevalent methods based on entire space multitask model construct auxiliary learning tasks by harnessing the sequential track of user behaviors, i.e., exposure →→\\rightarrow click →→\\rightarrow conversion. However, they still fall short of the two primary defects: (1) intrinsic estimation bias (IEB), where the CVR estimates are intrinsically greater than the actual values; (2) false independence prior (FIP), where the causation from click to post-click conversion might be overlooked. On this basis, this paper further proposes a model-agnostic method named entire space counterfactual multi-task model (ESCM2) that utilizes a counterfactual risk minimizer to handle both IEB and FIP issues at once. To demonstrate the superiority of ESCM2, this paper explores its parameter tuning in practice, derives its analytic properties, and showcases its effectiveness in industry, where ESCM2 can effectively alleviate the intrinsic IEB and FIP issues and outperform baseline models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
