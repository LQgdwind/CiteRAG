Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: GIST: Distributed Training for Large-Scale Graph Convolutional Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The graph convolutional network (GCN) is a go-to solution for machine learning on graphs, but its training is notoriously difficult to scale both in terms of graph size and the number of model parameters. Although some work has explored training on large-scale graphs (e.g., GraphSAGE, ClusterGCN, etc.), we pioneer efficient training of large-scale GCN models (i.e., ultra-wide, overparameterized models) with the proposal of a novel, distributed training framework. Our proposed training methodology, called GIST, disjointly partitions the parameters of a GCN model into several, smaller sub-GCNs that are trained independently and in parallel. In addition to being compatible with all GCN architectures and existing sampling techniques for efficient GCN training, GIST i)i) improves model performance, ii)ii) scales to training on arbitrarily large graphs, iii)iii) decreases wall-clock training time, and iv)iv) enables the training of markedly overparameterized GCN models. Remarkably, with GIST, we train an astonishgly-wide 32,7683276832,\\!768-dimensional GraphSAGE model, which exceeds the capacity of a single GPU by a factor of 8×8\\times, to SOTA performance on the Amazon2M dataset.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
