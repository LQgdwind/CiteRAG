Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Thermodynamics-informed Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper we present a deep learning method to predict the temporal evolution of dissipative dynamic systems. We propose using both geometric and thermodynamic inductive biases to improve accuracy and generalization of the resulting integration scheme. The first is achieved with Graph Neural Networks, which induces a non-Euclidean geometrical prior with permutation invariant node and edge update functions. The second bias is forced by learning the GENERIC structure of the problem, an extension of the Hamiltonian formalism, to model more general non-conservative dynamics. Several examples are provided in both Eulerian and Lagrangian description in the context of fluid and solid mechanics respectively, achieving relative mean errors of less than 3% in all the tested examples. Two ablation studies are provided based on recent works in both physics-informed and geometric deep learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
