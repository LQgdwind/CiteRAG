Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Model free variable importance for high dimensional data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A model-agnostic variable importance method can be used with arbitrary prediction functions. Here we present some model-free methods that do not require access to the prediction function. This is useful when that function is proprietary and not available, or just extremely expensive. It is also useful when studying residuals from a model. The cohort Shapley (CS) method is model-free but has exponential cost in the dimension of the input space. A supervised on-manifold Shapley method from Frye et al., (2020) is also model free but requires as input a second black box model that has to be trained for the Shapley value problem. We introduce an integrated gradient (IG) version of cohort Shapley, called IGCS, with cost ùí™‚Äã(n‚Äãd)ùí™ùëõùëë\\mathcal{O}(nd). We show that over the vast majority of the relevant unit cube that the IGCS value function is close to a multilinear function for which IGCS matches CS. Another benefit of IGCS is that is allows IG methods to be used with binary predictors. We use some area between curves (ABC) measures to quantify the performance of IGCS. On a problem from high energy physics we verify that IGCS has nearly the same ABCs as CS does. We also use it on a problem from computational chemistry in 1024 variables. We see there that IGCS attains much higher ABCs than we get from Monte Carlo sampling. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/cohortshapley/cohortintgrad.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
