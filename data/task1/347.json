      "content": "Paper Title: Provably Efficient Exploration for Reinforcement Learning Using Unsupervised Learning Correspondence to: Simon S. Du <ssdu@cs.washington.edu>, Lin F. Yang <linyang@ee.ucla.edu>\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivated by the prevailing paradigm of using unsupervised learning for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) problems (Tang et al.,, 2017; Bellemare et al.,, 2016), we investigate when this paradigm is provably efficient. We study episodic Markov decision processes with rich observations generated from a small number of latent states. We present a general algorithmic framework that is built upon two components: an unsupervised learning algorithm and a no-regret tabular RL algorithm. Theoretically, we prove that as long as the unsupervised learning algorithm enjoys a polynomial sample complexity guarantee, we can find a near-optimal policy with sample complexity polynomial in the number of latent states, which is significantly smaller than the number of observations. Empirically, we instantiate our framework on a class of hard exploration problems to demonstrate the practicality of our theory.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
