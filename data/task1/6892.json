Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: How to Sample From The Limiting Distribution of a Continuous-Time Quantum Walk\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-projectors, using which we can sample from limiting distributions of continuous-time quantum walks. The standard algorithm for sampling from a distribution that is close to the limiting distribution of a given quantum walk is to run the quantum walk for a time chosen uniformly at random from a large interval, and measure the resulting quantum state. This approach usually results in an exponential running time. We show that, using ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-projectors, we can sample exactly from the limiting distribution. In the black-box setting, where we only have query access to the adjacency matrix of the graph, our sampling algorithm runs in time proportional to Œî‚àí1superscriptŒî1\\Delta^{-1}, where ŒîŒî\\Delta is the minimum spacing between the distinct eigenvalues of the graph. In the non-black-box setting, we give examples of graphs for which our algorithm runs exponentially faster than the standard sampling algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
