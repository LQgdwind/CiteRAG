Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unifying the Three Algebraic Approaches to the CSP via Minimal Taylor Algebras\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper focuses on the algebraic theory underlying the study of the complexity and the algorithms for the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). We unify, simplify, and extend parts of the three approaches that have been developed to study the CSP over finite templates – absorption theory that was used to characterize CSPs solvable by local consistency methods (JACM’14), and Bulatov’s and Zhuk’s theories that were used for two independent proofs of the CSP Dichotomy Theorem (FOCS’17, JACM’20). As the first contribution we present an elementary theorem about primitive positive definability and use it to obtain the starting points of Bulatov’s and Zhuk’s proofs as corollaries. As the second contribution we propose and initiate a systematic study of minimal Taylor algebras. This class of algebras is broad enough that it suffices to verify the CSP Dichotomy Theorem on this class only, but still is unusually well behaved. In particular, many concepts from the three approaches coincide in this class, which is in striking contrast with the general setting. We believe that the theory initiated in this paper will eventually result in a simple and more natural proof of the Dichotomy Theorem that employs a simpler and more efficient algorithm, and will help in attacking complexity questions in other CSP-related problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
