Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Nearest Neighborhood-Based Deep Clustering for Source Data-absent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the classic setting of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), the labeled source data are available in the training phase. However, in many real-world scenarios, owing to some reasons such as privacy protection and information security, the source data is inaccessible, and only a model trained on the source domain is available. This paper proposes a novel deep clustering method for this challenging task. Aiming at the dynamical clustering at feature-level, we introduce extra constraints hidden in the geometric structure between data to assist the process. Concretely, we propose a geometry-based constraint, named semantic consistency on the nearest neighborhood (SCNNH), and use it to encourage robust clustering. To reach this goal, we construct the nearest neighborhood for every target data and take it as the fundamental clustering unit by building our objective on the geometry. Also, we develop a more SCNNH-compliant structure with an additional semantic credibility constraint, named semantic hyper-nearest neighborhood (SHNNH). After that, we extend our method to this new geometry. Extensive experiments on three challenging UDA datasets indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. The proposed method has significant improvement on all datasets (as we adopt SHNNH, the average accuracy increases by over 3.0% on the large-scaled dataset). Code is available at https://github.com/tntek/N2DCX.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
