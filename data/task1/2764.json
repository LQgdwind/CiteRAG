Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distilling Causal Effect of Data in Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a causal framework to explain the catastrophic forgetting in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) and then derive a novel distillation method that is orthogonal to the existing anti-forgetting techniques, such as data replay and feature/label distillation. We first 1) place CIL into the framework, 2) answer why the forgetting happens: the causal effect of the old data is lost in new training, and then 3) explain how the existing techniques mitigate it: they bring the causal effect back. Based on the framework, we find that although the feature/label distillation is storage-efficient, its causal effect is not coherent with the end-to-end feature learning merit, which is however preserved by data replay. To this end, we propose to distill the Colliding Effect between the old and the new data, which is fundamentally equivalent to the causal effect of data replay, but without any cost of replay storage. Thanks to the causal effect analysis, we can further capture the Incremental Momentum Effect of the data stream, removing which can help to retain the old effect overwhelmed by the new data effect, and thus alleviate the forgetting of the old class in testing. Extensive experiments on three CIL benchmarks: CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Sub&Full, show that the proposed causal effect distillation can improve various state-of-the-art CIL methods by a large margin (0.72%–9.06%). 111Codes is available at https://github.com/JoyHuYY1412/DDE_CIL\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
