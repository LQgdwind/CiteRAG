      "content": "Paper Title: Generation of smoothly-varying infill configurations from a continuous menu of cell patterns and the asymptotic analysis of its mechanical behaviour\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We here introduce a novel scheme for generating smoothly-varying infill graded microstructural (IGM) configurations from a given menu of generating cells. The scheme was originally proposed for essentially improving the variety of describable configurations in a modified asymptotic homogenisation-based topology optimisation framework [1] for fast IGM design. But the proposed scheme, after modification, also demonstrates its unique values in two aspects of applications. First, it provides a fairly simple way of generating an IGM configuration continuously patching any given cell configurations. Second, it tenders a straightforward mean for decorating microstructures on a given manifold. We will further show that the form of topology description function given here effectively offers a platform for unifying most existing approaches for IGM generation. Fuelled by asymptotic analysis of the mechanical behaviour of the resulting IGM configurations, a topology optimisation scheme for compliance minimisation is introduced. We will finally show that, the use of the present scheme helps reduce the compliance value of an optimised structure by nearly a half, if compared with that from the original framework [1].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
