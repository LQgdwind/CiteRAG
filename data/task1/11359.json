Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A parallel framework for graphical optimal transport\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study multi-marginal optimal transport (MOT) problems where the underlying cost has a graphical structure. These graphical multi-marginal optimal transport problems have found applications in several domains including traffic flow control and regression problems in the Wasserstein space. MOT problem can be approached through two aspects: a single big MOT problem, or coupled minor OT problems. In this paper, we focus on the latter approach and demonstrate it has efficiency gain from the parallelization. For tree-structured MOT problems, we introduce a novel parallelizable algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity. Additionally, we adapt this algorithm for general graphs, employing the modified junction trees to enable parallel updates. Our contributions, validated through numerical experiments, offer new avenues for MOT applications and establish benchmarks in computational efficiency.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
