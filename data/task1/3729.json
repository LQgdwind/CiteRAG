Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fractal Pyramid Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a new network architecture, the Fractal Pyramid Networks (PFNs) for pixel-wise prediction tasks as an alternative to the widely used encoder-decoder structure. In the encoder-decoder structure, the input is processed by an encoding-decoding pipeline that tries to get a semantic large-channel feature. Different from that, our proposed PFNs hold multiple information processing pathways and encode the information to multiple separate small-channel features. On the task of self-supervised monocular depth estimation, even without ImageNet pretrained, our models can compete or outperform the state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset with much fewer parameters. Moreover, the visual quality of the prediction is significantly improved. The experiment of semantic segmentation provides evidence that the PFNs can be applied to other pixel-wise prediction tasks, and demonstrates that our models can catch more global structure information. Our source codes are available in the supplementary materials.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
