Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Occlusion Guided Scene Flow Estimation on 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract 3D scene flow estimation is a vital tool in perceiving our environment given depth or range sensors. Unlike optical flow, the data is usually sparse and in most cases partially occluded in between two temporal samplings. Here we propose a new scene flow architecture called OGSF-Net which tightly couples the learning for both flow and occlusions between frames. Their coupled symbiosis results in a more accurate prediction of flow in space. Unlike a traditional multi-action network, our unified approach is fused throughout the network, boosting performances for both occlusion detection and flow estimation. Our architecture is the first to gauge the occlusion in 3D scene flow estimation on point clouds. In key datasets such as Flyingthings3D and KITTI, we achieve the state-of-the-art results.111Our code will be publicly available upon publication. 222https://github.com/BillOuyang/OGSFNet.git\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
