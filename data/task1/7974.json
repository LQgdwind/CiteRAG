      "content": "Paper Title: Random Majority Opinion Diffusion: Stabilization Time, Absorbing States, and Influential Nodes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Consider a graph G𝐺G with n𝑛n nodes and m𝑚m edges, which represents a social network, and assume that initially each node is blue or white (indicating its opinion on a certain topic). In each round, all nodes simultaneously update their color to the most frequent color in their neighborhood. This is called the Majority Model (MM) if a node keeps its color in case of a tie and the Random Majority Model (RMM) if it chooses blue with probability 1/2121/2 and white otherwise. We prove that there are graphs for which RMM needs exponentially many rounds to reach a stable configuration in expectation, and such a configuration can have exponentially many states (i.e., colorings). This is in contrast to MM, which is known to always reach a stable configuration with one or two states in 𝒪​(m)𝒪𝑚\\mathcal{O}(m) rounds. For the special case of a cycle graph Cnsubscript𝐶𝑛C_{n}, we prove the stronger and tight bounds of ⌈n/2⌉−1𝑛21\\lceil n/2\\rceil-1 and 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) in MM and RMM, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the number of stable colorings in MM on Cnsubscript𝐶𝑛C_{n} is equal to Θ​(Φn)ΘsuperscriptΦ𝑛\\Theta\\left(\\Phi^{n}\\right), where Φ=(1+5)/2Φ152\\Phi=(1+\\sqrt{5})/2 is the golden ratio, while it is equal to 2 for RMM. Our results demonstrate how minor local alterations, such as tie-breaking rule, can significantly influence the global behavior of the process. We also study the minimum size of a winning set, which is a set of nodes whose agreement on a color in the initial coloring enforces the process to end in a coloring where all nodes share that color. We present tight bounds on the minimum size of a winning set for both MM and RMM. Furthermore, we analyze our models for a random initial coloring, where each node is colored blue independently with some probability p𝑝p and white otherwise. Using some martingale analysis and counting arguments, we prove that the expected final number of blue nodes is respectively equal to (2​p2−p3)​n/(1−p+p2)2superscript𝑝2superscript𝑝3𝑛1𝑝superscript𝑝2(2p^{2}-p^{3})n/(1-p+p^{2}) and p​n𝑝𝑛pn in MM and RMM on a cycle graph Cnsubscript𝐶𝑛C_{n}. Finally, we conduct some experiments which complement our theoretical findings and also lead to the proposal of some intriguing open problems and conjectures to be tackled in the future work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
