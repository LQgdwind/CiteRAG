Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: How to evaluate your medical time series classification?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Medical time series (MedTS) play a critical role in many healthcare applications, such as vital sign monitoring and the diagnosis of brain and heart diseases. However, the existence of subject-specific features poses unique challenges in MedTS evaluation. Inappropriate evaluation setups that either exploit or overlook these features can lead to artificially inflated classification performance (by up to 50% in accuracy on ADFTD dataset): this concern has received little attention in current research. Here, we categorize the existing evaluation setups into two primary categories: subject-dependent and subject-independent. We show the subject-independent setup is more appropriate for different datasets and tasks. Our theoretical analysis explores the feature components of MedTS, examining how different evaluation setups influence the features that a model learns. Through experiments on six datasets (spanning EEG, ECG, and fNIRS modalities) using four different methods, we demonstrate step-by-step how subject-dependent utilizes subject-specific features as a shortcut for classification and leads to a deceptive high performance, suggesting that the subject-independent setup is more precise and practicable evaluation setup in real-world. This comprehensive analysis aims to establish clearer guidelines for evaluating MedTS models in different healthcare applications.
