      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating Markov Random Field Inference with Uncertainty Quantification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Statistical machine learning methods have widespread applications in various domains. These methods include probabilistic algorithms, such as Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC), which rely on generating random numbers from probability distributions. These algorithms are computationally expensive on conventional processors, yet their statistical properties, namely interpretability and uncertainty quantification compared to deep learning, make them an attractive alternative approach. Therefore, hardware specialization can be adopted to address the shortcomings of conventional processors in running these applications. In this paper, we propose a high-throughput accelerator for first-order Markov Random Field (MRF) inference, a powerful model for representing a wide range of applications, using MCMC with Gibbs sampling. We propose a tiled architecture which takes advantage of near-memory computing, and memory banking and communication schemes tailored to the semantics of first-order MRF. Additionally, we propose a novel hybrid on-chip/off-chip memory system and logging scheme to efficiently support uncertainty quantification. This memory system design is not specific to MRF models and is applicable to applications using probabilistic algorithms. In addition, it dramatically reduces off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. We implemented an FPGA prototype of our proposed architecture using high-level synthesis tools and achieved 146MHz frequency for an accelerator with 32 function units on an Intel Arria 10 FPGA. Compared to prior work on FPGA, our accelerator achieves 26×\\times speedup. Furthermore, our proposed memory system and logging scheme to support uncertainty quantification reduces off-chip bandwidth consumption by 71% for two benchmark applications. ASIC analysis in 15nm technology node shows our design with 2048 function units running at 3GHz outperforms GPU implementations of motion estimation and stereo vision run on Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti by 120×\\times-210×\\times while occupying only 7.7% of the area.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
