Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion bridges for stochastic Hamiltonian systems and shape evolutionsSubmitted to the editors DATE.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Stochastically evolving geometric systems are studied in shape analysis and computational anatomy for modelling random evolutions of human organ shapes. The notion of geodesic paths between shapes is central to shape analysis and has a natural generalisation as diffusion bridges in a stochastic setting. Simulation of such bridges is key to solve inference and registration problems in shape analysis. We demonstrate how to apply state-of-the-art diffusion bridge simulation methods to recently introduced stochastic shape deformation models thereby substantially expanding the applicability of such models. We exemplify these methods by estimating template shapes from observed shape configurations while simultaneously learning model parameters.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
