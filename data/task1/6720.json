Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Affect Modelling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Affect modeling is viewed, traditionally, as the process of mapping measurable affect manifestations from multiple modalities of user input to affect labels. That mapping is usually inferred through end-to-end (manifestation-to-affect) machine learning processes. What if, instead, one trains general, subject-invariant representations that consider affect information and then uses such representations to model affect? In this paper we assume that affect labels form an integral part, and not just the training signal, of an affect representation and we explore how the recent paradigm of contrastive learning can be employed to discover general high-level affect-infused representations for the purpose of modeling affect. We introduce three different supervised contrastive learning approaches for training representations that consider affect information. In this initial study we test the proposed methods for arousal prediction in the RECOLA dataset based on user information from multiple modalities. Results demonstrate the representation capacity of contrastive learning and its efficiency in boosting the accuracy of affect models. Beyond their evidenced higher performance compared to end-to-end arousal classification, the resulting representations are general-purpose and subject-agnostic, as training is guided though general affect information available in any multimodal corpus.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
