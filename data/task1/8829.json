Recently, the first mathematical runtime guarantees have been obtained for this algorithm, however only for synthetic benchmark problems. In this work, we give the first proven performance guarantees for a classic optimization problem, the NP-complete bi-objective minimum spanning tree problem. More specifically, we show that the NSGA-II with population size N‚â•4‚Äã((n‚àí1)‚Äãwmax+1)ùëÅ4ùëõ1subscriptùë§1N\\geq 4((n-1)w_{\\max}+1) computes all extremal points of the Pareto front in an expected number of O‚Äã(m2‚Äãn‚Äãwmax‚Äãlog‚Å°(n‚Äãwmax))ùëÇsuperscriptùëö2ùëõsubscriptùë§ùëõsubscriptùë§O(m^{2}nw_{\\max}\\log(nw_{\\max})) iterations, where nùëõn is the number of vertices, mùëöm the number of edges, and wmaxsubscriptùë§w_{\\max} is the maximum edge weight in the problem instance. This result confirms, via mathematical means, the good performance of the NSGA-II observed empirically. It also shows that mathematical analyses of this algorithm are not only possible for synthetic benchmark problems, but also for more complex combinatorial optimization problems. As a side result, we also obtain a new analysis of the performance of the global SEMO algorithm on the bi-objective minimum spanning tree problem, which improves the previous best result by a factor of |F|ùêπ|F|, the number of extremal points of the Pareto front, a set that can be as large as n‚Äãwmaxùëõsubscriptùë§nw_{\\max}. The main reason for this improvement is our observation that both multi-objective evolutionary algorithms find the different extremal points in parallel rather than sequentially, as assumed in the previous proofs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
