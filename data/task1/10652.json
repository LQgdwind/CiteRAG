      "content": "Paper Title: Low-Rank Graph Contrastive Learning for Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used to learn node representations and with outstanding performance on various tasks such as node classification. However, noise, which inevitably exists in real-world graph data, would considerably degrade the performance of GNNs revealed by recent studies. In this work, we propose a novel and robust GNN encoder, Low-Rank Graph Contrastive Learning (LR-GCL). Our method performs transductive node classification in two steps. First, a low-rank GCL encoder named LR-GCL is trained by prototypical contrastive learning with low-rank regularization. Next, using the features produced by LR-GCL, a linear transductive classification algorithm is used to classify the unlabeled nodes in the graph. Our LR-GCL is inspired by the low frequency property of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank learning in graph contrastive learning supported by strong empirical performance. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of LR-GCL and the robustness of the learned node representations. The code of LR-GCL is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Low-Rank_Graph_Contrastive_Learning-64A6/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
