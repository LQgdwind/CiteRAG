      "content": "Paper Title: PUGeo-Net: A Geometry-centric Network for 3D Point Cloud Upsampling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper addresses the problem of generating uniform dense point clouds to describe the underlying geometric structures from given sparse point clouds. Due to the irregular and unordered nature, point cloud densification as a generative task is challenging. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel deep neural network based method, called PUGeo-Net, that incorporates discrete differential geometry into deep learning elegantly, making it fundamentally different from the existing deep learning methods that are largely motivated by the image super-resolution techniques and generate new points in the abstract feature space. Specifically, our method learns the first and second fundamental forms, which are able to fully represent the local geometry unique up to rigid motion. We encode the first fundamental form in a 3√ó3333\\times 3 linear transformation matrix ùêìùêì\\bf T for each input point. Such a matrix approximates the augmented Jacobian matrix of a local parameterization that encodes the intrinsic information and builds a one-to-one correspondence between the 2D parametric domain and the 3D tangent plane, so that we can lift the adaptively distributed 2D samples (which are also learned from data) to 3D space. After that, we use the learned second fundamental form to compute a normal displacement for each generated sample and project it to the curved surface. As a by-product, PUGeo-Net can compute normals for the original and generated points, which is highly desired the surface reconstruction algorithms. We interpret PUGeo-Net using the local theory of surfaces in differential geometry, which is also confirmed by quantitative verification. We evaluate PUGeo-Net on a wide range of 3D models with sharp features and rich geometric details and observe that PUGeo-Net, the first neural network that can jointly generate vertex coordinates and normals, consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and efficiency for upsampling factor 4‚àº16similar-to4164\\sim 16. In addition, PUGeo-Net can handle noisy and non-uniformly distributed inputs well, validating its robustness.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
