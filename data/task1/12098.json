      "content": "Paper Title: High-Performance and Scalable Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Lattice Surgery on a 2.5D Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Due to the high error rate of a qubit, detecting and correcting errors on it is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Among several FTQC techniques, lattice surgery (LS) using surface code (SC) is currently promising. To demonstrate practical quantum advantage as early as possible, it is indispensable to propose a high-performance and low-overhead FTQC architecture specialized for a given FTQC scheme based on detailed analysis. In this study, we first categorize the factors, or hazards, that degrade LS-based FTQC performance and propose a performance evaluation methodology to decompose the impact of each hazard, inspired by the CPI stack. We propose the Bypass architecture based on the bottleneck analysis using the proposed evaluation methodology. The proposed Bypass architecture is a 2.5-dimensional architecture consisting of dense and sparse qubit layers and successfully eliminates the bottleneck to achieve high-performance and scalable LS-based FTQC. We evaluate the proposed architecture with a circuit-level stabilizer simulator and a cycle-accurate LS simulator with practical quantum phase estimation problems. The results show that the Bypass architecture improves the fidelity of FTQC and achieves both a 1.73×\\times speedup and a 17% reduction in classical/quantum hardware resources over a conventional 2D architecture.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
