      "content": "Paper Title: Expectation Maximization Pseudo Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we study pseudo-labelling. Pseudo-labelling employs raw inferences on unlabelled data as pseudo-labels for self-training. We elucidate the empirical successes of pseudo-labelling by establishing a link between this technique and the Expectation Maximisation algorithm. Through this, we realise that the original pseudo-labelling serves as an empirical estimation of its more comprehensive underlying formulation. Following this insight, we present a full generalisation of pseudo-labels under Bayes’ theorem, termed Bayesian Pseudo Labels. Subsequently, we introduce a variational approach to generate these Bayesian Pseudo Labels, involving the learning of a threshold to automatically select high-quality pseudo labels. In the remainder of the paper, we showcase the applications of pseudo-labelling and its generalised form, Bayesian Pseudo-Labelling, in the semi-supervised segmentation of medical images. Specifically, we focus on: 1) 3D binary segmentation of lung vessels from CT volumes; 2) 2D multi-class segmentation of brain tumours from MRI volumes; 3) 3D binary segmentation of whole brain tumours from MRI volumes; and 4) 3D binary segmentation of prostate from MRI volumes. We further demonstrate that pseudo-labels can enhance the robustness of the learned representations. The code is released in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/moucheng2017/EMSSL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
