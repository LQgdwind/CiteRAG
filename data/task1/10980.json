Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Context-Based Multimodal Fusion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The fusion models, which effectively combine information from different sources, are widely used in solving multimodal tasks. However, they have significant limitations related to aligning data distributions across different modalities. This challenge can lead to inconsistencies and difficulties in learning robust representations. Alignment models, while specifically addressing this issue, often require training ”from scratch” with large datasets to achieve optimal results, which can be costly in terms of resources and time. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative model called Context-Based Multimodal Fusion (CBMF), which combines both modality fusion and data distribution alignment. In CBMF, each modality is represented by a specific context vector, fused with the embedding of each modality. This enables the use of large pre-trained models that can be frozen, reducing the computational and training data requirements. Additionally, the network learns to differentiate embeddings of different modalities through fusion with context and aligns data distributions using a contrastive approach for self-supervised learning. Thus, CBMF offers an effective and economical solution for solving complex multimodal tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
