      "content": "Paper Title: Representation Learning for Online and Offline RL in Low-rank MDPs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work studies the question of Representation Learning in RL: how can we learn a compact low-dimensional representation such that on top of the representation we can perform RL procedures such as exploration and exploitation, in a sample efficient manner. We focus on the low-rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition dynamics correspond to a low-rank transition matrix. Unlike prior works that assume the representation is known (e.g., linear MDPs), here we need to learn the representation for the low-rank MDP. We study both the online RL and offline RL settings. For the online setting, operating with the same computational oracles used in Flambe(Agarwal et al., 2020b)‚Äî-the state-of-art algorithm for learning representations in low-rank MDPs, we propose an algorithm Rep-UCB‚ÄîUpper Confidence Bound driven Representation learning for RL, which significantly improves the sample complexity from O~‚Äã(A9‚Äãd7/(œµ10‚Äã(1‚àíŒ≥)22))~ùëÇsuperscriptùê¥9superscriptùëë7superscriptitalic-œµ10superscript1ùõæ22\\widetilde{O}(A^{9}d^{7}/(\\epsilon^{10}(1-\\gamma)^{22})) for Flambe to O~‚Äã(d4‚ÄãA2/(œµ2‚Äã(1‚àíŒ≥)5))~ùëÇsuperscriptùëë4superscriptùê¥2superscriptitalic-œµ2superscript1ùõæ5\\widetilde{O}(d^{4}A^{2}/(\\epsilon^{2}(1-\\gamma)^{5})) with dùëëd being the rank of the transition matrix (or dimension of the ground truth representation), Aùê¥A being the number of actions, and Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma being the discount factor. Notably, Rep-UCB is simpler than Flambe, as it directly balances the interplay between representation learning, exploration, and exploitation, while Flambe is an explore-then-commit style approach and has to perform reward-free exploration step-by-step forward in time. For the offline RL setting, we develop an algorithm that leverages pessimism to learn under a partial coverage condition: our algorithm is able to compete against any policy as long as it is covered by the offline data distribution.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
