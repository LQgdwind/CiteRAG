Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Clinical-Longformer and Clinical-BigBird: Transformers for long clinical sequences\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have dramatically improved performance for various natural language processing tasks. The clinical knowledge enriched model, namely ClinicalBERT, also achieved state-of-the-art results when performed on clinical named entity recognition and natural language inference tasks. One of the core limitations of these transformers is the substantial memory consumption due to their full self-attention mechanism. To overcome this, long sequence transformer models, e.g. Longformer and BigBird, were proposed with the idea of sparse attention mechanism to reduce the memory usage from quadratic to the sequence length to a linear scale. These models extended the maximum input sequence length from 512 to 4096, which enhanced the ability of modeling long-term dependency and consequently achieved optimal results in a variety of tasks. Inspired by the success of these long sequence transformer models, we introduce two domain enriched language models, namely Clinical-Longformer and Clinical-BigBird, which are pre-trained from large-scale clinical corpora. We evaluate both pre-trained models using 10 baseline tasks including named entity recognition, question answering, and document classification tasks. The results demonstrate that Clinical-Longformer and Clinical-BigBird consistently and significantly outperform ClinicalBERT as well as other short-sequence transformers in all downstream tasks. We have made our source code available at https://github.com/luoyuanlab/Clinical-Longformer the pre-trained models available for public download at: https://huggingface.co/yikuan8/Clinical-Longformer.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
