Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dawn of the Dead(line Misses): Impact of Job Dismiss on the Deadline Miss Rate\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Occasional deadline misses are acceptable for soft real-time systems. Quantifying probabilistic and deterministic characteristics of deadline misses is therefore essential to ensure that deadline misses indeed happen only occasionally. This is supported by recent research activities on probabilistic worst-case execution time, worst-case deadline failure probability, the maximum number of deadline misses, upper bounds on the deadline miss probability, and the deadline miss rate. This paper focuses on the deadline miss rate of a periodic soft real-time task in the long run. Our model assumes that this soft real-time task has an arbitrary relative deadline and that a job can still be executed after a deadline-miss until a dismiss point. This model generalizes the existing models that either dismiss a job immediately after its deadline miss or never dismiss a job. We provide mathematical notation on the convergence of the deadline miss rate in the long run and essential properties to calculate the deadline miss rate. Specifically, we use a Markov chain to model the execution behavior of a periodic soft real-time task. We present the required ergodicity property to ensure that the deadline miss rate in the long run is described by a stationary distribution.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
