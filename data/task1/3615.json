Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Extending the RISC-V ISA for exploring advanced reconfigurable SIMD instructions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. This paper presents a novel, non-standard set of vector instruction types for exploring custom SIMD instructions in a softcore. The new types allow simultaneous access to a relatively high number of operands, reducing the instruction count where applicable. Additionally, a high-performance open-source RISC-V (RV32 IM) softcore is introduced, optimised for exploring custom SIMD instructions and streaming performance. By providing instruction templates for instruction development in HDL/Verilog, efficient FPGA-based instructions can be developed with few low-level lines of code. In order to improve custom SIMD instruction performance, the softcore’s cache hierarchy is optimised for bandwidth, such as with very wide blocks for the last-level cache. The approach is demonstrated on example memory-intensive applications on an FPGA. Although the exploration is based on the softcore, the goal is to provide a means to experiment with advanced SIMD instructions which could be loaded in future CPUs that feature reconfigurable regions as custom instructions. Finally, we provide some insights on the challenges and effectiveness of such future micro-architectures. ††footnotetext: CARRV 2021, June 17, Virtual Workshop, Co-located with ISCA 2021\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
