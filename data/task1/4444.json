Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Frequency Aware Face Hallucination Generative Adversarial Network with Semantic Structural Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we address the issue of face hallucination. Most current face hallucination methods rely on two-dimensional facial priors to generate high resolution face images from low resolution face images. These methods are only capable of assimilating global information into the generated image. Still there exist some inherent problems in these methods; such as, local features, subtle structural details and missing depth information in final output image. Present work proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based novel progressive Face Hallucination (FH) network to address these issues present among current methods. The generator of the proposed model comprises of FH network and two sub-networks, assisting FH network to generate high resolution images. The first sub-network leverages on explicitly adding high frequency components into the model. To explicitly encode the high frequency components, an auto encoder is proposed to generate high resolution coefficients of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). To add three dimensional parametric information into the network, second sub-network is proposed. This network uses a shape model of 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) to add structural constraint to the FH network. Extensive experimentation results in the paper shows that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
