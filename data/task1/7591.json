      "content": "Paper Title: Data structures for Approximate Discrete Fréchet distance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Fréchet distance is one of the most studied distance measures between curves P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q. The data structure variant of the problem is a longstanding open problem: Efficiently preprocess P𝑃P, so that for any Q𝑄Q given at query time, one can efficiently approximate their Fréchet distance. There exist conditional lower bounds that prohibit (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate Fréchet distance computations in subquadratic time, even when preprocessing P𝑃P using any polynomial amount of time and space. As a consequence, the problem has been studied under various restrictions: restricting Q𝑄Q to be a (horizontal) segment, or requiring P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q to be so-called realistic input curves. In this paper, we consider two types of realistic curves: c𝑐c-packed and κ𝜅\\kappa-straight curves for parameters c𝑐c and κ𝜅\\kappa which are curves that are respectively not too dense, or reasonably straight. We study Fréchet distance computation in any metric space 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} between a realistic input curve P𝑃P and any query curve Q𝑄Q. We give a data structure for (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate discrete Fréchet distance in any metric space 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} between a realistic input curve P𝑃P and any query curve Q𝑄Q. After preprocessing the input curve P𝑃P (with |P|=n𝑃𝑛|P|=n vertices) in O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time, we may answer queries specifying a query curve Q𝑄Q and an ε𝜀\\varepsilon, and output a value d​(P,Q)𝑑𝑃𝑄d(P,Q) which is at most a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-factor away from the true Fréchet distance between Q𝑄Q and P𝑃P. Our query time is asymptotically linear in |Q|=m𝑄𝑚|Q|=m, 1ε1𝜀\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}, log⁡n𝑛\\log n, and the realism parameter c𝑐c or κ𝜅\\kappa. Our data structure allows us to append or reduce P𝑃P. We use randomized update algorithms that take O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) time per operation, with high probability. Our data structure is the first to: adapt to the approximation parameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon at query time, handle query curves with arbitrarily many vertices, work for any ambient space of the curves, or be dynamic. The method presented in this paper simplifies and generalizes previous contributions to the static problem variant. Particularly, we show how to go from approximately deciding the Fréchet distance, to computing an approximate value without the typically-used Well Separated Pair Decomposition of (P,Q)𝑃𝑄(P,Q), which has O​(2d​n+d​n​log⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑑𝑛𝑑𝑛𝑛O(2^{d}n+dn\\log n) construction time in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, or parametric search, which, when applied to sublinear decision algorithms, commonly squares the decision time. We obtain subquadratic total running time in any metric space, including walks on planar graphs, geodesic distance spaces, and even ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} for d<n𝑑𝑛d<n. Our algorithm takes into account that one may not have oracle-access to exact distances in 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, assuming oracle-access to approximate distances for some parameterized query cost. We obtain efficient queries and static algorithms for Fréchet distance computation in high-dimensional spaces and other metric spaces, e.g. when 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is a graph under the shortest path metric, or the geodesic distance in a polygon.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
