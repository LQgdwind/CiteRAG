Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Traffic-Net: 3D Traffic Monitoring Using a Single Camera\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computer Vision has played a major role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and traffic surveillance. Along with the rapidly growing automated vehicles and crowded cities, the automated and advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) using video surveillance infrastructures have been evolved by the implementation of Deep Neural Networks. In this research, we provide a practical platform for real-time traffic monitoring, including 3D vehicle/pedestrian detection, speed detection, trajectory estimation, congestion detection, as well as monitoring the interaction of vehicles and pedestrians, all using a single CCTV traffic camera. We adapt a custom YOLOv5 deep neural network model for vehicle/pedestrian detection and an enhanced SORT tracking algorithm. For the first time, a hybrid satellite-ground based inverse perspective mapping (SG-IPM) method for camera auto-calibration is also developed which leads to an accurate 3D object detection and visualisation. We also develop a hierarchical traffic modelling solution based on short- and long-term temporal video data stream to understand the traffic flow, bottlenecks, and risky spots for vulnerable road users. Several experiments on real-world scenarios and comparisons with state-of-the-art are conducted using various traffic monitoring datasets, including MIO-TCD, UA-DETRAC and GRAM-RTM collected from highways, intersections, and urban areas under different lighting and weather conditions. Keywords â€“ 3D Object Detection; Traffic Flow Monitoring; Intelligent Transportation Systems; Deep Neural Networks; Vehicle Detection; Pedestrian Detection; Inverse Perspective Mapping Calibration; Digital Twins, Video Surveillance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 60\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
