Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hypergraphs for multiscale cycles in structured data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Scientific data has been growing in both size and complexity across the modern physical, engineering, life and social sciences. Spatial structure, for example, is a hallmark of many of the most important real-world complex systems, but its analysis is fraught with statistical challenges. Topological data analysis can provide a powerful computational window on complex systems. Here we present a framework to extend and interpret persistent homology summaries to analyse spatial data across multiple scales. We introduce hyperTDA, a topological pipeline that unifies local (e.g. geodesic) and global (e.g. Euclidean) metrics without losing spatial information, even in the presence of noise. Homology generators offer an elegant and flexible description of spatial structures and can capture the information computed by persistent homology in an interpretable way. Here the information computed by persistent homology is transformed into a weighted hypergraph, where hyperedges correspond to homology generators. We consider different choices of generators (e.g. matroid or minimal) and find that centrality and community detection are robust to either choice. We compare hyperTDA to existing geometric measures and validate its robustness to noise. We demonstrate the power of computing higher-order topological structures on spatial curves arising frequently in ecology, biophysics, and biology, but also in high-dimensional financial datasets. We find that hyperTDA can select between synthetic trajectories from the landmark 2020 AnDi challenge and quantifies movements of different animal species, even when data is limited.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
