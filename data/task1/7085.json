Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scratching Visual Transformer‚Äôs Back with Uniform Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The favorable performance of Vision Transformers (ViTs) is often attributed to the multi-head self-attention (ùôºùöÇùô∞ùôºùöÇùô∞\\mathtt{MSA}). The ùôºùöÇùô∞ùôºùöÇùô∞\\mathtt{MSA} enables global interactions at each layer of a ViT model, which is a contrasting feature against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that gradually increase the range of interaction across multiple layers. We study the role of the density of the attention. Our preliminary analyses suggest that the spatial interactions of attention maps are close to dense interactions rather than sparse ones. This is a curious phenomenon, as dense attention maps are harder for the model to learn due to steeper softmax gradients around them. We interpret this as a strong preference for ViT models to include dense interaction. We thus manually insert the uniform attention to each layer of ViT models to supply the much needed dense interactions. We call this method Context Broadcasting, ùô≤ùô±ùô≤ùô±\\mathtt{CB}. We observe that the inclusion of ùô≤ùô±ùô≤ùô±\\mathtt{CB} reduces the degree of density in the original attention maps and increases both the capacity and generalizability of the ViT models. ùô≤ùô±ùô≤ùô±\\mathtt{CB} incurs negligible costs: 1 line in your model code, no additional parameters, and minimal extra operations.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
