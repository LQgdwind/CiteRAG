Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Statistical Model Checking for Multi-agent Systems using HyperPCTL*\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we present a Bayesian method for statistical model checking (SMC) of probabilistic hyperproperties specified in the logic HyperPCTL* on discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs). While SMC of HyperPCTL* using sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) has been explored before, we develop an alternative SMC algorithm based on Bayesian hypothesis testing. In comparison to PCTL*, verifying HyperPCTL* formulae is complex owing to their simultaneous interpretation on multiple paths of the DTMC. In addition, extending the bottom-up model-checking algorithm of the non-probabilistic setting is not straight forward due to the fact that SMC does not return exact answers to the satisfiability problems of subformulae, instead, it only returns correct answers with high-confidence. We propose a recursive algorithm for SMC of HyperPCTL* based on a modified Bayes‚Äô test that factors in the uncertainty in the recursive satisfiability results. We have implemented our algorithm in a Python toolbox, HyProVer, and compared our approach with the SPRT based SMC. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our Bayesian SMC algorithm performs better both in terms of the verification time and the number of samples required to deduce satisfiability of a given HyperPCTL* formula.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
