      "content": "Paper Title: Enriched Robust Multi-View Kernel Subspace Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Subspace clustering is to find underlying low-dimensional subspaces and cluster the data points correctly. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering method. Most existing methods suffer from two critical issues. First, they usually adopt a two-stage framework and isolate the processes of affinity learning, multi-view information fusion and clustering. Second, they assume the data lies in a linear subspace which may fail in practice as most real-world datasets may have non-linearity structures. To address the above issues, in this paper we propose a novel Enriched Robust Multi-View Kernel Subspace Clustering framework where the consensus affinity matrix is learned from both multi-view data and spectral clustering. Due to the objective and constraints which is difficult to optimize, we propose an iterative optimization method which is easy to implement and can yield closed solution in each step. Extensive experiments have validated the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art clustering methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
