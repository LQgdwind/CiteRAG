Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Decomposing the Enigma: Subgoal-based Demonstration Learning for Formal Theorem Proving\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large language models (LLMs) present an intriguing avenue of exploration in the domain of formal theorem proving. Nonetheless, the full utilization of these models, particularly in terms of demonstration formatting and organization, remains an underexplored area. In an endeavor to enhance the efficacy of LLMs, we introduce a subgoal-based demonstration learning framework, consisting of two primary elements: Firstly, drawing upon the insights of subgoal learning from the domains of reinforcement learning and robotics, we propose the construction of distinct subgoals for each demonstration example and refine these subgoals in accordance with the pertinent theories of subgoal learning. Secondly, we build upon recent advances in diffusion models to predict the optimal organization, simultaneously addressing two intricate issues that persist within the domain of demonstration organization: subset selection and order determination. Through the integration of subgoal-based learning methodologies, we have successfully increased the prevailing proof accuracy from 38.9% to 44.3% on the miniF2F benchmark. Furthermore, the adoption of diffusion models for demonstration organization can lead to an additional enhancement in accuracy to 45.5%, or a 5×5\\times improvement in sampling efficiency compared with the long-standing state-of-the-art method. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKUNLP/subgoal-theorem-prover.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
