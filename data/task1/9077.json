      "content": "Paper Title: BeMap: Balanced Message Passing for Fair Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Graph Neural Network (GNN) has shown strong empirical performance in many downstream tasks by iteratively aggregating information from the local neighborhood of each node, i.e., message passing. However, concrete evidence has revealed that a graph neural network could be biased against certain demographic groups, which calls for the consideration of algorithmic fairness. Despite the increasing efforts in ensuring algorithmic fairness on graph neural networks, they often do not explicitly consider the induced bias caused by message passing in GNN during training. In this paper, we first investigate the problem of bias amplification in message passing. We empirically and theoretically demonstrate that message passing could amplify the bias when the 1-hop neighbors from different demographic groups are unbalanced. Guided by such analyses, we propose BeMap, a fair message passing method, that leverages a balance-aware sampling strategy to balance the number of the 1-hop neighbors of each node among different demographic groups. Extensive experiments on node classification demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed BeMap method in mitigating bias while maintaining classification accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
