Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Fashion Design with Multi-stage Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cross-modal fashion synthesis and editing offer intelligent support to fashion designers by enabling the automatic generation and local modification of design drafts. While current diffusion models demonstrate commendable stability and controllability in image synthesis, they still face significant challenges in generating fashion design from abstract design elements and fine-grained editing. Abstract sensory expressions, e.g. office, business, and party, form the high-level design concepts, while measurable aspects like sleeve length, collar type, and pant length are considered the low-level attributes of clothing. Controlling and editing fashion images using lengthy text descriptions poses a difficulty. In this paper, we propose HieraFashDiff, a novel fashion design method using the shared multi-stage diffusion model encompassing high-level design concepts and low-level clothing attributes in a hierarchical structure. Specifically, we categorized the input text into different levels and fed them in different time step to the diffusion model according to the criteria of professional clothing designers. HieraFashDiff allows designers to add low-level attributes after high-level prompts for interactive editing incrementally. In addition, we design a differentiable loss function in the sampling process with a mask to keep non-edit areas. Comprehensive experiments performed on our newly conducted Hierarchical fashion dataset, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art competitors.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
