Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Privacy-Preserving Multimedia Mobile Cloud Computing Using Protective Perturbation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Mobile cloud computing has been adopted in many multimedia applications, where the resource-constrained mobile device sends multimedia data (e.g., images) to remote cloud servers to request computation-intensive multimedia services (e.g., image recognition). While significantly improving the performance of the mobile applications, the cloud-based mechanism often causes privacy concerns as the multimedia data and services are offloaded from the trusted user device to untrusted cloud servers. Several recent studies have proposed perturbation-based privacy preserving mechanisms, which obfuscate the offloaded multimedia data to eliminate privacy exposures without affecting the functionality of the remote multimedia services. However, the existing privacy protection approaches require the deployment of computation-intensive perturbation generation on the resource-constrained mobile devices. Also, the obfuscated images are typically not compliant with the standard image compression algorithms and suffer from significant bandwidth consumption. In this paper, we develop a novel privacy-preserving multimedia mobile cloud computing framework, namely PMC2, to address the resource and bandwidth challenges. PMC2 employs secure confidential computing in the cloud to deploy the perturbation generator, which addresses the resource challenge while maintaining the privacy. Furthermore, we develop a neural compressor specifically trained to compress the perturbed images in order to address the bandwidth challenge. We implement PMC2 in an end-to-end mobile cloud computing system, based on which our evaluations demonstrate superior latency, power efficiency, and bandwidth consumption achieved by PMC2 while maintaining high accuracy in the target multimedia service.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
