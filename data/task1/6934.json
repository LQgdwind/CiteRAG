Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Architecting materials for extremal stiffness, yield and buckling strength\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes a methodology for architecting microstructures with extremal stiffness, yield, and buckling strength using topology optimization. The optimized microstructures reveal an interesting transition from simple lattice like structures for yield-dominated situations to hierarchical lattice structures for buckling-dominated situations. The transition from simple to hierarchical is governed by the relative yield strength of the constituent base material as well as the volume fraction. The overall performances of the optimized microstructures indicate that maximum strength is determined by the buckling strength at low volume fractions and yield strength at higher volume fractions, regardless of the base material‚Äôs relative yield strength. The non-normalized properties of the optimized microstructures show that higher base material Young‚Äôs modulus leads to both higher Young‚Äôs modulus and strength of the architected microstructures. Furthermore, the polynomial order of the maximum strength lines with respect to mass density obtained from the optimized microstructures reduces as base material relative yield strength decreases, reducing from 2.3 for buckling dominated Thermoplastic Polyurethane to 1 for yield dominated steel microstructures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
