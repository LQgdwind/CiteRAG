Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sample-Efficient Multi-Objective Learning via Generalized Policy Improvement Prioritization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithms tackle sequential decision problems where agents may have different preferences over (possibly conflicting) reward functions. Such algorithms often learn a set of policies (each optimized for a particular agent preference) that can later be used to solve problems with novel preferences. We introduce a novel algorithm that uses Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) to define principled, formally-derived prioritization schemes that improve sample-efficient learning. They implement active-learning strategies by which the agent can (i) identify the most promising preferences/objectives to train on at each moment, to more rapidly solve a given MORL problem; and (ii) identify which previous experiences are most relevant when learning a policy for a particular agent preference, via a novel Dyna-style MORL method. We prove our algorithm is guaranteed to always converge to an optimal solution in a finite number of steps, or an 系italic-系\\epsilon-optimal solution (for a bounded 系italic-系\\epsilon) if the agent is limited and can only identify possibly sub-optimal policies. We also prove that our method monotonically improves the quality of its partial solutions while learning. Finally, we introduce a bound that characterizes the maximum utility loss (with respect to the optimal solution) incurred by the partial solutions computed by our method throughout learning. We empirically show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MORL algorithms in challenging multi-objective tasks, both with discrete and continuous state and action spaces.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
