      "content": "Paper Title: Skeleton2vec: A Self-supervised Learning Framework with Contextualized Target Representations for Skeleton Sequence\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-supervised pre-training paradigms have been extensively explored in the field of skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, methods based on masked prediction have pushed the performance of pre-training to a new height. However, these methods take low-level features, such as raw joint coordinates or temporal motion, as prediction targets for the masked regions, which is suboptimal. In this paper, we show that using high-level contextualized features as prediction targets can achieve superior performance. Specifically, we propose Skeleton2vec, a simple and efficient self-supervised 3D action representation learning framework, which utilizes a transformer-based teacher encoder taking unmasked training samples as input to create latent contextualized representations as prediction targets. Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, the latent representations generated by the teacher encoder can incorporate the global context of the entire training samples, leading to a richer training task. Additionally, considering the high temporal correlations in skeleton sequences, we propose a motion-aware tube masking strategy which divides the skeleton sequence into several tubes and performs persistent masking within each tube based on motion priors, thus forcing the model to build long-range spatio-temporal connections and focus on action-semantic richer regions. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our proposed Skeleton2vec outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results. The source code of Skeleton2vec is available at https://github.com/Ruizhuo-Xu/Skeleton2vec.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
