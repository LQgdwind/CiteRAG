Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Meta Learning Black-Box Population-Based Optimizers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The no free lunch theorem states that no model is better suited to every problem. A question that arises from this is how to design methods that propose optimizers tailored to specific problems achieving state-of-the-art performance. This paper addresses this issue by proposing the use of meta-learning to infer population-based black-box optimizers that can automatically adapt to specific classes of problems. We suggest a general modeling of population-based algorithms that result in Learning-to-Optimize POMDP (LTO-POMDP), a meta-learning framework based on a specific partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). From that framework’s formulation, we propose to parameterize the algorithm using deep recurrent neural networks and use a meta-loss function based on stochastic algorithms’ performance to train efficient data-driven optimizers over several related optimization tasks. The learned optimizers’ performance based on this implementation is assessed on various black-box optimization tasks and hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models. Our results revealed that the meta-loss function encourages a learned algorithm to alter its search behavior so that it can easily fit into a new context. Thus, it allows better generalization and higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art generic optimization algorithms, such as the Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
