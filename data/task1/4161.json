Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Searching for Two-Stream Models in Multivariate Space for Video Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Conventional video models rely on a single stream to capture the complex spatial-temporal features. Recent work on two-stream video models, such as SlowFast network and AssembleNet, prescribe separate streams to learn complementary features, and achieve stronger performance. However, manually designing both streams as well as the in-between fusion blocks is a daunting task, requiring to explore a tremendously large design space. Such manual exploration is time-consuming and often ends up with sub-optimal architectures when computational resources are limited and the exploration is insufficient. In this work, we present a pragmatic neural architecture search approach, which is able to search for two-stream video models in giant spaces efficiently. We design a multivariate search space, including 6 search variables to capture a wide variety of choices in designing two-stream models. Furthermore, we propose a progressive search procedure, by searching for the architecture of individual streams, fusion blocks and attention blocks one after the other. We demonstrate two-stream models with significantly better performance can be automatically discovered in our design space. Our searched two-stream models, namely Auto-TSNet, consistently outperform other models on standard benchmarks. On Kinetics, compared with the SlowFast model, our Auto-TSNet-L model reduces FLOPS by nearly 11×11\\times while achieving the same accuracy 78.9%percent78.978.9\\%. On Something-Something-V2, Auto-TSNet-M improves the accuracy by at least 2%percent22\\% over other methods which use less than 50 GFLOPS per video.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
