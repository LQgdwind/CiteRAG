      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Combinatorial Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper introduces a federated learning framework tailored for online combinatorial optimization with bandit feedback. In this setting, agents select subsets of arms, observe noisy rewards for these subsets without accessing individual arm information, and can cooperate and share information at specific intervals. Our framework transforms any offline resilient single-agent (α−ϵ)𝛼italic-ϵ(\\alpha-\\epsilon)-approximation algorithm—having a complexity of 𝒪~​(ψϵβ)~𝒪𝜓superscriptitalic-ϵ𝛽\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\frac{\\psi}{\\epsilon^{\\beta}}\\right), where the logarithm is omitted, for some function ψ𝜓\\psi and constant β𝛽\\beta—into an online multi-agent algorithm with m𝑚m communicating agents and an α𝛼\\alpha-regret of no more than 𝒪~​(m−13+β​ψ13+β​T2+β3+β)~𝒪superscript𝑚13𝛽superscript𝜓13𝛽superscript𝑇2𝛽3𝛽\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(m^{-\\frac{1}{3+\\beta}}\\psi^{\\frac{1}{3+\\beta}}T^{\\frac{2+\\beta}{3+\\beta}}\\right). Our approach not only eliminates the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon approximation error but also ensures sublinear growth with respect to the time horizon T𝑇T and demonstrates a linear speedup with an increasing number of communicating agents. Additionally, the algorithm is notably communication-efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of communication rounds, quantified as 𝒪~​(ψ​Tββ+1)~𝒪𝜓superscript𝑇𝛽𝛽1\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\psi T^{\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1}}\\right). Furthermore, the framework has been successfully applied to online stochastic submodular maximization using various offline algorithms, yielding the first results for both single-agent and multi-agent settings and recovering specialized single-agent theoretical guarantees. We empirically validate our approach to a stochastic data summarization problem, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework, even in single-agent scenarios.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
