      "content": "Paper Title: K-Link: Knowledge-Link Graph from LLMs for Enhanced Representation Learning in Multivariate Time-Series Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Sourced from various sensors and organized chronologically, Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data involves crucial spatial-temporal dependencies, e.g., correlations among sensors. To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools, yet their effectiveness is restricted by the quality of graph construction from MTS data. Typically, existing approaches construct graphs solely from MTS signals, which may introduce bias due to a small training dataset and may not accurately represent underlying dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named K-Link, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode extensive general knowledge and thereby providing effective solutions to reduce the bias. Leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, such as physical principles, we extract a Knowledge-Link graph, capturing vast semantic knowledge of sensors and the linkage of the sensor-level knowledge. To harness the potential of the knowledge-link graph in enhancing the graph derived from MTS data, we propose a graph alignment module, facilitating the transfer of semantic knowledge within the knowledge-link graph into the MTS-derived graph. By doing so, we can improve the graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning with GNNs for MTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for superior performance across various MTS-related downstream tasks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
