      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Prompt Tuning of Large Vision-Language Model for Fine-Grained Ship Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Fine-grained ship classification in remote sensing (RS-FGSC) poses a significant challenge due to the high similarity between classes and the limited availability of labeled data, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised classification methods. Recent advancements in large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in few-shot or zero-shot learning, particularly in understanding image content. This study delves into harnessing the potential of VLMs to enhance classification accuracy for unseen ship categories, which holds considerable significance in scenarios with restricted data due to cost or privacy constraints. Directly fine-tuning VLMs for RS-FGSC often encounters the challenge of overfitting the seen classes, resulting in suboptimal generalization to unseen classes, which highlights the difficulty in differentiating complex backgrounds and capturing distinct ship features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel prompt tuning technique that employs a hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design. Our approach integrates remote sensing ship priors through bias terms, learned from a small trainable network. This strategy enhances the modelâ€™s generalization capabilities while improving its ability to discern intricate backgrounds and learn discriminative ship features. Furthermore, we contribute to the field by introducing a comprehensive dataset, FGSCM-52, significantly expanding existing datasets with more extensive data and detailed annotations for less common ship classes. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art techniques. The source code will be made publicly available.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
