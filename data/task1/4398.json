Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Turning old models fashion again: Recycling classical CNN networks using the Lattice Transformation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the early 1990s, the first signs of life of the CNN era were given: LeCun et al. [1] proposed a CNN model trained by the backpropagation algorithm to classify low-resolution images of handwritten digits. Undoubtedly, it was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision. But with the rise of other classification methods, it fell out fashion. That was until 2012, when Krizhevsky et al. (2012) [2] revived the interest in CNNs by exhibiting considerably higher image classification accuracy on the ImageNet challenge. Since then, the complexity of the architectures are exponentially increasing and many structures are rapidly becoming obsolete. Using multistream networks as a base and the feature infusion precept, we explore the proposed LCNN [3] cross-fusion strategy to use the backbones of former state-of-the-art networks on image classification in order to discover if the technique is able to put these designs back in the game. In this paper, we showed that we can obtain an increase of accuracy up to 63.21%percent63.2163.21\\% on the NORB dataset we comparing with the original structure. However, no technique is definitive. While our goal is to try to reuse previous state-of-the-art architectures with few modifications, we also expose the disadvantages of our explored strategy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
