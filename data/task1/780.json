      "content": "Paper Title: Which scaling rule applies to large Artificial Neural NetworksThe paper is the extended version of the presentation held at the 22nd Int’l Conf on Artificial Intelligence (ICAI’20), Las Vegas, USA, as ICA2246. Project no. 136496 has been implemented with the support provided from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary, financed under the K funding scheme.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The experience shows that cooperating and communicating computing systems, comprising segregated single processors, have severe performance limitations, which cannot be explained using von Neumann’s classic computing paradigm. In his classic ”First Draft” he warned that using a ”too fast processor” vitiates his simple ”procedure” (but not his computing model!); furthermore, that using the classic computing paradigm for imitating neuronal operations, is unsound. Amdahl added that large machines, comprising many processors, have an inherent disadvantage. Given that Artificial Neural Network (ANN)’s components are heavily communicating with each other, they are built from a large number of components designed/fabricated for use in conventional computing, furthermore they attempt to mimic biological operation using improper technological solutions, their achievable payload computing performance is conceptually modest. The type of workload that Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems generate leads to an exceptionally low payload computational performance, and their design/technology limits their size to just above the ”toy” level systems: the scaling of processor-based ANN systems is strongly nonlinear. Given the proliferation and growing size of ANN systems, we suggest ideas to estimate in advance the efficiency of the device or application. The wealth of ANN implementations, and the proprietary technical data do not enable more. Through analyzing published measurements we provide evidence that the role of data transfer time drastically influences both ANN s performance and feasibility. It is discussed how some major theoretical limiting factors, ANN’s layer structure and their methods of technical implementation of communication affect their efficiency. The paper starts from von Neumann’s original model, without neglecting the transfer time apart from processing time; derives an appropriate interpretation and handling for Amdahl’s law. It shows that, in that interpretation, Amdahl’s Law correctly describes ANN s.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
