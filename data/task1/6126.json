Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Discovering Ancestral Instrumental Variables for Causal Inference from Observational Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Instrumental variable (IV) is a powerful approach to inferring the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest from observational data even when there exist latent confounders between the treatment and the outcome. However, existing IV methods require that an IV is selected and justified with domain knowledge. An invalid IV may lead to biased estimates. Hence, discovering a valid IV is critical to the applications of IV methods. In this paper, we study and design a data-driven algorithm to discover valid IVs from data under mild assumptions. We develop the theory based on partial ancestral graphs (PAGs) to support the search for a set of candidate Ancestral IVs (AIVs), and for each possible AIV, the identification of its conditioning set. Based on the theory, we propose a data-driven algorithm to discover a pair of IVs from data. The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the developed IV discovery algorithm estimates accurate estimates of causal effects in comparison with the state-of-the-art IV based causal effect estimators.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
