Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: WEDGE: A multi-weather autonomous driving dataset built from generative vision-language models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The open road poses many challenges to autonomous perception, including poor visibility from extreme weather conditions. Models trained on good-weather datasets frequently fail at detection in these out-of-distribution settings. To aid adversarial robustness in perception, we introduce WEDGE (WEather images by DALL-E GEneration): a synthetic dataset generated with a vision-language generative model via prompting. WEDGE consists of 3360 images in 16 extreme weather conditions manually annotated with 16513 bounding boxes, supporting research in the tasks of weather classification and 2D object detection. We have analyzed WEDGE from research standpoints, verifying its effectiveness for extreme-weather autonomous perception. We establish baseline performance for classification and detection with 53.87% test accuracy and 45.41 mAP. Most importantly, WEDGE can be used to fine-tune state-of-the-art detectors, improving SOTA performance on real-world weather benchmarks (such as DAWN) by 4.48 AP for well-generated classes like trucks. WEDGE has been collected under OpenAI’s terms111https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use. Accessed: March 21, 2023. of use and is released for public use under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. The repository for this work and dataset is available at https://infernolia.github.io/WEDGE.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
