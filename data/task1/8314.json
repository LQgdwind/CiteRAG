Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Case Study on AI Engineering Practices: Developing an Autonomous Stock Trading System\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Today, many systems use artificial intelligence (AI) to solve complex problems. While this often increases system effectiveness, developing a production-ready AI-based system is a difficult task. Thus, solid AI engineering practices are required to ensure the quality of the resulting system and to improve the development process. While several practices have already been proposed for the development of AI-based systems, detailed practical experiences of applying these practices are rare. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by collecting such experiences during a case study, namely the development of an autonomous stock trading system that uses machine learning functionality to invest in stocks. We selected 10 AI engineering practices from the literature and systematically applied them during development, with the goal to collect evidence about their applicability and effectiveness. Using structured field notes, we documented our experiences. Furthermore, we also used field notes to document challenges that occurred during the development, and the solutions we applied to overcome them. Afterwards, we analyzed the collected field notes, and evaluated how each practice improved the development. Lastly, we compared our evidence with existing literature. Most applied practices improved our system, albeit to varying extent, and we were able to overcome all major challenges. The qualitative results provide detailed accounts about 10 AI engineering practices, as well as challenges and solutions associated with such a project. Our experiences therefore enrich the emerging body of evidence in this field, which may be especially helpful for practitioner teams new to AI engineering.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
