Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Differentially Private ADMM Algorithms for Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we study efficient differentially private alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) via gradient perturbation for many machine learning problems. For smooth convex loss functions with (non)-smooth regularization, we propose the first differentially private ADMM (DP-ADMM) algorithm with performance guarantee of (œµ,Œ¥)italic-œµùõø(\\epsilon,\\delta)-differential privacy ((œµ,Œ¥)italic-œµùõø(\\epsilon,\\delta)-DP). From the viewpoint of theoretical analysis, we use the Gaussian mechanism and the conversion relationship between R√©nyi Differential Privacy (RDP) and DP to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis for our algorithm. Then we establish a new criterion to prove the convergence of the proposed algorithms including DP-ADMM. We also give the utility analysis of our DP-ADMM. Moreover, we propose an accelerated DP-ADMM (DP-AccADMM) with the Nesterov‚Äôs acceleration technique. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on many real-world datasets to show the privacy-utility tradeoff of the two proposed algorithms, and all the comparative analysis shows that DP-AccADMM converges faster and has a better utility than DP-ADMM, when the privacy budget œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon is larger than a threshold.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
