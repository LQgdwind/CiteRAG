Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Representative Trajectories of Dynamical Systems via Domain-Adaptive Imitation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Domain-adaptive trajectory imitation is a skill that some predators learn for survival, by mapping dynamic information from one domain (their speed and steering direction) to a different domain (current position of the moving prey). An intelligent agent with this skill could be exploited for a diversity of tasks, including the recognition of abnormal motion in traffic once it has learned to imitate representative trajectories. Towards this direction, we propose DATI, a deep reinforcement learning agent designed for domain-adaptive trajectory imitation using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial method. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic families of reference trajectories show that DATI outperforms baseline methods for imitation learning and optimal control in this setting, keeping the same per-task hyperparameters. Its generalization to a real-world scenario is shown through the discovery of abnormal motion patterns in maritime traffic, opening the door for the use of deep reinforcement learning methods for spatially-unconstrained trajectory data mining.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
