      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Coding Theorems in Time-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The classical coding theorem in Kolmogorov complexity states that if an n𝑛n-bit string x𝑥x is sampled with probability δ𝛿\\delta by an algorithm with prefix-free domain then 𝖪​(x)≤log⁡(1/δ)+O​(1)𝖪𝑥1𝛿𝑂1\\mathsf{K}(x)\\leq\\log(1/\\delta)+O(1). In a recent work, Lu and Oliveira [29] established an unconditional time-bounded version of this result, by showing that if x𝑥x can be efficiently sampled with probability δ𝛿\\delta then 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)=O​(log⁡(1/δ))+O​(log⁡n)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥𝑂1𝛿𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(x)=O(\\log(1/\\delta))+O(\\log n), where 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} denotes the randomized analogue of Levin’s 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} complexity. Unfortunately, this result is often insufficient when transferring applications of the classical coding theorem to the time-bounded setting, as it achieves a O​(log⁡(1/δ))𝑂1𝛿O(\\log(1/\\delta)) bound instead of the information-theoretic optimal log⁡(1/δ)1𝛿\\log(1/\\delta). Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate optimal coding theorems in the time-bounded setting. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows. ∙∙\\bullet Efficient coding theorem for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} with a factor of 222. Addressing a question from [29], we show that if x𝑥x can be efficiently sampled with probability at least δ𝛿\\delta then 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)≤(2+o​(1))⋅log⁡(1/δ)+O​(log⁡n)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥⋅2𝑜11𝛿𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(x)\\leq(2+o(1))\\cdot\\log(1/\\delta)+O\\!\\left(\\log n\\right). As in previous work, our coding theorem is efficient in the sense that it provides a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm that, when given x𝑥x, the code of the sampler, and δ𝛿\\delta, it outputs, with probability ≥0.99absent0.99\\geq 0.99, a probabilistic representation of x𝑥x that certifies this 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} complexity bound. ∙∙\\bullet Optimality under a cryptographic assumption. Under a hypothesis about the security of cryptographic pseudorandom generators, we show that no efficient coding theorem can achieve a bound of the form 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)≤(2−o​(1))⋅log⁡(1/δ)+𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(log⁡n)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥⋅2𝑜11𝛿𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(x)\\leq(2-o(1))\\cdot\\log(1/\\delta)+\\mathsf{poly}(\\log n). Under a weaker assumption, we exhibit a gap between efficient coding theorems and existential coding theorems with near-optimal parameters. ∙∙\\bullet Optimal coding theorem for 𝗉𝖪tsuperscript𝗉𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{pK}^{t} and unconditional Antunes-Fortnow. We consider 𝗉𝖪tsuperscript𝗉𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{pK}^{t} complexity [18], a variant of 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} where the randomness is public and the time bound is fixed. We observe the existence of an optimal coding theorem for 𝗉𝖪tsuperscript𝗉𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{pK}^{t}, and employ this result to establish an unconditional version of a theorem of Antunes and Fortnow [2] which characterizes the worst-case running times of languages that are in average polynomial-time over all 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P}-samplable distributions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
