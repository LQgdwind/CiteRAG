      "content": "Paper Title: A Robust Version of Hegedűs’s Lemma, with Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Hegedűs’s lemma is the following combinatorial statement regarding polynomials over finite fields. Over a field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} of characteristic p>0𝑝0p>0 and for q𝑞q a power of p𝑝p, the lemma says that any multilinear polynomial P∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝑃𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛P\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}] of degree less than q𝑞q that vanishes at all points in {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} of some fixed Hamming weight k∈[q,n−q]𝑘𝑞𝑛𝑞k\\in[q,n-q] must also vanish at all points in {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} of weight k+q𝑘𝑞k+q. This lemma was used by Hegedűs (2009) to give a solution to Galvin’s problem, an extremal problem about set systems; by Alon, Kumar and Volk (2018) to improve the best-known multilinear circuit lower bounds; and by Hrubeš, Ramamoorthy, Rao and Yehudayoff (2019) to prove optimal lower bounds against depth-222 threshold circuits for computing some symmetric functions. In this paper, we formulate a robust version of Hegedűs’s lemma. Informally, this version says that if a polynomial of degree o​(q)𝑜𝑞o(q) vanishes at most points of weight k𝑘k, then it vanishes at many points of weight k+q𝑘𝑞k+q. We prove this lemma and give the following three different applications. • Degree lower bounds for the coin problem: The δ𝛿\\delta-Coin Problem is the problem of distinguishing between a coin that is heads with probability ((1/2)+δ)12𝛿((1/2)+\\delta) and a coin that is heads with probability 1/2121/2. We show that over a field of positive (fixed) characteristic, any polynomial that solves the δ𝛿\\delta-coin problem with error ε𝜀\\varepsilon must have degree Ω​(1δ​log⁡(1/ε)),Ω1𝛿1𝜀\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\log(1/\\varepsilon)), which is tight up to constant factors. • Probabilistic degree lower bounds: The Probabilistic degree of a Boolean function is the minimum d𝑑d such that there is a random polynomial of degree d𝑑d that agrees with the function at each point with high probability. We give tight lower bounds on the probabilistic degree of every symmetric Boolean function over positive (fixed) characteristic. As far as we know, this was not known even for some very simple functions such as unweighted Exact Threshold functions, and constant error. • A robust version of the combinatorial result of Hegedűs (2009) mentioned above.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
