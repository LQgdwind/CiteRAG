Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Diversity Through Exclusion (DTE): Niche Identification for Reinforcement Learning through Value-Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many environments contain numerous available niches of variable value, each associated with a different local optimum in the space of behaviors (policy space). In such situations it is often difficult to design a learning process capable of evading distraction by poor local optima long enough to stumble upon the best available niche. In this work we propose a generic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that performs better than baseline deep Q-learning algorithms in such environments with multiple variably-valued niches. The algorithm we propose consists of two parts: an agent architecture and a learning rule. The agent architecture contains multiple sub-policies. The learning rule is inspired by fitness sharing in evolutionary computation and applied in reinforcement learning using Value-Decomposition-Networks in a novel manner for a single-agent’s internal population. It can concretely be understood as adding an extra loss term where one policy’s experience is also used to update all the other policies in a manner that decreases their value estimates for the visited states. In particular, when one sub-policy visits a particular state frequently this decreases the value predicted for other sub-policies for going to that state. Further, we introduce an artificial chemistry inspired platform where it is easy to create tasks with multiple rewarding strategies utilizing different resources (i.e. multiple niches). We show that agents trained this way can escape poor-but-attractive local optima to instead converge to harder-to-discover higher value strategies in both the artificial chemistry environments and in simpler illustrative environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
