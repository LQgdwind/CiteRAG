Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Enhanced Optimisation for Routing Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in solving routing problems. However, there is still a substantial gap in solution quality between machine learning and operations research algorithms. Recently, another line of research has been introduced that fuses the strengths of machine learning and operational research algorithms. In particular, search perturbation operators have been used to improve the solution. Nevertheless, using the perturbation may not guarantee a quality solution. This paper presents \"Learning to Guide Local Search\" (L2GLS), a learning-based approach for routing problems that uses a penalty term and reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust search efforts. L2GLS combines local search (LS) operators’ strengths with penalty terms to escape local optimals. Routing problems have many practical applications, often presetting larger instances that are still challenging for many existing algorithms introduced in the learning to optimise field. We show that L2GLS achieves the new state-of-the-art results on larger TSP and CVRP over other machine learning methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
