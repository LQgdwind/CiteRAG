All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problems of counting copies and induced copies of a small pattern graph H𝐻H in a large host graph G𝐺G. Recent work fully classified the complexity of those problems according to structural restrictions on the patterns H𝐻H. In this work, we address the more challenging task of analysing the complexity for restricted patterns and restricted hosts. Specifically we ask which families of allowed patterns and hosts imply fixed-parameter tractability, i.e., the existence of an algorithm running in time f​(H)⋅|G|O​(1)⋅𝑓𝐻superscript𝐺𝑂1f(H)\\cdot|G|^{O(1)} for some computable function f𝑓f. Our main results present exhaustive and explicit complexity classifications for families that satisfy natural closure properties. Among others, we identify the problems of counting small matchings and independent sets in subgraph-closed graph classes 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} as our central objects of study and establish the following crisp dichotomies as consequences of the Exponential Time Hypothesis: • Counting k𝑘k-matchings in a graph G∈𝒢𝐺𝒢G\\in\\mathcal{G} is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is nowhere dense. • Counting k𝑘k-independent sets in a graph G∈𝒢𝐺𝒢G\\in\\mathcal{G} is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is nowhere dense. Moreover, we obtain almost tight conditional lower bounds if 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is somewhere dense, i.e., not nowhere dense. These base cases of our classifications subsume a wide variety of previous results on the matching and independent set problem, such as counting k𝑘k-matchings in bipartite graphs (Curticapean, Marx; FOCS 14), in F𝐹F-colourable graphs (Roth, Wellnitz; SODA 20), and in degenerate graphs (Bressan, Roth; FOCS 21), as well as counting k𝑘k-independent sets in bipartite graphs (Curticapean et al.; Algorithmica 19). At the same time our proofs are much simpler: using structural characterisations of somewhere dense graphs, we show that a colourful version of a recent breakthrough technique for analysing pattern counting problems (Curticapean, Dell, Marx; STOC 17) applies to any subgraph-closed somewhere dense class of graphs, yielding a unified view of our current understanding of the complexity of subgraph counting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
