Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Supervised Learning in Event Sequences: A Comparative Study and Hybrid Approach of Generative Modeling and Contrastive Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This study investigates self-supervised learning techniques to obtain representations of Event Sequences (EvS). It is a key modality in various applications, including but not limited to banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. We perform a comprehensive study of generative and contrastive approaches in self-supervised learning, applying them both independently. We find that there is no single supreme method. Consequently, we explore the potential benefits of combining these approaches. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel method that aligns generative and contrastive embeddings as distinct modalities, drawing inspiration from contemporary multimodal research. Generative and contrastive approaches are often treated as mutually exclusive, leaving a gap for their combined exploration. Our results demonstrate that this aligned model performs at least on par with, and mostly surpasses, existing methods and is more universal across a variety of tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that self-supervised methods consistently outperform the supervised approach on our datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
