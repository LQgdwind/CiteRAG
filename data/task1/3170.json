      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty-Aware Boosted Ensembling in Multi-Modal Settings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reliability of machine learning (ML) systems is crucial in safety-critical applications such as healthcare, and uncertainty estimation is a widely researched method to highlight the confidence of ML systems in deployment. Sequential and parallel ensemble techniques have shown improved performance of ML systems in multi-modal settings by leveraging the feature sets together. We propose an uncertainty-aware boosting technique for multi-modal ensembling in order to focus on the data points with higher associated uncertainty estimates, rather than the ones with higher loss values. We evaluate this method on healthcare tasks related to Dementia and Parkinson’s disease which involve real-world multi-modal speech and text data, wherein our method shows an improved performance. Additional analysis suggests that introducing uncertainty-awareness into the boosted ensembles decreases the overall entropy of the system, making it more robust to heteroscedasticity in the data, as well as better calibrating each of the modalities along with high quality prediction intervals. We open-source our entire codebase at https://github.com/usarawgi911/Uncertainty-aware-boosting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
