Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Controllability of complex networks: input node placement restricting the longest control chain\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The minimum number of inputs needed to control a network is frequently used to quantify its controllability. Control of linear dynamics through a minimum set of inputs, however, often has prohibitively large energy requirements and there is an inherent trade-off between minimizing the number of inputs and control energy. To better understand this trade-off, we study the problem of identifying a minimum set of input nodes such that controllabililty is ensured while restricting the length of the longest control chain. The longest control chain is the maximum distance from input nodes to any network node, and recent work found that reducing its length significantly reduces control energy. We map the longest control chain-constraint minimum input problem to finding a joint maximum matching and minimum dominating set. We show that this graph combinatorial problem is NP-complete, and we introduce and validate a heuristic approximation. Applying this algorithm to a collection of real and model networks, we investigate how network structure affects the minimum number of inputs, revealing, for example, that for many real networks reducing the longest control chain requires only few or no additional inputs, only the rearrangement of the input nodes. Keywords: complex network, network control, control energy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
