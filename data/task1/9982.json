      "content": "Paper Title: On the Fine-Grained Query Complexity of Symmetric Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Watrous conjectured that the randomized and quantum query complexities of symmetric functions are polynomially equivalent, which was resolved by Ambainis and Aaronson [1], and was later improved in [17, 13]. This paper explores a fine-grained version of the Watrous conjecture, including the randomized and quantum algorithms with success probabilities arbitrarily close to 1/2121/2. Our contributions include the following: 1. An analysis of the optimal success probability of quantum and randomized query algorithms of two fundamental partial symmetric Boolean functions given a fixed number of queries. We prove that for any quantum algorithm computing these two functions using T𝑇T queries, there exist randomized algorithms using 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(T)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑇\\mathsf{poly}(T) queries that achieve the same success probability as the quantum algorithm, even if the success probability is arbitrarily close to 1/2. These two classes of functions are instrumental in analyzing general symmetric functions. 2. We establish that for any total symmetric Boolean function f𝑓f, if a quantum algorithm uses T𝑇T queries to compute f𝑓f with success probability 1/2+β12𝛽1/2+\\beta, then there exists a randomized algorithm using O​(T2)𝑂superscript𝑇2O(T^{2}) queries to compute f𝑓f with success probability 1/2+Ω​(δ​β2)12Ω𝛿superscript𝛽21/2+\\Omega\\left(\\delta\\beta^{2}\\right) on a 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta fraction of inputs, where β,δ𝛽𝛿\\beta,\\delta can be arbitrarily small positive values. As a corollary, we prove a randomized version of Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture [1] for total symmetric Boolean functions in the regime where the success probability of algorithms can be arbitrarily close to 1/2. 3. We present tight polynomial equivalences for several fundamental complexity measures of partial symmetric Boolean functions. Specifically, we first prove that for certain partial symmetric Boolean functions, quantum query complexity is at most quadratic in approximate degree for any error arbitrarily close to 1/2. Next, we show exact quantum query complexity is at most quadratic in degree. Additionally, we give the tight bounds of several complexity measures, indicating their polynomial equivalence. Conversely, we exhibit an exponential separation between randomized and exact quantum query complexity for certain partial symmetric Boolean functions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
