Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-view Geometry: Correspondences Refinement Based on Algebraic Properties\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Correspondences estimation or feature matching is a key step in the image-based 3D reconstruction problem. In this paper, we propose two algebraic properties for correspondences. The first is a rank deficient matrix construct from the correspondences of at least nine key-points on two images (two-view correspondences) and the second is also another rank deficient matrix built from the other correspondences of six key-points on at least five images (multi-view correspondences). To our knowledge, there are no theoretical results for multi-view correspondences prior to this paper. To obtain accurate correspondences, multi-view correspondences seem to be more useful than two-view correspondences. From these two algebraic properties, we propose an refinement algorithm for correspondences. This algorithm is a combination of correspondences refinement, outliers recognition and missing key-points recovery. Real experiments from the project of reconstructing Buddha statue show that the proposed refinement algorithm can reduce the average error from 77 pixels to 55 pixels on the correspondences estimation. This drop is substantial and it validates our results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
