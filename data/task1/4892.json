      "content": "Paper Title: Towards the One Learning Algorithm Hypothesis: A System-theoretic Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The existence of a universal learning architecture in human cognition is a widely spread conjecture supported by experimental findings from neuroscience. While no low-level implementation can be specified yet, an abstract outline of human perception and learning is believed to entail three basic properties: (a) hierarchical attention and processing, (b) memory-based knowledge representation, and (c) progressive learning and knowledge compaction. We approach the design of such a learning architecture from a system-theoretic viewpoint, developing a closed-loop system with three main components: (i) a multi-resolution analysis pre-processor, (ii) a group-invariant feature extractor, and (iii) a progressive knowledge-based learning module. Multi-resolution feedback loops are used for learning, i.e., for adapting the system parameters to online observations. To design (i) and (ii), we build upon the established theory of wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis and the properties of group convolution operators. Regarding (iii), we introduce a novel learning algorithm that constructs progressively growing knowledge representations in multiple resolutions. The proposed algorithm is an extension of the Online Deterministic Annealing (ODA) algorithm which can be viewed as a competitive-learning neural network where the neurons represent codevectors in the data space and the training rule is based on annealing optimization, solved using gradient-free stochastic approximation. ODA has inherent robustness and regularization properties and provides a means to progressively increase the complexity of the learning model i.e. the number of the neurons, as needed, through an intuitive bifurcation phenomenon. The proposed multi-resolution approach is hierarchical, progressive, knowledge-based, and interpretable, allowing the localization of the error-prone regions of the data space. We illustrate the properties of the proposed architecture in the context of the state-of-the-art learning algorithms and deep learning methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
