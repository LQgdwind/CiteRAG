Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: AutoAttention: Automatic Field Pair Selection for Attention in User Behavior Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In Click-through rate (CTR) prediction models, a user’s interest is usually represented as a fixed-length vector based on her history behaviors. Recently, several methods are proposed to learn an attentive weight for each user behavior and conduct weighted sum pooling. However, these methods only manually select several fields from the target item side as the query to interact with the behaviors, neglecting the other target item fields, as well as user and context fields. Directly including all these fields in the attention may introduce noise and deteriorate the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model named AutoAttention, which includes all item/user/context side fields as the query, and assigns a learnable weight for each field pair between behavior fields and query fields. Pruning on these field pairs via these learnable weights lead to automatic field pair selection, so as to identify and remove noisy field pairs. Though including more fields, the computation cost of AutoAttention is still low due to using a simple attention function and field pair selection. Extensive experiments on the public dataset and Tencent’s production dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
