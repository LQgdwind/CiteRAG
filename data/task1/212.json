Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 65 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

Let R(k)​(𝒢)superscript𝑅𝑘𝒢R^{(k)}(\\mathcal{G}) be the maximum k𝑘k-party number-on-forehead randomized communication complexity of a function in 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}.

This significantly extends the lower bounds against bipartite formulas obtained by [60]. As a corollary, we get an average-case lower bound for 𝖦𝖨𝖯nksubscriptsuperscript𝖦𝖨𝖯𝑘𝑛\\mathsf{GIP}^{k}_{n} against 𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠​[n1.99]∘𝖯𝖳𝖥k−1𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠delimited-[]superscript𝑛1.99superscript𝖯𝖳𝖥𝑘1{\\sf FORMULA}[n^{1.99}]\\circ{\\sf PTF}^{k-1}, i.e., sub-quadratic-size de Morgan formulas with degree-(k−1)𝑘1(k-1) PTF (polynomial threshold function) gates at the bottom. Previously, only sub-linear lower bounds were known [42, 63] for circuits with PTF gates. • There is a PRG of seed length n/2+O​(s⋅R(2)​(𝒢)⋅log⁡(s/ε)⋅log⁡(1/ε))𝑛2𝑂⋅⋅𝑠superscript𝑅2𝒢𝑠𝜀1𝜀n/2+O\\left(\\sqrt{s}\\cdot R^{(2)}(\\mathcal{G})\\cdot\\log(s/\\varepsilon)\\cdot\\log(1/\\varepsilon)\\right) that ε𝜀\\varepsilon-fools 𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠​[s]∘𝒢𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠delimited-[]𝑠𝒢{\\sf FORMULA}[s]\\circ\\mathcal{G}.

In particular, this provides the first non-trivial PRG (with seed length o​(n)𝑜𝑛o(n)) for intersections of n𝑛n half-spaces in the regime where ε≤1/n𝜀1𝑛\\varepsilon\\leq 1/n, complementing a recent result of [45]. • There exists a randomized 2n−tsuperscript2𝑛𝑡2^{n-t}-time ##\\#SAT algorithm for 𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠​[s]∘𝒢𝖥𝖮𝖱𝖬𝖴𝖫𝖠delimited-[]𝑠𝒢{\\sf FORMULA}[s]\\circ\\mathcal{G}, where t=Ω​(ns⋅log2⁡(s)⋅R(2)​(𝒢))1/2.𝑡Ωsuperscript𝑛⋅𝑠superscript2𝑠superscript𝑅2𝒢12t=\\Omega\\left(\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{s}\\cdot\\log^{2}(s)\\cdot R^{(2)}(\\mathcal{G})}\\right)^{1/2}.
