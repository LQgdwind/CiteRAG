If ΦΦ\\Phi is trivial on k𝑘k-vertex graphs (i.e., if ΦΦ\\Phi contains either all or no k𝑘k-vertex graphs), this problem is trivial. Otherwise we prove, among other results: • If ΦΦ\\Phi is edge-monotone (i.e., closed under deleting edges), then #​IndSub​(Φ,k)#IndSubΦ𝑘\\#\\textnormal{{IndSub}}(\\Phi,k) cannot be solved in time no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(k)} assuming ETH. This strengthens a result by Döring, Marx and Wellnitz [STOC 2024] that only ruled out an exponent of o​(log⁡k/log⁡log⁡k)𝑜𝑘𝑘o(\\sqrt{\\log k}/\\log\\log k). Our results also hold when counting modulo fixed primes. • If there is some fixed ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 such that at most (2−ε)(k2)superscript2𝜀binomial𝑘2(2-\\varepsilon)^{\\binom{k}{2}} graphs on k𝑘k vertices satisfy ΦΦ\\Phi, then #​IndSub​(Φ,k)#IndSubΦ𝑘\\#\\textnormal{{IndSub}}(\\Phi,k) cannot be solved in time no​(k/log⁡k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘𝑘n^{o(k/\\sqrt{\\log k})} assuming ETH. Our results hold even when each of the graphs in ΦΦ\\Phi may come with an arbitrary individual weight. This generalizes previous results for hereditary properties by Focke and Roth [SIAM J. Comput. 2024] up to a log⁡k𝑘\\sqrt{\\log k} factor in the exponent of the lower bound. • If ΦΦ\\Phi only depends on the number of edges, then #​IndSub​(Φ,k)#IndSubΦ𝑘\\#\\textnormal{{IndSub}}(\\Phi,k) cannot be solved in time no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(k)} assuming ETH. This improves on a lower bound by Roth, Schmitt and Wellnitz [FOCS 2020] that only ruled out an exponent of o​(k/log⁡k)𝑜𝑘𝑘o(k/\\sqrt{\\log k}). In all cases, we also obtain #W[1]-hardness if k𝑘k is part of the input and the problem is parameterized by k𝑘k. We also obtain lower bounds on the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension. Most importantly, our results follow from relatively straightforward Fourier analysis, as opposed to the nontrivial techniques from combinatorics, group theory, and simplicial topology used in previous papers. Our paper subsumes most of the known #W[1]-hardness results known in the area, often with tighter lower bounds under ETH.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
