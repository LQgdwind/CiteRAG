Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling of non-equilibrium effects in intermittency region between two phases\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper concerns modeling of the evolution of the intermittency region between two weakly miscible phases due to temporal and spatial variations of its characteristic length scale. First, the need for a more general description allowing for the evolution of the intermittency region is rationalized. Afterwards, results of the previous work (Wacławczyk T., 2017, On a relation between the volume of fluid, level-set and phase field interface models, Int. J. Multiphas. Flow, Vol. 97) are discussed in the context of sharp interface models known in the literature and new insight into droplet coalescence mechanism recently recognized in molecular dynamics studies (Perumanath S., Borg M.K., Chubynsky M.V., Sprittles J.E., Reese J.M., 2019, Droplet coalescence is initiated by thermal motion, Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 122). Finally, physical and numerical models extending the applicability of the equilibrium solution to the case when the intermittency region could also be in the non-equilibrium state are introduced and verified.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
