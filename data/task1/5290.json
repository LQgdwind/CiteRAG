Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Robust Phased Elimination Algorithm for Corruption-Tolerant Gaussian Process Bandits\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the sequential optimization of an unknown, continuous, and expensive to evaluate reward function, from noisy and adversarially corrupted observed rewards. When the corruption attacks are subject to a suitable budget Cùê∂C and the function lives in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), the problem can be posed as corrupted Gaussian process (GP) bandit optimization. We propose a novel robust elimination-type algorithm that runs in epochs, combines exploration with infrequent switching to select a small subset of actions, and plays each action for multiple time instants. Our algorithm, Robust GP Phased Elimination (RGP-PE), successfully balances robustness to corruptions with exploration and exploitation such that its performance degrades minimally in the presence (or absence) of adversarial corruptions. When TùëáT is the number of samples and Œ≥Tsubscriptùõæùëá\\gamma_{T} is the maximal information gain, the corruption-dependent term in our regret bound is O‚Äã(C‚ÄãŒ≥T3/2)ùëÇùê∂superscriptsubscriptùõæùëá32O(C\\gamma_{T}^{3/2}), which is significantly tighter than the existing O‚Äã(C‚ÄãT‚ÄãŒ≥T)ùëÇùê∂ùëásubscriptùõæùëáO(C\\sqrt{T\\gamma_{T}}) for several commonly-considered kernels. We perform the first empirical study of robustness in the corrupted GP bandit setting, and show that our algorithm is robust against a variety of adversarial attacks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
