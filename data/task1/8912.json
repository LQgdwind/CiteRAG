      "content": "Paper Title: Sim-Suction: Learning a Suction Grasp Policy for Cluttered Environments Using a Synthetic Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents Sim-Suction, a robust object-aware suction grasp policy for mobile manipulation platforms with dynamic camera viewpoints, designed to pick up unknown objects from cluttered environments. Suction grasp policies typically employ data-driven approaches, necessitating large-scale, accurately-annotated suction grasp datasets. However, the generation of suction grasp datasets in cluttered environments remains underexplored, leaving uncertainties about the relationship between the object of interest and its surroundings. To address this, we propose a benchmark synthetic dataset, Sim-Suction-Dataset, comprising 500 cluttered environments with 3.2 million annotated suction grasp poses. The efficient Sim-Suction-Dataset generation process provides novel insights by combining analytical models with dynamic physical simulations to create fast and accurate suction grasp pose annotations. We introduce Sim-Suction-Pointnet to generate robust 6D suction grasp poses by learning point-wise affordances from the Sim-Suction-Dataset, leveraging the synergy of zero-shot text-to-segmentation. Real-world experiments for picking up all objects demonstrate that Sim-Suction-Pointnet achieves success rates of 96.76%, 94.23%, and 92.39% on cluttered level 1 objects (prismatic shape), cluttered level 2 objects (more complex geometry), and cluttered mixed objects, respectively. The codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/junchengli1/Sim-Suction-API.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
