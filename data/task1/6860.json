Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: LCRL: Certified Policy Synthesis via Logically-Constrained Reinforcement LearningThis work is in part supported by the HiClass project (113213), a partnership between the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Innovate UK.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract LCRL is a software tool that implements model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms over unknown Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), synthesising policies that satisfy a given linear temporal specification with maximal probability. LCRL leverages partially deterministic finite-state machines known as Limit Deterministic B√ºchi Automata (LDBA) to express a given linear temporal specification. A reward function for the RL algorithm is shaped on-the-fly, based on the structure of the LDBA. Theoretical guarantees under proper assumptions ensure the convergence of the RL algorithm to an optimal policy that maximises the satisfaction probability. We present case studies to demonstrate the applicability, ease of use, scalability and performance of LCRL . Owing to the LDBA-guided exploration and LCRL model-free architecture, we observe robust performance, which also scales well when compared to standard RL approaches (whenever applicable to LTL specifications). Full instructions on how to execute all the case studies in this paper are provided on a GitHub page that accompanies the LCRL distribution www.github.com/grockious/lcrl.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
