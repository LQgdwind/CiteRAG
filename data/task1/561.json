Typically, gradient-based techniques combined with continuation in model parameters are used to promote convergence to more optimal solutions; however, these methods can fail even in the simplest cases. In this paper, we present an algorithm to perform a systematic exploratory search for the solutions of the optimization problem via second-order methods without a good initial guess. The algorithm combines the techniques of deflation, barrier methods and primal-dual active set solvers in a novel way. We demonstrate this approach on several numerical examples, observe mesh-independence in certain cases and show that multiple distinct local minima can be recovered.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 64 most likely reference titles for this paper.
