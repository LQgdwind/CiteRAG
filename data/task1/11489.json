Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quasi-Linear Size PCPs with Small Soundness from HDX\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We construct 2-query, quasi-linear sized probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) with arbitrarily small constant soundness, improving upon Dinur‚Äôs 2-query quasi-linear size PCPs with soundness 1‚àíŒ©‚Äã(1)1Œ©11-\\Omega(1). As an immediate corollary, we get that under the exponential time hypothesis, for all Œµ>0ùúÄ0{\\varepsilon}>0 no approximation algorithm for 333-SAT can obtain an approximation ratio of 7/8+Œµ78ùúÄ7/8+{\\varepsilon} in time 2n/logC‚Å°nsuperscript2ùëõsuperscriptùê∂ùëõ2^{n/\\log^{C}n}, where Cùê∂C is a constant depending on ŒµùúÄ{\\varepsilon}. Our result builds on a recent line of works showing the existence of linear sized direct product testers with small soundness [BM24, DD24a, BLM24, DD24b, DDL24]. The main new ingredient in our proof is a technique that embeds a given PCP construction into a PCP on a prescribed graph, provided that the latter is a graph underlying a sufficiently good high-dimensional expander. Towards this end, we use ideas from fault-tolerant distributed computing, and more precisely from the literature of the almost everywhere agreement problem [DPPU86, Upf92, CGO10, CGO12, JRV20]. We show that graphs underlying HDXs admit routing protocols that are tolerant to adversarial edge corruptions, and in doing so we also improve the state of the art in this line of work. Our PCP construction requires variants of the aforementioned direct product testers with poly-logarithmic degree. The existence and constructability of these variants is shown in an appendix by Zhiwei Yun.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
