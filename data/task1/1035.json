Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Preventing Value Function Collapse in Ensemble Q-Learning by Maximizing Representation Diversity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The classic DQN algorithm is limited by the overestimation bias of the learned Q-function. Subsequent algorithms have proposed techniques to reduce this problem, without fully eliminating it. Recently, the Maxmin and Ensemble Q-learning algorithms have used different estimates provided by the ensembles of learners to reduce the overestimation bias. Unfortunately, these learners can converge to the same point in the parametric or representation space, falling back to the classic single neural network DQN. In this paper, we describe a regularization technique to maximize ensemble diversity in these algorithms. We propose and compare five regularization functions inspired from economics theory and consensus optimization. We show that the regularized approach significantly outperforms the Maxmin and Ensemble Q-learning algorithms as well as non-ensemble baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
