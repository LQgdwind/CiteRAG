Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Classifier Combination Approach for Question Classification for Bengali Question Answering System\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Question classification (QC) is a prime constituent of automated question answering system. The work presented here demonstrates that the combination of multiple models achieve better classification performance than those obtained with existing individual models for the question classification task in Bengali. We have exploited state-of-the-art multiple model combination techniques, i.e., ensemble, stacking and voting, to increase QC accuracy. Lexical, syntactic and semantic features of Bengali questions are used for four well-known classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, kernel Naïve Bayes, Rule Induction, and Decision Tree, which serve as our base learners. Single-layer question-class taxonomy with 8 coarse-grained classes is extended to two-layer taxonomy by adding 69 fine-grained classes. We carried out the experiments both on single-layer and two-layer taxonomies. Experimental results confirmed that classifier combination approaches outperform single classifier classification approaches by 4.02% for coarse-grained question classes. Overall, the stacking approach produces the best results for fine-grained classification and achieves 87.79% of accuracy. The approach presented here could be used in other Indo-Aryan or Indic languages to develop a question answering system.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
