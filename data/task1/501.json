Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-Shot Compositional Policy Learning via Language Grounding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Despite recent breakthroughs in reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), existing algorithms fail to generalize beyond the training environments. In reality, humans can adapt to new tasks quickly by leveraging prior knowledge about the world such as language descriptions. To facilitate the research on language-guided agents with domain adaption, we propose a novel zero-shot compositional policy learning task, where the environments are characterized as a composition of different attributes. Since there are no public environments supporting this study, we introduce a new research platform BabyAI++ in which the dynamics of environments are disentangled from visual appearance. At each episode, BabyAI++ provides varied vision-dynamics combinations along with corresponding descriptive texts. To evaluate the adaption capability of learned agents, a set of vision-dynamics pairings are held-out for testing on BabyAI++. Unsurprisingly, we find that current language-guided RL/IL techniques overfit to the training environments and suffer from a huge performance drop when facing unseen combinations. In response, we propose a multi-modal fusion method with an attention mechanism to perform visual language-grounding. Extensive experiments show strong evidence that language grounding is able to improve the generalization of agents across environments with varied dynamics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
