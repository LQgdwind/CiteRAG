Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Placement and Migration Policies for an STT-RAM based Hybrid L1 Cache for Intermittently Powered Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The number of battery-powered devices is rapidly increasing due to the widespread use of IoT-enabled nodes in various fields. Energy harvesters, which help to power embedded devices, are a feasible alternative to replacing battery-powered devices. In a capacitor, the energy harvester stores enough energy to power up the embedded device and compute the task. This type of computation is referred to as intermittent computing. Energy harvesters are unable to supply continuous power to embedded devices. All registers and cache in conventional processors are volatile. We require a Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)-based Non-Volatile Processor (NVP) that can store registers and cache contents during a power failure. NVM-based caches reduce system performance and consume more energy than SRAM-based caches. This paper proposes Efficient Placement and Migration policies for hybrid cache architecture that uses SRAM and STT-RAM at the first level cache. The proposed architecture includes cache block placement and migration policies to reduce the number of writes to STT-RAM. During a power failure, the backup strategy identifies and migrates the critical blocks from SRAM to STT-RAM. When compared to the baseline architecture, the proposed architecture reduces STT-RAM writes from 63.35% to 35.93%, resulting in a 32.85% performance gain and a 23.42% reduction in energy consumption. Our backup strategy reduces backup time by 34.46% when compared to the baseline.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
