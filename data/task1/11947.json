      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion-based Generative Multicasting with Intent-aware Semantic Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal to multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. The transmitter then sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, i.e. non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. This improves utilization of the wireless resources, with better preserving privacy of the non-intended classes. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the usersâ€™ reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users. For a typical setup of multicasting street scene images to 10 users, our proposed framework achieves a 15.4%percent15.415.4\\% reduction in per-user latency at a fixed power budget, or equivalently 50%percent5050\\% reduction in the transmission power required to achieve a fixed per-user latency, compared with non-generative multicasting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
