Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mechanism design with multi-armed bandit\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A popular approach of automated mechanism design is to formulate a linear program (LP) whose solution gives a mechanism with desired properties. We analytically derive a class of optimal solutions for such an LP that gives mechanisms achieving standard properties of efficiency, incentive compatibility, strong budget balance (SBB), and individual rationality (IR), where SBB and IR are satisfied in expectation. Notably, our solutions are represented by an exponentially smaller number of essential variables than the original variables of LP. Our solutions, however, involve a term whose exact evaluation requires solving a certain optimization problem exponentially many times as the number of players, NN, grows. We thus evaluate this term by modeling it as the problem of estimating the mean reward of the best arm in multi-armed bandit (MAB), propose a Probably and Approximately Correct estimator, and prove its asymptotic optimality by establishing a lower bound on its sample complexity. This MAB approach reduces the number of times the optimization problem is solved from exponential to O​(N​log⁡N)O(N\\,\\log N). Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach finds mechanisms that are guaranteed to achieve desired properties with high probability for environments with up to 128 players, which substantially improves upon the prior work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
