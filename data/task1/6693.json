      "content": "Paper Title: SIM2E: Benchmarking the Group Equivariant Capability of Correspondence Matching Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Correspondence matching is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics applications. Solving correspondence matching problems using neural networks has been on the rise recently. Rotation-equivariance and scale-equivariance are both critical in correspondence matching applications. Classical correspondence matching approaches are designed to withstand scaling and rotation transformations. However, the features extracted using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are only translation-equivariant to a certain extent. Recently, researchers have strived to improve the rotation-equivariance of CNNs based on group theories. Sim(2) is the group of similarity transformations in the 2D plane. This paper presents a specialized dataset dedicated to evaluating sim(2)-equivariant correspondence matching algorithms. We compare the performance of 16 state-of-the-art (SoTA) correspondence matching approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the importance of group equivariant algorithms for correspondence matching on various sim(2) transformation conditions. Since the subpixel accuracy achieved by CNN-based correspondence matching approaches is unsatisfactory, this specific area requires more attention in future works. Our dataset is publicly available at: \\hrefhttps://mias.group/SIM2E/mias.group/SIM2E.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
