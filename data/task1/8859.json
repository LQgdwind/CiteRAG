Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Discovery of Continuous Skills on a Sphere\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, methods for learning diverse skills to generate various behaviors without external rewards have been actively studied as a form of unsupervised reinforcement learning. However, most of the existing methods learn a finite number of discrete skills, and thus the variety of behaviors that can be exhibited with the learned skills is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning potentially an infinite number of different skills, which is named discovery of continuous skills on a sphere (DISCS). In DISCS, skills are learned by maximizing mutual information between skills and states, and each skill corresponds to a continuous value on a sphere. Because the representations of skills in DISCS are continuous, infinitely diverse skills could be learned. We examine existing methods and DISCS in the MuJoCo Ant robot control environments and show that DISCS can learn much more diverse skills than the other methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
