Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Transductive Learning for Abstractive News Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Pre-trained and fine-tuned news summarizers are expected to generalize to news articles unseen in the fine-tuning (training) phase. However, these articles often contain specifics, such as new events and people, a summarizer could not learn about in training. This applies to scenarios such as a news publisher training a summarizer on dated news and summarizing incoming recent news. In this work, we explore the first application of transductive learning to summarization where we further fine-tune models on test set inputs. Specifically, we construct pseudo summaries from salient article sentences and input randomly masked articles. Moreover, this approach is also beneficial in the fine-tuning phase, where we jointly predict extractive pseudo references and abstractive gold summaries in the training set. We show that our approach yields state-of-the-art results on CNN/DM and NYT datasets, improving ROUGE-L by 1.05 and 0.74, respectively. Importantly, our approach does not require any changes of the original architecture. Moreover, we show the benefits of transduction from dated to more recent CNN news. Finally, through human and automatic evaluation, we demonstrate improvements in summary abstractiveness and coherence.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
