Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Balancing Average and Worst-case Accuracy in Multitask Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract When training and evaluating machine learning models on a large number of tasks, it is important to not only look at average task accuracy—which may be biased by easy or redundant tasks—but also worst-case accuracy (i.e. the performance on the task with the lowest accuracy). In this work, we show how to use techniques from the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) literature to improve worst-case performance in multitask learning. We highlight several failure cases of DRO when applied off-the-shelf and present an improved method, Lookahead-DRO (L-DRO), which mitigates these issues. The core idea of L-DRO is to anticipate the interaction between tasks during training in order to choose a dynamic re-weighting of the various task losses, which will (i) lead to minimal worst-case loss and (ii) train on as many tasks as possible. After demonstrating the efficacy of L-DRO on a small controlled synthetic setting, we evaluate it on two realistic benchmarks: a multitask version of the CIFAR-100 image classification dataset and a large-scale multilingual language modeling experiment. Our empirical results show that L-DRO achieves a better trade-off between average and worst-case accuracy with little computational overhead compared to several strong baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
