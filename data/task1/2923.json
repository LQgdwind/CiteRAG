Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: You Can Do Better! If You Elaborate the Reason When Making Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neural predictive models have achieved remarkable performance improvements in various natural language processing tasks. However, most neural predictive models suffer from the lack of explainability of predictions, limiting their practical utility. This paper proposes a neural predictive approach to make a prediction and generate its corresponding explanation simultaneously. It leverages the knowledge entailed in explanations as an additional distillation signal for more efficient learning. We conduct a preliminary study on Chinese medical multiple-choice question answering, English natural language inference and commonsense question answering tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can generate reasonable explanations for its predictions even with a small-scale training corpus. The proposed method also achieves improved prediction accuracy on three datasets, which indicates that making predictions can benefit from generating the explanation in the decision process.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
