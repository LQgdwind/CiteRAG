      "content": "Paper Title: SBPF: Sensitiveness Based Pruning Framework For Convolutional Neural Network On Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Pruning techniques are used comprehensively to compress convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image classification. However, the majority of pruning methods require a well pre-trained model to provide useful supporting parameters, such as ùíû1subscriptùíû1\\mathscr{C}_{1}-norm, BatchNorm value and gradient information, which may lead to inconsistency of filter evaluation if the parameters of the pre-trained model are not well optimized. Therefore, we propose a sensitiveness based method to evaluate the importance of each layer from the perspective of inference accuracy by adding extra damage for the original model. Because the performance of the accuracy is determined by the distribution of parameters across all layers rather than individual parameter, the sensitiveness based method will be robust to update of parameters. Namely, we can obtain similar importance evaluation of each convolutional layer between the imperfect-trained and fully trained models. For VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, even when the original model is only trained with 50 epochs, we can get same evaluation of layer importance as the results when the model is trained fully. Then we will remove filters proportional from each layer by the quantified sensitiveness. Our sensitiveness based pruning framework is verified efficiently on VGG-16, a customized Conv-4 and ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10, MNIST and CIFAR-100, respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
