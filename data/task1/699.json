      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Predictive Coding Models in a Deep-Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bayesian predictive coding is a putative neuromorphic method for acquiring higher-level neural representations to account for sensory input. Although originating in the neuroscience community, there are also efforts in the machine learning community to study these models. This paper reviews some of the more well known models. Our review analyzes module connectivity and patterns of information transfer, seeking to find general principles used across the models. We also survey some recent attempts to cast these models within a deep learning framework. A defining feature of Bayesian predictive coding is that it uses top-down, reconstructive mechanisms to predict incoming sensory inputs or their lower-level representations. Discrepancies between the predicted and the actual inputs, known as prediction errors, then give rise to future learning that refines and improves the predictive accuracy of learned higher-level representations. Predictive coding models intended to describe computations in the neocortex emerged prior to the development of deep learning and used a communication structure between modules that we name the Rao-Ballard protocol. This protocol was derived from a Bayesian generative model with some rather strong statistical assumptions. The RB protocol provides a rubric to assess the fidelity of deep learning models that claim to implement predictive coding. Here, we consider the implementation of this protocol within convenient deep learning frameworks that are robust to less restrictive statistical assumptions. We employ deep learning examples to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of predictive learning. Although neurally inspired in a historical sense, modern deep learning frameworks can be used at an intermediate modeling level that is agnostic to specific claims about biologically based neural representations. The intent is to make the classical models easier to study and more versatile and comprehensive while retaining their core properties.
