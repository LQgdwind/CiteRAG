      "content": "Paper Title: Detection of Dense Subhypergraphs by Low-Degree Polynomials\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Detection of a planted dense subgraph in a random graph is a fundamental statistical and computational problem that has been extensively studied in recent years. We study a hypergraph version of the problem. Let Gr​(n,p)superscript𝐺𝑟𝑛𝑝G^{r}(n,p) denote the r𝑟r-uniform Erdős-Rényi hypergraph model with n𝑛n vertices and edge density p𝑝p. We consider detecting the presence of a planted Gr​(nγ,n−α)superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑛𝛾superscript𝑛𝛼G^{r}(n^{\\gamma},n^{-\\alpha}) subhypergraph in a Gr​(n,n−β)superscript𝐺𝑟𝑛superscript𝑛𝛽G^{r}(n,n^{-\\beta}) hypergraph, where 0<α<β<r−10𝛼𝛽𝑟10<\\alpha<\\beta<r-1 and 0<γ<10𝛾10<\\gamma<1. Focusing on tests that are degree-no​(1)superscript𝑛𝑜1n^{o(1)} polynomials of the entries of the adjacency tensor, we determine the threshold between the easy and hard regimes for the detection problem. More precisely, for 0<γ<1/20𝛾120<\\gamma<1/2, the threshold is given by α=β​γ𝛼𝛽𝛾\\alpha=\\beta\\gamma, and for 1/2≤γ<112𝛾11/2\\leq\\gamma<1, the threshold is given by α=β/2+r​(γ−1/2)𝛼𝛽2𝑟𝛾12\\alpha=\\beta/2+r(\\gamma-1/2). Our results are already new in the graph case r=2𝑟2r=2, as we consider the subtle log-density regime where hardness based on average-case reductions is not known. Our proof of low-degree hardness is based on a conditional variant of the standard low-degree likelihood calculation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
