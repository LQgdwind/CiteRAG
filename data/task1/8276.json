Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: IMF: Interactive Multimodal Fusion Model for Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Link prediction aims to identify potential missing triples in knowledge graphs. To get better results, some recent studies have introduced multimodal information to link prediction. However, these methods utilize multimodal information separately and neglect the complicated interaction between different modalities. In this paper, we aim at better modeling the inter-modality information and thus introduce a novel Interactive Multimodal Fusion (IMF) model to integrate knowledge from different modalities. To this end, we propose a two-stage multimodal fusion framework to preserve modality-specific knowledge as well as take advantage of the complementarity between different modalities. Instead of directly projecting different modalities into a unified space, our multimodal fusion module limits the representations of different modalities independent while leverages bilinear pooling for fusion and incorporates contrastive learning as additional constraints. Furthermore, the decision fusion module delivers the learned weighted average over the predictions of all modalities to better incorporate the complementarity of different modalities. Our approach has been demonstrated to be effective through empirical evaluations on several real-world datasets. The implementation code is available online at https://github.com/HestiaSky/IMF-Pytorch.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
