Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Anomaly Detection with Test Time Augmentation and Consistency Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to unseen data: they may wrongly assign high confidence scores to out-distribution samples. Recent works try to solve the problem using representation learning methods and specific metrics. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective post-hoc anomaly detection algorithm named Test Time Augmentation Anomaly Detection (TTA-AD), inspired by a novel observation. Specifically, we observe that in-distribution data enjoy more consistent predictions for its original and augmented versions on a trained network than out-distribution data, which separates in-distribution and out-distribution samples. Experiments on various high-resolution image benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTA-AD achieves comparable or better detection performance under dataset-vs-dataset anomaly detection settings with a 60%âˆ¼90%similar-topercent60percent9060\\%\\sim 90\\% running time reduction of existing classifier-based algorithms. We provide empirical verification that the key to TTA-AD lies in the remaining classes between augmented features, which has long been partially ignored by previous works. Additionally, we use RUNS as a surrogate to analyze our algorithm theoretically.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
