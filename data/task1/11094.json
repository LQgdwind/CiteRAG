Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Density of group languages in shift spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We study the density of group languages (i.e. rational languages recognized by morphisms onto finite groups) inside shift spaces. The density of a rational language can be understood as the frequency of some ‚Äúpattern‚Äù in the shift space, for example a pattern like ‚Äúwords with an even number of a given letter.‚Äù In this paper, we handle density of group languages via ergodicity of skew products between the shift space and the recognizing group. We consider both the cases of shifts of finite type (with a suitable notion of irreducibility), and of minimal shifts. In the latter case, our main result is a closed formula for the density which holds whenever the skew product has minimal closed invariant subsets which are ergodic under the product of the original measure and the uniform probability measure on the group. The formula is derived in part from a characterization of minimal closed invariant subsets for skew products relying on notions of cocycles and coboundaries. In the case where the whole skew product itself is ergodic under the product measure, then the density is completely determined by the cardinality of the image of the language inside the recognizing group. We provide sufficient conditions for the skew product to have minimal closed invariant subsets that are ergodic under the product measure. Finally, we investigate the link between minimal closed invariant subsets, return words and bifix codes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
