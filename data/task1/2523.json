      "content": "Paper Title: Propagation and reconstruction of re-entry uncertainties using continuity equation and simplicial interpolationfootnote footnotePresented as paper AAS 19-409 at the 29th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting, Ka’anapali, HI, 13-17 January 2019\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work proposes a continuum-based approach for the propagation of uncertainties in the initial conditions and parameters for the analysis and prediction of spacecraft re-entries. Using the continuity equation together with the re-entry dynamics, the joint probability distribution of the uncertainties is propagated in time for specific sampled points. At each time instant, the joint probability distribution function is then reconstructed from the scattered data using a gradient-enhanced linear interpolation based on a simplicial representation of the state space. Uncertainties in the initial conditions at re-entry and in the ballistic coefficient for three representative test cases are considered: a three-state and a six-state steep Earth re-entry and a six-state unguided lifting entry at Mars. The paper shows the comparison of the proposed method with Monte Carlo based techniques in terms of quality of the obtained marginal distributions and runtime as a function of the number of samples used.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
