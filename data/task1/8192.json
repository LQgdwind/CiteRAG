Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 63 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Morpho-logic from a Topos Perspective: Application to symbolic AI\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Modal logics have proved useful for many reasoning tasks in symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), such as belief revision, spatial reasoning, among others. On the other hand, mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory for non-linear analysis of structures, that was widely developed and applied in image analysis. Its mathematical bases rely on algebra, complete lattices, topology. Strong links have been established between MM and mathematical logics, mostly modal logics. In this paper, we propose to further develop and generalize this link between mathematical morphology and modal logic from a topos perspective, i.e. categorial structures generalizing space, and connecting logics, sets and topology. Furthermore, we rely on the internal language and logic of topos. We define structuring elements, dilations and erosions as morphisms. Then we introduce the notion of structuring neighborhoods, and show that the dilations and erosions based on them lead to a constructive modal logic, for which a sound and complete proof system is proposed. We then show that the modal logic thus defined (called morpho-logic here), is well adapted to define concrete and efficient operators for revision, merging, and abduction of new knowledge, or even spatial reasoning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
