Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: High Bandwidth Memory on FPGAs: A Data Analytics Perspective Kaan Kara12, Christoph Hagleitner2, Dionysios Diamantopoulos2, Dimitris Syrivelis2, Gustavo Alonso1\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract FPGA-based data processing in datacenters is increasing in popularity due to the demands of modern workloads and the ensuing necessity for specialization in hardware. Driven by this trend, vendors are rapidly adapting reconfigurable devices to suit data and compute intensive workloads. Inclusion of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) in FPGA devices is a recent example. HBM promises overcoming the bandwidth bottleneck, faced often by FPGA-based accelerators due to their throughput oriented design. In this paper, we study the usage and benefits of HBM on FPGAs from a data analytics perspective. We consider three workloads that are often performed in analytics oriented databases and implement them on FPGA showing in which cases they benefit from HBM: range selection, hash join, and stochastic gradient descent for linear model training. We integrate our designs into a columnar database (MonetDB) and show the trade-offs arising from the integration related to data movement and partitioning. In certain cases, FPGA+HBM based solutions are able to surpass the highest performance provided by either a 2-socket POWER9 system or a 14-core XeonE5 by up to 1.8x (selection), 12.9x (join), and 3.2x (SGD).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
