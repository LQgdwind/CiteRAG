Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial VQA: A New Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of VQA Models adversarialvqa.github.io\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Benefiting from large-scale pre-training, we have witnessed significant performance boost on the popular Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Despite rapid progress, it remains unclear whether these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models are robust when encountering examples in the wild. To study this, we introduce Adversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Through this new benchmark, we discover several interesting findings. (iùëñi) Surprisingly, we find that during dataset collection, non-expert annotators can easily attack SOTA VQA models successfully. (i‚Äãiùëñùëñii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training methods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard VQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the effectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii) When used for data augmentation, our dataset can effectively boost model performance on other robust VQA benchmarks. We hope our Adversarial VQA dataset can shed new light on robustness study in the community and serve as a valuable benchmark for future work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
