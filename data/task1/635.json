Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Language Model Prior for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The scarcity of large parallel corpora is an important obstacle for neural machine translation. A common solution is to exploit the knowledge of language models (lm) trained on abundant monolingual data. In this work, we propose a novel approach to incorporate a lm as prior in a neural translation model (tm). Specifically, we add a regularization term, which pushes the output distributions of the tm to be probable under the lm prior, while avoiding wrong predictions when the tm “disagrees” with the lm. This objective relates to knowledge distillation, where the lm can be viewed as teaching the tm about the target language. The proposed approach does not compromise decoding speed, because the lm is used only at training time, unlike previous work that requires it during inference. We present an analysis on the effects that different methods have on the distributions of the tm. Results on two low-resource machine translation datasets show clear improvements even with limited monolingual data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
