Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: DisCo: Remedy Self-supervised Learning on Lightweight Models with Distilled Contrastive Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While Self-Supervised representation Learning (SSL) has received widespread attention from the community, recent researches argue that its performance will suffer a cliff fall when the model size decreases. Since current SSL methods mainly rely on contrastive learning to train the network, in this work, we propose a simple yet effective method termed Distilled Contrastive Learning (DisCo) to ease the issue. Specifically, we find the final inherent embedding of the mainstream SSL methods contains the most fruitful information, and propose to distill the final embedding to maximally transmit a teacherâ€™s knowledge to a lightweight model by constraining the last embedding of the student to be consistent with that of the teacher. In addition, we find that there exists a phenomenon termed Distilling BottleNeck and propose to enlarge the embedding dimension to alleviate this problem. Since the MLP only exists during the SSL phase, our method does not introduce any extra parameter to lightweight models during the downstream task deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on all lightweight models by a large margin. Particularly, when ResNet-101/ResNet-50 is used respectively as a teacher to teach EfficientNet-B0, the linear result of EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet is improved by 22.1% and 19.7% respectively, which is very close to ResNet-101/ResNet-50 with much fewer parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/Yuting-Gao/DisCo-pytorch.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
