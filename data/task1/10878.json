Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Introducing User Feedback-based Counterfactual Explanations (UFCE)This is a preprint of a paper submitted to International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Machine learning models are widely used in real-world applications. However, their complexity makes it often challenging to interpret the rationale behind their decisions. Counterfactual explanations (CEs) have emerged as a viable solution for generating comprehensible explanations in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). CE provides actionable information to users on how to achieve the desired outcome with minimal modifications to the input. However, current CE algorithms usually operate within the entire feature space when optimizing changes to turn over an undesired outcome, overlooking the identification of key contributors to the outcome and disregarding the practicality of the suggested changes. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology, that is named as user feedback-based counterfactual explanation (UFCE), which addresses these limitations and aims to bolster confidence in the provided explanations. UFCE allows for the inclusion of user constraints to determine the smallest modifications in the subset of actionable features while considering feature dependence, and evaluates the practicality of suggested changes using benchmark evaluation metrics. We conducted three experiments with five datasets, demonstrating that UFCE outperforms two well-known CE methods in terms of proximity, sparsity, and feasibility. Reported results indicate that user constraints influence the generation of feasible CEs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
