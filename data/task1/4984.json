Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cold Item Integration in Deep Hybrid Recommenders via Tunable Stochastic Gates\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A major challenge in collaborative filtering methods is how to produce recommendations for cold items (items with no ratings), or integrate cold item into an existing catalog. Over the years, a variety of hybrid recommendation models have been proposed to address this problem by utilizing items’ metadata and content along with their ratings or usage patterns. In this work, we wish to revisit the cold start problem in order to draw attention to an overlooked challenge: the ability to integrate and balance between (regular) warm items and completely cold items. In this case, two different challenges arise: (1) preserving high quality performance on warm items, while (2) learning to promote cold items to relevant users. First, we show that these two objectives are in fact conflicting, and the balance between them depends on the business needs and the application at hand. Next, we propose a novel hybrid recommendation algorithm that bridges these two conflicting objectives and enables a harmonized balance between preserving high accuracy for warm items while effectively promoting completely cold items. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on movies, apps, and articles recommendations, and provide an empirical analysis of the cold-warm trade-off.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
