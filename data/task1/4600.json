Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: High-Speed VLSI Architectures for Modular Polynomial Multiplication via Fast Filtering and Applications to Lattice-Based Cryptography\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents a low-latency hardware accelerator for modular polynomial multiplication for lattice-based post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption applications. The proposed novel modular polynomial multiplier exploits the fast finite impulse response (FIR) filter architecture to reduce the computational complexity of the schoolbook modular polynomial multiplication. We also extend this structure to fast MùëÄM-parallel architectures while achieving low-latency, high-speed, and full hardware utilization. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed architectures under various polynomial settings as well as in the Saber scheme for post-quantum cryptography as a case study. The experimental results show that our proposed modular polynomial multiplier reduces the computation time and area-time product, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art designs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
