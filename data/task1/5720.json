Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mix-and-Match: Scalable Dialog Response Retrieval using Gaussian Mixture Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Embedding-based approaches for dialog response retrieval embed the context-response pairs as points in the embedding space. These approaches are scalable, but fail to account for the complex, man-to-many relationships that exist between context-response pairs. On the other end of the spectrum, there are approaches that feed the context-response pairs jointly through multiple layers of neural networks. These approaches can model the complex relationships between context-response pairs, but fail to scale when the set of responses is moderately large (¿100). In this paper, we combine the best of both worlds by proposing a scalable model that can learn complex relationships between context-response pairs. Specifically, the model maps the contexts as well as responses to probability distributions over the embedding space. We train the models by optimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions induced by context-response pairs in the training data. We show that the resultant model achieves better performance as compared to other embedding-based approaches on publicly available conversation data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
