Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Is Simple Uniform Sampling Effective for Center-Based Clustering with Outliers: When and Why?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Real-world datasets often contain outliers, and the presence of outliers can make the clustering problems to be much more challenging. In this paper, we propose a simple uniform sampling framework for solving several representative center-based clustering with outliers problems: kùëòk-center/median/means clustering with outliers. Our analysis is fundamentally different from the previous (uniform and non-uniform) sampling based ideas. To explain the effectiveness of uniform sampling in theory, we introduce a measure of ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù and prove that the performance of our framework depends on the significance degree of the given instance. In particular, the sample size can be independent of the input data size nùëõn and the dimensionality dùëëd, if we assume the given instance is ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù, which is in fact a reasonable assumption in practice. Due to its simplicity, the uniform sampling approach also enjoys several significant advantages over the non-uniform sampling approaches in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically studies the effectiveness of uniform sampling from both theoretical and experimental aspects.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
