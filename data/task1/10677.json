Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: InSaAF: Incorporating Safety through Accuracy and Fairness Are LLMs ready for the Indian Legal Domain?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advancements in language technology and Artificial Intelligence have resulted in numerous Language Models being proposed to perform various tasks in the legal domain ranging from predicting judgments to generating summaries. Despite their immense potential, these models have been proven to learn and exhibit societal biases and make unfair predictions. In this study, we explore the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform legal tasks in the Indian landscape when social factors are involved. We present a novel metric, Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta-weighted Legal Safety Score (L‚ÄãS‚ÄãSŒ≤ùêøùëÜsubscriptùëÜùõΩLSS_{\\beta}), which encapsulates both the fairness and accuracy aspects of the LLM. We assess LLMs‚Äô safety by considering its performance in the Binary Statutory Reasoning task and its fairness exhibition with respect to various axes of disparities in the Indian society. Task performance and fairness scores of LLaMA and LLaMA‚Äì2 models indicate that the proposed L‚ÄãS‚ÄãSŒ≤ùêøùëÜsubscriptùëÜùõΩLSS_{\\beta} metric can effectively determine the readiness of a model for safe usage in the legal sector. We also propose finetuning pipelines, utilising specialised legal datasets, as a potential method to mitigate bias and improve model safety. The finetuning procedures on LLaMA and LLaMA‚Äì2 models increase the L‚ÄãS‚ÄãSŒ≤ùêøùëÜsubscriptùëÜùõΩLSS_{\\beta}, improving their usability in the Indian legal domain. Our code is publicly released 111https://anonymous.4open.science/r/InSaAF-221F/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
