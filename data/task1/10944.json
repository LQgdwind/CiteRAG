Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 42 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mars 2.0: A Toolchain for Modeling, Analysis, Verification and Code Generation of Cyber-Physical Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We introduce Mars 2.0 for modeling, analysis, verification and code generation of Cyber-Physical Systems. Mars 2.0 integrates Mars 1.0 with several important extensions and improvements, allowing the design of cyber-physical systems using the combination of AADL and Simulink/Stateflow (AADL⊕S/Sdirect-sumAADLS/S\\textsf{AADL}\\!\\oplus\\!\\textsf{S/S}), which provide a unified graphical framework for modeling the functionality, physicality and architecture of the system to be developed. For a safety-critical system, formal analysis and verification of its combined AADL⊕S/Sdirect-sumAADLS/S\\textsf{AADL}\\!\\oplus\\!\\textsf{S/S} model can be conducted via the following steps. First, the toolchain automatically translates AADL⊕S/Sdirect-sumAADLS/S\\textsf{AADL}\\!\\oplus\\!\\textsf{S/S} models into Hybrid CSP (HCSP), an extension of CSP for formally modeling hybrid systems. Second, the HCSP processes can be simulated using the HCSP simulator, and to complement incomplete simulation, they can be verified using the Hybrid Hoare Logic prover in Isabelle/HOL, as well as the more automated HHLPy prover. Finally, implementations in SystemC or C can be automatically generated from the verified HCSP processes. The transformation from AADL⊕S/Sdirect-sumAADLS/S\\textsf{AADL}\\!\\oplus\\!\\textsf{S/S} to HCSP, and the one from HCSP to SystemC or C, are both guaranteed to be correct with formal proofs. This approach allows model-driven design of safety-critical cyber-physical systems based on graphical and formal models and proven-correct translation procedures. We demonstrate the use of the toolchain on several benchmarks of varying complexity, including several industrial-sized examples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 42 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
