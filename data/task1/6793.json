      "content": "Paper Title: Separating bichromatic point sets in the plane by restricted orientation convex hulls1footnote 11footnote 1A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the XVIII Spanish Meeting on Computational Geometry (EGC2019) [4].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We explore the separability of point sets in the plane by a restricted-orientation convex hull, which is an orientation-dependent, possibly disconnected, and non-convex enclosing shape that generalizes the convex hull. Let R𝑅R and B𝐵B be two disjoint sets of red and blue points in the plane, and 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} be a set of k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 lines passing through the origin. We study the problem of computing the set of orientations of the lines of 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} for which the 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}-convex hull of R𝑅R contains no points of B𝐵B. For k=2𝑘2k=2 orthogonal lines we have the rectilinear convex hull. In optimal O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time and O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) space, n=|R|+|B|𝑛𝑅𝐵n=|R|+|B|, we compute the set of rotation angles such that, after simultaneously rotating the lines of 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} around the origin in the same direction, the rectilinear convex hull of R𝑅R contains no points of B𝐵B. We generalize this result to the case where 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} is formed by k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 lines with arbitrary orientations. In the counter-clockwise circular order of the lines of 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}, let αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} be the angle required to clockwise rotate the i𝑖ith line so it coincides with its successor. We solve the problem in this case in O​(1/Θ⋅N​log⁡N)𝑂⋅1Θ𝑁𝑁O({1}/{\\Theta}\\cdot N\\log N) time and O​(1/Θ⋅N)𝑂⋅1Θ𝑁O({1}/{\\Theta}\\cdot N) space, where Θ=min⁡{α1,…,αk}Θsubscript𝛼1…subscript𝛼𝑘\\Theta=\\min\\{\\alpha_{1},\\ldots,\\alpha_{k}\\} and N=max⁡{k,|R|+|B|}𝑁𝑘𝑅𝐵N=\\max\\{k,|R|+|B|\\}. We finally consider the case in which 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} is formed by k=2𝑘2k=2 lines, one of the lines is fixed, and the second line rotates by an angle that goes from 00 to π𝜋\\pi. We show that this last case can also be solved in optimal O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time and O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) space, where n=|R|+|B|𝑛𝑅𝐵n=|R|+|B|.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
