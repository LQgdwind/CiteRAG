Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Representing Matroids over the Reals is ∃ℝ-complete\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A matroid M𝑀M is an ordered pair (E,ℐ)𝐸ℐ(E,\\mathcal{I}), where E𝐸E is a finite set called the ground set and a collection ℐ⊂2Eℐsuperscript2𝐸\\mathcal{I}\\subset 2^{E} called the independent sets which satisfy the conditions: (i) ∅∈ℐℐ\\emptyset\\in\\mathcal{I}, (ii) I′⊂I∈ℐsuperscript𝐼′𝐼ℐI^{\\prime}\\subset I\\in\\mathcal{I} implies I′∈ℐsuperscript𝐼′ℐI^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{I}, and (iii) I1,I2∈ℐsubscript𝐼1subscript𝐼2ℐI_{1},I_{2}\\in\\mathcal{I} and |I1|<|I2|subscript𝐼1subscript𝐼2|I_{1}|<|I_{2}| implies that there is an e∈I2𝑒subscript𝐼2e\\in I_{2} such that I1∪{e}∈ℐsubscript𝐼1𝑒ℐI_{1}\\cup\\{e\\}\\in\\mathcal{I}. The rank 𝗋𝗄​(M)𝗋𝗄𝑀{\\sf rk}(M) of a matroid M𝑀M is the maximum size of an independent set. We say that a matroid M=(E,ℐ)𝑀𝐸ℐM=(E,\\mathcal{I}) is representable over the reals if there is a map φ:E→ℝ𝗋𝗄​(M):𝜑→𝐸superscriptℝ𝗋𝗄𝑀\\varphi\\colon E\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{{\\sf rk}(M)} such that I∈ℐ𝐼ℐI\\in\\mathcal{I} if and only if φ​(I)𝜑𝐼\\varphi(I) forms a linearly independent set. We study the problem of Matroid ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-Representability over the reals. Given a matroid M𝑀M, we ask whether there is a set of points in the Euclidean space representing M𝑀M. We show that Matroid ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-Representability is ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete, already for matroids of rank 333. The complexity class ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} can be defined as the family of algorithmic problems that is polynomial-time equivalent to determining if a multivariate polynomial with integer coefficients has a real root. Our methods are similar to previous methods from the literature. Yet, the result itself was never pointed out and there is no proof readily available in the language of computer science.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
