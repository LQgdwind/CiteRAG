Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: IFSS-Net: Interactive Few-Shot Siamese Network for Faster Muscle Segmentation and Propagation in Volumetric Ultrasound\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present an accurate, fast and efficient method for segmentation and muscle mask propagation in 3D freehand ultrasound data, towards accurate volume quantification. A deep Siamese 3D Encoder-Decoder network that captures the evolution of the muscle appearance and shape for contiguous slices is deployed. We uses it to propagate a reference mask annotated by a clinical expert. To handle longer changes of the muscle shape over the entire volume and to provide an accurate propagation, we devise a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory module. Also, to train our model with a minimal amount of training samples, we propose a strategy combining learning from few annotated 2D ultrasound slices with sequential pseudo-labeling of the unannotated slices. We introduce a decremental update of the objective function to guide the model convergence in the absence of large amounts of annotated data. After training with a small number of volumes, the decremental update transitions from a weakly-supervised training to a few-shot setting. Finally, to handle the class-imbalance between foreground and background muscle pixels, we propose a parametric Tversky loss function that learns to adaptively penalize false positives and false negatives. We validate our approach for the segmentation, label propagation, and volume computation of the three low-limb muscles on a dataset of 61600 images from 44 subjects. We achieve a Dice score coefficient of over 95%percent9595~{}\\% and a volumetric error of 1.6035±0.587%plus-or-minus1.6035percent0.5871.6035\\pm 0.587~{}\\%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
