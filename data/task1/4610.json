      "content": "Paper Title: Extractors for Sum of Two Sources\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problem of extracting randomness from sumset sources, a general class of weak sources introduced by Chattopadhyay and Li (STOC, 2016). An (n,k,C)𝑛𝑘𝐶(n,k,C)-sumset source 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} is a distribution on {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} of the form 𝐗1+𝐗2+…+𝐗Csubscript𝐗1subscript𝐗2…subscript𝐗𝐶\\mathbf{X}_{1}+\\mathbf{X}_{2}+\\ldots+\\mathbf{X}_{C}, where 𝐗isubscript𝐗𝑖\\mathbf{X}_{i}’s are independent sources on n𝑛n bits with min-entropy at least k𝑘k. Prior extractors either required the number of sources C𝐶C to be a large constant or the min-entropy k𝑘k to be at least 0.51​n0.51𝑛0.51n. As our main result, we construct an explicit extractor for sumset sources in the setting of C=2𝐶2C=2 for min-entropy poly​(log⁡n)poly𝑛\\mathrm{poly}(\\log n) and polynomially small error. We can further improve the min-entropy requirement to (log⁡n)⋅(log⁡log⁡n)1+o​(1)⋅𝑛superscript𝑛1𝑜1(\\log n)\\cdot(\\log\\log n)^{1+o(1)} at the expense of worse error parameter of our extractor. We find applications of our sumset extractor for extracting randomness from other well-studied models of weak sources such as affine sources, small-space sources, and interleaved sources. Interestingly, it is unknown if a random function is an extractor for sumset sources. We use techniques from additive combinatorics to show that it is a disperser, and further prove that an affine extractor works for an interesting subclass of sumset sources which informally corresponds to the “low doubling” case (i.e., the support of 𝐗1+𝐗2subscript𝐗1subscript𝐗2\\mathbf{X}_{1}+\\mathbf{X}_{2} is not much larger than 2ksuperscript2𝑘2^{k}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
