Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Visual Communication Map for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep reinforcement learning has been applied successfully to solve various real-world problems and the number of its applications in the multi-agent settings has been increasing. Multi-agent learning distinctly poses significant challenges in the effort to allocate a concealed communication medium. Agents receive thorough knowledge from the medium to determine subsequent actions in a distributed nature. Apparently, the goal is to leverage the cooperation of multiple agents to achieve a designated objective efficiently. Recent studies typically combine a specialized neural network with reinforcement learning to enable communication between agents. This approach, however, limits the number of agents or necessitates the homogeneity of the system. In this paper, we have proposed a more scalable approach that not only deals with a great number of agents but also enables collaboration between dissimilar functional agents and compatibly combined with any deep reinforcement learning methods. Specifically, we create a global communication map to represent the status of each agent in the system visually. The visual map and the environmental state are fed to a shared-parameter network to train multiple agents concurrently. Finally, we select the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to demonstrate our proposed scheme, namely Visual communication map for Multi-agent A3C (VMA3C). Simulation results show that the use of visual communication map improves the performance of A3C regarding learning speed, reward achievement, and robustness in multi-agent problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
