Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: HPE: Answering Complex Questions over Text by Hybrid Question Parsing and Execution\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The dominant paradigm of textual question answering with end-to-end neural models excels at answering simple questions but falls short on explainability and dealing with more complex questions. This stands in contrast to the broad adaptation of semantic parsing approaches over structured data sources (e.g., relational database), that convert questions to logical forms and execute them with query engines. Towards the goal of combining the strengths of neural and symbolic methods, we propose a framework of question parsing and execution for textual QA. It comprises two central pillars: (1) parsing a question of varying complexity into an intermediate representation, named H-expression, which symbolically represents how an answer to the question can be reached by hierarchically combining answers from the primitive simple questions; (2) to execute the resulting expression, we design a hybrid executor, which integrates deterministic rules to translate the symbolic operations with a drop-in neural reader to answer each simple question. The proposed framework can be viewed as a top-down question parsing followed by a bottom-up answer backtracking. H-expressions closely guide the execution process, offering higher precision besides better interpretability while still preserving the advantages of the neural readers for resolving primitive elements. Our extensive experiments on four different QA datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms existing approaches in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while also effectively exposing the underlying reasoning process.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
