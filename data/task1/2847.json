Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: XLST: Cross-lingual Self-training to Learn Multilingual Representation for Low Resource Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised multilingual representation learning framework, called cross-lingual self-training (XLST). XLST is able to utilize a small amount of annotated data from high-resource languages to improve the representation learning on multilingual un-annotated data. Specifically, XLST uses a supervised trained model to produce initial representations and another model to learn from them, by maximizing the similarity between output embeddings of these two models. Furthermore, the moving average mechanism and multi-view data augmentation are employed, which are experimentally shown to be crucial to XLST. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on the CommonVoice corpus to evaluate the effectiveness of XLST. Results on 5 downstream low-resource ASR tasks shows that our multilingual pretrained model achieves relatively 18.6% PER reduction over the state-of-the-art self-supervised method, with leveraging additional 100 hours of annotated English data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
