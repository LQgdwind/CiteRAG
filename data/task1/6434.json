      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Adversarial Examples and Adversarial Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks by Mutual Information\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A counter-intuitive property of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their inherent susceptibility to adversarial examples, which severely hinders the application of CNNs in security-critical fields. Adversarial examples are similar to original examples but contain malicious perturbations. Adversarial training is a simple and effective defense method to improve the robustness of CNNs to adversarial examples. The mechanisms behind adversarial examples and adversarial training are worth exploring. Therefore, this work investigates similarities and differences between normally trained CNNs (NT-CNNs) and adversarially trained CNNs (AT-CNNs) in information extraction from the mutual information perspective. We show that 1) whether NT-CNNs or AT-CNNs, for original and adversarial examples, the trends towards mutual information are almost similar throughout training; 2) compared with normal training, adversarial training is more difficult and the amount of information that AT-CNNs extract from the input is less; 3) the CNNs trained with different methods have different preferences for certain types of information; NT-CNNs tend to extract texture-based information from the input, while AT-CNNs prefer to shape-based information. The reason why adversarial examples mislead CNNs may be that they contain more texture-based information about other classes. Furthermore, we also analyze the mutual information estimators used in this work and find that they outline the geometric properties of the middle layer’s output111Code: https://github.com/wowotou1998/exploring-adv-by-mutual-info .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
