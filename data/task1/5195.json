Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Meta-Cognitive Features for a Machine-Learning-Based One-Shot Group-Decision Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The outcome of a collective decision-making process, such as crowdsourcing, often relies on the procedure through which the perspectives of its individual members are aggregated. Popular aggregation methods, such as the majority rule, often fail to produce the optimal result, especially in high-complexity tasks. Methods that rely on meta-cognitive information, such as confidence-based methods and the Surprisingly Popular Option, had shown an improvement in various tasks. However, there is still a significant number of cases with no optimal solution. Our aim is to exploit meta-cognitive information and to learn from it, for the purpose of enhancing the ability of the group to produce a correct answer. Specifically, we propose two different feature-representation approaches: (1) Response-Centered feature Representation (RCR), which focuses on the characteristics of the individual response instances, and (2) Answer-Centered feature Representation (ACR), which focuses on the characteristics of each of the potential answers. Using these two feature-representation approaches, we train Machine-Learning (ML) models, for the purpose of predicting the correctness of a response and of an answer. The trained models are used as the basis of an ML-based aggregation methodology that, contrary to other ML-based techniques, has the advantage of being a \"one-shot\" technique, independent from the crowd-specific composition and personal record, and adaptive to various types of situations. To evaluate our methodology, we collected 2490 responses for different tasks, which we used for feature engineering and for the training of ML models. We tested our feature-representation approaches through the performance of our proposed ML-based aggregation methods. The results show an increase of 20% to 35% in the success rate, compared to the use of standard rule-based aggregation methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
