Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Supervised Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization using Centroid-encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Visualizing high-dimensional data is an essential task in Data Science and Machine Learning. The Centroid-Encoder (CE) method is similar to the autoencoder but incorporates label information to keep objects of a class close together in the reduced visualization space. CE exploits nonlinearity and labels to encode high variance in low dimensions while capturing the global structure of the data. We present a detailed analysis of the method using a wide variety of data sets and compare it with other supervised dimension reduction techniques, including NCA, nonlinear NCA, t-distributed NCA, t-distributed MCML, supervised UMAP, supervised PCA, Colored Maximum Variance Unfolding, supervised Isomap, Parametric Embedding, supervised Neighbor Retrieval Visualizer, and Multiple Relational Embedding. We empirically show that centroid-encoder outperforms most of these techniques. We also show that when the data variance is spread across multiple modalities, centroid-encoder extracts a significant amount of information from the data in low dimensional space. This key feature establishes its value to use it as a tool for data visualization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
