Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: LQResNet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Learning Dynamic Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Mathematical modeling is an essential step, for example, to analyze the transient behavior of a dynamical process and to perform engineering studies such as optimization and control. With the help of first-principles and expert knowledge, a dynamic model can be built. However, for complex dynamic processes, appearing, e.g., in biology, chemical plants, neuroscience, financial markets, this often remains an onerous task. Hence, data-driven modeling of the dynamics process becomes an attractive choice and is supported by the rapid advancement in sensor and measurement technology. A data-driven approach, namely operator inference framework, models a dynamic process, where a physics-informed structure of the nonlinear term is assumed. In this work, we suggest combining the operator inference with certain deep neural network approaches to infer the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the system. The approach uses recent advancements in deep learning and prior knowledge of the process if possible. We briefly also discuss several extensions and advantages of the proposed methodology. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology accomplishes the desired tasks for dynamics processes encountered in neural dynamics and the glycolytic oscillator.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
