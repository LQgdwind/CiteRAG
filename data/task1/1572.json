Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Counterfactual Explanation and Causal Inference In Service of Robustness in Robot Control\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose an architecture for training generative models of counterfactual conditionals of the form, ‘can we modify event A to cause B instead of C?’, motivated by applications in robot control. Using an ‘adversarial training’ paradigm, an image-based deep neural network model is trained to produce small and realistic modifications to an original image in order to cause user-defined effects. These modifications can be used in the design process of image-based robust control - to determine the ability of the controller to return to a working regime by modifications in the input space, rather than by adaptation. In contrast to conventional control design approaches, where robustness is quantified in terms of the ability to reject noise, we explore the space of counterfactuals that might cause a certain requirement to be violated, thus proposing an alternative model that might be more expressive in certain robotics applications. So, we propose the generation of counterfactuals as an approach to explanation of black-box models and the envisioning of potential movement paths in autonomous robotic control. Firstly, we demonstrate this approach in a set of classification tasks, using the well known MNIST and CelebFaces Attributes datasets. Then, addressing multi-dimensional regression, we demonstrate our approach in a reaching task with a physical robot, and in a navigation task with a robot in a digital twin simulation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
