      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Knowledge Adaptation for Passenger Demand Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Considering the multimodal nature of transport systems (e.g., train, bus) and potential cross-modal correlations (e.g., similar temporal patterns), there is a growing trend of enhancing demand forecasting accuracy by learning from multimodal data, i.e., forecasting models that are optimized with data from multiple transport modes jointly. These multimodal forecasting models are able to improve accuracy, but they can be less practical when different parts of multimodal datasets are owned by different institutions who cannot directly share data among them. While various institutions may not be able to share their data with each other directly, they may share forecasting models trained by their data, where such models cannot be used to identify the exact information from their datasets. In this context, this study proposes an Unsupervised Knowledge Adaptation Demand Forecasting (Un-Kadf) framework, which forecasts the demand of one mode (i.e., the target mode) by utilizing a pre-trained model based on data of another mode, but does not require direct data sharing of another transport mode (i.e., the source mode). The proposed framework utilizes the potential shared patterns among multiple transport modes for improving forecasting performance while avoiding the direct sharing of data among different institutions. Specifically, a pre-trained forecasting model is first learned based on the data of a source mode, which can capture and memorize the source travel patterns (but not the exact source data). Then, the demand data of the target dataset is encoded into an individual knowledge part and a sharing knowledge part which will extract travel patterns by two networks, i.e., individual extraction network and sharing extraction network, respectively. The unsupervised knowledge adaptation strategy is utilized to form the sharing features for further forecasting by making the pre-trained network and the sharing extraction network analogous. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets from the Greater Sydney area covering four public transit modes (i.e., bus, train, light rail, and ferry) demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a number of baseline methods and state-of-the-art models. Our findings also illustrate that unsupervised knowledge adaptation by sharing the pre-trained model to the target transport mode can improve the forecasting performance without the dependence on direct data sharing.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
