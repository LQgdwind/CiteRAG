      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating Convergence of Score-Based Diffusion Models, Provably\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Score-based diffusion models, while achieving remarkable empirical performance, often suffer from low sampling speed, due to extensive function evaluations needed during the sampling phase. Despite a flurry of recent activities towards speeding up diffusion generative modeling in practice, theoretical underpinnings for acceleration techniques remain severely limited. In this paper, we design novel training-free algorithms to accelerate popular deterministic (i.e., DDIM) and stochastic (i.e., DDPM) samplers. Our accelerated deterministic sampler converges at a rate O‚Äã(1T2)ùëÇ1superscriptùëá2O(\\frac{1}{{T}^{2}}) with TùëáT the number of steps, improving upon the O‚Äã(1T)ùëÇ1ùëáO(\\frac{1}{T}) rate for the DDIM sampler; and our accelerated stochastic sampler converges at a rate O‚Äã(1T)ùëÇ1ùëáO(\\frac{1}{T}), outperforming the rate O‚Äã(1T)ùëÇ1ùëáO(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}) for the DDPM sampler. The design of our algorithms leverages insights from higher-order approximation, and shares similar intuitions as popular high-order ODE solvers like the DPM-Solver-2. Our theory accommodates ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2}-accurate score estimates, and does not require log-concavity or smoothness on the target distribution.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
