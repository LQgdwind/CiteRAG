Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dyna-5G: A Dynamic, Flexible, and Self-Organizing 5G Network for M2M Ecosystems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we present Dyna-5G, a dynamic, self-organizing 5G New Radio (5G-NR) network designed for massive Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks. Traditional 5G NR networks, characterized by their centralized architecture, face challenges in supporting applications that require dynamic, decentralized communication, such as autonomous vehicles and drone swarms for emergency responses. These scenarios often suffer from the centralized model’s single point of failure, undermining the reliability required in critical and fully autonomous applications. Dyna-5G addresses these challenges by allowing each device in the network to function as either part of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network, or as User Equipment (UE), thus maintaining network functionality even when conventional infrastructure components are compromised. Dyna-5G has built-in mechanisms carefully designed specifically for M2M networks, such as failure-recovery and ad-hoc entry and exit. We demonstrate the performance and feasibility of Dyna-5G using a custom-built testbed that simulates real-world missions, demonstrating our network’s robustness, adaptability, and failure recovery capabilities. The results indicate that our entire 5G network model can fully re-organize in 6 seconds at maximum, without compromising the mission.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
