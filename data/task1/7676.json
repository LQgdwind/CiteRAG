Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating Glyph Design for Showing Large-Magnitude-Range Quantum Spins\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present experimental results to explore a form of bivariate glyphs for representing large-magnitude-range vectors. The glyphs meet two conditions: (1) two visual dimensions are separable; and (2) one of the two visual dimensions uses a categorical representation (e.g., a categorical colormap). We evaluate how much these two conditions determine the bivariate glyphs’ effectiveness. The first experiment asks participants to perform three local tasks requiring reading no more than two glyphs. The second experiment scales up the search space in global tasks when participants must look at the entire scene of hundreds of vector glyphs to get an answer. Our results support that the first condition is necessary for local tasks when a few items are compared. But it is not enough for understanding a large amount of data. The second condition is necessary for perceiving global structures of examining very complex datasets. Participants’ comments reveal that the categorical features in the bivariate glyphs trigger emergent optimal viewers’ behaviors. This work contributes to perceptually accurate glyph representations for revealing patterns from large scientific results. We release source code, quantum physics data, training documents, participants’ answers, and statistical analyses for reproducible science at https://osf.io/4xcf5/?viewonly=94123139df9c4ac984a1e0df811cd580https://osf.io/4xcf5/?view_{o}nly=94123139df9c4ac984a1e0df811cd580.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
