Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: PeopleSansPeople: A Synthetic Data Generator for Human-Centric Computer Vision\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, person detection and human pose estimation have made great strides, helped by large-scale labeled datasets. However, these datasets had no guarantees or analysis of human activities, poses, or context diversity. Additionally, privacy, legal, safety, and ethical concerns may limit the ability to collect more human data. An emerging alternative to real-world data that alleviates some of these issues is synthetic data. However, creation of synthetic data generators is incredibly challenging and prevents researchers from exploring their usefulness. Therefore, we release a human-centric synthetic data generator PeopleSansPeople which contains simulation-ready 3D human assets, a parameterized lighting and camera system, and generates 2D and 3D bounding box, instance and semantic segmentation, and COCO pose labels. Using PeopleSansPeople, we performed benchmark synthetic data training using a Detectron2 Keypoint R-CNN variant [1]. We found that pre-training a network using synthetic data and fine-tuning on various sizes of real-world data resulted in a keypoint AP increase of +38.0338.03+38.03 (44.43±0.17plus-or-minus44.430.1744.43\\pm 0.17 vs. 6.406.406.40) for few-shot transfer (limited subsets of COCO-person train [2]), and an increase of +1.471.47+1.47 (63.47±0.19plus-or-minus63.470.1963.47\\pm 0.19 vs. 62.0062.0062.00) for abundant real data regimes, outperforming models trained with the same real data alone. We also found that our models outperformed those pre-trained with ImageNet with a keypoint AP increase of +22.5322.53+22.53 (44.43±0.17plus-or-minus44.430.1744.43\\pm 0.17 vs. 21.9021.9021.90) for few-shot transfer and +1.071.07+1.07 (63.47±0.19plus-or-minus63.470.1963.47\\pm 0.19 vs. 62.4062.4062.40) for abundant real data regimes. This freely-available data generator111PeopleSansPeople template Unity environment, benchmark binaries, and source code is available at: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PeopleSansPeople should enable a wide range of research into the emerging field of simulation to real transfer learning in the critical area of human-centric computer vision.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
