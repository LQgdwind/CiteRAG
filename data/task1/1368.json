      "content": "Paper Title: Topology optimization considering the distortion in additive manufacturing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Additive manufacturing is a free-form manufacturing technique in which parts are built in a layer-by-layer manner. Laser powder bed fusion is one of the popular techniques used to fabricate metal parts. However, it induces residual stress and distortion during fabrication that adversely affects the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of the manufactured parts. Therefore, predicting and avoiding the residual stress and distortion are critical issues. In this study, we propose a topology optimization method that accounts for the distortion. First, we propose a computationally inexpensive analytical model for additive manufacturing that uses laser powder bed fusion and formulated an optimization problem. Next, we approximate the topological derivative of the objective function using an adjoint variable method that is then utilized to update the level set function via a time evolutionary reaction-diffusion equation. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method was established using two-dimensional design examples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
