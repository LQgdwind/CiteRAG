Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Movie Trailer Genre Classification Using Multimodal Pretrained Features1footnote 11footnote 1This work has been funded by National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, within project LA/P/0063/2020.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a novel method for movie genre classification, capitalizing on a diverse set of readily accessible pretrained models. These models extract high-level features related to visual scenery, objects, characters, text, speech, music, and audio effects. To intelligently fuse these pretrained features, we train small classifier models with low time and memory requirements. Employing the transformer model, our approach utilizes all video and audio frames of movie trailers without performing any temporal pooling, efficiently exploiting the correspondence between all elements, as opposed to the fixed and low number of frames typically used by traditional methods. Our approach fuses features originating from different tasks and modalities, with different dimensionalities, different temporal lengths, and complex dependencies as opposed to current approaches. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art movie genre classification models in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). To foster future research, we make the pretrained features for the entire MovieNet dataset, along with our genre classification code and the trained models, publicly available.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
