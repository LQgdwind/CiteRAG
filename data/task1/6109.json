      "content": "Paper Title: “How Biased are Your Features?”: Computing Fairness Influence Functions with Global Sensitivity Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Fairness in machine learning has attained significant focus due to the widespread application in high-stake decision-making tasks. Unregulated machine learning classifiers can exhibit bias towards certain demographic groups in data, thus the quantification and mitigation of classifier bias is a central concern in fairness in machine learning. In this paper, we aim to quantify the influence of different features in a dataset on the bias of a classifier. To do this, we introduce the Fairness Influence Function (FIF). This function breaks down bias into its components among individual features and the intersection of multiple features. The key idea is to represent existing group fairness metrics as the difference of the scaled conditional variances in the classifier’s prediction and apply a decomposition of variance according to global sensitivity analysis. To estimate FIFs, we instantiate an algorithm 𝖥𝖺𝗂𝗋𝖷𝗉𝗅𝖺𝗂𝗇𝖾𝗋𝖥𝖺𝗂𝗋𝖷𝗉𝗅𝖺𝗂𝗇𝖾𝗋\\mathsf{FairXplainer} that applies variance decomposition of classifier’s prediction following local regression. Experiments demonstrate that 𝖥𝖺𝗂𝗋𝖷𝗉𝗅𝖺𝗂𝗇𝖾𝗋𝖥𝖺𝗂𝗋𝖷𝗉𝗅𝖺𝗂𝗇𝖾𝗋\\mathsf{FairXplainer} captures FIFs of individual feature and intersectional features, provides a better approximation of bias based on FIFs, demonstrates higher correlation of FIFs with fairness interventions, and detects changes in bias due to fairness affirmative/punitive actions in the classifier. The code is available at https://github.com/ReAILe/bias-explainer. The extended version of the paper is at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00667.pdf.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 62\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
