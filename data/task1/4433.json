Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5.

      "content": "Paper Title: Leaked-Web: Accurate and Efficient Machine Learning-Based Website Fingerprinting Attack through Hardware Performance Counters\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Users’ website browsing history contains sensitive information, like health conditions, political interests, financial situations, etc. In order to cope with the potential website behavior leakage and enhance the browsing security, some defense mechanisms such as SSH tunnels and anonymity networks (e.g., Tor) have been proposed. Nevertheless, some recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of inferring website fingerprints based on important usage information such as traffic, cache usage, memory usage, CPU activity, power consumption, and hardware performance counters information. However, existing website fingerprinting attacks demand high sampling rate which causes high performance overheads and large network traffic, and/or they require launching an additional malicious website by the user which is not guaranteed. As a result, such drawbacks make the existing attacks more noticeable to users and corresponding fingerprinting detection mechanisms. In response, in this work we propose Leaked-Web, a novel accurate and efficient machine learning-based website fingerprinting attack through processor’s Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). Leaked-Web efficiently collects hardware performance counters in users’ computer system at a significantly low granularity monitoring rate and sends the samples to the remote attack’s server for further classification. Leaked-Web examines the web browsers’ microarchitectural features using various advanced machine learning algorithms ranging from classical, boosting, deep learning, and time-series models. Our experimental results indicate that Leaked-Web based on a LogitBoost ML classifier using only the top 4 HPC features achieves 91% classification accuracy outperforming the state-of-the-art attacks by nearly 5%. Furthermore, our proposed attack obtains a negligible performance overhead (only <<1%) which is around 12% lower than the existing hardware-assisted website fingerprinting attacks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
