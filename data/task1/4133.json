      "content": "Paper Title: Automatic Speech Recognition And Limited Vocabulary: A Survey 1footnote 11footnote 1\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an active field of research due to its large number of applications and the proliferation of interfaces or computing devices that can support speech processing. However, the bulk of applications are based on well-resourced languages that overshadow under-resourced ones. Yet, ASR represents an undeniable means to promote such languages, especially when designing human-to-human or human-to-machine systems involving illiterate people. An approach to design an ASR system targeting under-resourced languages is to start with a limited vocabulary. ASR using a limited vocabulary is a subset of the speech recognition problem that focuses on the recognition of a small number of words or sentences. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive view of mechanisms behind ASR systems as well as techniques, tools, projects, recent contributions, and possible future directions in ASR using a limited vocabulary. This work consequently provides a way forward when designing an ASR system using limited vocabulary. Although an emphasis is put on limited vocabulary, most of the tools and techniques reported in this survey can be applied to ASR systems in general.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 156 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 156\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
