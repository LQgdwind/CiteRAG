Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Infographics Wizard: Flexible Infographics Authoring and Design Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Infographics are an aesthetic visual representation of information following specific design principles of human perception. Designing infographics can be a tedious process for non-experts and time-consuming, even for professional designers. With the help of designers, we propose a semi-automated infographic framework for general structured and flow-based infographic design generation. For novice designers, our framework automatically creates and ranks infographic designs for a user-provided text with no requirement for design input. However, expert designers can still provide custom design inputs to customize the infographics. We will also contribute an individual visual group (VG) designs dataset (in SVG), along with a 1k complete infographic image dataset with segmented VGs in this work. Evaluation results confirm that by using our framework, designers from all expertise levels can generate generic infographic designs faster than existing methods while maintaining the same quality as hand-designed infographics templates. {CCSXML} <ccs2012> <concept> <concept_id>10003120.10003145.10003151</concept_id> <concept_desc>Human-centered computing Visualization systems and tools</concept_desc> <concept_significance>500</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10010405.10010469</concept_id> <concept_desc>Applied computing Arts and humanities</concept_desc> <concept_significance>300</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10010147.10010178.10010224.10010225.10010231</concept_id> <concept_desc>Computing methodologies Visual content-based indexing and retrieval</concept_desc> <concept_significance>100</concept_significance> </concept> <concept> <concept_id>10010147.10010178.10010205.10010206</concept_id> <concept_desc>Computing methodologies Heuristic function construction</concept_desc> <concept_significance>300</concept_significance> </concept> </ccs2012> \\ccsdesc [500]Human-centered computing Visualization systems and tools \\ccsdesc[300]Applied computing Arts and humanities \\ccsdesc[100]Computing methodologies Visual content-based indexing and retrieval \\ccsdesc[300]Computing methodologies Heuristic function construction \\printccsdesc\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
