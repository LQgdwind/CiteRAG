Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Tractable Fragments of Temporal Sequences of Topological Information\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we focus on qualitative temporal sequences of topological information. We firstly consider the context of topological temporal sequences of length greater than 333 describing the evolution of regions at consecutive time points. We show that there is no Cartesian subclass containing all the basic relations and the universal relation for which the algebraic closure decides satisfiability. However, we identify some tractable subclasses, by giving up the relations containing the non-tangential proper part relation and not containing the tangential proper part relation. We then formalize an alternative semantics for temporal sequences. We place ourselves in the context of the topological temporal sequences describing the evolution of regions on a partition of time (i.e. an alternation of instants and intervals). In this context, we identify large tractable fragments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
