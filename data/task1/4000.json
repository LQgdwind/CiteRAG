Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Brain-Inspired Deep Imitation Learning for Autonomous Driving Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Autonomous driving has attracted great attention from both academics and industries. To realise autonomous driving, Deep Imitation Learning (DIL) is treated as one of the most promising solutions, because it improves autonomous driving systems by automatically learning a complex mapping from human driving data, compared to manually designing the driving policy. However, existing DIL methods cannot generalise well across domains, that is, a network trained on the data of source domain gives rise to poor generalisation on the data of target domain. In the present study, we propose a novel brain-inspired deep imitation method that builds on the evidence from human brain functions, to improve the generalisation ability of deep neural networks so that autonomous driving systems can perform well in various scenarios. Specifically, humans have a strong generalisation ability which is beneficial from the structural and functional asymmetry of the two sides of the brain. Here, we design dual Neural Circuit Policy (NCP) architectures in deep neural networks based on the asymmetry of human neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our brain-inspired method outperforms existing methods regarding generalisation when dealing with unseen data. Our source codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Intenzo21/Brain-Inspired-Deep-Imitation-Learning-for-Autonomous-Driving-Systems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
