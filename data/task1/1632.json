Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generative latent neural models for automatic word alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract \\done [FY]\\Todo[FY:]Write abstract Word alignments identify translational correspondences between words in a parallel sentence pair and are used, for instance, to learn bilingual dictionaries, to train statistical machine translation systems or to perform quality estimation. Variational autoencoders have been recently used in various of natural language processing to learn in an unsupervised way latent representations that are useful for language generation tasks. In this paper, we study these models for the task of word alignment and propose and assess several evolutions of a vanilla variational autoencoders. We demonstrate that these techniques can yield competitive results as compared to Giza++ and to a strong neural network alignment system for two language pairs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
