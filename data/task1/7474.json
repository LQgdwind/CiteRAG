      "content": "Paper Title: Perturb Initial Features: Generalization of Neural Networks Under Sparse Features for Semi-supervised Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly used in semi-supervised settings. Previous research has primarily focused on finding appropriate graph filters (e.g., aggregation methods) to improve message-passing schemes. While these methods are effective, they can still suffer from the sparsity of training nodes in case their features have few non-zero elements. This can lead to overfitting in certain dimensions in the first projection matrix, as training samples may not learn the entire dimensions of graph filters (hyperplanes). To address this issue, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy. Specifically, we create additional space for training by flipping both the initial features and the hyperplane, which removes zero elements and reduces the variance of prediction with improved robustness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to mitigate the overfitting of GNNs caused by the initial features. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed technique increases node classification accuracy by up to 46.5% compared to the baseline method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
