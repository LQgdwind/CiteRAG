Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sentiment Analysis of Fashion Related Posts in Social Media\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The role of social media in fashion industry has been blooming as the years have continued on. In this work, we investigate sentiment analysis for fashion related posts in social media platforms. There are two main challenges of this task. On the first place, information of different modalities must be jointly considered to make the final predictions. On the second place, some unique fashion related attributes should be taken into account. While most existing works focus on traditional multimodal sentiment analysis, they always fail to exploit the fashion related attributes in this task. We propose a novel framework that jointly leverages the image vision, post text, as well as fashion attribute modality to determine the sentiment category. One characteristic of our model is that it extracts fashion attributes and integrates them with the image vision information for effective representation. Furthermore, it exploits the mutual relationship between the fashion attributes and the post texts via a mutual attention mechanism. Since there is no existing dataset suitable for this task, we prepare a large-scale sentiment analysis dataset of over 12k fashion related social media posts. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
