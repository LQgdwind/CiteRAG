Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Twin-width and polynomial kernels\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the existence of polynomial kernels, for parameterized problems without a polynomial kernel on general graphs, when restricted to graphs of bounded twin-width. Our main result is that a polynomial kernel for kùëòk-Dominating Set on graphs of twin-width at most 4 would contradict a standard complexity-theoretic assumption. The reduction is quite involved, especially to get the twin-width upper bound down to 4, and can be tweaked to work for Connected kùëòk-Dominating Set and Total kùëòk-Dominating Set (albeit with a worse upper bound on the twin-width). The kùëòk-Independent Set problem admits the same lower bound by a much simpler argument, previously observed [ICALP ‚Äô21], which extends to kùëòk-Independent Dominating Set, kùëòk-Path, kùëòk-Induced Path, kùëòk-Induced Matching, etc. On the positive side, we obtain a simple quadratic vertex kernel for Connected kùëòk-Vertex Cover and Capacitated kùëòk-Vertex Cover on graphs of bounded twin-width. Interestingly the kernel applies to graphs of Vapnik-Chervonenkis density 1, and does not require a witness sequence. We also present a more intricate O‚Äã(k1.5)ùëÇsuperscriptùëò1.5O(k^{1.5}) vertex kernel for Connected kùëòk-Vertex Cover. Finally we show that deciding if a graph has twin-width at most 1 can be done in polynomial time, and observe that most optimization/decision graph problems can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of twin-width at most 1.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
