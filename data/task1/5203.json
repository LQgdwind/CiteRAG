Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: One-Shot Learning on Attributed Sequences\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract One-shot learning has become an important research topic in the last decade with many real-world applications. The goal of one-shot learning is to classify unlabeled instances when there is only one labeled example per class. Conventional problem setting of one-shot learning mainly focuses on the data that is already in a feature space (such as images). However, the data instances in real-world applications are often more complex and feature vectors may not be available. In this paper, we study the problem of one-shot learning on attributed sequences, where each instance is composed of a set of attributes (e.g., user profile) and a sequence of categorical items (e.g., clickstream). This problem is important for a variety of real-world applications ranging from fraud prevention to network intrusion detection. This problem is more challenging than the conventional one-shot learning since there are dependencies between attributes and sequences. We design a deep learning framework OLAS to tackle this problem. The proposed OLAS utilizes a twin network to generalize the features from pairwise attributed sequence examples. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed OLAS can outperform the state-of-the-art methods under a rich variety of parameter settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
