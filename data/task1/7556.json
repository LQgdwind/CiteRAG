Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum-Inspired Approximations to Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Two contrasting algorithmic paradigms for constraint satisfaction problems are successive local explorations of neighboring configurations versus producing new configurations using global information about the problem (e.g. approximating the marginals of the probability distribution which is uniform over satisfying configurations). This paper presents new algorithms for the latter framework, ultimately producing estimates for satisfying configurations using methods from Boolean Fourier analysis. The approach is broadly inspired by the quantum amplitude amplification algorithm in that it maximally increases the amplitude of the approximation function over satisfying configurations given sequential refinements. We demonstrate that satisfying solutions may be retrieved in a process analogous to quantum measurement made efficient by sparsity in the Fourier domain, and present a complete solver construction using this novel approximation. Freedom in the refinement strategy invites further opportunities to design solvers in an evolutionary computing framework. Results demonstrate competitive performance against local solvers for the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, encouraging future work in understanding the connections between Boolean Fourier analysis and constraint satisfaction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
