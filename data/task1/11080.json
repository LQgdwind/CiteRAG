Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 63 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Ellipsoidal embeddings of graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Due to their flexibility to represent almost any kind of relational data, graph-based models have enjoyed a tremendous success over the past decades. While graphs are inherently only combinatorial objects, however, many prominent analysis tools are based on the algebraic representation of graphs via matrices such as the graph Laplacian, or on associated graph embeddings. Such embeddings associate to each node a set of coordinates in a vector space, a representation which can then be employed for learning tasks such as the classification or alignment of the nodes of the graph. As the geometric picture provided by embedding methods enables the use of a multitude of methods developed for vector space data, embeddings have thus gained interest both from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Inspired by trace-optimization problems, often encountered in the analysis of graph-based data, here we present a method to derive ellipsoidal embeddings of the nodes of a graph, in which each node is assigned a set of coordinates on the surface of a hyperellipsoid. Our method may be seen as an alternative to popular spectral embedding techniques, to which it shares certain similarities we discuss. To illustrate the utility of the embedding we conduct a case study in which we analyse synthetic and real world networks with modular structure, and compare the results obtained with known methods in the literature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
