      "content": "Paper Title: Sum-of-Squares Lower Bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) is the statistical task of finding a non-Gaussian direction in a high-dimensional dataset. Specifically, given i.i.d. samples from a distribution PvAsubscriptsuperscript𝑃𝐴𝑣P^{A}_{v} on ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} that behaves like a known distribution A𝐴A in a hidden direction v𝑣v and like a standard Gaussian in the orthogonal complement, the goal is to approximate the hidden direction. The standard formulation posits that the first k−1𝑘1k-1 moments of A𝐴A match those of the standard Gaussian and the k𝑘k-th moment differs. Under mild assumptions, this problem has sample complexity O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n). On the other hand, all known efficient algorithms require Ω​(nk/2)Ωsuperscript𝑛𝑘2\\Omega(n^{k/2}) samples. Prior work developed sharp Statistical Query and low-degree testing lower bounds suggesting an information-computation tradeoff for this problem. Here we study the complexity of NGCA in the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) framework. Our main contribution is the first super-constant degree SoS lower bound for NGCA. Specifically, we show that if the non-Gaussian distribution A𝐴A matches the first (k−1)𝑘1(k-1) moments of 𝒩​(0,1)𝒩01\\mathcal{N}(0,1) and satisfies other mild conditions, then with fewer than n(1−ε)​k/2superscript𝑛1𝜀𝑘2n^{(1-\\varepsilon)k/2} many samples from the normal distribution, with high probability, degree (log⁡n)12−on​(1)superscript𝑛12subscript𝑜𝑛1(\\log n)^{{1\\over 2}-o_{n}(1)} SoS fails to refute the existence of such a direction v𝑣v. Our result significantly strengthens prior work by establishing a super-polynomial information-computation tradeoff against a broader family of algorithms. As corollaries, we obtain SoS lower bounds for several problems in robust statistics and the learning of mixture models. Our SoS lower bound proof introduces a novel technique, that we believe may be of broader interest, and a number of refinements over existing methods. As in previous work, we use the framework of [Barak et al. FOCS 2016], where we express the moment matrix M𝑀M as a sum of graph matrices, find a factorization M≈L​Q​LT𝑀𝐿𝑄superscript𝐿𝑇M\\approx LQL^{T} using minimum vertex separators, and show that with high probability Q𝑄Q is positive semidefinite (PSD) while the errors are small. Our technical innovations are as follows. First, instead of the minimum weight separator used in prior work, we crucially make use of the minimum square separator. Second, proving that Q𝑄Q is PSD poses significant challenges due to an intrinsic reason. In all prior work, the major part of Q𝑄Q was always a constant term, meaning a matrix whose entries are constant functions of the input. Here, however, even after removing a small error term, Q𝑄Q remains a nontrivial linear combination of non-constant, equally dominating terms. We develop an algebraic method to address this difficulty, which may have wider applications. Specifically, we model the multiplications between the “important” graph matrices by an ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-algebra, construct a representation of this algebra, and use it to analyze Q𝑄Q. Via this approach, we show that the PSDness of Q𝑄Q boils down to the multiplicative identities of Hermite polynomials.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
