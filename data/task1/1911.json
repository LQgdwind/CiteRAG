Gasnikov was supported by a grant for research centers in the field of artificial intelligence, provided by the Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation in accordance with the subsidy agreement (agreement identifier 000000D730321P5Q0002) and the agreement with the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology dated November 1, 2021 No. 70-2021-00138.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper focuses on the distributed optimization of stochastic saddle point problems. The first part of the paper is devoted to lower bounds for the cenralized and decentralized distributed methods for smooth (strongly) convex-(strongly) concave saddle-point problems as well as the near-optimal algorithms by which these bounds are achieved. Next, we present a new federated algorithm for cenralized distributed saddle point problems â€“ Extra Step Local SGD. Theoretical analysis of the new method is carried out for strongly convex-strongly concave and non-convex-non-concave problems. In the experimental part of the paper, we show the effectiveness of our method in practice. In particular, we train GANs in a distributed manner.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
