Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Meta-Learning Algorithm for Interrogative Agendas\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Explainability is a key challenge and a major research theme in AI research for developing intelligent systems that are capable of working with humans more effectively. An obvious choice in developing explainable intelligent systems relies on employing knowledge representation formalisms which are inherently tailored towards expressing human knowledge e.g., interrogative agendas. In the scope of this work, we focus on formal concept analysis (FCA), a standard knowledge representation formalism, to express interrogative agendas, and in particular to categorize objects w.r.t. a given set of features. Several FCA-based algorithms have already been in use for standard machine learning tasks such as classification and outlier detection. These algorithms use a single concept lattice for such a task, meaning that the set of features used for the categorization is fixed. Different sets of features may have different importance in that categorization, we call a set of features an agenda. In many applications a correct or good agenda for categorization is not known beforehand. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to construct a good interrogative agenda explaining the data. Such algorithm is meant to call existing FCA-based classification and outlier detection algorithms iteratively, to increase their accuracy and reduce their sample complexity. The proposed method assigns a measure of importance to different set of features used in the categorization, hence making the results more explainable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
