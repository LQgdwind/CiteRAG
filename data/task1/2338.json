Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: LCEval: Learned Composite Metric for Caption Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Automatic evaluation metrics hold a fundamental importance in the development and fine-grained analysis of captioning systems. While current evaluation metrics tend to achieve an acceptable correlation with human judgements at the system level, they fail to do so at the caption level. In this work, we propose a neural network-based learned metric to improve the caption-level caption evaluation. To get a deeper insight into the parameters which impact a learned metricâ€™s performance, this paper investigates the relationship between different linguistic features and the caption-level correlation of the learned metrics. We also compare metrics trained with different training examples to measure the variations in their evaluation. Moreover, we perform a robustness analysis, which highlights the sensitivity of learned and handcrafted metrics to various sentence perturbations. Our empirical analysis shows that our proposed metric not only outperforms the existing metrics in terms of caption-level correlation but it also shows a strong system-level correlation against human assessments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
