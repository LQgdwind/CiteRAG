Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: C3Fusion: Consistent Contrastive Colon Fusion, Towards Deep SLAM in Colonoscopy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract 3D colon reconstruction from Optical Colonoscopy (OC) to detect non-examined surfaces remains an unsolved problem. The challenges arise from the nature of optical colonoscopy data, characterized by highly reflective low-texture surfaces, drastic illumination changes and frequent tracking loss. Recent methods demonstrate compelling results, but suffer from: (1) frangible frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation resulting in many tracking failures; or (2) rely on point-based representations at the cost of scan quality. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction framework that addresses these issues end to end, which result in both quantitatively and qualitatively accurate and robust 3D colon reconstruction. Our SLAM approach, which employs correspondences based on contrastive deep features, and deep consistent depth maps, estimates globally optimized poses, is able to recover from frequent tracking failures, and estimates a global consistent 3D model; all within a single framework. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation on multiple synthetic and real colonoscopy videos, showing high-quality results and comparisons against relevant baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
