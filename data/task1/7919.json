Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Auditing Gender Presentation Differences in Text-to-Image Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Text-to-image models, which can generate high-quality images based on textual input, have recently enabled various content-creation tools. Despite significantly affecting a wide range of downstream applications, the distributions of these generated images are still not fully understood, especially when it comes to the potential stereotypical attributes of different genders. In this work, we propose a paradigm (Gender Presentation Differences) that utilizes fine-grained self-presentation attributes to study how gender is presented differently in text-to-image models. By probing gender indicators in the input text (e.g., “a woman” or “a man”), we quantify the frequency differences of presentation-centric attributes (e.g., “a shirt” and “a dress”) through human annotation and introduce a novel metric: GEP.111GEP: GEnder Presentation Differences. This study uses this term to refer specifically to the attribute-level presentation differences between images generated from different gender indicators. Note that the definition of GEP is not built on the common usage of gender presentation (gender expression, used to distinguish from gender identity. Wikipedia 2022). Furthermore, we propose an automatic method to estimate such differences. The automatic GEP metric based on our approach yields a higher correlation with human annotations than that based on existing CLIP scores, consistently across three state-of-the-art text-to-image models. Finally, we demonstrate the generalization ability of our metrics in the context of gender stereotypes related to occupations. 222Project website: https://salt-nlp.github.io/GEP/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
