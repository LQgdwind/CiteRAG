      "content": "Paper Title: Region of Interest focused MRI to Synthetic CT Translation using Regression and Classification Multi-task Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Synthesizing accurate CT like images is an important step in MR-only clinical workflow. In this work, we present a method for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from zero-echo-time (ZTE) MRI aimed at structural and quantitative accuracies of the image, with a particular focus on the accurate bone density value prediction. We propose a loss function that favors a spatially sparse region in the image. We harness the ability of a multi-task network to produce correlated outputs as a framework to enable localization of region of interest (RoI) via classification, emphasize regression of values within RoI and still retain the overall accuracy via global regression. The network is optimized by a composite loss function that combines a dedicated loss from each task. We demonstrate that the proposed method, despite its architectural simplicity, offers an advantage over other configurations of the network and other popular image generation methods to achieve higher accuracy of performance at a modest computational requirements. This is relevant to sCT where failure to accurately estimate high Hounsfield Unit values of bone could lead to impaired accuracy in clinical applications. We compare the dose calculation maps from the proposed sCT and the real CT in a radiation therapy treatment planning setup.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
