Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Requirements Elicitation in Cognitive Service for Conversational Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Nowadays, cognitive service provides more interactive way to understand users’ requirements via human-machine conversation. In other words, it has to capture users’ requirements from their utterance and respond them with the relevant and suitable service resources. To this end, two phases must be applied: I.Sequence planning and Real-time detection of user requirement, II.Service resource selection and Response generation. The existing works ignore the potential connection between these two phases. To model their connection, Two-Phase Requirement Elicitation Method is proposed. For the phase I, this paper proposes a user requirement elicitation framework (URef) to plan a potential requirement sequence grounded on user profile and personal knowledge base before the conversation. In addition, it can also predict user’s true requirement and judge whether the requirement is completed based on the user’s utterance during the conversation. For the phase II, this paper proposes a response generation model based on attention, SaRSNet. It can select the appropriate resource (i.e. knowledge triple) in line with the requirement predicted by URef, and then generates a suitable response for recommendation. The experimental results on the open dataset DuRecDial have been significantly improved compared to the baseline, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
