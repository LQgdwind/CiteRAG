Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Counterfactual Explanations for Arbitrary Regression Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a new method for counterfactual explanations (CFEs) based on Bayesian optimisation that applies to both classification and regression models. Our method is a globally convergent search algorithm with support for arbitrary regression models and constraints like feature sparsity and actionable recourse, and furthermore can answer multiple counterfactual questions in parallel while learning from previous queries. We formulate CFE search for regression models in a rigorous mathematical framework using differentiable potentials, which resolves robustness issues in threshold-based objectives. We prove that in this framework, (a) verifying the existence of counterfactuals is NP-complete; and (b) that finding instances using such potentials is CLS-complete. We describe a unified algorithm for CFEs using a specialised acquisition function that composes both expected improvement and an exponential-polynomial (EP) family with desirable properties. Our evaluation on real-world benchmark domains demonstrate high sample-efficiency and precision.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
