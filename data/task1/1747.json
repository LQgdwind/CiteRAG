      "content": "Paper Title: Bioinspired Bipedal Locomotion Control for Humanoid Robotics Based on EACO\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Over the past decade, substantial progress have been made in the development of humanoid robots. One of the outstanding challenges in gait optimization of humanoid robots is to find gait parameters that can optimize a desired performance metric, such as walking speed, robustness, and energy efficiency. The existing gait optimization methods, such as Bayesian optimization (BO), gradient descent methods (GDM), genetic algorithms (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are very time-consuming to find the optimal solutions for objective function with multiple local minima. Furthermore, most of global optimization approaches are impractical to apply to the real robots because they require a large number of interactions with robots, such as, for each iteration many sets of parameters from the population in genetic algorithms must be evaluated. Therefore, we must greatly reduce the required number of interactions for finding optimal parameters. To construct a robot that can walk as efficiently and steadily as humans or other legged animals, we develop an enhanced elitist-mutated ant colony optimization (EACO) algorithm with genetic and crossover operators in real-time applications to humanoid robotics or other legged robots. This work presents promoting global search capability and convergence rate of the EACO applied to humanoid robots in real-time by estimating the expected convergence rate using Markov chain. Furthermore, we put a special focus on the EACO algorithm on a wide range of problems, from ACO, real-coded GAs, GAs with neural networks (NNs), particle swarm optimization (PSO) to complex robotics systems including gait synthesis, dynamic modeling of parameterizable trajectories and gait optimization of humanoid robotics. The experimental results illustrate the capability of this method to discover the premature convergence probability, tackle successfully inherent stagnation, and promote the convergence rate of the EACO-based humanoid robotics systems and demonstrated the applicability and the effectiveness of our strategy for solving sophisticated optimization tasks. We found reliable and fast walking gaits with a velocity of up to 0.47m/s using the EACO optimization strategy. These findings have significant implications for understanding and tackling inherent stagnation and poor convergence rate of the EACO and provide new insight into the genetic architectures and control optimization of humanoid robotics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
