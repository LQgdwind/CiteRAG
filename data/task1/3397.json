Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Enterprise Credit Rating via Deep Feature Crossing Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Due to the powerful learning ability on high-rank and non-linear features, deep neural networks (DNNs) are being applied to data mining and machine learning in various fields, and exhibit higher discrimination performance than conventional methods. However, the applications based on DNNs are rare in enterprise credit rating tasks because most of DNNs employ the “end-to-end” learning paradigm, which outputs the high-rank representations of objects and predictive results without any explanations. Thus, users in the financial industry cannot understand how these high-rank representations are generated, what do they mean and what relations exist with the raw inputs. Then users cannot determine whether the predictions provided by DNNs are reliable, and not trust the predictions providing by such ”black box” models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel network to explicitly model the enterprise credit rating problem using DNNs and attention mechanisms. The proposed model realizes explainable enterprise credit ratings. Experimental results obtained on real-world enterprise datasets verify that the proposed approach achieves higher performance than conventional methods, and provides insights into individual rating results and the reliability of model training.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
