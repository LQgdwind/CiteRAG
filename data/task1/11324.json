Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Protein pathways as a catalyst to directed evolution of the topology of artificial neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the present article, we propose a paradigm shift on evolving Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) towards a new bio-inspired design that is grounded on the structural properties, interactions, and dynamics of protein networks (PNs): the Artificial Protein Network (APN). This introduces several advantages previously unrealized by state-of-the-art approaches in NE: (1) We can draw inspiration from how nature, thanks to millions of years of evolution, efficiently encodes protein interactions in the DNA to translate our APN to silicon DNA. This helps bridge the gap between syntax and semantics observed in current NE approaches. (2) We can learn from how nature builds networks in our genes, allowing us to design new and smarter networks through EA evolution. (3) We can perform EA crossover/mutation operations and evolution steps, replicating the operations observed in nature directly on the genotype of networks, thus exploring and exploiting the phenotypic space, such that we avoid getting trapped in sub-optimal solutions. (4) Our novel definition of APN opens new ways to leverage our knowledge about different living things and processes from biology. (5) Using biologically inspired encodings, we can model more complex demographic and ecological relationships (e.g., virus-host or predator-prey interactions), allowing us to optimise for multiple, often conflicting objectives.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
