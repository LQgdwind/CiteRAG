Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Planning Landscape Analysis for Self-Adaptive Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. To assure performance on the fly, planning is arguably one of the most important steps for self-adaptive systems (SASs), especially when they are highly configurable with a daunting number of adaptation options. However, there has been little understanding of the planning landscape or ways by which it can be analyzed. This inevitably creates barriers to the design of better and tailored planners for SASs. In this paper, we showcase how the planning landscapes of SASs can be quantified and reasoned, particularly with respect to the different environments. By studying four diverse real-world SASs and 14 environments, we found that (1) the SAS planning landscapes often provide strong guidance to the planner, but their ruggedness and multi-modality can be the major obstacle; (2) the extents of guidance and number of global/local optima are sensitive to the changing environment, but not the ruggedness of the surface; (3) the local optima are often closer to the global optimum than other random points; and (4) there are considerable (and useful) overlaps on the global/local optima between landscapes under different environments. We then discuss the potential implications to the future work of planner designs for SASs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
