Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Attribute-based Explanation of Non-Linear Embeddings of High-Dimensional Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Embeddings of high-dimensional data are widely used to explore data, to verify analysis results, and to communicate information. Their explanation, in particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With linear projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With non-linear projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies such as attribute-based color coding are required. In this paper, we review existing augmentation techniques and discuss their limitations. We present the Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges (complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in thermodynamics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 62\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
