Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mapi-Pro: An Energy Efficient Memory Mapping Technique for Intermittent Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Battery-less technology evolved to replace battery usage in space, deep mines, and other environments to reduce cost and pollution. Non-volatile memory (NVM) based processors were explored for saving the system state during a power failure. Such devices have a small SRAM and large non-volatile memory. To make the system energy efficient, we need to use SRAM efficiently. So we must select some portions of the application and map them to either SRAM or FRAM. This paper proposes an ILP-based memory mapping technique for Intermittently powered IoT devices. Our proposed technique gives an optimal mapping choice that reduces the system’s Energy-Delay Product (EDP). We validated our system using a TI-based MSP430FR6989 and MSP430F5529 development boards. Our proposed memory configuration consumes 38.10% less EDP than the baseline configuration and 9.30% less EDP than the existing work under stable power. Our proposed configuration achieves 15.97% less EDP than the baseline configuration and 21.99% less EDP than the existing work under unstable power. This work supports intermittent computing and works efficiently during frequent power failures.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
