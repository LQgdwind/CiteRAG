Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 63 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Simply-typed constant-domain modal lambda calculus I: distanced beta reduction and combinatory logic\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. A system 𝝀υsubscript𝝀𝜐\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\upsilon} is developed that combines modal logic and simply-typed lambda calculus, and that generalizes the system studied by Montague and Gallin. Whereas Montague and Gallin worked with Church’s simple theory of types, the system 𝝀υsubscript𝝀𝜐\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\upsilon} is developed in the typed base theory most commonly used today, namely the simply-typed lambda calculus. Further, the system 𝝀υsubscript𝝀𝜐\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\upsilon} is controlled by a parameter υ𝜐\\upsilon which allows more options for state types and state variables than is present in Montague and Gallin. A main goal of the paper is to establish the basic metatheory of 𝝀υsubscript𝝀𝜐\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\upsilon}: (i) a completeness theorem is proven for β​η𝛽𝜂\\beta\\eta-reduction, and (ii) an Andrews-like characterization of Henkin models in terms of combinatory logic is given; and this involves a distanced version of β𝛽\\beta-reduction and a 𝖡𝖢𝖪𝖶𝖡𝖢𝖪𝖶\\mathsf{BCKW}-like basis rather than 𝖲𝖪𝖨𝖲𝖪𝖨\\mathsf{SKI}-like basis. Further, conservation of the maximal system 𝝀ωsubscript𝝀𝜔\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\omega} over 𝝀υsubscript𝝀𝜐\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\upsilon} is proven, and expressibility of 𝝀ωsubscript𝝀𝜔\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\omega} in 𝝀υsubscript𝝀𝜐\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\upsilon} is proven; thus these modal logics are highly expressive. Similar results are proven for the relation between 𝝀ωsubscript𝝀𝜔\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\omega} and 𝝀𝝀\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}, the corresponding ordinary simply-typed lambda calculus. This answers a question of Zimmerman in the simply-typed setting. In a companion paper this is extended to Church’s simple theory of types.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
