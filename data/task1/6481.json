      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking Data Augmentation for Robust Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data Augmentation (DA) — generating extra training samples beyond the original training set — has been widely-used in today’s unbiased VQA models to mitigate language biases. Current mainstream DA strategies are synthetic-based methods, which synthesize new samples by either editing some visual regions/words, or re-generating them from scratch. However, these synthetic samples are always unnatural and error-prone. To avoid this issue, a recent DA work composes new augmented samples by randomly pairing pristine images and other human-written questions. Unfortunately, to guarantee augmented samples have reasonable ground-truth answers, they manually design a set of heuristic rules for several question types, which extremely limits its generalization abilities. To this end, we propose a new Knowledge Distillation based Data Augmentation for VQA, dubbed KDDAug. Specifically, we first relax the requirements of reasonable image-question pairs, which can be easily applied to any question type. Then, we design a knowledge distillation (KD) based answer assignment to generate pseudo answers for all composed image-question pairs, which are robust to both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Since KDDAug is a model-agnostic DA strategy, it can be seamlessly incorporated into any VQA architecture. Extensive ablation studies on multiple backbones and benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization abilities of KDDAug.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
