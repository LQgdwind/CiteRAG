Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-based XAI through CBR: There is more to explanations than models can tell\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The underlying hypothesis of knowledge-based explainable artificial intelligence is: the data required for data-centric artificial intelligence agents (e.g., neural networks) are less diverse in contents than the data required to explain the decisions of such agents to humans. The idea is that a classifier can attain high accuracy using data that express a phenomenon from one perspective whereas the audience of explanations can entail multiple stakeholders and span diverse perspectives. We hence propose to use domain knowledge to complement the data used by agents. We formulate knowledge-based explainable artificial intelligence as a supervised data classification problem aligned with the CBR methodology. In this formulation, the inputs are case problems composed of both the inputs and outputs of the data-centric agent, and case solutions, the outputs, are explanation categories obtained from domain knowledge and subject matter experts. This formulation does not typically lead to an accurate classification, preventing the selection of the correct explanation category. Knowledge-based explainable artificial intelligence extends the data in this formulation by adding features aligned with domain knowledge that can increase accuracy when selecting explanation categories.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
