      "content": "Paper Title: Automatically Select Emotion for Response via Personality-affected Emotion Transition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To provide consistent emotional interaction with users, dialog systems should be capable to automatically select appropriate emotions for responses like humans. However, most existing works focus on rendering specified emotions in responses or empathetically respond to the emotion of users, yet the individual difference in emotion expression is overlooked. This may lead to inconsistent emotional expressions and disinterest users. To tackle this issue, we propose to equip the dialog system with personality and enable it to automatically select emotions in responses by simulating the emotion transition of humans in conversation. In detail, the emotion of the dialog system is transitioned from its preceding emotion in context. The transition is triggered by the preceding dialog context and affected by the specified personality trait. To achieve this, we first model the emotion transition in the dialog system as the variation between the preceding emotion and the response emotion in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. Then, we design neural networks to encode the preceding dialog context and the specified personality traits to compose the variation. Finally, the emotion for response is selected from the sum of the preceding emotion and the variation. We construct a dialog dataset with emotion and personality labels and conduct emotion prediction tasks for evaluation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the personality-affected emotion transition.111Our dataset is released at: github.com/preke/PELD.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
