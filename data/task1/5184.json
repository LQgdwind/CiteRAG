Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Low Regret Binary Sampling Method for Efficient Global Optimization of Univariate Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for the problem of global optimization in univariate loss functions. For the performance evaluation, we study the cumulative regret of the algorithm instead of the simple regret between our best query and the optimal value of the objective function. Although our approach has similar regret results with the traditional lower-bounding algorithms such as the Piyavskii-Shubert method for the Lipschitz continuous or Lipschitz smooth functions, it has a major computational cost advantage. In Piyavskii-Shubert method, for certain types of functions, the query points may be hard to determine (as they are solutions to additional optimization problems). However, this issue is circumvented in our binary sampling approach, where the sampling set is predetermined irrespective of the function characteristics. For a search space of [0,1]01[0,1], our approach has at most L‚Äãlog‚Å°(3‚ÄãT)ùêø3ùëáL\\log(3T) and 2.25‚ÄãH2.25ùêª2.25H regret for LùêøL-Lipschitz continuous and HùêªH-Lipschitz smooth functions respectively. We also analytically extend our results for a broader class of functions that covers more complex regularity conditions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
