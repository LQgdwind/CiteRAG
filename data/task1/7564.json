Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: DP-RAFT: A Differentially Private Recipe for Accelerated Fine-Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A major direction in differentially private machine learning is differentially private fine-tuning: pretraining a model on a source of \"public data\" and transferring the extracted features to downstream tasks. This is an important setting because many industry deployments fine-tune publicly available feature extractors on proprietary data for downstream tasks. In this paper, we carefully integrate techniques, both new and from prior work, to solve benchmark tasks in computer vision and natural language processing using differentially private fine-tuning. Our key insight is that by accelerating training with the choice of key hyperparameters, we can quickly drive the model parameters to regions in parameter space where the impact of noise is minimized. We obtain new state-of-the art performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, FashionMNIST, STL10, and PersonaChat, including 99%percent9999\\% on CIFAR10 for Œµ=1,Œ¥=1‚Äãe‚àí5formulae-sequenceùúÄ1ùõø1ùëí5\\varepsilon=1,\\delta=1e-5-DP.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
