Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Iso-CapsNet: Isomorphic Capsule Network for Brain Graph Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Brain graph representation learning serves as the fundamental technique for brain diseases diagnosis. Great efforts from both the academic and industrial communities have been devoted to brain graph representation learning in recent years. The isomorphic neural network (IsoNN) introduced recently can automatically learn the existence of sub-graph patterns in brain graphs, which is also the state-of-the-art brain graph representation learning method by this context so far. However, IsoNN fails to capture the orientations of sub-graph patterns, which may render the learned representations to be useless for many cases. In this paper, we propose a new Iso-CapsNet (Isomorphic Capsule Net) model by introducing the graph isomorphic capsules for effective brain graph representation learning. Based on the capsule dynamic routing, besides the sub-graph pattern existence confidence scores, Iso-CapsNet can also learn other sub-graph rich properties, including position, size and orientation, for calculating the class-wise digit capsules. We have compared Iso-CapsNet with both classic and state-of-the-art brain graph representation approaches with extensive experiments on four brain graph benchmark datasets. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of Iso-CapsNet, which can outperform the baseline methods with significant improvements.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
