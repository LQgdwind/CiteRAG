      "content": "Paper Title: Coverability in VASS Revisited: Improving Rackoff’s Bound to Obtain Conditional Optimality\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Seminal results establish that the coverability problem for Vector Addition Systems with States (VASS) is in EXPSPACE (Rackoff, ’78) and is EXPSPACE-hard already under unary encodings (Lipton, ’76). More precisely, Rosier and Yen later utilise Rackoff’s bounding technique to show that if coverability holds then there is a run of length at most n2𝒪​(d​log⁡d)superscript𝑛superscript2𝒪𝑑𝑑n^{2^{\\mathcal{O}(d\\log d)}}, where d𝑑d is the dimension and n𝑛n is the size of the given unary VASS. Earlier, Lipton showed that there exist instances of coverability in d𝑑d-dimensional unary VASS that are only witnessed by runs of length at least n2Ω​(d)superscript𝑛superscript2Ω𝑑n^{2^{\\Omega(d)}}. Our first result closes this gap. We improve the upper bound by removing the twice-exponentiated log⁡(d)𝑑\\log(d) factor, thus matching Lipton’s lower bound. This closes the corresponding gap for the exact space required to decide coverability. This also yields a deterministic n2𝒪​(d)superscript𝑛superscript2𝒪𝑑n^{2^{\\mathcal{O}(d)}}-time algorithm for coverability. Our second result is a matching lower bound, that there does not exist a deterministic n2o​(d)superscript𝑛superscript2𝑜𝑑n^{2^{o(d)}}-time algorithm, conditioned upon the Exponential Time Hypothesis. When analysing coverability, a standard proof technique is to consider VASS with bounded counters. Bounded VASS make for an interesting and popular model due to strong connections with timed automata. Withal, we study a natural setting where the counter bound is linear in the size of the VASS. Here the trivial exhaustive search algorithm runs in 𝒪​(nd+1)𝒪superscript𝑛𝑑1\\mathcal{O}(n^{d+1})-time. We give evidence to this being near-optimal. We prove that in dimension one this trivial algorithm is conditionally optimal, by showing that n2−o​(1)superscript𝑛2𝑜1n^{2-o(1)}-time is required under the k𝑘k-cycle hypothesis. In general fixed dimension d𝑑d, we show that nd−2−o​(1)superscript𝑛𝑑2𝑜1n^{d-2-o(1)}-time is required under the 3-uniform hyperclique hypothesis.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
