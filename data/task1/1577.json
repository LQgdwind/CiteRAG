Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Problems in AI research and how the SP System may solve them\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper describes problems in AI research and how the SP System may solve them. The SP System is described in an appendix and sources referenced there. Most of the problems considered in the paper are described by leading researchers in AI in interviews with science writer Martin Ford, and reported by him in his book Architects of Intelligence. The problems that are considered are: the need to bridge the divide between symbolic and non-symbolic kinds of knowledge and processing; the tendency of deep neural networks (DNNs) to make large and unexpected errors in recognition; the need to strengthen the representation and processing of natural languages; the challenges of unsupervised learning; the need for a coherent account of generalisation, under-generalisation, and over-generalisation; how to learn usable knowledge from a single exposure or experience; how to achieve transfer learning (incorporating old knowledge in new); how to increase the speed of learning in AI systems, and how to reduce the demands of AI learning for large volumes of data, and for large computational resources; the need for transparency in the representation and processing of knowledge; how to achieve human-like capabilities in probabilistic reasoning; the need to re-balance research towards top-down strategies, with the need to develop ‘broad AI’ (or ‘artificial general intelligence’); how to minimise the risk of accidents with self-driving vehicles; the need for strong compositionality in the structure of knowledge; the challenges of commonsense reasoning and commonsense knowledge; establishing the key importance of information compression in AI research; establishing the importance of a biological perspective in AI research; establishing whether knowledge in the brain is represented in ‘distributed’ or ‘localist’ form; how to bypass the limited scope for adaptation in deep neural networks; and how to eliminate the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Tbe evidence for how the SP System may solve these problems in AI research, with evidence for the versatility of the SP System, suggests that it provides a firmer foundation for the development of human-like general AI or ‘AGI’ than any alternative. In this research, no attempt has been made to study the important areas of motivation and emotion.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
