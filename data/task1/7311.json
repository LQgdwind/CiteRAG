Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Sequentiality in Reinforcement Learning from a Single Demonstration\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep Reinforcement Learning has been successfully applied to learn robotic control. However, the corresponding algorithms struggle when applied to problems where the agent is only rewarded after achieving a complex task. In this context, using demonstrations can significantly speed up the learning process, but demonstrations can be costly to acquire. In this paper, we propose to leverage a sequential bias to learn control policies for complex robotic tasks using a single demonstration. To do so, our method learns a goal-conditioned policy to control a system between successive low-dimensional goals. This sequential goal reaching approach raises a problem of compatibility between successive goals: we need to ensure that the state resulting from reaching a goal is compatible with the achievement of the following goals. To tackle this problem, we present a new algorithm called DCIL-II. We show that DCIL-II can solve with unprecedented sample efficiency some challenging simulated tasks such as humanoid locomotion and stand-up as well as fast running with a simulated Cassie robot. Our method leveraging sequentiality is a step towards the resolution of complex robotic tasks under minimal specification effort, a key feature for the next generation of autonomous robots.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
