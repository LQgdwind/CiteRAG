      "content": "Paper Title: The Development of a Multi-Physics Approach for Modelling the Response of Aerospace Fastener Assemblies to Lightning Attachment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work is concerned with the development of a numerical modelling approach for studying the time-accurate response of aerospace fasteners subjected to high electrical current loading from a simulated lightning strike. The electromagnetic, thermal and elastoplastic response of individual fastener components is captured by this method allowing a critical analysis of fastener design and material layering. Under high electrical current loading, ionisation of gas filled cavities in the fastener assembly can lead to viable current paths across internal voids. This ionisation can lead to localised pockets of high pressure plasma through the Joule heating effect. The multi-physics approach developed in this paper extends an existing methodology that allows a two-way dynamic non-linear coupling of the plasma arc, the titanium aerospace fastener components, the surrounding aircraft panels, the internal supporting structure and internal plasma-filled cavities. Results from this model are compared with experimental measurements of a titanium fastener holding together carbon composite panels separated by thin dielectric layers. The current distribution measurements are shown to be accurately reproduced. A parameter study is used to assess the internal cavity modelling strategy and to quantify the relation between the internal cavity plasma pressure, the electrical current distribution and changes in the internal cavity geometry.
