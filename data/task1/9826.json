      "content": "Paper Title: The Quest of Finding the Antidote to Sparse Double Descent\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In energy-efficient schemes, finding the optimal size of deep learning models is very important and has a broad impact. Meanwhile, recent studies have reported an unexpected phenomenon, the sparse double descent: as the model’s sparsity increases, the performance first worsens, then improves, and finally deteriorates. Such a non-monotonic behavior raises serious questions about the optimal model’s size to maintain high performance: the model needs to be sufficiently over-parametrized, but having too many parameters wastes training resources. In this paper, we aim to find the best trade-off efficiently. More precisely, we tackle the occurrence of the sparse double descent and present some solutions to avoid it. Firstly, we show that a simple ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} regularization method can help to mitigate this phenomenon but sacrifices the performance/sparsity compromise. To overcome this problem, we then introduce a learning scheme in which distilling knowledge regularizes the student model. Supported by experimental results achieved using typical image classification setups, we show that this approach leads to the avoidance of such a phenomenon.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
