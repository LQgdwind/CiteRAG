Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Space Complexity of Euclidean Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The (k,z)𝑘𝑧(k,z)-Clustering problem in Euclidean space ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} has been extensively studied. Given the scale of data involved, compression methods for the Euclidean (k,z)𝑘𝑧(k,z)-Clustering problem, such as data compression and dimension reduction, have received significant attention in the literature. However, the space complexity of the clustering problem, specifically, the number of bits required to compress the cost function within a multiplicative error ε𝜀\\varepsilon, remains unclear in existing literature. This paper initiates the study of space complexity for Euclidean (k,z)𝑘𝑧(k,z)-Clustering and offers both upper and lower bounds. Our space bounds are nearly tight when k𝑘k is constant, indicating that storing a coreset, a well-known data compression approach, serves as the optimal compression scheme. Furthermore, our lower bound result for (k,z)𝑘𝑧(k,z)-Clustering establishes a tight space bound of Θ​(n​d)Θ𝑛𝑑\\Theta(nd) for terminal embedding, where n𝑛n represents the dataset size. Our technical approach leverages new geometric insights for principal angles and discrepancy methods, which may hold independent interest.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
