      "content": "Paper Title: Relating Implicit Bias and Adversarial Attacks through Intrinsic Dimension\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract ††footnotetext: Code is available at https://github.com/lorenzobasile/ImplicitBiasAdversarial Despite their impressive performance in classification, neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These attacks are small perturbations of the input data designed to fool the model. Naturally, a question arises regarding the potential connection between the architecture, settings, or properties of the model and the nature of the attack. In this work, we aim to shed light on this problem by focusing on the implicit bias of the neural network, which refers to its inherent inclination to favor specific patterns or outcomes. Specifically, we investigate one aspect of the implicit bias, which involves the essential Fourier frequencies required for accurate image classification. We conduct tests to assess the statistical relationship between these frequencies and those necessary for a successful attack. To delve into this relationship, we propose a new method that can uncover non-linear correlations between sets of coordinates, which, in our case, are the aforementioned frequencies. By exploiting the entanglement between intrinsic dimension and correlation, we provide empirical evidence that the network bias in Fourier space and the target frequencies of adversarial attacks are closely tied.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
