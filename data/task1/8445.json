      "content": "Paper Title: When does Metropolized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provably outperform Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We analyze the mixing time of Metropolized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with the leapfrog integrator to sample from a distribution on d whose log-density is smooth, has Lipschitz Hessian in Frobenius norm and satisfies isoperimetry. We bound the gradient complexity to reach œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon error in total variation distance from a warm start by O~‚Äã(d1/4‚Äãpolylog‚Äã(1/œµ))~ùëÇsuperscriptùëë14polylog1italic-œµ\\tilde{O}(d^{1/4}\\text{polylog}(1/\\epsilon)) and demonstrate the benefit of choosing the number of leapfrog steps to be larger than 1. To surpass previous analysis on Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) that has O~‚Äã(d1/2‚Äãpolylog‚Äã(1/œµ))~ùëÇsuperscriptùëë12polylog1italic-œµ\\tilde{O}(d^{1/2}\\text{polylog}(1/\\epsilon)) dimension dependency [WSC22], we reveal a key feature in our proof that the joint distribution of the location and velocity variables of the discretization of the continuous HMC dynamics stays approximately invariant. This key feature, when shown via induction over the number of leapfrog steps, enables us to obtain estimates on moments of various quantities that appear in the acceptance rate control of Metropolized HMC. Moreover, to deal with another bottleneck on the HMC proposal distribution overlap control in the literature, we provide a new approach to upper bound the Kullback-Leibler divergence between push-forwards of the Gaussian distribution through HMC dynamics initialized at two different points. Notably, our analysis does not require log-concavity or independence of the marginals, and only relies on an isoperimetric inequality. To illustrate the applicability of our result, several examples of natural functions that fall into our framework are discussed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
