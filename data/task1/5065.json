Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Computer Vision Based Parking Optimization System\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract An improvement in technology is linearly related to time and time-relevant problems. It has been seen that as time progresses, the number of problems humans face also increases. However, technology to resolve these problems tends to improve as well [1]. One of the earliest existing problems which started with the invention of vehicles was parking. The ease of resolving this problem using technology has evolved over the years but the problem of parking still remains unsolved. The main reason behind this is that parking doesn’t only involve one problem but it consists of a set of problems within itself. One of these problems is the occupancy detection of the parking slots in a distributed parking ecosystem. In a distributed system, users would find preferable parking spaces as opposed to random parking spaces. In this paper, we propose a web-based application as a solution for parking space detection in different parking spaces. The solution is based on Computer Vision (CV) [2][3] and is built using the Django framework written in Python 3.0. The solution works to resolve the occupancy detection problem along with providing the user the option to determine the block based on availability and his preference. The evaluation results for our proposed system are promising and efficient. The proposed system can also be integrated with different systems and be used for solving other relevant parking problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
