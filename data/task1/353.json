      "content": "Paper Title: The Parameterized Complexity of Guarding Almost Convex Polygons11footnote 1A preliminary version of this article is accepted for publication at the 36th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2020).\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Art Gallery problem is a fundamental visibility problem in Computational Geometry. The input consists of a simple polygon P𝑃P, (possibly infinite) sets G𝐺G and C𝐶C of points within P𝑃P, and an integer k𝑘k; the task is to decide if at most k𝑘k guards can be placed on points in G𝐺G so that every point in C𝐶C is visible to at least one guard. In the classic formulation of Art Gallery, G𝐺G and C𝐶C consist of all the points within P𝑃P. Other well-known variants restrict G𝐺G and C𝐶C to consist either of all the points on the boundary of P𝑃P or of all the vertices of P𝑃P. Recently, three new important discoveries were made: the above mentioned variants of Art Gallery are all W[1]-hard with respect to k𝑘k [Bonnet and Miltzow, ESA’16], the classic variant has an 𝒪​(log⁡k)𝒪𝑘{\\mathcal{O}}(\\log k)-approximation algorithm [Bonnet and Miltzow, SoCG’17], and it may require irrational guards [Abrahamsen et al., SoCG’17]. Building upon the third result, the classic variant and the case where G𝐺G consists only of all the points on the boundary of P𝑃P were both shown to be ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete [Abrahamsen et al., STOC’18]. Even when both G𝐺G and C𝐶C consist only of all the points on the boundary of P𝑃P, the problem is not known to be in NP. Given the first discovery, the following question was posed by Giannopoulos [Lorentz Center Workshop, 2016]: Is Art Gallery FPT with respect to r𝑟r, the number of reflex vertices? In light of the developments above, we focus on the variant where G𝐺G and C𝐶C consist of all the vertices of P𝑃P, called Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery. Apart from being a variant of Art Gallery, this case can also be viewed as the classic Dominating Set problem in the visibility graph of a polygon. In this article, we show that the answer to the question by Giannopoulos is positive: Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery is solvable in time r𝒪​(r2)​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑟𝒪superscript𝑟2superscript𝑛𝒪1r^{{\\mathcal{O}}(r^{2})}n^{{\\mathcal{O}}(1)}. Furthermore, our approach extends to assert that Vertex-Boundary Art Gallery and Boundary-Vertex Art Gallery are both FPT as well. To this end, we utilize structural properties of “almost convex polygons” to present a two-stage reduction from Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery to a new constraint satisfaction problem (whose solution is also provided in this paper) where constraints have arity 222 and involve monotone functions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
