      "content": "Paper Title: On Inapproximability of Reconfiguration Problems: PSPACE-Hardness and some Tight NP-Hardness Results\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The field of combinatorial reconfiguration studies search problems with a focus on transforming one feasible solution into another. Recently, Ohsaka [STACS‚Äô23] put forth the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis (RIH), which roughly asserts that there is some Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0 such that given as input a kùëòk-CSP instance (for some constant kùëòk) over some constant sized alphabet, and two satisfying assignments œàssubscriptùúìùë†\\psi_{s} and œàtsubscriptùúìùë°\\psi_{t}, it is PSPACE-hard to find a sequence of assignments starting from œàssubscriptùúìùë†\\psi_{s} and ending at œàtsubscriptùúìùë°\\psi_{t} such that every assignment in the sequence satisfies at least (1‚àíŒµ)1ùúÄ(1-\\varepsilon) fraction of the constraints and also that every assignment in the sequence is obtained by changing its immediately preceding assignment (in the sequence) on exactly one variable. Assuming RIH, many important reconfiguration problems have been shown to be PSPACE-hard to approximate by Ohsaka [STACS‚Äô23; SODA‚Äô24]. In this paper, we prove RIH, thus establishing the first (constant factor) PSPACE-hardness of approximation results for many reconfiguration problems, resolving an open question posed by Ito et al. [TCS‚Äô11]. Our proof uses known constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs of Proximity (in a black-box manner) to create the gap. Independent to our work, Hirahara and Ohsaka [STOC‚Äô24] have also proved RIH. We also prove that the aforementioned kùëòk-CSP Reconfiguration problem is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of 1/2+Œµ12ùúÄ1/2+\\varepsilon (for any Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0) when k=2ùëò2k=2. We complement this with a (1/2‚àíŒµ)12ùúÄ(1/2-\\varepsilon)-approximation polynomial time algorithm, which improves upon a (1/4‚àíŒµ)14ùúÄ(1/4-\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm of Ohsaka [2023] (again for any Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0). Finally, we show that Set Cover Reconfiguration is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of 2‚àíŒµ2ùúÄ2-\\varepsilon for any constant Œµ>0ùúÄ0\\varepsilon>0, which matches the simple linear-time 2-approximation algorithm by Ito et al. [TCS‚Äô11].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
