      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Algorithm Execution: Estimating Computable Properties of Black-box Functions Using Mutual Information\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In many real-world problems, we want to infer some property of an expensive black-box function fùëìf, given a budget of TùëáT function evaluations. One example is budget constrained global optimization of fùëìf, for which Bayesian optimization is a popular method. Other properties of interest include local optima, level sets, integrals, or graph-structured information induced by fùëìf. Often, we can find an algorithm ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} to compute the desired property, but it may require far more than TùëáT queries to execute. Given such an ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A}, and a prior distribution over fùëìf, we refer to the problem of inferring the output of ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} using TùëáT evaluations as Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX). To tackle this problem, we present a procedure, InfoBAX, that sequentially chooses queries that maximize mutual information with respect to the algorithm‚Äôs output. Applying this to Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm, for instance, we infer shortest paths in synthetic and real-world graphs with black-box edge costs. Using evolution strategies, we yield variants of Bayesian optimization that target local, rather than global, optima. On these problems, InfoBAX uses up to 500 times fewer queries to fùëìf than required by the original algorithm. Our method is closely connected to other Bayesian optimal experimental design procedures such as entropy search methods and optimal sensor placement using Gaussian processes.111See the project website here: https://willieneis.github.io/bax-website222Our code is availabile here: https://github.com/willieneis/bayesian-algorithm-execution333This paper appears in Proceedings of the 38thth{}^{\\text{th}} International Conference on Machine Learning, 2021.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
