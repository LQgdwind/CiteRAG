Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Voxel Structure-based Mesh Reconstruction from a 3D Point Cloud\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Mesh reconstruction from a 3D point cloud is an important topic in the fields of computer graphic, computer vision, and multimedia analysis. In this paper, we propose a voxel structure-based mesh reconstruction framework. It provides the intrinsic metric to improve the accuracy of local region detection. Based on the detected local regions, an initial reconstructed mesh can be obtained. With the mesh optimization in our framework, the initial reconstructed mesh is optimized into an isotropic one with the important geometric features such as external and internal edges. The experimental results indicate that our framework shows great advantages over peer ones in terms of mesh quality, geometric feature keeping, and processing speed. The source code of the proposed method is publicly available111Code Link: github.com/vvvwo/Parallel-Structure-for-Meshing..\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
