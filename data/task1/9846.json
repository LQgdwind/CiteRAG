Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Interpretable Sequence Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Categorical sequence clustering plays a crucial role in various fields, but the lack of interpretability in cluster assignments poses significant challenges. Sequences inherently lack explicit features, and existing sequence clustering algorithms heavily rely on complex representations, making it difficult to explain their results. To address this issue, we propose a method called Interpretable Sequence Clustering Tree (ISCT), which combines sequential patterns with a concise and interpretable tree structure. ISCT leverages k‚àí1ùëò1k-1 patterns to generate kùëòk leaf nodes, corresponding to kùëòk clusters, which provides an intuitive explanation on how each cluster is formed. More precisely, ISCT first projects sequences into random subspaces and then utilizes the kùëòk-means algorithm to obtain high-quality initial cluster assignments. Subsequently, it constructs a pattern-based decision tree using a boosting-based construction strategy in which sequences are re-projected and re-clustered at each node before mining the top-111 discriminative splitting pattern. Experimental results on 14 real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method provides an interpretable tree structure while delivering fast and accurate cluster assignments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
