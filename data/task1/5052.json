Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Clustering Active Learning for Person Re-identification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Supervised person re-identification (re-id) approaches require a large amount of pairwise manual labeled data, which is not applicable in most real-world scenarios for re-id deployment. On the other hand, unsupervised re-id methods rely on unlabeled data to train models but performs poorly compared with supervised re-id methods. In this work, we aim to combine unsupervised re-id learning with a small number of human annotations to achieve a competitive performance. Towards this goal, we present a Unsupervised Clustering Active Learning (UCAL) re-id deep learning approach. It is capable of incrementally discovering the representative centroid-pairs and requiring human annotate them. These few labeled representative pairwise data can improve the unsupervised representation learning model with other large amounts of unlabeled data. More importantly, because the representative centroid-pairs are selected for annotation, UCAL can work with very low-cost human effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art active learning methods on three re-id benchmark datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
