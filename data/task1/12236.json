Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Spike2Former: Efficient Spiking Transformer for High-performance Image Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have a low-power advantage but perform poorly in image segmentation tasks. The reason is that directly converting neural networks with complex architectural designs for segmentation tasks into spiking versions leads to performance degradation and non-convergence. To address this challenge, we first identify the modules in the architecture design that lead to the severe reduction in spike firing, make targeted improvements, and propose Spike2Former architecture. Second, we propose normalized integer spiking neurons to solve the training stability problem of SNNs with complex architectures. We set a new state-of-the-art for SNNs in various semantic segmentation datasets, with a significant improvement of +12.7%\\mathbf{+12.7\\%} mIoU and 5.0×\\mathbf{5.0\\times} efficiency on ADE20K, +14.3%\\mathbf{+14.3\\%} mIoU and 5.2×\\mathbf{5.2\\times} efficiency on VOC2012, and +9.1%\\mathbf{+9.1\\%} mIoU and 6.6×\\mathbf{6.6\\times} efficiency on CityScapes. Our code is available at https://github.com/BICLab/Spike2Former\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
