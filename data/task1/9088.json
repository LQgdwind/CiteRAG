Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sample-Level Weighting for Multi-Task Learning with Auxiliary Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Multi-task learning (MTL) can improve the generalization performance of neural networks by sharing representations with related tasks. Nonetheless, MTL can also degrade performance through harmful interference between tasks. Recent work has pursued task-specific loss weighting as a solution for this interference. However, existing algorithms treat tasks as atomic, lacking the ability to explicitly separate harmful and helpful signals beyond the task level. To this end, we propose SLGrad, a sample-level weighting algorithm for multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks. Through sample-specific task weights, SLGrad reshapes the task distributions during training to eliminate harmful auxiliary signals and augment useful task signals. Substantial generalization performance gains are observed on (semi-) synthetic datasets and common supervised multi-task problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
