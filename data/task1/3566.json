Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cervical Cytology Classification Using PCA & GWO Enhanced Deep Features Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Cervical cancer is one of the most deadly and common diseases among women worldwide. It is completely curable if diagnosed in an early stage, but the tedious and costly detection procedure makes it unviable to conduct population-wise screening. Thus, to augment the effort of the clinicians, in this paper, we propose a fully automated framework that utilizes Deep Learning and feature selection using evolutionary optimization for cytology image classification. The proposed framework extracts Deep feature from several Convolution Neural Network models and uses a two-step feature reduction approach to to ensure reduction in computation cost and faster convergence. The features extracted from the CNN models form a large feature space whose dimensionality is reduced using Principal Component Analysis while preserving 99% of the variance. A non-redundant, optimal feature subset is selected from this feature space using an evolutionary optimization algorithm, the Grey Wolf Optimizer, thus improving the classification performance. Finally, the selected feature subset is used to train an SVM classifier for generating the final predictions. The proposed framework is evaluated on three publicly available benchmark datasets: Mendeley Liquid Based Cytology (4-class) dataset, Herlev Pap Smear (7-class) dataset, and the SIPaKMeD Pap Smear (5-class) dataset achieving classification accuracies of 99.47%, 98.32% and 97.87% respectively, thus justifying the reliability of the approach. The relevant codes for the proposed approach can be found in: GitHub\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
