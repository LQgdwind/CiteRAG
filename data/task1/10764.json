Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Personalized Behavior-Aware Transformer for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Sequential Recommendation (SR) captures users’ dynamic preferences by modeling how users transit among items. However, SR models that utilize only single type of behavior interaction data encounter performance degradation when the sequences are short. To tackle this problem, we focus on Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation (MBSR) in this paper, which aims to leverage time-evolving heterogeneous behavioral dependencies for better exploring users’ potential intents on the target behavior. Solving MBSR is challenging. On the one hand, users exhibit diverse multi-behavior patterns due to personal characteristics. On the other hand, there exists comprehensive co-influence between behavior correlations and item collaborations, the intensity of which is deeply affected by temporal factors. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Personalized Behavior-Aware Transformer framework (PBAT) for MBSR problem, which models personalized patterns and multifaceted sequential collaborations in a novel way to boost recommendation performance. First, PBAT develops a personalized behavior pattern generator in the representation layer, which extracts dynamic and discriminative behavior patterns for sequential learning. Second, PBAT reforms the self-attention layer with a behavior-aware collaboration extractor, which introduces a fused behavior-aware attention mechanism for incorporating both behavioral and temporal impacts into collaborative transitions. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our framework. Our implementation code is released at https://github.com/TiliaceaeSU/PBAT.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
