Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Storage-Effective BTB Organization for Servers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many contemporary applications feature multi-megabyte instruction footprints that overwhelm the capacity of branch target buffers (BTB) and instruction caches (L1-I), causing frequent front-end stalls that inevitably hurt performance. BTB capacity is crucial for performance as a sufficiently large BTB enables the front-end to accurately resolve the upcoming execution path and steer instruction fetch appropriately. Moreover, it also enables highly effective fetch-directed instruction prefetching that can eliminate a large portion L1-I misses. For these reasons, commercial processors allocate vast amounts of storage capacity to BTBs. This work aims to reduce BTB storage requirements by optimizing the organization of BTB entries. Our key insight is that storing branch target offsets, instead of full or compressed targets, can drastically reduce BTB storage cost as the vast majority of dynamic branches have short offsets requiring just a handful of bits to encode. Based on this insight, we size the ways of a set associative BTB to hold different number of target offset bits such that each way stores offsets within a particular range. Doing so enables a dramatic reduction in storage for target addresses. Our final design, called BTB-X, uses an 8-way set associative BTB with differently sized ways that enables it to track about 2.24x more branches than a conventional BTB and 1.3x more branches than a storage-optimized state-of-the-art BTB organization, called PDede, with the same storage budget.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
