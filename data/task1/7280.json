      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Treatment Adherence of Tuberculosis Patients at Scale\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious bacterial disease, is a significant cause of death, especially in low-income countries, with an estimated ten million new cases reported globally in 202020202020. While TB is treatable, non-adherence to the medication regimen is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, proactively identifying patients at risk of dropping off their medication regimen enables corrective measures to mitigate adverse outcomes. Using a proxy measure of extreme non-adherence and a dataset of nearly 700,000700000700,000 patients from four states in India, we formulate and solve the machine learning (ML) problem of early prediction of non-adherence based on a custom rank-based metric. We train ML models and evaluate against baselines, achieving a ∼100%similar-toabsentpercent100\\sim 100\\% lift over rule-based baselines and ∼214%similar-toabsentpercent214\\sim 214\\% over a random classifier, taking into account country-wide large-scale future deployment. We deal with various issues in the process, including data quality, high-cardinality categorical data, low target prevalence, distribution shift, variation across cohorts, algorithmic fairness, and the need for robustness and explainability. Our findings indicate that risk stratification of non-adherent patients is a viable, deployable-at-scale ML solution. As the official AI partner of India’s Central TB Division, we are working on multiple city and state-level pilots with the goal of pan-India deployment.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
