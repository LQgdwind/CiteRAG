      "content": "Paper Title: ATM-R: An Adaptive Tradeoff Model with Reference Points for Constrained Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The goal of constrained multiobjective evolutionary optimization is to obtain a set of well-converged and well-distributed feasible solutions. To complete this goal, there should be a tradeoff among feasibility, diversity, and convergence. However, it is nontrivial to balance these three elements simultaneously by using a single tradeoff model since the importance of each element varies in different evolutionary phases. As an alternative, we adapt different tradeoff models in different phases and propose a novel algorithm called ATM-R. In the infeasible phase, ATM-R takes the tradeoff between diversity and feasibility into account, aiming to move the population toward feasible regions from diverse search directions. In the semi-feasible phase, ATM-R promotes the transition from “the tradeoff between feasibility and diversity” to “the tradeoff between diversity and convergence”, which can facilitate the discovering of enough feasible regions and speed up the search for the feasible Pareto optima in succession. In the feasible phase, the tradeoff between diversity and convergence is considered to attain a set of well-converged and well-distributed feasible solutions. It is worth noting that the merits of reference points are leveraged in ATM-R to accomplish these tradeoff models. Also, in ATM-R, a multiphase mating selection strategy is developed to generate promising solutions beneficial to different evolutionary phases. Systemic experiments on a wide range of benchmark test functions demonstrate that ATM-R is effective and competitive, compared against five state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
