Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Network-wide Traffic Signal Control Optimization Using a Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Inefficient traffic control may cause numerous problems such as traffic congestion and energy waste. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning method, named KS-DDPG (Knowledge Sharing Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient ) to achieve optimal control by enhancing the cooperation between traffic signals. By introducing the knowledge-sharing enabled communication protocol, each agent can access to the collective representation of the traffic environment collected by all agents. The proposed method is evaluated through two experiments respectively using synthetic and real-world datasets. The comparison with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning-based and conventional transportation methods demonstrate the proposed KS-DDPG has significant efficiency in controlling large-scale transportation networks and coping with fluctuations in traffic flow. In addition, the introduced communication mechanism has also been proven to speed up the convergence of the model without significantly increasing the computational burden.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
