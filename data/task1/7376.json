Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Personalized Federated Learning with Hidden Information on Personalized Prior\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning (FL for simplification) is a distributed machine learning technique that utilizes global servers and collaborative clients to achieve privacy-preserving global model training without direct data sharing. However, heterogeneous data problem, as one of FL’s main problems, makes it difficult for the global model to perform effectively on each client’s local data. Thus, personalized federated learning (PFL for simplification) aims to improve the performance of the model on local data as much as possible. Bayesian learning, where the parameters of the model are seen as random variables with a prior assumption, is a feasible solution to the heterogeneous data problem due to the tendency that the more local data the model use, the more it focuses on the local data, otherwise focuses on the prior. When Bayesian learning is applied to PFL, the global model provides global knowledge as a prior to the local training process. In this paper, we employ Bayesian learning to model PFL by assuming a prior in the scaled exponential family, and therefore propose pFedBreD, a framework to solve the problem we model using Bregman divergence regularization. Empirically, our experiments show that, under the prior assumption of the spherical Gaussian and the first order strategy of mean selection, our proposal significantly outcompetes other PFL algorithms on multiple public benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
