      "content": "Paper Title: Controlled Learning of Pointwise Nonlinearities in Neural-Network-Like ArchitecturesThe research leading to these results was funded in part by the Swiss National Science Foundation under Grant 200020_219356 and the European Research Council under Grant ERC-2020-AdG FunLearn-101020573.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a general variational framework for the training of freeform nonlinearities in layered computational architectures subject to some slope constraints. The regularization that we add to the traditional training loss penalizes the second-order total variation of each trainable activation. The slope constraints allow us to impose properties such as 1-Lipschitz stability, firm non-expansiveness, and monotonicity/invertibility. These properties are crucial to ensure the proper functioning of certain classes of signal-processing algorithms (e.g., plug-and-play schemes, unrolled proximal gradient, invertible flows). We prove that the global optimum of the stated constrained-optimization problem is achieved with nonlinearities that are adaptive nonuniform linear splines. We then show how to solve the resulting function-optimization problem numerically by representing the nonlinearities in a suitable (nonuniform) B-spline basis. Finally, we illustrate the use of our framework with the data-driven design of (weakly) convex regularizers for the denoising of images and the resolution of inverse problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
