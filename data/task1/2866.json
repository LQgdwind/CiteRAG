Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adjacency Graphs of Polyhedral Surfaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study whether a given graph can be realized as an adjacency graph of the polygonal cells of a polyhedral surface in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. We show that every graph is realizable as a polyhedral surface with arbitrary polygonal cells, and that this is not true if we require the cells to be convex. In particular, if the given graph contains K5subscriptùêæ5K_{5}, K5,81subscriptùêæ581K_{5,81}, or any nonplanar 333-tree as a subgraph, no such realization exists. On the other hand, all planar graphs, K4,4subscriptùêæ44K_{4,4}, and K3,5subscriptùêæ35K_{3,5} can be realized with convex cells. The same holds for any subdivision of any graph where each edge is subdivided at least once, and, by a result from McMullen et al. (1983), for any hypercube. Our results have implications on the maximum density of graphs describing polyhedral surfaces with convex cells: The realizability of hypercubes shows that the maximum number of edges over all realizable nùëõn-vertex graphs is in Œ©‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)Œ©ùëõùëõ\\Omega(n\\log n). From the non-realizability of K5,81subscriptùêæ581K_{5,81}, we obtain that any realizable nùëõn-vertex graph has ùí™‚Äã(n9/5)ùí™superscriptùëõ95\\mathcal{O}(n^{9/5}) edges. As such, these graphs can be considerably denser than planar graphs, but not arbitrarily dense.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
