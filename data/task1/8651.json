      "content": "Paper Title: Single Node Injection Label Specificity Attack on Graph Neural Networks via Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various real-world applications. However, recent studies highlight the vulnerability of GNNs to malicious perturbations. Previous adversaries primarily focus on graph modifications or node injections to existing graphs, yielding promising results but with notable limitations. Graph modification attack (GMA) requires manipulation of the original graph, which is often impractical, while graph injection attack (GIA) necessitates training a surrogate model in the black-box setting, leading to significant performance degradation due to divergence between the surrogate architecture and the actual victim model. Furthermore, most methods concentrate on a single attack goal and lack a generalizable adversary to develop distinct attack strategies for diverse goals, thus limiting precise control over victim model behavior in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we present a gradient-free generalizable adversary that injects a single malicious node to manipulate the classification result of a target node in the black-box evasion setting. Specifically, we model the single node injection label specificity attack as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose Gradient-free Generalizable Single Node Injection Attack, namely G2-SNIA, a reinforcement learning framework employing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). By directly querying the victim model, G2-SNIA learns patterns from exploration to achieve diverse attack goals with extremely limited attack budgets. Through comprehensive experiments over three acknowledged benchmark datasets and four prominent GNNs in the most challenging and realistic scenario, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed G2-SNIA over the existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, by comparing G2-SNIA with multiple white-box evasion baselines, we confirm its capacity to generate solutions comparable to those of the best adversaries.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
