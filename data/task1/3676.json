Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hard hat wearing detection based on head keypoint localization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, a lot of attention is paid to deep learning methods in the context of vision-based construction site safety systems. However, still there is no reliable way to establish the relationship between supervised construction workers and their basic personal protective equipment, like hard hats. To address this problem, a novel deep learning method combining object detection, keypoint localization, and simple rule-based reasoning is proposed in this article. In tests, this solution surpassed the previous methods based on the relative bounding box position of different instances, as well as direct detection of hard hat wearers and non-wearers. Achieving MS COCO style overall AP of 67.5% compared to 66.4% and 66.3% achieved by the above-mentioned approaches, with class specific AP for hard hat non-wearers of 64.1% compared to 63.0% and 60.3%. The results show that the conjunction of deep learning methods with humanly-interpretable rule-based algorithm is better suited for detection of hard hat non-wearers. Code is available at barwojcik/hard_hats.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
