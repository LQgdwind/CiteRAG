Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sablas: Learning Safe Control for Black-box Dynamical Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Control certificates based on barrier functions have been a powerful tool to generate probably safe control policies for dynamical systems. However, existing methods based on barrier certificates are normally for white-box systems with differentiable dynamics, which makes them inapplicable to many practical applications where the system is a black-box and cannot be accurately modeled. On the other side, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods for black-box systems suffer from lack of safety guarantees and low sampling efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can learn safe control policies and barrier certificates for black-box dynamical systems, without requiring for an accurate system model. Our method re-designs the loss function to back-propagate gradient to the control policy even when the black-box dynamical system is non-differentiable, and we show that the safety certificates hold on the black-box system. Empirical results in simulation show that our method can significantly improve the performance of the learned policies by achieving nearly 100% safety and goal reaching rates using much fewer training samples, compared to state-of-the-art black-box safe control methods. Our learned agents can also generalize to unseen scenarios while keeping the original performance.
