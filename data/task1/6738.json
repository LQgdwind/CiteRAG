      "content": "Paper Title: Self-support topology optimization considering distortion for metal additive manufacturing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes a self-support topology optimization method that considers distortion to improve the manufacturability of additive manufacturing. First, a self-support constraint is proposed that combines an overhang angle constraint with an adjustable degree of the dripping effect and a thermal constraint for heat dissipation in the building process. Next, we introduce a mechanical model based on the inherent strain method in the building process and propose a constraint that can suppress distortion. An optimization problem is formulated to satisfy all constraints, and an optimization algorithm based on level-set-based topology optimization is constructed. Finally, two- and three-dimensional optimization examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology optimization method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
