Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Microwave Imaging is an essential technique for reconstructing the electrical properties of an inaccessible medium. Many approaches have been proposed employing algorithms to solve the Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problem associated with this technique. In addition to the algorithm, one needs to implement adequate structures to represent the problem domain, the input data, the results of the adopted metrics, and experimentation routines. We introduce an open-source Python library that offers a modular and standardized framework for implementing and evaluating the performance of algorithms for the problem. Based on the implementation of fundamental components for the execution of algorithms, this library aims to facilitate the development and discussion of new methods. Through a modular structure organized into classes, researchers can design their case studies and benchmarking experiments relying on features such as test randomization, specific metrics, and statistical comparison. To the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, it is the first time that such tools for benchmarking and comparison are introduced for microwave imaging algorithms. In addition, two new metrics for location and shape recovery are presented. In this work, we introduce the principles for the design of the problem components and provide studies to exemplify the main aspects of this library. It is freely distributed through a Github repository that can be accessed from https://andre-batista.github.io/eispy2d/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
