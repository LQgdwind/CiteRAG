Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Simulating the Impact of Dynamic Rerouting on Metropolitan-Scale Traffic Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The rapid introduction of mobile navigation aides that use real-time road network information to suggest alternate routes to drivers is making it more difficult for researchers and government transportation agencies to understand and predict the dynamics of congested transportation systems. Computer simulation is a key capability for these organizations to analyze hypothetical scenarios; however, the complexity of transportation systems makes it challenging for them to simulate very large geographical regions, such as multi-city metropolitan areas. In this paper, we describe the Mobiliti traffic simulator, which includes mechanisms to capture congestion delays, timing constraints, and link storage capacity constraints. The simulator is designed to support distributed memory parallel execution and be scalable on high-performance computing platforms. We introduce a method to model dynamic rerouting behavior with the addition of vehicle controller actors and reroute request events. We demonstrate the potential of the simulator by analyzing the impact of varying the population penetration rate of dynamic rerouting on the San Francisco Bay Area road network. Using high-performance parallel computing, we can simulate a day of the San Francisco Bay Area with 19 million vehicle trips with 50 percent dynamic rerouting penetration over a road network with 0.5 million nodes and 1 million links in less than three minutes. We present an analysis of system-level impacts when changing the dynamic rerouting penetration rate and examine the varying effects on different functional classes and geographical regions. Finally, we present a validation of the simulation results compared to real world data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
