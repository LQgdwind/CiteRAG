Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Crafting Generative Art through Genetic Improvement: Managing Creative Outputs in Diverse Fitness Landscapes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generative art is a rules-driven approach to creating artistic outputs in various mediums. For example, a fluid simulation can govern the flow of colored pixels across a digital display or a rectangle placement algorithm can yield a Mondrian-style painting. Previously, we investigated how genetic improvement, a sub-field of genetic programming, can automatically create and optimize generative art drawing programs. One challenge of applying genetic improvement to generative art is defining fitness functions and their interaction in a many-objective evolutionary algorithm such as Lexicase selection. Here, we assess the impact of each fitness function in terms of the their individual effects on generated images, characteristics of generated programs, and impact of bloat on this specific domain. Furthermore, we have added an additional fitness function that uses a classifier for mimicking a human’s assessment as to whether an output is considered as “art.” This classifier is trained on a dataset of input images resembling the glitch art aesthetic that we aim to create. Our experimental results show that with few fitness functions, individual generative techniques sweep across populations. Moreover, we found that compositions tended to be driven by one technique with our current fitness functions. Lastly, we show that our classifier is best suited for filtering out noisy images, ideally leading towards more outputs relevant to user preference.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
