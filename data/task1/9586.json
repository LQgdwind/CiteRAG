Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: STL: A Signed and Truncated Logarithm Activation Function for Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Activation functions play an essential role in neural networks. They provide the non-linearity for the networks. Therefore, their properties are important for neural networks’ accuracy and running performance. In this paper, we present a novel signed and truncated logarithm function as activation function. The proposed activation function has significantly better mathematical properties, such as being odd function, monotone, differentiable, having unbounded value range, and a continuous nonzero gradient. These properties make it an excellent choice as an activation function. We compare it with other well-known activation functions in several well-known neural networks. The results confirm that it is the state-of-the-art. The suggested activation function can be applied in a large range of neural networks where activation functions are necessary.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
