Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-View Conformal Learning for Heterogeneous Sensor Fusion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Being able to assess the confidence of individual predictions in machine learning models is crucial for decision making scenarios. Specially, in critical applications such as medical diagnosis, security, and unmanned vehicles, to name a few. In the last years, complex predictive models have had great success in solving hard tasks and new methods are being proposed every day. While the majority of new developments in machine learning models focus on improving the overall performance, less effort is put on assessing the trustworthiness of individual predictions, and even to a lesser extent, in the context of sensor fusion. To this end, we build and test multi-view and single-view conformal models for heterogeneous sensor fusion. Our models provide theoretical marginal confidence guarantees since they are based on the conformal prediction framework. We also propose a multi-view semi-conformal model based on sets intersection. Through comprehensive experimentation, we show that multi-view models perform better than single-view models not only in terms of accuracy-based performance metrics (as it has already been shown in several previous works) but also in conformal measures that provide uncertainty estimation. Our results also showed that multi-view models generate prediction sets with less uncertainty compared to single-view models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
