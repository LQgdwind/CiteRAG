      "content": "Paper Title: ChatAgri: Exploring Potentials of ChatGPT on Cross-linguistic Agricultural Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the era of sustainable smart agriculture, a massive amount of agricultural news text is being posted on the Internet, in which massive agricultural knowledge has been accumulated. In this context, it is urgent to explore effective text classification techniques for users to access the required agricultural knowledge with high efficiency. Mainstream deep learning approaches employing fine-tuning strategies on pre-trained language models (PLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance gains over the past few years. Nonetheless, these methods still face many drawbacks that are complex to solve, including: 1. Limited agricultural training data due to the expensive-cost and labour-intensive annotation; 2. Poor domain transferability, especially of cross-linguistic ability; 3. Complex and expensive large models deployment. Inspired by the extraordinary success brought by the recent ChatGPT (e.g. GPT-3.5, GPT-4), in this work, we systematically investigate and explore the capability and utilization of ChatGPT applying to the agricultural informatization field. Specifically, we have thoroughly explored various attempts to maximize the potentials of ChatGPT by considering various crucial factors, including prompt construction, answer parsing, and different ChatGPT variants. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary comparative study on ChatGPT, PLMs-based fine-tuning methods, and PLMs-based prompt-tuning methods. A series of empirical results demonstrate that ChatGPT has effectively addressed the aforementioned research challenges and bottlenecks, which can be regarded as an ideal solution for agricultural text classification. Moreover, compared with existing PLM-based fine-tuning methods, ChatGPT achieves comparable performance even without fine-tuning on any agricultural data samples. We hope our preliminary study could prompt the emergence of a general-purposed AI paradigm for agricultural text processing.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
