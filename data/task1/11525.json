Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Computational Complexity of Factored Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Computational complexity is traditionally measured with respect to input size. For graphs, this is typically the number of vertices (or edges) of the graph. However, for large graphs even explicitly representing the graph could be prohibitively expensive. Instead, graphs with enough structure could admit more succinct representations. A number of previous works have considered various succinct representations of graphs, such as small circuits [Galperin, Wigderson ’83]. We initiate the study of the computational complexity of problems on factored graphs: graphs that are given as a formula of products and union on smaller graphs. For any graph problem, we define a parameterized version by the number of operations used to construct the graph. For different graph problems, we show that the corresponding parameterized problems have a wide range of complexities that are also quite different from most parameterized problems. We give a natural example of a parameterized problem that is unconditionally not fixed parameter tractable (FPT). On the other hand, we show that subgraph counting is FPT. Finally, we show that reachability for factored graphs is FPT if and only if NL is in some fixed polynomial time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
