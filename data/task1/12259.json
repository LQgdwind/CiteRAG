Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: ANID: How Far Are We? Evaluating the Discrepancies Between AI-synthesized Images and Natural Images through Multimodal Guidance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), one of the key challenges is distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural images. Despite the remarkable capabilities of advanced AI generative models in producing visually compelling images, significant discrepancies remain when these images are compared to natural ones. To systematically investigate and quantify these discrepancies, we introduce an AI-Natural Image Discrepancy Evaluation benchmark aimed at addressing the critical question: how far are AI-generated images (AIGIs) from truly realistic images? We have constructed a large-scale multimodal dataset, the Distinguishing Natural and AI-generated Images (DNAI) dataset, which includes over 440,000 AIGI samples generated by 8 representative models using both unimodal and multimodal prompts, such as Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text vs. Image-to-Image (TI2I). Our fine-grained assessment framework provides a comprehensive evaluation of the DNAI dataset across five key dimensions: naive visual feature quality, semantic alignment in multimodal generation, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Extensive evaluation results highlight significant discrepancies across these dimensions, underscoring the necessity of aligning quantitative metrics with human judgment to achieve a holistic understanding of AI-generated image quality. Code is available at https://github.com/ryliu68/ANID.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
