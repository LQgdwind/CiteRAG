Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Single Frame and Multi-Frame Joint Network for 360-degree Panorama Video Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spherical videos, also known as 360​°360° (panorama) videos, can be viewed with various virtual reality devices such as computers and head-mounted displays. They attract large amount of interest since awesome immersion can be experienced when watching spherical videos. However, capturing, storing and transmitting high-resolution spherical videos are extremely expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel single frame and multi-frame joint network (SMFN) for recovering high-resolution spherical videos from low-resolution inputs. To take advantage of pixel-level inter-frame consistency, deformable convolutions are used to eliminate the motion difference between feature maps of the target frame and its neighboring frames. A mixed attention mechanism is devised to enhance the feature representation capability. The dual learning strategy is exerted to constrain the space of solution so that a better solution can be found. A novel loss function based on the weighted mean square error is proposed to emphasize on the super-resolution of the equatorial regions. This is the first attempt to settle the super-resolution of spherical videos, and we collect a novel dataset from the Internet, MiG Panorama Video, which includes 204 videos. Experimental results on 4 representative video clips demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lovepiano/SMFN_For_360VSR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
