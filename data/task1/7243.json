      "content": "Paper Title: Behavioral Intention Prediction in Driving Scenes: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the driving scene, the road agents usually conduct frequent interaction and intention understanding of the surroundings. Ego-agent (each road agent itself) predicts what behavior will be engaged by other road users all the time and expects a shared and consistent understanding for safe movement. Behavioral Intention Prediction (BIP) simulates such a human consideration process and fulfills the early prediction of specific behaviors. Similar to other prediction tasks, such as trajectory prediction, data-driven deep learning methods have taken the primary pipeline in research. The rapid development of BIP inevitably leads to new issues and challenges. To catalyze future research, this work provides a comprehensive review of BIP from the available datasets, key factors and challenges, pedestrian-centric and vehicle-centric BIP approaches, and BIP-aware applications. Based on the investigation, data-driven deep learning approaches have become the primary pipelines. The behavioral intention types are still monotonous in most current datasets and methods (e.g., Crossing (C) and Not Crossing (NC) for pedestrians and Lane Changing (LC) for vehicles) in this field. In addition, for the safe-critical scenarios (e.g., near-crashing situations), current research is limited. Through this investigation, we identify open issues in behavioral intention prediction and suggest possible insights for future research.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 254 most likely reference titles for this paper.
