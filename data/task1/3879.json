Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Identifying Influential Users in Unknown Social Networks for Adaptive Incentive Allocation Under Budget Restriction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, recommendation systems have been widely applied in many domains. These systems are impotent in affecting users to choose the behavior that the system expects. Meanwhile, providing incentives has been proven to be a more proactive way to affect users’ behaviors. Due to the budget limitation, the number of users who can be incentivized is restricted. In this light, we intend to utilize social influence existing among users to enhance the effect of incentivization. Through incentivizing influential users directly, their followers or friends in the social network are possibly incentivized indirectly. However, in many real-world scenarios, the topological structure of the network is usually unknown, which makes identifying influential users difficult. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm specifically for exploring influential users in unknown networks, which can estimate the influential relationships among users based on their historical behaviors and without knowing the topology of the network. Meanwhile, we design an adaptive incentive allocation approach that determines incentive values based on users’ preferences and their influence ability. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches by conducting experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
