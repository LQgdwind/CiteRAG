Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Measuring Unintended Memorisation of Unique Private Features in Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neural networks pose a privacy risk to training data due to their propensity to memorise and leak information. Focusing on image classification, we show that neural networks also unintentionally memorise unique features even when they occur only once in training data. An example of a unique feature is a person’s name that is accidentally present on a training image. Assuming access to the inputs and outputs of a trained model, the domain of the training data, and knowledge of unique features, we develop a score estimating the model’s sensitivity to a unique feature by comparing the KL divergences of the model’s output distributions given modified out-of-distribution images. Our results suggest that unique features are memorised by multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks trained on benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10. We find that strategies to prevent overfitting (e.g. early stopping, regularisation, batch normalisation) do not prevent memorisation of unique features. These results imply that neural networks pose a privacy risk to rarely occurring private information. These risks can be more pronounced in healthcare applications if patient information is present in the training data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
