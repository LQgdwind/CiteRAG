Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Stability-based Generalization Analysis for Mixtures of Pointwise and Pairwise Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, some mixture algorithms of pointwise and pairwise learning (PPL) have been formulated by employing the hybrid error metric of ‚Äúpointwise loss + pairwise loss‚Äù and have shown empirical effectiveness on feature selection, ranking and recommendation tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, the learning theory foundation of PPL has not been touched in the existing works. In this paper, we try to fill this theoretical gap by investigating the generalization properties of PPL. After extending the definitions of algorithmic stability to the PPL setting, we establish the high-probability generalization bounds for uniformly stable PPL algorithms. Moreover, explicit convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and regularized risk minimization (RRM) for PPL are stated by developing the stability analysis technique of pairwise learning. In addition, the refined generalization bounds of PPL are obtained by replacing uniform stability with on-average stability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
