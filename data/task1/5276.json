Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Initiate and Reason in Event-Driven Cascading Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Training agents to control a dynamic environment is a fundamental task in AI. In many environments, the dynamics can be summarized by a small set of events that capture the semantic behavior of the system. Typically, these events form chains or cascades. We often wish to change the system behavior using a single intervention that propagates through the cascade. For instance, one may trigger a biochemical cascade to switch the state of a cell or, in logistics, reroute a truck to meet an unexpected, urgent delivery. We introduce a new supervised learning setup called Cascade. An agent observes a system with known dynamics evolving from some initial state. The agent is given a structured semantic instruction and needs to make an intervention that triggers a cascade of events, such that the system reaches an alternative (counterfactual) behavior. We provide a test-bed for this problem, consisting of physical objects. We combine semantic tree search with an event-driven forward model and devise an algorithm that learns to efficiently search in exponentially large semantic trees. We demonstrate that our approach learns to follow instructions to intervene in new complex scenes. When provided with an observed cascade of events, it can also reason about alternative outcomes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
