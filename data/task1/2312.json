Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: GrADyS: Exploring movement awareness for efficient routing in Ground-and-Air Dynamic Sensor Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Several situations exist where a geographic region of some size needs to be scanned or monitored through many sensors. Still, it is either absolutely impossible or prohibitively expensive to deploy and maintain wireless communication infrastructure for the distributed sensors. Either because the region is hidden behind walls, not easily accessible, hard to get through, or infected with some lethal bacteria or virus transmitter. In this case, the best is to scatter (disposable) sensors in the region and let them transmit the collected sensor data by wireless means to an overflying UAV/drone. Which then physically hauls the collected data from the monitored area to a central base station that functions as a gateway to the Internet. The project GrADyS aims to research two sets of problems regarding such data collection. The former aims to coordinate several autonomous UAVs in a distributed manner to collect the generated data while relying only on ad-hoc communication. The latter aims to develop routing protocols to mesh networks Bluetooth Mesh’s Low Power Nodes. Both research lines already present preliminary results that are presented in this paper.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
