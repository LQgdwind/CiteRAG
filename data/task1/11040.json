      "content": "Paper Title: CoroNetGAN: Controlled Pruning of GANs via Hypernetworks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to exhibit remarkable performance and are widely used across many generative computer vision applications. However, the unprecedented demand for the deployment of GANs on resource-constrained edge devices still poses a challenge due to huge number of parameters involved in the generation process. This has led to focused attention on the area of compressing GANs. Most of the existing works use knowledge distillation with the overhead of teacher dependency. Moreover, there is no ability to control the degree of compression in these methods. Hence, we propose CoroNetGAN for compressing GAN using the combined strength of differentiable pruning method via hypernetworks. The proposed method provides the advantage of performing controllable compression while training along with reducing training time by a substantial factor. Experiments have been done on various conditional GAN architectures (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN) to signify the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets such as Edges→Shoes→EdgesShoes\\text{Edges}\\rightarrow\\text{Shoes}, Horse↔Zebra↔HorseZebra\\text{Horse}\\leftrightarrow\\text{Zebra} and Summer→Winter→SummerWinter\\text{Summer}\\rightarrow\\text{Winter}. The results obtained illustrate that our approach succeeds to outperform the baselines on Zebra→Horse→ZebraHorse\\text{Zebra}\\rightarrow\\text{Horse} and Summer→Winter→SummerWinter\\text{Summer}\\rightarrow\\text{Winter} achieving the best FID score of 32.3 and 72.3 respectively, yielding high-fidelity images across all the datasets. Additionally, our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in achieving better inference time on various smart-phone chipsets and data-types making it a feasible solution for deployment on edge devices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
