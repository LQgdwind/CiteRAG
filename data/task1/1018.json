Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness of efficiently generating ground states in postselected quantum computation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generating ground states of any local Hamiltonians seems to be impossible in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we give evidence for the impossibility by applying an argument used in the quantum-computational-supremacy approach. More precisely, we show that if ground states of any 333-local Hamiltonians can be approximately generated in quantum polynomial time with postselection, then ùñØùñØ=ùñØùñ≤ùñØùñ†ùñ¢ùñ§ùñØùñØùñØùñ≤ùñØùñ†ùñ¢ùñ§{\\sf PP}={\\sf PSPACE}. Our result is superior to the existing findings in the sense that we reduce the impossibility to an unlikely relation between classical complexity classes. We also discuss what makes efficiently generating the ground states hard for postselected quantum computation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
