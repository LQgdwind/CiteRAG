Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: POSNoise: An Effective Countermeasure Against Topic Biases in Authorship Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Authorship verification (AV) is a fundamental research task in digital text forensics, which addresses the problem of whether two texts were written by the same person. In recent years, a variety of AV methods have been proposed that focus on this problem and can be divided into two categories: The first category refers to such methods that are based on explicitly defined features, where one has full control over which features are considered and what they actually represent. The second category, on the other hand, relates to such AV methods that are based on implicitly defined features, where no control mechanism is involved, so that any character sequence in a text can serve as a potential feature. However, AV methods belonging to the second category bear the risk that the topic of the texts may bias their classification predictions, which in turn may lead to misleading conclusions regarding their results. To tackle this problem, we propose a preprocessing technique called POSNoise, which effectively masks topic-related content in a given text. In this way, AV methods are forced to focus on such text units that are more related to the writing style. Our empirical evaluation based on six AV methods (falling into the second category) and seven corpora shows that POSNoise leads to better results compared to a well-known topic masking approach in 34 out of 42 cases, with an increase in accuracy of up to 10%. Keywords: Authorship analysis ⋅⋅\\cdot topic masking ⋅⋅\\cdot bias mitigation ⋅⋅\\cdot preprocessing.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
