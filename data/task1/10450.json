Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Self-Supervised Learning for Non-Sequential Tabular Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been incorporated into many state-of-the-art models in various domains, where SSL defines pretext tasks based on unlabeled datasets to learn contextualized and robust representations. Recently, SSL has been a new trend in exploring the representation learning capability in the realm of tabular data, which is more challenging due to not having explicit relations for learning descriptive representations. This survey aims to systematically review and summarize the recent progress and challenges of SSL for non-sequential tabular data (SSL4NS-TD). We first present a formal definition of NS-TD and clarify its correlation to related studies. Then, these approaches are categorized into three groups â€“ predictive learning, contrastive learning, and hybrid learning, with their motivations and strengths of representative methods within each direction. On top of this, application issues of SSL4NS-TD are presented, including automatic data engineering, cross-table transferability, and domain knowledge integration. In addition, we elaborate on existing benchmarks and datasets for NS-TD applications to discuss the performance of existing tabular models. Finally, we discuss the challenges of SSL4NS-TD and provide potential directions for future research. We expect our work to be useful in terms of encouraging more research on lowering the barrier to entry SSL for the tabular domain and improving the foundations for implicit tabular data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
