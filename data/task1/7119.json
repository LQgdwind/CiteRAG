Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Universe Model for Partial Matching Networks over Multiple Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the general setting for partial matching of two or multiple graphs, in the sense that not necessarily all the nodes in one graph can find their correspondences in another graph and vice versa. We take a universe matching perspective to this ubiquitous problem, whereby each node is either matched into an anchor in a virtual universe graph or regarded as an outlier. Such a universe matching scheme enjoys a few important merits, which have not been adopted in existing learning-based graph matching (GM) literature. First, the subtle logic for inlier matching and outlier detection can be clearly modeled, which is otherwise less convenient to handle in the pairwise matching scheme. Second, it enables end-to-end learning especially for universe level affinity metric learning for inliers matching, and loss design for gathering outliers together. Third, the resulting matching model can easily handle new arriving graphs under online matching, or even the graphs coming from different categories of the training set. To our best knowledge, this is the first deep learning network that can cope with two-graph matching, multiple-graph matching, online matching, and mixture graph matching simultaneously. Extensive experimental results show the state-of-the-art performance of our method in these settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 61\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
