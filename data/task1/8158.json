Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a GML-Enabled Knowledge Graph Platform\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This vision paper proposes KGNet, an on-demand graph machine learning (GML) as a service on top of RDF engines to support GML-enabled SPARQL queries. KGNet automates the training of GML models on a KG by identifying a task-specific subgraph. This helps reduce the task-irrelevant KG structure and properties for better scalability and accuracy. While training a GML model on K‚ÄãGùêæùê∫KG, KGNet collects metadata of trained models in the form of an RDF graph called KGMeta, which is interlinked with the relevant subgraphs in K‚ÄãGùêæùê∫KG. Finally, all trained models are accessible via a SPARQL-like query. We call it a GML-enabled query and refer to it as SPARQLML. KGNet supports SPARQLML on top of existing RDF engines as an interface for querying and inferencing over KGs using GML models. The development of KGNet poses research opportunities in several areas, including meta-sampling for identifying task-specific subgraphs, GML pipeline automation with computational constraints, such as limited time and memory budget, and SPARQLML query optimization. KGNet supports different GML tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and semantic entity matching. We evaluated KGNet using two real KGs of different application domains. Compared to training on the entire KG, KGNet significantly reduced training time and memory usage while maintaining comparable or improved accuracy. The KGNet source-code111https://github.com/CoDS-GCS/KGNET is available for further study.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
