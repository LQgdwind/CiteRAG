      "content": "Paper Title: Masked Diffusion Models are Fast Distribution Learners\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Diffusion model has emerged as the de-facto model for image generation, yet the heavy training overhead hinders its broader adoption in the research community. We observe that diffusion models are commonly trained to learn all fine-grained visual information from scratch. This paradigm may cause unnecessary training costs hence requiring in-depth investigation. In this work, we show that it suffices to train a strong diffusion model by first pre-training the model to learn some primer distribution that loosely characterizes the unknown real image distribution. Then the pre-trained model can be fine-tuned for various generation tasks efficiently. In the pre-training stage, we propose to mask a high proportion (e.g., up to 90%) of input images to approximately represent the primer distribution and introduce a masked denoising score matching objective to train a model to denoise visible areas. In subsequent fine-tuning stage, we efficiently train diffusion model without masking. Utilizing the two-stage training framework, we achieves significant training acceleration and a new FID score record of 6.27 on CelebA-HQ 256Ã—256256256256\\times 256 for ViT-based diffusion models. The generalizability of a pre-trained model further helps building models that perform better than ones trained from scratch on different downstream datasets. For instance, a diffusion model pre-trained on VGGFace2 attains a 46% quality improvement when fine-tuned on a different dataset that contains only 3000 images. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiachenlei/maskdm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
