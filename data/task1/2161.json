Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Uncertainty from Deep Learning for Trustworthy Materials Discovery Workflows\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we leverage predictive uncertainty of deep neural networks to answer challenging questions material scientists usually encounter in machine learning based materials applications workflows. First, we show that by leveraging predictive uncertainty, a user can determine the required training data set size necessary to achieve a certain classification accuracy. Next, we propose uncertainty guided decision referral to detect and refrain from making decisions on confusing samples. Finally, we show that predictive uncertainty can also be used to detect out-of-distribution test samples. We find that this scheme is accurate enough to detect a wide range of real-world shifts in data, e.g., changes in the image acquisition conditions or changes in the synthesis conditions. Using microstructure information from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images as an example use case, we show that leveraging uncertainty-aware deep learning can significantly improve the performance and dependability of classification models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
