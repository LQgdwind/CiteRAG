      "content": "Paper Title: Offline Risk-sensitive RL with Partial Observability to Enhance Performance in Human-Robot Teaming\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The integration of physiological computing into mixed-initiative human-robot interaction systems offers valuable advantages in autonomous task allocation by incorporating real-time features as human state observations into the decision-making system. This approach may alleviate the cognitive load on human operators by intelligently allocating mission tasks between agents. Nevertheless, accommodating a diverse pool of human participants with varying physiological and behavioral measurements presents a substantial challenge. To address this, resorting to a probabilistic framework becomes necessary, given the inherent uncertainty and partial observability on the human’s state. Recent research suggests to learn a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model from a data set of previously collected experiences that can be solved using Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) methods. In the present work, we not only highlight the potential of partially observable representations and physiological measurements to improve human operator state estimation and performance, but also enhance the overall mission effectiveness of a human-robot team. Importantly, as the fixed data set may not contain enough information to fully represent complex stochastic processes, we propose a method to incorporate model uncertainty, thus enabling risk-sensitive sequential decision-making. Experiments were conducted with a group of twenty-six human participants within a simulated robot teleoperation environment, yielding empirical evidence of the method’s efficacy. The obtained adaptive task allocation policy led to statistically significant higher scores than the one that was used to collect the data set, allowing for generalization across diverse participants also taking into account risk-sensitive metrics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
