      "content": "Paper Title: Mirror Descent for Stochastic Control Problems with measure-valued controls\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. This paper studies the convergence of the mirror descent algorithm for finite horizon stochastic control problems with measure-valued control processes. The control objective involves a convex regularisation function, denoted as h‚Ñéh, with regularisation strength determined by the weight œÑ‚â•0ùúè0\\tau\\geq 0. The setting covers regularised relaxed control problems. Under suitable conditions, we establish the relative smoothness and convexity of the control objective with respect to the Bregman divergence of h‚Ñéh, and prove linear convergence of the algorithm for œÑ=0ùúè0\\tau=0 and exponential convergence for œÑ>0ùúè0\\tau>0. The results apply to common regularisers including relative entropy, œá2superscriptùúí2\\chi^{2}-divergence, and entropic Wasserstein costs. This validates recent reinforcement learning heuristics that adding regularisation accelerates the convergence of gradient methods. The proof exploits careful regularity estimates of backward stochastic differential equations in the bounded mean oscillation norm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
