Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Mitigating Architecture Overfitting in Dataset Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Dataset distillation methods have demonstrated remarkable performance for neural networks trained with very limited training data. However, a significant challenge arises in the form of architecture overfitting: the distilled training data synthesized by a specific network architecture (i.e., training network) generates poor performance when trained by other network architectures (i.e., test networks). This paper addresses this issue and proposes a series of approaches in both architecture designs and training schemes which can be adopted together to boost the generalization performance across different network architectures on the distilled training data. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our methods. Particularly, across various scenarios involving different sizes of distilled data, our approaches achieve comparable or superior performance to existing methods when training on the distilled data using networks with larger capacities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
