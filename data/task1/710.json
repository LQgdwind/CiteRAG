Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Construction of Minimum Spanning Trees from Financial Returns using Rank Correlation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The construction of minimum spanning trees (MSTs) from correlation matrices is an often used method to study relationships in the financial markets. However most of the work on this topic tends to use the Pearson correlation coefficient, which relies on the assumption of normality and can be brittle to the presence of outliers, neither of which is ideal for the study of financial returns. In this paper we study the inference of MSTs from daily US, UK and German financial returns using Pearson and two rank correlation methods, Spearman and Kendall‚Äôs œÑùúè\\tau. MSTs constructed using these rank methods tend to be more stable and maintain more edges over the dataset than those constructed using Pearson correlation. The edge agreement between the Pearson and rank MSTs varies significantly depending on the state of the markets, but the rank MSTs generally show strong agreement at all times. Deviation from univariate normality can be related to changes in the correlation matrices but is more difficult to connect to changes in the MSTs. Irrelevant of coefficient, the trees tend to have similar topologies. Portfolios constructed from the MST correlation matrices have a smaller turnover than those from the full covariance matrix for the larger markets, but not for the smaller German market. Using a bootstrap method we find that the correlation matrices constructed using the rank correlations are more robust, but there is little difference between the robustness of the MSTs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
