Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Locally Differentially Private Distributed Deep Learning via Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning often requires a large amount of data. In real-world applications, e.g., healthcare applications, the data collected by a single organization (e.g., hospital) is often limited, and the majority of massive and diverse data is often segregated across multiple organizations. As such, it motivates the researchers to conduct distributed deep learning, where the data user would like to build DL models using the data segregated across multiple different data owners. However, this could lead to severe privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data, thus the data owners would be hesitant and reluctant to participate. We propose LDP-DL, a privacy-preserving distributed deep learning framework via local differential privacy and knowledge distillation, where each data owner learns a teacher model using its own (local) private dataset, and the data user learns a student model to mimic the output of the ensemble of the teacher models. In the experimental evaluation, a comprehensive comparison has been made among our proposed approach (i.e., LDP-DL), DP-SGD, PATE and DP-FL, using three popular deep learning benchmark datasets (i.e., CIFAR10, MNIST and FashionMNIST). The experimental results show that LDP-DL consistently outperforms the other competitors in terms of privacy budget and model accuracy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
