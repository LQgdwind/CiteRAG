Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Test-Time Style Shifting: Handling Arbitrary Styles in Domain Generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In domain generalization (DG), the target domain is unknown when the model is being trained, and the trained model should successfully work on an arbitrary (and possibly unseen) target domain during inference. This is a difficult problem, and despite active studies in recent years, it remains a great challenge. In this paper, we take a simple yet effective approach to tackle this issue. We propose test-time style shifting, which shifts the style of the test sample (that has a large style gap with the source domains) to the nearest source domain that the model is already familiar with, before making the prediction. This strategy enables the model to handle any target domains with arbitrary style statistics, without additional model update at test-time. Additionally, we propose style balancing, which provides a great platform for maximizing the advantage of test-time style shifting by handling the DG-specific imbalance issues. The proposed ideas are easy to implement and successfully work in conjunction with various other DG schemes. Experimental results on different datasets show the effectiveness of our methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
