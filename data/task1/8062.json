Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distilling Calibrated Student from an Uncalibrated Teacher\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge distillation is a common technique for improving the performance of a shallow student network by transferring information from a teacher network, which in general, is comparatively large and deep. These teacher networks are pre-trained and often uncalibrated, as no calibration technique is applied to the teacher model while training. Calibration of a network measures the probability of correctness for any of its predictions, which is critical in high-risk domains. In this paper, we study how to obtain a calibrated student from an uncalibrated teacher. Our approach relies on the fusion of the data-augmentation techniques, including but not limited to cutout, mixup, and CutMix, with knowledge distillation. We extend our approach beyond traditional knowledge distillation and find it suitable for Relational Knowledge Distillation and Contrastive Representation Distillation as well. The novelty of the work is that it provides a framework to distill a calibrated student from an uncalibrated teacher model without compromising the accuracy of the distilled student. We perform extensive experiments to validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10 and TinyImageNet, and obtained calibrated student models. We also observe robust performance of our approach while evaluating it on corrupted CIFAR-100C data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
