Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Domination and Cut Problems on Chordal Graphs with Bounded Leafage\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The leafage of a chordal graph G𝐺G is the minimum integer ℓℓ\\ell such that G𝐺G can be realized as an intersection graph of subtrees of a tree with ℓℓ\\ell leaves. We consider structural parameterization by the leafage of classical domination and cut problems on chordal graphs. Fomin, Golovach, and Raymond [ESA 201820182018, Algorithmica 202020202020] proved, among other things, that Dominating Set on chordal graphs admits an algorithm running in time 2𝒪​(ℓ2)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝒪superscriptℓ2superscript𝑛𝒪12^{\\mathcal{O}(\\ell^{2})}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}. We present a conceptually much simpler algorithm that runs in time 2𝒪​(ℓ)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝒪ℓsuperscript𝑛𝒪12^{\\mathcal{O}(\\ell)}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}. We extend our approach to obtain similar results for Connected Dominating Set and Steiner Tree. We then consider the two classical cut problems MultiCut with Undeletable Terminals and Multiway Cut with Undeletable Terminals. We prove that the former is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the leafage and complement this result by presenting a simple n𝒪​(ℓ)superscript𝑛𝒪ℓn^{\\mathcal{O}(\\ell)}-time algorithm. To our surprise, we find that Multiway Cut with Undeletable Terminals on chordal graphs can be solved, in contrast, in n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑛𝒪1n^{{\\mathcal{O}}(1)}-time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
