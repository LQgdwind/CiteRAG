Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Estimating the persistent homology of ‚Ñù^ùëõ-valued functions using function-geometric multifiltrations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Given an unknown ‚Ñùnsuperscript‚Ñùùëõ\\mathbb{R}^{n}-valued function ùíªùíª\\mathscr{f} on a metric space XùëãX, can we approximate the persistent homology of ùíªùíª\\mathscr{f} from a finite sampling of XùëãX with known pairwise distances and function values? This question has been answered in the case n=1ùëõ1n=1, assuming ùíªùíª\\mathscr{f} is Lipschitz continuous and XùëãX is a sufficiently regular geodesic metric space, and using filtered geometric complexes with fixed scale parameter for the approximation. In this paper we answer the question for arbitrary nùëõn, under similar assumptions and using function-geometric multifiltrations. Our analysis offers a different view on these multifiltrations by focusing on their approximation properties rather than on their stability properties. We also leverage the multiparameter setting to provide insight into the influence of the scale parameter, whose choice is central to this type of approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
