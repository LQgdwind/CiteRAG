Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Practical Multi-Robot Hybrid Tasks Allocation for Autonomous Cleaning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Task allocation plays a vital role in multi-robot autonomous cleaning systems, where multiple robots work together to clean a large area. However, most current studies mainly focus on deterministic, single-task allocation for cleaning robots, without considering hybrid tasks in uncertain working environments. Moreover, there is a lack of datasets and benchmarks for relevant research. In this paper, to address these problems, we formulate multi-robot hybrid-task allocation under the uncertain cleaning environment as a robust optimization problem. Firstly, we propose a novel robust mixed-integer linear programming model with practical constraints including the task order constraint for different tasks and the ability constraints of hybrid robots. Secondly, we establish a dataset of 100 instances made from floor plans, each of which has 2D manually-labeled images and a 3D model. Thirdly, we provide comprehensive results on the collected dataset using three traditional optimization approaches and a deep reinforcement learning-based solver. The evaluation results show that our solution meets the needs of multi-robot cleaning task allocation and the robust solver can protect the system from worst-case scenarios with little additional cost. The benchmark will be available at https://github.com/iamwangyabin/Multi-robot-Cleaning-Task-Allocation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
