      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting Visual Attention and Distraction During Visual Search Using Convolutional Neural Networks *This is a pre-print manuscript currently under review in Journal of Vision.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Most studies in computational modeling of visual attention encompass task-free observation of images. Free-viewing saliency considers limited scenarios of daily life. Most visual activities are goal-oriented and demand a great amount of top-down attention control. Visual search task demands more top-down control of attention, compared to free-viewing. In this paper, we present two approaches to model visual attention and distraction of observers during visual search. Our first approach adapts a light-weight free-viewing saliency model to predict eye fixation density(probability) maps of human observers over pixels of search images, using a two-stream convolutional encoder-decoder network, trained and evaluated on COCO-Search18 dataset. This method predicts which locations are more distracting when searching for a particular target. Our network achieves good results on standard saliency metrics (AUC-Judd=0.95, AUC-Borji=0.85, sAUC=0.84, NSS=4.64, KLD=0.93, CC=0.72, SIM=0.54, and IG=2.59). Our second approach is object-based and predicts the distractor and target objects during visual search. Distractors are all objects except the target that observers fixate on during search. This method uses a Mask-RCNN segmentation network pre-trained on MS-COCO and fine-tuned on COCO-Search18 dataset. We release our segmentation annotations of targets and distractors in COCO-Search18 for three target categories: bottle, bowl, and car. The average scores over the three categories are: F1-score=0.64, MAP0.5=0.57, MAR0.5=0.73. Our implementation code in Tensorflow is publicly available at https://github.com/ManooshSamiei/Distraction-Visual-Search.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
