Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Timing Process Interventions with Causal Inference and Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The shift from the understanding and prediction of processes to their optimization offers great benefits to businesses and other organizations. Precisely timed process interventions are the cornerstones of effective optimization. Prescriptive process monitoring (PresPM) is the sub-field of process mining that concentrates on process optimization. The emerging PresPM literature identifies state-of-the-art methods, causal inference (CI) and reinforcement learning (RL), without presenting a quantitative comparison. Most experiments are carried out using historical data, causing problems with the accuracy of the methods’ evaluations and preempting online RL. Our contribution consists of experiments on timed process interventions with synthetic data that renders genuine online RL and the comparison to CI possible, and allows for an accurate evaluation of the results. Our experiments reveal that RL’s policies outperform those from CI and are more robust at the same time. Indeed, the RL policies approach perfect policies. Unlike CI, the unaltered online RL approach can be applied to other, more generic PresPM problems such as next best activity recommendations. Nonetheless, CI has its merits in settings where online learning is not an option.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
