Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Double Attention-based Lightweight Network for Plant Pest Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Timely recognition of plant pests from field images is significant to avoid potential losses of crop yields. Traditional convolutional neural network-based deep learning models demand high computational capability and require large labelled samples for each pest type for training. On the other hand, the existing lightweight network-based approaches suffer in correctly classifying the pests because of common characteristics and high similarity between multiple plant pests. In this work, a novel double attention-based lightweight deep learning architecture is proposed to automatically recognize different plant pests. The lightweight network facilitates faster and small data training while the double attention module increases performance by focusing on the most pertinent information. The proposed approach achieves 96.61%, 99.08% and 91.60% on three variants of two publicly available datasets with 5869, 545 and 500 samples, respectively. Moreover, the comparison results reveal that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches on both small and large datasets consistently.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 43\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
