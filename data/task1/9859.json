Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generalized Simplicial Attention Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The aim of this work is to introduce Generalized Simplicial Attention Neural Networks (GSANs), i.e., novel neural architectures designed to process data defined on simplicial complexes using masked self-attentional layers. Hinging on topological signal processing principles, we devise a series of self-attention schemes capable of processing data components defined at different simplicial orders, such as nodes, edges, triangles, and beyond. These schemes learn how to weight the neighborhoods of the given topological domain in a task-oriented fashion, leveraging the interplay among simplices of different orders through the Dirac operator and its Dirac decomposition. We also theoretically establish that GSANs are permutation equivariant and simplicial-aware. Finally, we illustrate how our approach compares favorably with other methods when applied to several (inductive and transductive) tasks such as trajectory prediction, missing data imputation, graph classification, and simplex prediction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
