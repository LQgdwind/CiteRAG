Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: S3E-GNN: Sparse Spatial Scene Embedding with Graph Neural Networks for Camera Relocalization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Camera relocalization is the key component of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. This paper proposes a learning-based approach, named Sparse Spatial Scene Embedding with Graph Neural Networks (S3E-GNN), as an end-to-end framework for efficient and robust camera relocalization. S3E-GNN consists of two modules. In the encoding module, a trained S3E network encodes RGB images into embedding codes to implicitly represent spatial and semantic embedding code. With embedding codes and the associated poses obtained from a SLAM system, each image is represented as a graph node in a pose graph. In the GNN query module, the pose graph is transformed to form a embedding-aggregated reference graph for camera relocalization. We collect various scene datasets in the challenging environments to perform experiments. Our results demonstrate that S3E-GNN method outperforms the traditional Bag-of-words (BoW) for camera relocalization due to learning-based embedding and GNN powered scene matching mechanism.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
