Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: On Robust Numerical Solver for ODE via Self-Attention Mechanism\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the development of deep learning techniques, AI-enhanced numerical solvers are expected to become a new paradigm for solving differential equations due to their versatility and effectiveness in alleviating the accuracy-speed trade-off in traditional numerical solvers. However, this paradigm still inevitably requires a large amount of high-quality data, whose acquisition is often very expensive in natural science and engineering problems. Therefore, in this paper, we explore training efficient and robust AI-enhanced numerical solvers with a small data size by mitigating intrinsic noise disturbances. We first analyze the ability of the self-attention mechanism to regulate noise in supervised learning and then propose a simple-yet-effective numerical solver, AttSolver, which introduces an additive self-attention mechanism to the numerical solution of differential equations based on the dynamical system perspective of the residual neural network. Our results on benchmarks, ranging from high-dimensional problems to chaotic systems, demonstrate the effectiveness of AttSolver in generally improving the performance of existing traditional numerical solvers without any elaborated model crafting. Finally, we analyze the convergence, generalization, and robustness of the proposed method experimentally and theoretically.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
