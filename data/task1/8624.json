Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Type-enhanced Ensemble Triple Representation via Triple-aware Attention for Cross-lingual Entity Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Entity alignment(EA) is a crucial task for integrating cross-lingual and cross-domain knowledge graphs(KGs), which aims to discover entities referring to the same real-world object from different KGs. Most existing methods generate aligning entity representation by mining the relevance of triple elements via embedding-based methods, paying little attention to triple indivisibility and entity role diversity. In this paper, a novel framework named TTEA â€“ Type-enhanced Ensemble Triple Representation via Triple-aware Attention for Cross-lingual Entity Alignment is proposed to overcome the above issues considering ensemble triple specificity and entity role features. Specifically, the ensemble triple representation is derived by regarding relation as information carrier between semantic space and type space, and hence the noise influence during spatial transformation and information propagation can be smoothly controlled via specificity-aware triple attention. Moreover, our framework uses triple-ware entity enhancement to model the role diversity of triple elements. Extensive experiments on three real-world cross-lingual datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
