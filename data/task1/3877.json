Our main technical finding is that the template of every PCSP that is solvable in bounded width satisfies a certain structural condition implying that its algebraic closure-properties include weak near unanimity polymorphisms of all large arities. While this parallels the standard (non-promise) CSP theory, the method of proof is quite different and applies even to the regime of sublinear width. We also show that, in contrast with the CSP world, the presence of weak near unanimity polymorphisms of all large arities does not guarantee solvability in bounded width. The separating example is even solvable in the second level of the Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy of linear programming relaxations. This shows that, unlike for CSPs, linear programming can be stronger than bounded width. A direct application of these methods also show that the problem of q𝑞q-coloring p𝑝p-colorable graphs is not solvable in bounded or even sublinear width, for any two constants p𝑝p and q𝑞q such that 3≤p≤q3𝑝𝑞3\\leq p\\leq q. Turning to algorithms, we note that Wigderson’s algorithm for O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n})-coloring 333-colorable graphs with n𝑛n vertices is implementable in width 444. Indeed, by generalizing the method we see that, for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 smaller than 1/2121/2, the optimal width for solving the problem of O​(nϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛italic-ϵO(n^{\\epsilon})-coloring 333-colorable graphs with n𝑛n vertices lies between n1−3​ϵsuperscript𝑛13italic-ϵn^{1-3\\epsilon} and n1−2​ϵsuperscript𝑛12italic-ϵn^{1-2\\epsilon}. The upper bound gives a simple 2Θ​(n1−2​ϵ​log⁡(n))superscript2Θsuperscript𝑛12italic-ϵ𝑛2^{\\Theta(n^{1-2\\epsilon}\\log(n))}-time algorithm that, asymptotically, beats the straightforward 2Θ​(n1−ϵ)superscript2Θsuperscript𝑛1italic-ϵ2^{\\Theta(n^{1-\\epsilon})} bound that follows from partitioning the graph into O​(nϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛italic-ϵO(n^{\\epsilon}) many independent parts each of size O​(n1−ϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛1italic-ϵO(n^{1-\\epsilon}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
