Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: TCDesc: Learning Topology Consistent Descriptors\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Triplet loss is widely used for learning local descriptors from image patch. However, triplet loss only minimizes the Euclidean distance between matching descriptors and maximizes that between the non-matching descriptors, which neglects the topology similarity between two descriptor sets. In this paper, we propose topology measure besides Euclidean distance to learn topology consistent descriptors by considering kùëòkNN descriptors of positive sample. First we establish a novel topology vector for each descriptor followed by Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) to indicate the topological relation among the descriptor and its kùëòkNN descriptors. Then we define topology distance between descriptors as the difference of their topology vectors. Last we employ the dynamic weighting strategy to fuse Euclidean distance and topology distance of matching descriptors and take the fusion result as the positive sample distance in the triplet loss. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our method performs better than state-of-the-arts results and effectively improves the performance of triplet loss.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
