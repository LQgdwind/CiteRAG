      "content": "Paper Title: Conditional Kernel Imitation Learning for Continuous State Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Imitation Learning (IL) is an important paradigm within the broader reinforcement learning (RL) methodology. Unlike most of RL, it does not assume availability of reward-feedback. Reward inference and shaping are known to be difficult and error-prone methods particularly when the demonstration data comes from human experts. Classical methods such as behavioral cloning and inverse reinforcement learning are highly sensitive to estimation errors, a problem that is particularly acute in continuous state space problems. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art IL algorithms convert behavioral policy learning problems into distribution-matching problems which often require additional online interaction data to be effective. In this paper, we consider the problem of imitation learning in continuous state space environments based solely on observed behavior, without access to transition dynamics information, reward structure, or, most importantly, any additional interactions with the environment. Our approach is based on the Markov balance equation and introduces a novel conditional kernel density estimation-based imitation learning framework. It involves estimating the environmentâ€™s transition dynamics using conditional kernel density estimators and seeks to satisfy the probabilistic balance equations for the environment. We establish that our estimators satisfy basic asymptotic consistency requirements. Through a series of numerical experiments on continuous state benchmark environments, we show consistently superior empirical performance over many state-of-the-art IL algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
