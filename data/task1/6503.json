      "content": "Paper Title: Everything is There in Latent Space: Attribute Editing and Attribute Style Manipulation by StyleGAN Latent Space Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Unconstrained Image generation with high realism is now possible using recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, it is quite challenging to generate images with a given set of attributes. Recent methods use style-based GAN models to perform image editing by leveraging the semantic hierarchy present in the layers of the generator. We present Few-shot Latent-based Attribute Manipulation and Editing (FLAME), a simple yet effective framework to perform highly controlled image editing by latent space manipulation. Specifically, we estimate linear directions in the latent space (of a pre-trained StyleGAN) that controls semantic attributes in the generated image. In contrast to previous methods that either rely on large-scale attribute labeled datasets or attribute classifiers, FLAME uses minimal supervision of a few curated image pairs to estimate disentangled edit directions. FLAME can perform both individual and sequential edits with high precision on a diverse set of images while preserving identity. Further, we propose a novel task of Attribute Style Manipulation to generate diverse styles for attributes such as eyeglass and hair. We first encode a set of synthetic images of the same identity but having different attribute styles in the latent space to estimate an attribute style manifold. Sampling a new latent from this manifold will result in a new attribute style in the generated image. We propose a novel sampling method to sample latent from the manifold, enabling us to generate a diverse set of attribute styles beyond the styles present in the training set. FLAME can generate diverse attribute styles in a disentangled manner. We illustrate the superior performance of FLAME against previous image editing methods by extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons. FLAME generalizes well on out-of-distribution images from art domain as well as on other datasets such as cars and churches.
