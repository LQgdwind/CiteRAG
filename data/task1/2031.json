Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Transductive Zero-Shot Learning using Cross-Modal CycleGAN\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In Computer Vision, Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims at classifying unseen classes — classes for which no matching training image exists. Most of ZSL works learn a cross-modal mapping between images and class labels for seen classes. However, the data distribution of seen and unseen classes might differ, causing a domain shift problem. Following this observation, transductive ZSL (T-ZSL) assumes that unseen classes and their associated images are known during training, but not their correspondence. As current T-ZSL approaches do not scale efficiently when the number of seen classes is high, we tackle this problem with a new model for T-ZSL based upon CycleGAN. Our model jointly (i) projects images on their seen class labels with a supervised objective and (ii) aligns unseen class labels and visual exemplars with adversarial and cycle-consistency objectives. We show the efficiency of our Cross-Modal CycleGAN model (CM-GAN) on the ImageNet T-ZSL task where we obtain state-of-the-art results. We further validate CM-GAN on a language grounding task, and on a new task that we propose: zero-shot sentence-to-image matching on MS COCO.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
