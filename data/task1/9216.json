Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Visual Domain Adaptation with Source Preparation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Robotic Perception in diverse domains such as low-light scenarios, where new modalities like thermal imaging and specialized night-vision sensors are increasingly employed, remains a challenge. Largely, this is due to the limited availability of labeled data. Existing Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques, while promising to leverage labels from existing well-lit RGB images, fail to consider the characteristics of the source domain itself. We holistically account for this factor by proposing Source Preparation (SP), a method to mitigate source domain biases. Our Almost Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (AUDA) framework, a label-efficient semi-supervised approach for robotic scenarios â€“ employs Source Preparation (SP), Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and Supervised Alignment (SA) from limited labeled data. We introduce CityIntensified, a novel dataset comprising temporally aligned image pairs captured from a high-sensitivity camera and an intensifier camera for semantic segmentation and object detection in low-light settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in semantic segmentation, with experiments showing that SP enhances UDA across a range of visual domains, with improvements up to 40.64% in mIoU over baseline, while making target models more robust to real-world shifts within the target domain. We show that AUDA is a label-efficient framework for effective DA, significantly improving target domain performance with only tens of labeled samples from the target domain.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
