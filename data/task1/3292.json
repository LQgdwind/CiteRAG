Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Set Propagation with Finite Element Methods for Time Integration in Transient Solid Mechanics Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Finite Element Method (FEM) is the gold standard for spatial discretization in numerical simulations for a wide spectrum of real-world engineering problems. Prototypical areas of interest include linear heat transfer and linear structural dynamics problems modeled with partial differential equations (PDEs). While different algorithms for direct integration of the equations of motion exist, exploring all feasible behaviors for varying loads, initial states and fluxes in models with large numbers of degrees of freedom remains a challenging task. In this article we propose a novel approach, based in set propagation methods and motivated by recent advances in the field of Reachability Analysis. Assuming a set of initial states and inputs, the proposed method consists in the construction of a union of sets (flowpipe) that enclose the infinite number of solutions of the spatially discretized PDE. We present the numerical results obtained in five examples to illustrate the capabilities of our approach, and compare its performance against reference numerical integration methods. We conclude that, for problems with single known initial conditions, the proposed method is accurate. For problems with uncertain initial conditions included in sets, the proposed method can compute all the solutions of the system more efficiently than numerical integration methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
