      "content": "Paper Title: Online Euclidean Spanners\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we study the online Euclidean spanners problem for points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. Given a set S𝑆S of n𝑛n points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, a t𝑡t-spanner on S𝑆S is a subgraph of the underlying complete graph G=(S,(S2))𝐺𝑆binomial𝑆2G=(S,\\binom{S}{2}), that preserves the pairwise Euclidean distances between points in S𝑆S to within a factor of t𝑡t, that is the stretch factor. Suppose we are given a sequence of n𝑛n points (s1,s2,…,sn)subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2…subscript𝑠𝑛(s_{1},s_{2},\\ldots,s_{n}) in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, where point sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} is presented in step i𝑖i for i=1,…,n𝑖1…𝑛i=1,\\ldots,n. The objective of an online algorithm is to maintain a geometric t𝑡t-spanner on Si={s1,…,si}subscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝑠1…subscript𝑠𝑖S_{i}=\\{s_{1},\\ldots,s_{i}\\} for each step i𝑖i. The algorithm is allowed to add new edges to the spanner when a new point is presented, but cannot remove any edge from the spanner. The performance of an online algorithm is measured by its competitive ratio, which is the supremum, over all sequences of points, of the ratio between the weight of the spanner constructed by the algorithm and the weight of an optimum spanner. Here the weight of a spanner is the sum of all edge weights. First, we establish a lower bound of Ω​(ε−1​log⁡n/log⁡ε−1)Ωsuperscript𝜀1𝑛superscript𝜀1\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n/\\log\\varepsilon^{-1}) for the competitive ratio of any online (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanner algorithm, for a sequence of n𝑛n points in 1-dimension. We show that this bound is tight, and there is an online algorithm that can maintain a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanner with competitive ratio O​(ε−1​log⁡n/log⁡ε−1)𝑂superscript𝜀1𝑛superscript𝜀1O(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n/\\log\\varepsilon^{-1}). Next, we design online algorithms for sequences of points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, for any constant d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2, under the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} norm. We show that previously known incremental algorithms achieve a competitive ratio O​(ε−(d+1)​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝜀𝑑1𝑛O(\\varepsilon^{-(d+1)}\\log n). However, if the algorithm is allowed to use additional points (Steiner points), then it is possible to substantially improve the competitive ratio in terms of ε𝜀\\varepsilon. We describe an online Steiner (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-spanner algorithm with competitive ratio O​(ε(1−d)/2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝜀1𝑑2𝑛O(\\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2}\\log n). As a counterpart, we show that the dependence on n𝑛n cannot be eliminated in dimensions d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2. In particular, we prove that any online spanner algorithm for a sequence of n𝑛n points in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} under the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} norm has competitive ratio Ω​(f​(n))Ω𝑓𝑛\\Omega(f(n)), where limn→∞f​(n)=∞subscript→𝑛𝑓𝑛\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}f(n)=\\infty. Finally, we provide improved lower bounds under the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} norm: Ω​(ε−2/log⁡ε−1)Ωsuperscript𝜀2superscript𝜀1\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-2}/\\log\\varepsilon^{-1}) in the plane and Ω​(ε−d)Ωsuperscript𝜀𝑑\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-d}) in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} for d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
