      "content": "Paper Title: A Framework for Parameterized Subexponential Algorithms for Generalized Cycle Hitting Problems on Planar Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Subexponential parameterized algorithms are known for a wide range of natural problems on planar graphs, but the techniques are usually highly problem specific. The goal of this paper is to introduce a framework for obtaining n𝒪​(k)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k})} time algorithms for a family of graph modification problems that includes problems that can be seen as generalized cycle hitting problems. Our starting point is the Node Unique Label Cover problem (that is, given a CSP instance where each constraint is a permutation of values on two variables, the task is to delete k𝑘k variables to make the instance satisfiable). We introduce a variant of the problem where k𝑘k vertices have to be deleted such that every 2-connected component of the remaining instance is satisfiable. Then we extend the problem with cardinality constraints that restrict the number of times a certain value can be used (globally or within a 2-connected component of the solution). We show that there is an n𝒪​(k)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k})} time algorithm on planar graphs for any problem that can be formulated this way, which includes a large number of well-studied problems, for example, Odd Cycle Transversal, Subset Feedback Vertex Set, Group Feedback Vertex Set, Subset Group Feedback Vertex Set, Vertex Multiway Cut, and Component Order Connectivity. For those problems that admit appropriate (quasi)polynomial kernels (that increase the parameter only linearly and preserve planarity), our results immediately imply 2𝒪​(k⋅polylog​(k))⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝒪⋅𝑘polylog𝑘superscript𝑛𝒪12^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k}\\cdot\\textup{polylog}(k))}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} time parameterized algorithms on planar graphs. In particular, we use or adapt known kernelization results to obtain 2𝒪​(k⋅polylog​(k))⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝒪⋅𝑘polylog𝑘superscript𝑛𝒪12^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k}\\cdot\\textup{polylog}(k))}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} time (randomized) algorithms for Vertex Multiway Cut, Group Feedback Vertex Set, and Subset Feedback Vertex Set. Our algorithms are designed with possible generalization to H𝐻H-minor free graphs in mind. To obtain the same n𝒪​(k)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k})} time algorithms on H𝐻H-minor free graphs, the only missing piece is the vertex version of a contraction decomposition theorem that we currently have only for planar graphs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
