Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SWARM-SLR - Streamlined Workflow Automation for Machine-actionable Systematic Literature Reviews\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Authoring survey or review articles still requires significant tedious manual effort, despite many advancements in research knowledge management having the potential to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and reuse. However, these advancements bring forth an increasing number of approaches, tools, and systems, which often cover only specific stages and lack a comprehensive workflow utilizing their task-specific strengths. We propose the Streamlined Workflow Automation for Machine-actionable Systematic Literature Reviews (SWARM-SLR) to crowdsource the improvement of SLR efficiency while maintaining scientific integrity in a state-of-the-art knowledge discovery and distribution process. The workflow aims to domain-independently support researchers in collaboratively and sustainably managing the rising scholarly knowledge corpus. By synthesizing guidelines from the literature, we have composed a set of 65 requirements, spanning from planning to reporting a review. Existing tools were assessed against these requirements and synthesized into the SWARM-SLR workflow prototype, a ready-for-operation software support tool. The SWARM-SLR was evaluated via two online surveys, which largely confirmed the validity of the 65 requirements and situated 11 tools to the different life-cycle stages. The SWARM-SLR workflow was similarly evaluated and found to be supporting almost the entire span of an SLR, excelling specifically in search and retrieval, information extraction, knowledge synthesis, and distribution. Our SWARM-SLR requirements and workflow support tool streamlines the SLR support for researchers, allowing sustainable collaboration by linking individual efficiency improvements to crowdsourced knowledge management. If these efforts are continued, we expect the increasing number of tools to be manageable and usable inside fully structured, (semi-)automated literature review workflows.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
