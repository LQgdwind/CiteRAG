Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the In-context Learning Ability of Large Language Model for Biomedical Concept Linking\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The biomedical field relies heavily on concept linking in various areas such as literature mining, graph alignment, information retrieval, question-answering, data, and knowledge integration. Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in many natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in biomedical concept mapping is yet to be fully explored. This research investigates a method that exploits the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of large models for biomedical concept linking. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage retrieve-and-rank framework. Initially, biomedical concepts are embedded using language models, and then embedding similarity is utilized to retrieve the top candidates. These candidates’ contextual information is subsequently incorporated into the prompt and processed by a large language model to re-rank the concepts. This approach achieved an accuracy of 90.1% in BC5CDR disease entity normalization and 94.7% in chemical entity normalization, exhibiting a competitive performance relative to supervised learning methods. Further, it showed a significant improvement, with an over 20-point absolute increase in F1 score on an oncology matching dataset. Extensive qualitative assessments were conducted, and the benefits and potential shortcomings of using large language models within the biomedical domain were discussed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
