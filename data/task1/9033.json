      "content": "Paper Title: Task Relation-aware Continual User Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. User modeling, which learns to represent users into a low-dimensional representation space based on their past behaviors, got a surge of interest from the industry for providing personalized services to users. Previous efforts in user modeling mainly focus on learning a task-specific user representation that is designed for a single task. However, since learning task-specific user representations for every task is infeasible, recent studies introduce the concept of universal user representation, which is a more generalized representation of a user that is relevant to a variety of tasks. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches for learning universal user representations are impractical in real-world applications due to the data requirement, catastrophic forgetting and the limited learning capability for continually added tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel continual user representation learning method, called TERACON, whose learning capability is not limited as the number of learned tasks increases while capturing the relationship between the tasks. The main idea is to introduce an embedding for each task, i.e., task embedding, which is utilized to generate task-specific soft masks that not only allow the entire model parameters to be updated until the end of training sequence, but also facilitate the relationship between the tasks to be captured. Moreover, we introduce a novel knowledge retention module with pseudo-labeling strategy that successfully alleviates the long-standing problem of continual learning, i.e., catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on public and proprietary real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and practicality of TERACON. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/TERACON.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
