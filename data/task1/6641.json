Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive and Implicit Regularization for Matrix Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The explicit low-rank regularization, e.g., nuclear norm regularization, has been widely used in imaging sciences. However, it has been found that implicit regularization outperforms explicit ones in various image processing tasks. Another issue is that the fixed explicit regularization limits the applicability to broad images since different images favor different features captured by different explicit regularizations. As such, this paper proposes a new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization that captures the low-rank prior dynamically from the training data. The core of our new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization is parameterizing the Laplacian matrix in the Dirichlet energy-based regularization, which we call the regularization AIR. Theoretically, we show that the adaptive regularization of AIR enhances the implicit regularization and vanishes at the end of training. We validate AIR’s effectiveness on various benchmark tasks, indicating that the AIR is particularly favorable for the scenarios when the missing entries are non-uniform. The code can be found at https://github.com/lizhemin15/AIR-Net.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
