      "content": "Paper Title: Characterization of Noise using variants of Unitarity Randomized Benchmarking\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Benchmarking noise induced during the implementation of quantum gates is the main concern for practical quantum computers. Several protocols have been proposed that empirically calculate various metrics that quantify the error rates of the quantum gates chosen from a preferred gate set. Unitarity randomized benchmarking (URB) protocol is a method to estimate the coherence of noise induced by the quantum gates which is measured by the metric unitarity. In this paper, we for the first time, implement the URB protocol in a quantum simulator with all the parameters and noise models used from a real quantum device. The direct implementation of the URB protocol in a quantum device is not possible using current technologies, as it requires the preparation of mixed states. To overcome this challenge, we propose a modification of the URB protocol, namely the m-URB protocol, that enables us to practically implement it on any quantum device. We validate our m-URB protocol using two single-qubit noise channels – (a) depolarising channel and (b) bit-flip channel. We further alter the m-URB protocol, namely, native gate URB or Ng-URB protocol, to study the noise in the native gates into which the quantum circuits are compiled in a quantum computer. Using our Ng-URB protocol, we can also detect the presence of cross-talk errors which are correlated errors caused due to non-local and entangling gates such as CNOT gate. For illustration, we simulate the noise of the native gates taking the noise parameter from two real IBM-Q processors which are of 5-qubit and 15-qubit quantum registers. Results show that there is a significant cross-talk in the CNOT gate, whereas the cross-talk is mild for the single-qubit gates, in both the processors. Our results highlight the practical effectiveness of the Ng-URB protocol in successfully detecting the cross-talk between qubits when applying native gate operations irrespective of the platform.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
