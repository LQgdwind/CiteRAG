      "content": "Paper Title: Two families of linear codes with desirable properties from some functions over finite fields\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Linear codes are widely studied in coding theory as they have nice applications in distributed storage, combinatorics, lattices, cryptography and so on. Constructing linear codes with desirable properties is an interesting research topic. In this paper, based on the augmentation technique, we present two families of linear codes from some functions over finite fields. The first family of linear codes is constructed from monomial functions over finite fields. The locality of them is determined and the weight distributions of two subfamilies of the codes are also given. An infinite family of locally recoverable codes which are at least almost optimal and some optimal recoverable codes are obtained from the linear codes. In particular, the two subfamilies of the codes are proved to be both optimally or almost optimally extendable and self-orthogonal. The second family of linear codes is constructed from weakly regular bent functions over finite fields and their weight distribution is determined. This family of codes is proved to have locality 3 for some cases and is conjectured to have locality 2 for other cases. Particularly, two families of optimal locally recoverable codes are derived from the linear codes. Besides, this family of codes is also proved to be both optimally or almost optimally extendable and self-orthogonal.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
