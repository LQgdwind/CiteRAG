      "content": "Paper Title: From Words to Molecules: A Survey of Large Language Models in Chemistry\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in natural language processing (NLP) and various interdisciplinary areas. However, applying LLMs to chemistry is a complex task that requires specialized domain knowledge. This paper provides a thorough exploration of the nuanced methodologies employed in integrating LLMs into the field of chemistry, delving into the complexities and innovations at this interdisciplinary juncture. Specifically, our analysis begins with examining how molecular information is fed into LLMs through various representation and tokenization methods. We then categorize chemical LLMs into three distinct groups based on the domain and modality of their input data, and discuss approaches for integrating these inputs for LLMs. Furthermore, this paper delves into the pretraining objectives with adaptations to chemical LLMs. After that, we explore the diverse applications of LLMs in chemistry, including novel paradigms for their application in chemistry tasks. Finally, we identify promising research directions, including further integration with chemical knowledge, advancements in continual learning, and improvements in model interpretability, paving the way for groundbreaking developments in the field.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 74 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 74\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
