Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Embedding Transfer with Label Relaxation for Improved Metric Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents a novel method for embedding transfer, a task of transferring knowledge of a learned embedding model to another. Our method exploits pairwise similarities between samples in the source embedding space as the knowledge, and transfers them through a loss used for learning target embedding models. To this end, we design a new loss called relaxed contrastive loss, which employs the pairwise similarities as relaxed labels for inter-sample relations. Our loss provides a rich supervisory signal beyond class equivalence, enables more important pairs to contribute more to training, and imposes no restriction on manifolds of target embedding spaces. Experiments on metric learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method largely improves performance, or reduces sizes and output dimensions of target models effectively. We further show that it can be also used to enhance quality of self-supervised representation and performance of classification models. In all the experiments, our method clearly outperforms existing embedding transfer techniques.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
