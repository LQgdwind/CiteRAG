Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: OSCAR: Data-Driven Operational Space Control for Adaptive and Robust Robot Manipulation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Learning performant robot manipulation policies can be challenging due to high-dimensional continuous actions and complex physics-based dynamics. This can be alleviated through intelligent choice of action space. Operational Space Control (OSC) has been used as an effective task-space controller for manipulation. Nonetheless, its strength depends on the underlying modeling fidelity, and is prone to failure when there are modeling errors. In this work, we propose OSC for Adaptation and Robustness (OSCAR), a data-driven variant of OSC that compensates for modeling errors by inferring relevant dynamics parameters from online trajectories. OSCAR decomposes dynamics learning into task-agnostic and task-specific phases, decoupling the dynamics dependencies of the robot and the extrinsics due to its environment. This structure enables robust zero-shot performance under out-of-distribution and rapid adaptation to significant domain shifts through additional finetuning. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated manipulation problems, and find substantial improvements over an array of controller baselines.
