Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Interpretable Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are widely deployed for defending various cyberattacks. Existing learning-based NIDS mainly uses Neural Network (NN) as a classifier that relies on the quality and quantity of cyberattack data. Such NN-based approaches are also hard to interpret for improving efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we design a new local-global computation paradigm, FedForest, a novel learning-based NIDS by combining the interpretable Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Federated Learning (FL) framework. Specifically, FedForest is composed of multiple clients that extract local cyberattack data features for the server to train models and detect intrusions. A privacy-enhanced technology is also proposed in FedForest to further defeat the privacy of the FL systems. Extensive experiments on 4 cyberattack datasets of different tasks demonstrate that FedForest is effective, efficient, interpretable, and extendable. FedForest ranks first in the collaborative learning and cybersecurity competition 2021 for Chinese college students.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
