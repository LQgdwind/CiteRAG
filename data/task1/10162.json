Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Synthetic Information towards Maximum Posterior Ratio for deep learning on Imbalanced Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work explores how class-imbalanced data affects deep learning and proposes a data balancing technique for mitigation by generating more synthetic data for the minority class. In contrast to random-based oversampling techniques, our approach prioritizes balancing the most informative region by finding high entropy samples. This approach is opportunistic and challenging because well-placed synthetic data points can boost machine learning algorithms’ accuracy and efficiency, whereas poorly-placed ones can cause a higher misclassification rate. In this study, we present an algorithm for maximizing the probability of generating a synthetic sample in the correct region of its class by placing it toward maximizing the class posterior ratio. In addition, to preserve data topology, synthetic data are closely generated within each minority sample neighborhood. Overall, experimental results on forty-one datasets show that our technique significantly outperforms experimental methods in terms of boosting deep-learning performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
