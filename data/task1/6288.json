Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithms for Socially Fair 𝑘-Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study approximation algorithms for the socially fair (ℓp,k)subscriptℓ𝑝𝑘(\\ell_{p},k)-clustering problem with m𝑚m groups, whose special cases include the socially fair k𝑘k-median (p=1𝑝1p=1) and socially fair k𝑘k-means (p=2𝑝2p=2) problems. We present (1) a polynomial-time (5+2​6)psuperscript526𝑝(5+2\\sqrt{6})^{p}-approximation with at most k+m𝑘𝑚k+m centers (2) a (5+2​6+ϵ)psuperscript526italic-ϵ𝑝(5+2\\sqrt{6}+\\epsilon)^{p}-approximation with k𝑘k centers in time n2O​(p)⋅m2superscript𝑛⋅superscript2𝑂𝑝superscript𝑚2n^{2^{O(p)}\\cdot m^{2}}, and (3) a (15+6​6)psuperscript1566𝑝(15+6\\sqrt{6})^{p} approximation with k𝑘k centers in time km⋅poly​(n)⋅superscript𝑘𝑚poly𝑛k^{m}\\cdot\\text{poly}(n). The first result is obtained via a refinement of the iterative rounding method using a sequence of linear programs. The latter two results are obtained by converting a solution with up to k+m𝑘𝑚k+m centers to one with k𝑘k centers using sparsification methods for (2) and via an exhaustive search for (3). We also compare the performance of our algorithms with existing bicriteria algorithms as well as exactly k𝑘k center approximation algorithms on benchmark datasets, and find that our algorithms also outperform existing methods in practice.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
