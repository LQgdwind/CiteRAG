      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Recurrent Federated Learning for Edge Popularity Prediction in Privacy-Preserving Mobile Edge Computing Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Nowadays wireless communication is rapidly reshaping entire industry sectors. In particular, mobile edge computing (MEC) as an enabling technology for industrial Internet of things (IIoT) brings powerful computing/storage infrastructure closer to the mobile terminals and, thereby, significantly lowers the response latency. To reap the benefit of proactive caching at the network edge, precise knowledge on the popularity pattern among the end devices is essential. However, (i) the spatiotemporal variability of content popularity, (ii) the data deficiency in privacy-preserving system, (iii) the costly manual labels in supervised learning as well as (iv) the not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) user behaviors pose tough challenges to the acquisition and prediction of content popularities. In this article, we propose an unsupervised and privacy-preserving popularity prediction framework for MEC-enabled IIoT to achieve a high popularity prediction accuracy while addressing the challenges. Specifically, the concepts of local and global popularities are introduced and the time-varying popularity of each user is modelled as a model-free Markov chain. On this basis, we derive and validate the essential relationship between the local and global popularities and then propose an unsupervised recurrent federated learning (URFL) algorithm to predict the distributed popularity while achieving privacy preservation and unsupervised training. Moreover, a federated loss-weighted averaging (FedLWA) scheme for the parameter aggregation is further designed to alleviate the problem of non-i.i.d. user behaviors. Simulations indicate that the proposed framework can enhance the prediction accuracy in terms of a reduced root-mean-squared error by up to 60.5%percent60.560.5\\%–68.7%percent68.768.7\\% compared to other baseline methods, i.e., recommendation algorithms, centralized learning algorithms, and other distributed learning algorithms. Additionally, manual labeling and violation of users’ data privacy are both avoided.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
