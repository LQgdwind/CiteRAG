Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training with Unified Modality Masking for Visual Document Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents GenDoc, a general sequence-to-sequence document understanding model pre-trained with unified masking across three modalities: text, image, and layout. The proposed model utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture, which allows for increased adaptability to a wide range of downstream tasks with diverse output formats, in contrast to the encoder-only models commonly employed in document understanding. In addition to the traditional text infilling task used in previous encoder-decoder models, our pre-training extends to include tasks of masked image token prediction and masked layout prediction. We also design modality-specific instruction and adopt both disentangled attention and the mixture-of-modality-experts strategy to effectively capture the information leveraged by each modality. Evaluation of the proposed model through extensive experiments on several downstream tasks in document understanding demonstrates its ability to achieve superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis further suggests that GenDoc is more robust than the encoder-only models in scenarios where the OCR quality is imperfect.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
