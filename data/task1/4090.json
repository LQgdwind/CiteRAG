Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Self-supervised Sequential Recommendation with Robust Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Sequential Recommendation describes a set of techniques to model dynamic user behavior in order to predict future interactions in sequential user data. At their core, such approaches model transition probabilities between items in a sequence, whether through Markov chains, recurrent networks, or more recently, Transformers. However both old and new issues remain, including data-sparsity and noisy data; such issues can impair performance, especially in complex, parameter-hungry models. In this paper, we investigate the application of contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to sequential recommendation, as a way to alleviate some of these issues. Contrastive SSL constructs augmentations from unlabelled instances, where agreements among positive pairs are maximized. It is challenging to devise a contrastive SSL framework for sequential recommendation, due to its discrete nature, correlations among items, and skewness of length distributions. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Contrastive Self-supervised Learning for Sequential Recommendation (CoSeRec). We introduce two informative augmentation operators leveraging item correlations to create high quality views for contrastive learning. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on improving model performance, and the robustness against sparse and noisy data. Our implementation is available: https://github.com/YChen1993/CoSeRec\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
