Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: All You Need is LUV: Unsupervised Collection of Labeled Images Using UV-Fluorescent Markings\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Large-scale semantic image annotation is a significant challenge for learning-based perception systems in robotics. Current approaches often rely on human labelers, which can be expensive, or simulation data, which can visually or physically differ from real data. This paper proposes Labels from UltraViolet (LUV), a novel framework that enables rapid, labeled data collection in real manipulation environments without human labeling. LUV uses transparent, ultraviolet-fluorescent paint with programmable ultraviolet LEDs to collect paired images of a scene in standard lighting and UV lighting to autonomously extract segmentation masks and keypoints via color segmentation. We apply LUV to a suite of diverse robot perception tasks to evaluate its labeling quality, flexibility, and data collection rate. Results suggest that LUV is 180-2500 times faster than a human labeler across the tasks. We show that LUV provides labels consistent with human annotations on unpainted test images. The networks trained on these labels are used to smooth and fold crumpled towels with 83% success rate and achieve 1.7mm position error with respect to human labels on a surgical needle pose estimation task. The low cost of LUV makes it ideal as a lightweight replacement for human labeling systems, with the one-time setup costs at $300 equivalent to the cost of collecting around 200 semantic segmentation labels on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
