Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Extended High Utility Pattern Mining: An Answer Set Programming Based Framework and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Detecting sets of relevant patterns from a given dataset is an important challenge in data mining. The relevance of a pattern, also called utility in the literature, is a subjective measure and can be actually assessed from very different points of view. Rule-based languages like Answer Set Programming (ASP) seem well suited for specifying user-provided criteria to assess pattern utility in a form of constraints; moreover, declarativity of ASP allows for a very easy switch between several criteria in order to analyze the dataset from different points of view. In this paper, we make steps toward extending the notion of High Utility Pattern Mining (HUPM); in particular we introduce a new framework that allows for new classes of utility criteria not considered in the previous literature. We also show how recent extensions of ASP with external functions can support a fast and effective encoding and testing of the new framework. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework, we exploit it as a building block for the definition of an innovative method for predicting ICU admission for COVID-19 patients. Finally, an extensive experimental activity demonstrates both from a quantitative and a qualitative point of view the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
