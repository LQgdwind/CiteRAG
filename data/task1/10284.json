      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Learning from Graphs with Heterophily: Progress and Future\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graphs are structured data that models complex relations between real-world entities. Heterophilous graphs, where linked nodes are prone to be with different labels or dissimilar features, have recently attracted significant attention and found many applications. Meanwhile, increasing efforts have been made to advance learning from heterophilous graphs. Although there exist surveys on the relevant topic, they focus on heterophilous GNNs, which are only sub-topics of heterophilous graph learning. In this survey, we comprehensively overview existing works on learning from graphs with heterophily. First, we collect over 180 publications and introduce the development of this field. Then, we systematically categorize existing methods based on a hierarchical taxonomy including learning strategies, model architectures and practical applications. Finally, we discuss the primary challenges of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research. More publication details and corresponding open-source codes can be accessed and will be continuously updated at our repositories: https://github.com/gongchenghua/Awesome-Survey-Graphs-with-Heterophily.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 66\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
