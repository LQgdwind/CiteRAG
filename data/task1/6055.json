Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: How Powerful are ùêæ-hop Message Passing Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The most popular design paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is 1-hop message passing‚Äîaggregating information from 1-hop neighbors repeatedly. However, the expressive power of 1-hop message passing is bounded by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Recently, researchers extended 1-hop message passing to KùêæK-hop message passing by aggregating information from KùêæK-hop neighbors of nodes simultaneously. However, there is no work on analyzing the expressive power of KùêæK-hop message passing. In this work, we theoretically characterize the expressive power of KùêæK-hop message passing. Specifically, we first formally differentiate two different kernels of KùêæK-hop message passing which are often misused in previous works. We then characterize the expressive power of KùêæK-hop message passing by showing that it is more powerful than 1-WL and can distinguish almost all regular graphs. Despite the higher expressive power, we show that KùêæK-hop message passing still cannot distinguish some simple regular graphs and its expressive power is bounded by 3-WL. To further enhance its expressive power, we introduce a KP-GNN framework, which improves KùêæK-hop message passing by leveraging the peripheral subgraph information in each hop. We show that KP-GNN can distinguish many distance regular graphs which could not be distinguished by previous distance encoding or 3-WL methods. Experimental results verify the expressive power and effectiveness of KP-GNN. KP-GNN achieves competitive results across all benchmark datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
