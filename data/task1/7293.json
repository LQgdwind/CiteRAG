Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the importance of data collection for training general goal-reaching policies\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advances in ML suggest that the quantity of data available to a model is one of the primary bottlenecks to high performance. Although for language-based tasks there exist almost unlimited amounts of reasonably coherent data to train from, this is generally not the case for Reinforcement Learning, especially when dealing with a novel environment. In effect, even a relatively trivial continuous environment has an almost limitless number of states, but simply sampling random states and actions will likely not provide transitions that are interesting or useful for any potential downstream task. How should one generate massive amounts of useful data given only an MDP with no indication of downstream tasks? Are the quantity and quality of data truly transformative to the performance of a general controller? We propose to answer both of these questions. First, we introduce a principled unsupervised exploration method, ChronoGEM, which aims to achieve uniform coverage over the manifold of achievable states, which we believe is the most reasonable goal given no prior task information. Secondly, we investigate the effects of both data quantity and data quality on the training of a downstream goal-achievement policy, and show that both large quantities and high-quality of data are essential to train a general controller: a high-precision pose-achievement policy capable of attaining a large number of poses over numerous continuous control embodiments including humanoid.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
