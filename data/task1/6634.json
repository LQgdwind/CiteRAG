Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: EvolveHypergraph: Group-Aware Dynamic Relational Reasoning for Trajectory Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While the modeling of pair-wise relations has been widely studied in multi-agent interacting systems, its ability to capture higher-level and larger-scale group-wise activities is limited. In this paper, we propose a group-aware relational reasoning approach (named EvolveHypergraph) with explicit inference of the underlying dynamically evolving relational structures, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-agent trajectory prediction. In addition to the edges between a pair of nodes (i.e., agents), we propose to infer hyperedges that adaptively connect multiple nodes to enable group-aware relational reasoning in an unsupervised manner without fixing the number of hyperedges. The proposed approach infers the dynamically evolving relation graphs and hypergraphs over time to capture the evolution of relations, which are used by the trajectory predictor to obtain future states. Moreover, we propose to regularize the smoothness of the relation evolution and the sparsity of the inferred graphs or hypergraphs, which effectively improves training stability and enhances the explainability of inferred relations. The proposed approach is validated on both synthetic crowd simulations and multiple real-world benchmark datasets. Our approach infers explainable, reasonable group-aware relations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-term prediction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
