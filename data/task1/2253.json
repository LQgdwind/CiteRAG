Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: LayoutGMN: Neural Graph Matching for Structural Layout Similarity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a deep neural network to predict structural similarity between 2D layouts by leveraging Graph Matching Networks (GMN). Our network, coined LayoutGMN, learns the layout metric via neural graph matching, using an attention-based GMN designed under a triplet network setting. To train our network, we utilize weak labels obtained by pixel-wise Intersection-over-Union (IoUs) to define the triplet loss. Importantly, LayoutGMN is built with a structural bias which can effectively compensate for the lack of structure awareness in IoUs. We demonstrate this on two prominent forms of layouts, viz., floorplans and UI designs, via retrieval experiments on large-scale datasets. In particular, retrieval results by our network better match human judgement of structural layout similarity compared to both IoUs and other baselines including a state-of-the-art method based on graph neural networks and image convolution. In addition, LayoutGMN is the first deep model to offer both metric learning of structural layout similarity and structural matching between layout elements.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
