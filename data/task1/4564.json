Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Branch Predicting with Sparse Distributed Memories\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Modern processors rely heavily on speculation to keep the pipeline filled and consequently execute and commit instructions as close to maximum capacity as possible. To improve instruction level parallelism, the processor core needs to fetch and decode multiple instructions per cycle and has come to rely on incredibly accurate branch prediction. However, this comes at cost of the increased area and complexity which is needed for modern high accuracy branch predictors. The key idea described in this work is to use hyperdimensional computing and sparse distributed memory principles to create a novel branch predictor that can deliver complex predictions for a fraction of the current area. Sparse distributed memories can store vast amounts of data in a compressed manner, theoretically enabling branch histories larger and more precise than the branch predictors used today to be stored with equal or smaller area footprint. Furthermore, as all the data is in a hashed format and due to the nature of the hashing scheme used, it is inherently harder to manipulate with known side channel attacks. We describe our proof-of-concept and evaluate it against a state-of-the-art academic TAGE predictor. Our experiments are conducted on realistic synthetic branch predictor patterns and the Championship Branch Prediction traces and show competitive accuracy. Finally, we describe techniques that can be used to solve some of the challenges of processing with hyperdimensional vectors in order to deliver timely predictions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
