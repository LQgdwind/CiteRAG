Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Membership Inference on Word Embedding and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the text processing context, most ML models are built on word embeddings. These embeddings are themselves trained on some datasets, potentially containing sensitive data. In some cases this training is done independently, in other cases, it occurs as part of training a larger, task-specific model. In either case, it is of interest to consider membership inference attacks based on the embedding layer as a way of understanding sensitive information leakage. But, somewhat surprisingly, membership inference attacks on word embeddings and their effect in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks that use these embeddings, have remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we show that word embeddings are vulnerable to black-box membership inference attacks under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we show that this leakage persists through two other major NLP applications: classification and text-generation, even when the embedding layer is not exposed to the attacker. We show that our MI attack achieves high attack accuracy against a classifier model and an LSTM-based language model. Indeed, our attack is a cheaper membership inference attack on text-generative models, which does not require the knowledge of the target model or any expensive training of text-generative models as shadow models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
