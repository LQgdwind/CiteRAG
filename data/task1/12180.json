Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Reversing the Damage: A QP-Aware Transformer-Diffusion Approach for 8K Video Restoration under Codec Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we introduce DiQP; a novel Transformer-Diffusion model for restoring 8K video quality degraded by codec compression. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to consider restoring the artifacts introduced by various codecs (AV1, HEVC) by Denoising Diffusion without considering additional noise. This approach allows us to model the complex, non-Gaussian nature of compression artifacts, effectively learning to reverse the degradation. Our architecture combines the power of Transformers to capture long-range dependencies with an enhanced windowed mechanism that preserves spatio-temporal context within groups of pixels across frames. To further enhance restoration, the model incorporates auxiliary ”Look Ahead” and ”Look Around” modules, providing both future and surrounding frame information to aid in reconstructing fine details and enhancing overall visual quality. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for high-resolution videos such as 4K and 8K, showcasing its effectiveness in restoring perceptually pleasing videos from highly compressed sources. 111https://github.com/alimd94/DiQP\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
