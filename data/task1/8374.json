      "content": "Paper Title: DAMO-StreamNet: Optimizing Streaming Perception in Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Real-time perception, or streaming perception, is a crucial aspect of autonomous driving that has yet to be thoroughly explored in existing research. To address this gap, we present DAMO-StreamNet, an optimized framework that combines recent advances from the YOLO series with a comprehensive analysis of spatial and temporal perception mechanisms, delivering a cutting-edge solution. The key innovations of DAMO-StreamNet are: (1) A robust neck structure incorporating deformable convolution, enhancing the receptive field and feature alignment capabilities. (2) A dual-branch structure that integrates short-path semantic features and long-path temporal features, improving motion state prediction accuracy. (3) Logits-level distillation for efficient optimization, aligning the logits of teacher and student networks in semantic space. (4) A real-time forecasting mechanism that updates support frame features with the current frame, ensuring seamless streaming perception during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that DAMO-StreamNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving 37.8% (normal size (600, 960)) and 43.3% (large size (1200, 1920)) sAP without using extra data. This work not only sets a new benchmark for real-time perception but also provides valuable insights for future research. Additionally, DAMO-StreamNet can be applied to various autonomous systems, such as drones and robots, paving the way for real-time perception111Code is at https://github.com/zhiqic/DAMO-StreamNet.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
