Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterised Complexity of Consistent Query Answering via Graph Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We study consistent query answering via different graph representations. First, we introduce solution-conflict hypergraphs in which nodes represent facts and edges represent either conflicts or query solutions. Considering a monotonic query and a set of antimonotonic constraints, we present an explicit algorithm for counting the number of repairs satisfying the query based on a tree decomposition of the solution-conflict hypergraph. The algorithm not only provides fixed-parameter tractability results for data complexity over expressive query and constraint classes, but also introduces a novel and potentially implementable approach to repair counting. Second, we consider the Gaifman graphs arising from MSO descriptions of consistent query answering. Using a generalization of Courcelle’s theorem, we then present fixed-parameter tractability results for combined complexity over expressive query and constraint classes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
