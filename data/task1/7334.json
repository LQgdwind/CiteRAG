Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: SA-DPSGD: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent based on Simulated Annealing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Differential privacy (DP) provides a formal privacy guarantee that prevents adversaries with access to machine learning models from extracting information about individual training points. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) is the most popular training method with differential privacy in image recognition. However, existing DPSGD schemes lead to significant performance degradation, which prevents the application of differential privacy. In this paper, we propose a simulated annealing-based differentially private stochastic gradient descent scheme (SA-DPSGD) which accepts a candidate update with a probability that depends both on the update quality and on the number of iterations. Through this random update screening, we make the differentially private gradient descent proceed in the right direction in each iteration, and result in a more accurate model finally. In our experiments, under the same hyperparameters, our scheme achieves test accuracies 98.35%, 87.41% and 60.92% on datasets MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art result of 98.12%, 86.33% and 59.34%. Under the freely adjusted hyperparameters, our scheme achieves even higher accuracies, 98.89%, 88.50% and 64.17%. We believe that our method has a great contribution for closing the accuracy gap between private and non-private image classification.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
