Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: NN-EVCLUS: Neural Network-based Evidential Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Evidential clustering is an approach to clustering based on the use of Dempster-Shafer mass functions to represent cluster-membership uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a neural-network based evidential clustering algorithm, called NN-EVCLUS, which learns a mapping from attribute vectors to mass functions, in such a way that more similar inputs are mapped to output mass functions with a lower degree of conflict. The neural network can be paired with a one-class support vector machine to make it robust to outliers and capable of detecting previously unseen clusters when applied to new data. The network is trained to minimize the discrepancy between dissimilarities and degrees of conflict for all or some object pairs. Additional terms can be added to the loss function to account for pairwise constraints or labeled data, which can also be used to adapt the metric. Comparative experiments show the superiority of NN-EVCLUS over state-of-the-art evidential clustering algorithms for a range of unsupervised and constrained clustering tasks involving both attribute and dissimilarity data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 62\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
