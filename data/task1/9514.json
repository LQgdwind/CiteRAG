Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: FedBug: A Bottom-Up Gradual Unfreezing Framework for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated Learning (FL) offers a collaborative training framework, allowing multiple clients to contribute to a shared model without compromising data privacy. Due to the heterogeneous nature of local datasets, updated client models may overfit and diverge from one another, commonly known as the problem of client drift. In this paper, we propose FedBug (Federated Learning with Bottom-Up Gradual Unfreezing), a novel FL framework designed to effectively mitigate client drift. FedBug adaptively leverages the client model parameters, distributed by the server at each global round, as the reference points for cross-client alignment. Specifically, on the client side, FedBug begins by freezing the entire model, then gradually unfreezes the layers, from the input layer to the output layer. This bottom-up approach allows models to train the newly thawed layers to project data into a latent space, wherein the separating hyperplanes remain consistent across all clients. We theoretically analyze FedBug in a novel over-parameterization FL setup, revealing its superior convergence rate compared to FedAvg. Through comprehensive experiments, spanning various datasets, training conditions, and network architectures, we validate the efficacy of FedBug. Our contributions encompass a novel FL framework, theoretical analysis, and empirical validation, demonstrating the wide potential and applicability of FedBug.111Code is available at https://github.com/IandRover/FedBug.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
