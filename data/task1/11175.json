Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width k𝑘k there is an 𝒪​(k2​nk)𝒪superscript𝑘2superscript𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}n^{k}) algorithm for arbitrary graphs with n𝑛n vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no f​(k)​no​(k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘f(k)n^{o(k)} time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) algorithm for arbitrary posets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
