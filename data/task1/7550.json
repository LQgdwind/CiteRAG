      "content": "Paper Title: Solving the Side-Chain Packing Arrangement of Proteins from Reinforcement Learned Stochastic Decision Making\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Protein structure prediction is a fundamental problem in computational molecular biology. Classical algorithms such as ab-initio or threading as well as many learning methods have been proposed to solve this challenging problem. However, most reinforcement learning methods tend to model the state-action pairs as discrete objects. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in a continuous setting and based on a stochastic parametrized Hamiltonian version of the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) to solve the side-chain packing and protein-folding problem. For special cases our formulation can be reduced to previous work where the optimal folding trajectories are trained using an explicit use of Langevin dynamics. Optimal continuous stochastic Hamiltonian dynamics folding pathways can be derived with use of different models of molecular energetics and force fields. In our RL implementation we adopt a soft actor-critic methodology however we can replace this other RL training based on A2C, A3C or PPO.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
