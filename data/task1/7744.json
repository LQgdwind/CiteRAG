Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that enables collaboratively learning a shared model across massive clients while keeping the training data locally. However, for many existing FL systems, clients need to frequently exchange model parameters of large data size with the remote cloud server directly via wide-area networks (WAN), leading to significant communication overhead and long transmission time. To mitigate the communication bottleneck, we resort to the hierarchical federated learning paradigm of HiFL, which reaps the benefits of mobile edge computing and combines synchronous client-edge model aggregation and asynchronous edge-cloud model aggregation together to greatly reduce the traffic volumes of WAN transmissions. Specifically, we first analyze the convergence bound of HiFL theoretically and identify the key controllable factors for model performance improvement. We then advocate an enhanced design of HiFlash by innovatively integrating deep reinforcement learning based adaptive staleness control and heterogeneity-aware client-edge association strategy to boost the system efficiency and mitigate the staleness effect without compromising model accuracy. Extensive experiments corroborate the superior performance of HiFlash in model accuracy, communication reduction, and system efficiency.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
