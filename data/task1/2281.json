Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mapping Surfaces with Earcut\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Mapping a shape to some parametric domain is a fundamental tool in graphics and scientific computing. In practice, a map between two shapes is commonly represented by two meshes with same connectivity and different embedding. The standard approach is to input a meshing of one of the two domains plus a function that projects its boundary to the other domain, and then solve for the position of the interior vertices. Inspired by basic principles in mesh generation, in this paper we present the reader a novel point of view on mesh parameterization: we consider connectivity as an additional unknown, and assume that our inputs are just two boundaries that enclose the domains we want to connect. We compute the map by simultaneously growing the same mesh inside both shapes.This change in perspective allows us to recast the parameterization problem as a mesh generation problem, granting access to a wide set of mature tools that are typically not used in this setting. Our practical outcome is a provably robust yet trivial to implement algorithm that maps any planar shape with simple topology to a homotopic domain that is weakly visible from an inner convex kernel. Furthermore, we speculate on a possible extension of the proposed ideas to volumetric maps, listing the major challenges that arise. Differently from prior methods – for which we show that a volumetric extension is not possible – our analysis leaves us reasoneable hopes that the robust generation of volumetric maps via compatible mesh generation could be obtained in the future.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
