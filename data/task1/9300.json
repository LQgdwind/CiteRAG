Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On Logic-Based Explainability with Partially Specified Inputs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In the practical deployment of machine learning (ML) models, missing data represents a recurring challenge. Missing data is often addressed when training ML models. But missing data also needs to be addressed when deciding predictions and when explaining those predictions. Missing data represents an opportunity to partially specify the inputs of the prediction to be explained. This paper studies the computation of logic-based explanations in the presence of partially specified inputs. The paper shows that most of the algorithms proposed in recent years for computing logic-based explanations can be generalized for computing explanations given the partially specified inputs. One related result is that the complexity of computing logic-based explanations remains unchanged. A similar result is proved in the case of logic-based explainability subject to input constraints. Furthermore, the proposed solution for computing explanations given partially specified inputs is applied to classifiers obtained from well-known public datasets, thereby illustrating a number of novel explainability use cases.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
