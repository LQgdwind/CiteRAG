Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Unifying Model for Locally Constrained Spanning Tree Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Given a graph Gùê∫G and a digraph Dùê∑D whose vertices are the edges of Gùê∫G, we investigate the problem of finding a spanning tree of Gùê∫G that satisfies the constraints imposed by Dùê∑D. The restrictions to add an edge in the tree depend on its neighborhood in Dùê∑D. Here, we generalize previously investigated problems by also considering as input functions ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell and uùë¢u on E‚Äã(G)ùê∏ùê∫E(G) that give a lower and an upper bound, respectively, on the number of constraints that must be satisfied by each edge. The produced feasibility problem is denoted by G-DCST, while the optimization problem is denoted by G-DCMST. We show that G-DCST is \\NP\\NP\\NP-complete even under strong assumptions on the structures of Gùê∫G and Dùê∑D, as well as on functions ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell and uùë¢u. On the positive side, we prove two polynomial results, one for G-DCST and another for G-DCMST, and also give a simple exponential-time algorithm along with a proof that it is asymptotically optimal under the ETH. Finally, we prove that other previously studied constrained spanning tree (CST) problems can be modeled within our framework, namely, the Conflict CST, the Forcing CST, the At Least One/All Dependency CST, the Maximum Degree CST, the Minimum Degree CST, and the Fixed-Leaves Minimum Degree CST.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
