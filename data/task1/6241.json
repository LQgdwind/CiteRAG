Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Global Semantic Similarities in Knowledge Graphs by Relational Prototype Entities\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Knowledge graph (KG) embedding aims at learning the latent representations for entities and relations of a KG in continuous vector spaces. An empirical observation is that the head (tail) entities connected by the same relation often share similar semantic attributes—specifically, they often belong to the same category—no matter how far away they are from each other in the KG; that is, they share global semantic similarities. However, many existing methods derive KG embeddings based on the local information, which fail to effectively capture such global semantic similarities among entities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, which introduces a set of virtual nodes called relational prototype entities to represent the prototypes of the head and tail entities connected by the same relations. By enforcing the entities’ embeddings close to their associated prototypes’ embeddings, our approach can effectively encourage the global semantic similarities of entities—that can be far away in the KG—connected by the same relation. Experiments on the entity alignment and KG completion tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-arts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
