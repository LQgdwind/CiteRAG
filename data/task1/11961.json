      "content": "Paper Title: Hypergraphs as Weighted Directed Self-Looped Graphs: Spectral Properties, Clustering, Cheeger Inequality\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Hypergraphs naturally arise when studying group relations and have been widely used in the field of machine learning. There has not been a unified formulation of hypergraphs, yet the recently proposed edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVW) modeling [7] is one of the most generalized modeling methods of hypergraphs, i.e., most existing hypergraphs can be formulated as EDVW hypergraphs without any information loss to the best of our knowledge. However, the relevant algorithmic developments on EDVW hypergraphs remain nascent: compared to spectral graph theories, the formulations are incomplete, the spectral clustering algorithms are not well-developed, and one result regarding hypergraph Cheeger Inequality is even incorrect. To this end, deriving a unified random walk-based formulation, we propose our definitions of hypergraph Rayleigh Quotient, NCut, boundary/cut, volume, and conductance, which are consistent with the corresponding definitions on graphs. Then, we prove that the normalized hypergraph Laplacian is associated with the NCut value, which inspires our HyperClus-G algorithm for spectral clustering on EDVW hypergraphs. Finally, we prove that HyperClus-G can always find an approximately linearly optimal partitioning in terms of Both NCut111The NCut of the returned partition ùí©ùí©\\mathcal{N} and the optimal NCut of any partition ùí©‚àósuperscriptùí©\\mathcal{N}^{*} satisfy ùí©‚â§O‚Äã(ùí©‚àó)ùí©ùëÇsuperscriptùí©\\mathcal{N}\\leq O(\\mathcal{N}^{*}). and conductance 222The conductance of the returned partition Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi and the optimal conductance Œ¶‚àósuperscriptŒ¶\\Phi^{*} satisfy Œ¶‚â§O‚Äã(Œ¶‚àó)Œ¶ùëÇsuperscriptŒ¶\\Phi\\leq O(\\Phi^{*}). Additionally, we provide extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings from an empirical perspective.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
