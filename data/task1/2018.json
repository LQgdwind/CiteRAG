      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search under L-infinity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We show conditional hardness of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN) under the ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty} norm with two simple reductions. Our first reduction shows that hardness of a special case of the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), which captures many provably hard instances of SVP, implies a lower bound for ANN with polynomial preprocessing time under the same norm. Combined with a recent quantitative hardness result on SVP under ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty} (Bennett et al., FOCS 2017), our reduction implies that finding a (1+Œµ)1ùúÄ(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate nearest neighbor under ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty} with polynomial preprocessing requires near-linear query time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false. This complements the results of Rubinstein (STOC 2018), who showed hardness of ANN under ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1}, ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2}, and edit distance. Further improving the approximation factor for hardness, we show that, assuming SETH, near-linear query time is required for any approximation factor less than 333 under ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty}. This shows a conditional separation between ANN under the ‚Ñì1/‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{1}/\\ell_{2} norm and the ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty} norm since there are sublinear time algorithms achieving better than 333-approximation for the ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} and ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norm. Lastly, we show that the approximation factor of 333 is a barrier for any naive gadget reduction from the Orthogonal Vectors problem.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
