Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In a recent paper, Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam [BGM21] introduced higher order MDS codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell MDS code, denoted by MDS‚Å°(‚Ñì)MDS‚Ñì\\operatorname{MDS}(\\ell), has the property that any ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An independent work by Roth [Rot21] defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly) equivalent. We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are MDS‚Å°(‚Ñì)MDS‚Ñì\\operatorname{MDS}(\\ell) for all ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a random Reed-Solomon code of rate RùëÖR over an exponentially large field is list decodable from radius 1‚àíR‚àíŒµ1ùëÖùúÄ1-R-\\varepsilon with list size at most 1‚àíR‚àíŒµŒµ1ùëÖùúÄùúÄ\\frac{1-R-\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon}, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo [ST20].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
