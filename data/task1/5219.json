      "content": "Paper Title: Pre-Trained Language Transformers are Universal Image Classifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Facial images disclose many hidden personal traits such as age, gender, race, health, emotion, and psychology. Understanding these traits will help to classify the people in different attributes. In this paper, we have presented a novel method for classifying images using a pretrained transformer model. We apply the pretrained transformer for the binary classification of facial images in criminal and non-criminal classes. The pretrained transformer of GPT-2 is trained to generate text and then fine-tuned to classify facial images. During the finetuning process with images, most of the layers of GT-2 are frozen during backpropagation and the model is frozen pretrained transformer (FPT). The FPT acts as a universal image classifier, and this paper shows the application of FPT on facial images. We also use our FPT on encrypted images for classification. Our FPT shows high accuracy on both raw facial images and encrypted images. We hypothesize the meta-learning capacity FPT gained because of its large size and trained on a large size with theory and experiments. The GPT-2 trained to generate a single word token at a time, through the autoregressive process, forced to heavy-tail distribution. Then the FPT uses the heavy-tail property as its meta-learning capacity for classifying images. Our work shows one way to avoid bias during the machine classification of images. The FPT encodes worldly knowledge because of the pretraining of one text, which it uses during the classification. The statistical error of classification is reduced because of the added context gained from the text. Our paper shows the ethical dimension of using encrypted data for classification. Criminal images are sensitive to share across the boundary but encrypted largely evades ethical concern. FPT showing good classification accuracy on encrypted images shows promise for further research on privacy-preserving machine learning. We have collected facial images of criminal and non-criminal classes from multiple web sources for a balanced training data set. For experimentation, we used in total 20k images of criminals and non-criminals (10k for each class) collected from eleven different data sources. Our findings show that our proposed model can classify criminal and non-criminal images with 0.99 AUROC and 0.98 average Precision. For better generalization of our model, we also encrypted images using the Chaos-Based Image-Encryption algorithm. In our experiments, the proposed method can classify encrypted images with 0.98 AUROC and 0.97 average Precision.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
