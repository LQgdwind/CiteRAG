      "content": "Paper Title: FloorSet - a VLSI Floorplanning Dataset with Design Constraints of Real-World SoCs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Floorplanning for systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and its sub-systems is a crucial and non-trivial step of the physical design flow. It represents a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. A typical large scale SoC with 120 partitions generates a search-space of ∼10250similar-toabsentsuperscript10250\\sim 10^{250}. As novel machine learning (ML) approaches emerge to tackle such problems, there is a growing need for a modern benchmark that comprises a large training dataset and performance metrics that better reflect real-world constraints and objectives compared to existing benchmarks. To address this need, we present 𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝\\mathtt{FloorSet} - two comprehensive datasets of synthetic fixed-outline floorplan layouts that reflect the distribution of real SoCs. Each dataset has 1​M1𝑀1M training samples and 100100100 test samples where each sample is a synthetic floorplan. 𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝\\mathtt{FloorSet}-Prime comprises fully-abutted rectilinear partitions and near-optimal wire-length. A simplified dataset that reflects early design phases, 𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝\\mathtt{FloorSet}-Lite comprises rectangular partitions, with <5%absentpercent5<5\\% white-space and near-optimal wire-length. Both datasets define hard constraints seen in modern design flows such as shape constraints, edge-affinity, grouping constraints, and pre-placement constraints. 𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝\\mathtt{FloorSet} is intended to spur fundamental research on large-scale constrained optimization problems. Crucially, 𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝\\mathtt{FloorSet} alleviates the core issue of reproducibility in modern ML driven solutions to such problems. 𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚛𝚂𝚎𝚝\\mathtt{FloorSet} is available as an open-source repository for the research community111https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Constrained_Floorplans_Dataset-D490/.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
