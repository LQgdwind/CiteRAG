Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: One-Shot Graph Representation Learning Using Hyperdimensional Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a novel, simple, fast, and efficient approach for semi-supervised learning on graphs. The proposed approach takes advantage of hyper-dimensional computing which encodes data samples using random projections into a high dimensional space (HD space for short). Specifically, we propose a Hyper-dimensional Graph Learning (HDGL) algorithm that leverages the injectivity property of the node representations of a family of graph neural networks. HDGL maps node features to the HD space and then uses HD operators such as bundling and binding to aggregate information from the local neighborhood of each node. Results of experiments with widely used benchmark data sets show that HDGL achieves predictive performance that is competitive with the state-of-the-art deep learning methods, without the need for computationally expensive training.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
