      "content": "Paper Title: Provably Efficient Offline Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Strategy-wise Bonus\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper considers offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose the strategy-wise concentration principle which directly builds a confidence interval for the joint strategy, in contrast to the point-wise concentration principle that builds a confidence interval for each point in the joint action space. For two-player zero-sum Markov games, by exploiting the convexity of the strategy-wise bonus, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm whose sample complexity enjoys a better dependency on the number of actions than the prior methods based on the point-wise bonus. Furthermore, for offline multi-agent general-sum Markov games, based on the strategy-wise bonus and a novel surrogate function, we give the first algorithm whose sample complexity only scales ‚àëi=1mAisuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1ùëösubscriptùê¥ùëñ\\sum_{i=1}^{m}A_{i} where Aisubscriptùê¥ùëñA_{i} is the action size of the iùëñi-th player and mùëöm is the number of players. In sharp contrast, the sample complexity of methods based on the point-wise bonus would scale with the size of the joint action space Œ†i=1m‚ÄãAisuperscriptsubscriptŒ†ùëñ1ùëösubscriptùê¥ùëñ\\Pi_{i=1}^{m}A_{i} due to the curse of multiagents. Lastly, all of our algorithms can naturally take a pre-specified strategy class Œ†Œ†\\Pi as input and output a strategy that is close to the best strategy in Œ†Œ†\\Pi. In this setting, the sample complexity only scales with log‚Å°|Œ†|Œ†\\log|\\Pi| instead of ‚àëi=1mAisuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1ùëösubscriptùê¥ùëñ\\sum_{i=1}^{m}A_{i}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
