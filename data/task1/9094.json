Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: XInsight: Revealing Model Insights for GNNs with Flow-based Explanations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Progress in graph neural networks has grown rapidly in recent years, with many new developments in drug discovery, medical diagnosis, and recommender systems. While this progress is significant, many networks are ‘black boxes’ with little understanding of the ‘what’ exactly the network is learning. Many high-stakes applications, such as drug discovery, require human-intelligible explanations from the models so that users can recognize errors and discover new knowledge. Therefore, the development of explainable AI algorithms is essential for us to reap the benefits of AI. We propose an explainability algorithm for GNNs called eXplainable Insight (XInsight) that generates a distribution of model explanations using GFlowNets. Since GFlowNets generate objects with probabilities proportional to a reward, XInsight can generate a diverse set of explanations, compared to previous methods that only learn the maximum reward sample. We demonstrate XInsight by generating explanations for GNNs trained on two graph classification tasks: classifying mutagenic compounds with the MUTAG dataset and classifying acyclic graphs with a synthetic dataset that we have open-sourced. We show the utility of XInsight’s explanations by analyzing the generated compounds using QSAR modeling, and we find that XInsight generates compounds that cluster by lipophilicity, a known correlate of mutagenicity. Our results show that XInsight generates a distribution of explanations that uncovers the underlying relationships demonstrated by the model. They also highlight the importance of generating a diverse set of explanations, as it enables us to discover hidden relationships in the model and provides valuable guidance for further analysis.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
