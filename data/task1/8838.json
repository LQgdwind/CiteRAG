Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SMAP: A Novel Heterogeneous Information Framework for Scenario-based Optimal Model Assignment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The increasing maturity of big data applications has led to a proliferation of models targeting the same objectives within the same scenarios and datasets. However, selecting the most suitable model that considers modelâ€™s features while taking specific requirements and constraints into account still poses a significant challenge. Existing methods have focused on worker-task assignments based on crowdsourcing, they neglect the scenario-dataset-model assignment problem. To address this challenge, a new problem named the Scenario-based Optimal Model Assignment (SOMA) problem is introduced and a novel framework entitled Scenario and Model Associative percepts (SMAP) is developed. SMAP is a heterogeneous information framework that can integrate various types of information to intelligently select a suitable dataset and allocate the optimal model for a specific scenario. To comprehensively evaluate models, a new score function that utilizes multi-head attention mechanisms is proposed. Moreover, a novel memory mechanism named the mnemonic center is developed to store the matched heterogeneous information and prevent duplicate matching. Six popular traffic scenarios are selected as study cases and extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SMAP and the score function.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
