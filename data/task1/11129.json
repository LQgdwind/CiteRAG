      "content": "Paper Title: Superpolynomial Lower Bounds for Smooth 3-LCCs and Sharp Bounds for Designs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We give improved lower bounds for binary 333-query locally correctable codes (3-LCCs) 𝒞:{0,1}k→{0,1}n:𝒞→superscript01𝑘superscript01𝑛\\mathcal{C}\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{k}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}^{n}. Specifically, we prove: (1) If 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is a linear design 3-LCC, then n≥2(1−o​(1))​k𝑛superscript21𝑜1𝑘n\\geq 2^{(1-o(1))\\sqrt{k}}. A design 3-LCC has the additional property that the correcting sets for every codeword bit form a perfect matching and every pair of codeword bits is queried an equal number of times across all matchings. Our bound is tight up to a factor 88\\sqrt{8} in the exponent of 222, as the best construction of binary 333-LCCs (obtained by taking Reed–Muller codes on \\mathbb​F4\\mathbbsubscript𝐹4{\\mathbb F}_{4} and applying a natural projection map) is a design 333-LCC with n≤28​k𝑛superscript28𝑘n\\leq 2^{\\sqrt{8k}}. Up to a 88\\sqrt{8} factor, this resolves the Hamada conjecture on the maximum \\mathbb​F2\\mathbbsubscript𝐹2{\\mathbb F}_{2}-codimension of a 444-design. (2) If 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is a smooth, non-linear 333-LCC with near-perfect completeness, then, n≥kΩ​(log⁡k)𝑛superscript𝑘Ω𝑘n\\geq k^{\\Omega(\\log k)}. (3) If 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is a smooth, non-linear 333-LCC with completeness 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon, then n≥Ω~​(k12​ε)𝑛~Ωsuperscript𝑘12𝜀n\\geq\\tilde{\\Omega}(k^{\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}}). In particular, when ε𝜀\\varepsilon is a small constant, this implies a lower bound for general non-linear LCCs that beats the prior best n≥Ω~​(k3)𝑛~Ωsuperscript𝑘3n\\geq\\tilde{\\Omega}(k^{3}) lower bound of [AGKM23] by a polynomial factor. Our design LCC lower bound is obtained via a fine-grained analysis of the Kikuchi matrix method applied to a variant of the matrix used in [KM23]. Our lower bounds for non-linear codes are obtained by designing a from-scratch reduction from nonlinear 3-LCCs to a system of “chain polynomial equations” — polynomial equations with similar structure to the long chain derivations that arise in the lower bounds for linear 333-LCCs [KM23]. Keywords: Locally Correctable Codes, Locally Decodable Codes, Kikuchi Matrices\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
