Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Annotating Social Determinants of Health Using Active Learning, and Characterizing Determinants Using Neural Event Extraction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Social determinants of health (SDOH) affect health outcomes, and knowledge of SDOH can inform clinical decision-making. Automatically extracting SDOH information from clinical text requires data-driven information extraction models trained on annotated corpora that are heterogeneous and frequently include critical SDOH. This work presents a new corpus with SDOH annotations, a novel active learning framework, and the first extraction results on the new corpus. The Social History Annotation Corpus (SHAC) includes 4,480 social history sections with detailed annotation for 12 SDOH characterizing the status, extent, and temporal information of 18K distinct events. We introduce a novel active learning framework that selects samples for annotation using a surrogate text classification task as a proxy for a more complex event extraction task. The active learning framework successfully increases the frequency of health risk factors and improves automatic extraction of these events over undirected annotation. An event extraction model trained on SHAC achieves high extraction performance for substance use status (0.82-0.93 F1), employment status (0.81-0.86 F1), and living status type (0.81-0.93 F1) on data from three institutions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
