      "content": "Paper Title: On Classifying Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A continuous constraint satisfaction problem (CCSP) is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with the real numbers as domain. We engage in a systematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete for the Existential Theory of the Reals, i.e., ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete. To define this class, we first consider the problem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the Reals. In an instance of this problem we are given a sentence of the form ∃x1,…,xn∈ℝ:Φ​(x1,…,xn):subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛ℝΦsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\exists x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}:\\Phi(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}), where ΦΦ\\Phi is a well-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols {0,1,x1,…,xn,+,⋅,≥,>,∧,∨,¬}01subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛⋅\\{0,1,x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n},+,\\cdot,\\geq,>,\\wedge,\\vee,\\neg\\}. The goal is to check whether this sentence is true. Now the class ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} is the family of all problems that admit a polynomial-time many-one reduction to ETR. It is known that NP⊆∃ℝ⊆PSPACENPℝPSPACE\\textrm{NP}\\subseteq\\exists\\mathbb{R}\\subseteq\\textrm{PSPACE}. We restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints (x+y=z𝑥𝑦𝑧x+y=z) and which satisfy another mild technical condition. Previously, it was shown that multiplication constraints (x⋅y=z⋅𝑥𝑦𝑧x\\cdot y=z), squaring constraints (x2=ysuperscript𝑥2𝑦x^{2}=y), or inversion constraints (x⋅y=1⋅𝑥𝑦1x\\cdot y=1) are sufficient to establish ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-completeness. We extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality constraints as follows. We show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and that satisfy another mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality constraint (f​(x,y)=0𝑓𝑥𝑦0f(x,y)=0) are ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete. We further extend our results to inequality constraints. We show that together any well-behaved convexly curved and any well-behaved concavely curved inequality constraint (f​(x,y)≥0𝑓𝑥𝑦0f(x,y)\\geq 0 and g​(x,y)≥0𝑔𝑥𝑦0g(x,y)\\geq 0) imply ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-completeness on the class of such CCSPs. Here, we call a function f:U→ℝ:𝑓→𝑈ℝf\\colon U\\to\\mathbb{R} well-behaved if it is a C3superscript𝐶3C^{3}-function, f​(0,0)=0𝑓000f(0,0)=0, all its first and second partial derivatives fxsubscript𝑓𝑥f_{x}, fysubscript𝑓𝑦f_{y}, fx​xsubscript𝑓𝑥𝑥f_{xx}, fx​ysubscript𝑓𝑥𝑦f_{xy}, fy​ysubscript𝑓𝑦𝑦f_{yy} are rational in (0,0)00(0,0), fx​(0,0)≠0subscript𝑓𝑥000f_{x}(0,0)\\neq 0 or fy​(0,0)≠0subscript𝑓𝑦000f_{y}(0,0)\\neq 0, and another mild technical constraint. Furthermore, we call f𝑓f curved if the curvature of the curve given by f​(x,y)=0𝑓𝑥𝑦0f(x,y)=0 is nonzero at the origin. In this case we call f𝑓f either convexly curved if the curvature is negative, or concavely curved if it is positive.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 64 most likely reference titles for this paper.
