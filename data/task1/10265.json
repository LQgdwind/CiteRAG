Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MICA: Towards Explainable Skin Lesion Diagnosis via Multi-Level Image-Concept Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Black-box deep learning approaches have showcased significant potential in the realm of medical image analysis. However, the stringent trustworthiness requirements intrinsic to the medical field have catalyzed research into the utilization of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), with a particular focus on concept-based methods. Existing concept-based methods predominantly apply concept annotations from a single perspective (e.g., global level), neglecting the nuanced semantic relationships between sub-regions and concepts embedded within medical images. This leads to underutilization of the valuable medical information and may cause models to fall short in harmoniously balancing interpretability and performance when employing inherently interpretable architectures such as Concept Bottlenecks. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose a multi-modal explainable disease diagnosis framework that meticulously aligns medical images and clinical-related concepts semantically at multiple strata, encompassing the image level, token level, and concept level. Moreover, our method allows for model intervention and offers both textual and visual explanations in terms of human-interpretable concepts. Experimental results on three skin image datasets demonstrate that our method, while preserving model interpretability, attains high performance and label efficiency for concept detection and disease diagnosis. The code is available at https://github.com/Tommy-Bie/MICA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
