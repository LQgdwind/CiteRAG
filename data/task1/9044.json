      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating robustness of support vector machines with the Lagrangian dual approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Adversarial examples bring a considerable security threat to support vector machines (SVMs), especially those used in safety-critical applications. Thus, robustness verification is an essential issue for SVMs, which can provide provable robustness against various kinds of adversary attacks. The evaluation results obtained through the robustness verification can provide a safe guarantee for the use of SVMs. The existing verification method does not often perform well in verifying SVMs with nonlinear kernels. To this end, we propose a method to improve the verification performance for SVMs with nonlinear kernels. We first formalize the adversarial robustness evaluation of SVMs as an optimization problem. Then a lower bound of the original problem is obtained by solving the Lagrangian dual problem of the original problem. Finally, the adversarial robustness of SVMs is evaluated concerning the lower bound. We evaluate the adversarial robustness of SVMs with linear and nonlinear kernels on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The experimental results show that the percentage of provable robustness obtained by our method on the test set is better than that of the state-of-the-art.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
