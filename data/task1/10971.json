Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: CoTBal: Comprehensive Task Balancing for Multi-Task Visual Instruction Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Visual instruction tuning is a key training stage of large multimodal models (LMMs). Nevertheless, the common practice of indiscriminately mixing instruction-following data from various tasks may result in suboptimal overall performance due to different instruction formats and knowledge domains across tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Comprehensive Task Balancing (CoTBal) algorithm for multi-task visual instruction tuning of LMMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explores multi-task optimization in visual instruction tuning. Specifically, we consider two key dimensions for task balancing: (1) Inter-Task Contribution, the phenomenon where learning one task potentially enhances the performance in other tasks, attributable to the overlapping knowledge domains, and (2) Intra-Task Difficulty, which refers to the learning difficulty within a single task. By quantifying these two dimensions with performance-based metrics, task balancing is thus enabled by assigning more weights to tasks that offer substantial contributions to others, receive minimal contributions from others, and also have great intra-task difficulties. Experiments show that our CoTBal leads to superior overall performance in multi-task visual instruction tuning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 44\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
