      "content": "Paper Title: A Neural Separation Algorithm for the Rounded Capacity Inequalities\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The cutting plane method is a key technique for successful branch-and-cut and branch-price-and-cut algorithms that find the exact optimal solutions for various vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Among various cuts, the rounded capacity inequalities (RCIs) are the most fundamental. To generate RCIs, we need to solve the separation problem, whose exact solution takes a long time to obtain; therefore, heuristic methods are widely used. We design a learning-based separation heuristic algorithm with graph coarsening that learns the solutions of the exact separation problem with a graph neural network (GNN), which is trained with small instances of 50 to 100 customers. We embed our separation algorithm within the cutting plane method to find a lower bound for the capacitated VRP (CVRP) with up to 1,000 customers. We compare the performance of our approach with CVRPSEP, a popular separation software package for various cuts used in solving VRPs. Our computational results show that our approach finds better lower bounds than CVRPSEP for large-scale problems with 400 or more customers, while CVRPSEP shows strong competency for problems with less than 400 customers. Summary of Contribution: We suggest a novel learning-based separation algorithm for RCIs arising in solving CVRPs. While some attempts have been made to learn to select cuts, our study is the first attempt to learn to generate cuts. In particular, we suggest a scalable model that leverages a message passing GNN with graph coarsening. The GNN with a sparse graph allows the trained model to solve problems of various sizes, while the graph coarsening reduces the size of graphs and enables learning representation from equivalent but non-isomorphic graphs. We prove that our model has a polynomial worst-case time complexity at the inference phase. Furthermore, we experimentally verify that our model has the transferability to solve problems sampled from out-of-distribution.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
