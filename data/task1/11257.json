Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Time-Series Forecasting and Sequence Learning Using Memristor-based Reservoir System\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Pushing the frontiers of time-series information processing in ever-growing edge devices with stringent resources has been impeded by the system‚Äôs ability to process information and learn locally on the device. Local processing and learning typically demand intensive computations and massive storage as the process involves retrieving information and tuning hundreds of parameters back in time. In this work, we developed a memristor-based echo state network accelerator that features efficient temporal data processing and in-situ online learning. The proposed design is benchmarked using various datasets involving real-world tasks, such as forecasting the load energy consumption and weather conditions. The experimental results illustrate that the hardware model experiences a marginal degradation (‚àºsimilar-to\\sim4.8%) in performance as compared to the software model. This is mainly attributed to the limited precision and dynamic range of network parameters when emulated using memristor devices. The proposed system is evaluated for lifespan, robustness, and energy-delay product. It is observed that the system demonstrates a reasonable robustness for device failure below 10%, which may occur due to stuck-at faults. Furthermore, 246√ó\\times reduction in energy consumption is achieved when compared to a custom CMOS digital design implemented at the same technology node.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
