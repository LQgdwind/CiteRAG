Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fair Algorithm Design: Fair and Efficacious Machine Scheduling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivated by a plethora of practical examples where bias is induced by automated decision-making algorithms, there has been strong recent interest in the design of fair algorithms. However, there is often a dichotomy between fairness and efficacy: fair algorithms may proffer low social welfare solutions whereas welfare optimizing algorithms may be very unfair. This issue is exemplified in the machine scheduling problem where, for nùëõn jobs, the social welfare of any fair solution may be a factor Œ©‚Äã(n)Œ©ùëõ\\Omega(n) worse than the optimal welfare. In this paper, we prove that this dichotomy between fairness and efficacy can be overcome if we allow for a negligible amount of bias: there exist algorithms that are both ‚Äúalmost perfectly fair‚Äù and have a constant factor efficacy ratio, that is, are guaranteed to output solutions that have social welfare within a constant factor of optimal welfare. Specifically, for any œµ>0italic-œµ0\\epsilon>0, there exist mechanisms with efficacy ratio Œò‚Äã(1œµ)Œò1italic-œµ\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) and where no agent is more than an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon fraction worse off than they are in the fairest possible solution (given by an algorithm that does not use personal or type data). Moreover, these bicriteria guarantees are tight and apply to both the single machine case and the multiple machine case. The key to our results is the use of Pareto scheduling mechanisms. These mechanisms, by the judicious use of personal or type data, are able to exploit Pareto improvements that benefit every individual; such Pareto improvements would typically be forbidden by fair scheduling algorithms designed to satisfy standard statistical measures of group fairness. We anticipate this paradigm, the judicious use of personal data by a fair algorithm to greatly improve performance at the cost of negligible bias, has wider application.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
