Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Dispersive Art Gallery Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce a new variant of the art gallery problem that comes from safety issues. In this variant we are not interested in guard sets of smallest cardinality, but in guard sets with largest possible distances between these guards. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been considered before. We call it the Dispersive Art Gallery Problem. In particular, in the dispersive art gallery problem we are given a polygon ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P} and a real number ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell, and want to decide whether ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P} has a guard set such that every pair of guards in this set is at least a distance of ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell apart. In this paper, we study the vertex guard variant of this problem for the class of polyominoes. We consider rectangular visibility and distances as geodesics in the L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}-metric. Our results are as follows. We give a (simple) thin polyomino such that every guard set has minimum pairwise distances of at most 333. On the positive side, we describe an algorithm that computes guard sets for simple polyominoes that match this upper bound, i.e., the algorithm constructs worst-case optimal solutions. We also study the computational complexity of computing guard sets that maximize the smallest distance between all pairs of guards within the guard sets. We prove that deciding whether there exists a guard set realizing a minimum pairwise distance for all pairs of guards of at least 555 in a given polyomino is \\NP-complete. We were also able to find an optimal dynamic programming approach that computes a guard set that maximizes the minimum pairwise distance between guards in tree-shaped polyominoes, i.e., computes optimal solutions. Because the shapes constructed in the \\NP-hardness reduction are thin as well (but have holes), this result completes the case for thin polyominoes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
