Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Low-depth arithmetic circuit lower bounds via shifted partials\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We prove superpolynomial lower bounds for low-depth arithmetic circuits using the shifted partials measure [GKKS14, Kay12] and the affine projections of partials measure [GKS20, KNS20]. The recent breakthrough work of Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas [LST21] proved these lower bounds by proving lower bounds for low-depth set-multilinear circuits. An interesting aspect of our proof is that it does not require conversion of a circuit to a set-multilinear circuit, nor does it involve random restrictions. We are able to upper bound the measures for homogeneous formulas directly, without going via set-multilinearity. Our lower bounds hold for the iterated matrix multiplication as well as the Nisan-Wigderson design polynomials. We also define a subclass of homogeneous formulas which we call unique parse tree (UPT) formulas, and prove superpolynomial lower bounds for these. This generalizes the superpolynomial lower bounds for regular formulas [KSS14, FLMS15].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
