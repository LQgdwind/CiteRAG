Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Bitlet Model A Parameterized Analytical Model to Compare PIM and CPU Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Nowadays, data-intensive applications are gaining popularity and, together with this trend, processing-in-memory (PIM)-based systems are being given more attention and have become more relevant. This paper describes an analytical modeling tool called Bitlet that can be used, in a parameterized fashion, to estimate the performance and the power/energy of a PIM-based system and thereby assess the affinity of workloads for PIM as opposed to traditional computing. The tool uncovers interesting tradeoffs between, mainly, the PIM computation complexity (cycles required to perform a computation through PIM), the amount of memory used for PIM, the system memory bandwidth, and the data transfer size. Despite its simplicity, the model reveals new insights when applied to real-life examples. The model is demonstrated for several synthetic examples and then applied to explore the influence of different parameters on two systems - IMAGING and FloatPIM. Based on the demonstrations, insights about PIM and its combination with CPU are concluded.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
