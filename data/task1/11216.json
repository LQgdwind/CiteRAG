Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Parallel Discrete Adjoints in SU2\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The open-source multiphysics suite SU2 features discrete adjoints by means of operator overloading automatic differentiation (AD). While both primal and discrete adjoint solvers support MPI parallelism, hybrid parallelism using both MPI and OpenMP has only been introduced for the primal solvers so far. In this work, we enable hybrid parallel discrete adjoint solvers. Coupling SU2 with OpDiLib, an add-on for operator overloading AD tools that extends AD to OpenMP parallelism, marks a key step in this endeavour. We identify the affected parts of SU2’s advanced AD workflow and discuss the required changes and their tradeoffs. Detailed performance studies compare MPI parallel and hybrid parallel discrete adjoints in terms of memory and runtime and unveil key performance characteristics. We showcase the effectiveness of performance optimizations and highlight perspectives for future improvements. At the same time, this study demonstrates the applicability of OpDiLib in a large code base and its scalability on large test cases, providing valuable insights for future applications both within and beyond SU2.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
