Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Episodic-free Task Selection for Few-shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Episodic training is a mainstream training strategy for few-shot learning. In few-shot scenarios, however, this strategy is often inferior to some non-episodic training strategy, e. g., Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA), which challenges the principle that training conditions must match testing conditions. Thus, a question is naturally asked: How to search for episodic-free tasks for better few-shot learning? In this work, we propose a novel meta-training framework beyond episodic training. In this framework, episodic tasks are not used directly for training, but for evaluating the effectiveness of some selected episodic-free tasks from a task set that are performed for training the meta learners. The selection criterion is designed with the affinity, which measures the degree to which loss decreases when executing the target tasks after training with the selected tasks. In experiments, the training task set contains some promising types, e. g., contrastive learning and classification, and the target few-shot tasks are achieved with the nearest centroid classifiers on the miniImageNet, tiered-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
