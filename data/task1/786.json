Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Positive emotions help rank negative reviews in e-commerce\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Negative reviews, the poor ratings in postpurchase evaluation, play an indispensable role in e-commerce, especially in shaping future sales and firm equities. However, extant studies seldom examine their potential value for sellers and producers in enhancing capabilities of providing better services and products. For those who exploited the helpfulness of reviews in the view of e-commerce keepers, the ranking approaches were developed for customers instead. To fill this gap, in terms of combining description texts and emotion polarities, the aim of the ranking method in this study is to provide the most helpful negative reviews under a certain product attribute for online sellers and producers. By applying a more reasonable evaluating procedure, experts with related backgrounds are hired to vote for the ranking approaches. Our ranking method turns out to be more reliable for ranking negative reviews for sellers and producers, demonstrating a better performance than the baselines like BM25 with a result of 8% higher. In this paper, we also enrich the previous understandings of emotions in valuing reviews. Specifically, it is surprisingly found that positive emotions are more helpful rather than negative emotions in ranking negative reviews. The unexpected strengthening from positive emotions in ranking suggests that less polarized reviews on negative experience in fact offer more rational feedbacks and thus more helpfulness to the sellers and producers. The presented ranking method could provide e-commerce practitioners with an efficient and effective way to leverage negative reviews from online consumers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
