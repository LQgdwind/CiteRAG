Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Algorithmic Method of Partial Derivatives\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We study the following problem and its applications: given a homogeneous degree-d𝑑d polynomial g𝑔g as an arithmetic circuit, and a d×d𝑑𝑑d\\times d matrix X𝑋X whose entries are homogeneous linear polynomials, compute g​(∂/∂x1,…,∂/∂xn)​detX𝑔subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛𝑋g(\\partial/\\partial x_{1},\\ldots,\\partial/\\partial x_{n})\\det X. By considering special cases of this problem we obtain faster parameterized algorithms for several problems, including the matroid k𝑘k-parity and k𝑘k-matroid intersection problems, faster deterministic algorithms for testing if a linear space of matrices contains an invertible matrix (Edmonds’s problem) and detecting k𝑘k-internal outbranchings, and more. We also match the runtime of the fastest known deterministic algorithm for detecting subgraphs of bounded pathwidth, while using a new approach. Our approach raises questions in algebraic complexity related to Waring rank and the exponent of matrix multiplication ω𝜔\\omega. In particular, we study a new complexity measure on the space of homogeneous polynomials, namely the bilinear complexity of a polynomial’s apolar algebra. Our algorithmic improvements are reflective of the fact that for the degree-n𝑛n determinant polynomial this quantity is at most O​(n​2ω​n)𝑂𝑛superscript2𝜔𝑛O(n2^{\\omega n}), whereas all known upper bounds on the Waring rank of this polynomial exceed n!𝑛n!.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
