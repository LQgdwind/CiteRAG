      "content": "Paper Title: A Knowledge Enhanced Learning and Semantic Composition Model for Multi-Claim Fact Checking\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract To inhibit the spread of rumorous information and its severe consequences, traditional fact checking aims at retrieving relevant evidence to verify the veracity of a given claim. Fact checking methods typically use knowledge graphs (KGs) as external repositories and develop reasoning mechanism to retrieve evidence for verifying the triple claim. However, existing methods only focus on verifying a single claim. As real-world rumorous information is more complex and a textual statement is often composed of multiple clauses (i.e. represented as multiple claims instead of a single one), multi-claim fact checking is not only necessary but more important for practical applications. Although previous methods for verifying a single triple can be applied repeatedly to verify multiple triples one by one, they ignore the contextual information implied in a multi-claim statement and could not learn the rich semantic information in the statement as a whole. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end knowledge enhanced learning and verification method for multi-claim fact checking. Our method consists of two modules, KG-based learning enhancement and multi-claim semantic composition. To fully utilize the contextual information implied in multiple claims, the KG-based learning enhancement module learns the dynamic context-specific representations via selectively aggregating relevant attributes of entities. To capture the compositional semantics of multiple triples, the multi-claim semantic composition module constructs the graph structure to model claim-level interactions, and integrates global and salient local semantics with multi-head attention. We conduct experimental studies to validate our proposed method, and experimental results on a real-world dataset and two benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method for multi-claim fact checking over KG.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
