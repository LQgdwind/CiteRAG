Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Online Node Labeling for Very Large Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper studies the online node classification problem under a transductive learning setting. Current methods either invert a graph kernel matrix with 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) runtime and 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) space complexity or sample a large volume of random spanning trees, thus are difficult to scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose an improvement based on the online relaxation technique introduced by a series of works (Rakhlin et al., 2012; Rakhlin & Sridharan, 2015, 2017). We first prove an effective regret 𝒪​(n1+γ)𝒪superscript𝑛1𝛾\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n^{1+\\gamma}}) when suitable parameterized graph kernels are chosen, then propose an approximate algorithm FastONL enjoying 𝒪​(k​n1+γ)𝒪𝑘superscript𝑛1𝛾\\mathcal{O}(k\\sqrt{n^{1+\\gamma}}) regret based on this relaxation. The key of FastONL is a generalized local push method that effectively approximates inverse matrix columns and applies to a series of popular kernels. Furthermore, the per-prediction cost is 𝒪​(vol⁡(𝒮)​log⁡1/ϵ)𝒪vol𝒮1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(\\operatorname{vol}\\left(\\mathcal{S}\\right)\\log 1/\\epsilon) locally dependent on the graph with linear memory cost. Experiments show that our scalable method enjoys a better tradeoff between local and global consistency.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper.
