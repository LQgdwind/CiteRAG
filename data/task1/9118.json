Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Ada-NAV: Adaptive Trajectory-Based Sample Efficient Policy Learning for Robotic Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning has gained significant traction in the field of robotic navigation. However, a persistent challenge is its sample inefficiency, primarily due to the inherent complexities of encouraging exploration. During training, the mobile agent must explore as much as possible to efficiently learn optimal behaviors. We introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, Ada-NAV dynamically adjusts it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. We empirically validate the efficacy of Ada-NAV using two popular policy gradient methods: REINFORCE and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We demonstrate through both simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex, outdoor environments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
