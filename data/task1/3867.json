Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Radon Transform and Its Application\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper extends the Radon transform, a classical image processing tool for fast tomography and denoising, to the quantum computing platform. A new kind of periodic discrete Radon transform (PDRT), called quantum Radon transform (QRT), is proposed. The QRT has a quantum implementation that is exponentially faster than the classical Radon transform. Based on the QRT, we design an efficient quantum image denoising algorithm. The simulation results show that QRT preserves the good denoising capability as in the classical PDRT. Also, a quantum algorithm for interpolation-based discrete Radon transform (IDRT) is proposed, which can be used for fast line detection. Both the quantum extension of IDRT and the line detection algorithm can provide polynomial speedups over the classical counterparts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
