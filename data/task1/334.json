      "content": "Paper Title: 𝜆_∞ & Maximum Variance Embedding: Measuring and Optimizing Connectivity of A Graph Metric\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bobkov, Houdré, and the last author [BHT00] introduced a Poincaré-type functional parameter, λ∞subscript𝜆\\lambda_{\\infty}, of a graph G=(V=[n],E)𝐺𝑉delimited-[]𝑛𝐸G=(V=[n],E). They related λ∞subscript𝜆\\lambda_{\\infty} to the vertex expansion of the graph via a Cheeger-type inequality, analogous to the inequality relating the spectral gap of the graph, λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2}, to its edge expansion. While λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2} can be computed efficiently, our understanding of computational complexity of λ∞subscript𝜆\\lambda_{\\infty} is relatively little. A work by the second author, Raghavendra, and Vempala [LRV13] related the complexity of λ∞subscript𝜆\\lambda_{\\infty} to the so-called small-set expansion (SSE) problem, and set forth the desiderata for NP-hardness of this optimization problem. We confirm the conjecture that computing λ∞subscript𝜆\\lambda_{\\infty} is NP-hard, for weighted trees. Beyond measuring the connectivity of a graph by parameters such as λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2} and λ∞subscript𝜆\\lambda_{\\infty}, in many applications the objective is to optimize connectivity. This, via convex duality, leads to a problem in machine learning, i.e., Maximum Variance Embedding (MVE). The output of MVE is a function from vertices of the input graph G=(V=[n],E)𝐺𝑉delimited-[]𝑛𝐸G=(V=[n],E) into a low dimensional Euclidean space. The objective is to maximize the variance of the embedding, i.e., sum of pairwise squared Euclidean distances; and the constraints are specific upper, lower, or equality bounds on Euclidean distances between the neighboring vertices. Special cases of Maximum Variance Embedding into ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} and ℝ1superscriptℝ1\\mathbb{R}^{1} lead to absolute algebraic connectivity [Fie90] and spread constant [ABS98] of the graph metric, that respectively embrace well-connectivity of G𝐺G and Gnsuperscript𝐺𝑛G^{n}. Beyond connectivity, Maximum Variance Embedding has applications in diffusion speed and robustness of networks, clustering, and dimension reduction. We show that computing Maximum Variance Embedding in tree-width (of the graph) dimensions is NP-hard; accompanied by an efficient distance preserving dimension reduction algorithm with no loss to the variance, given a tree-decomposition and allowing two additional dimensions. We show that MVE of a tree in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} defines a non-convex yet benign optimization landscape, i.e., any local optima is a global optimum. Moreover, we develop a combinatorial algorithm to find such optima in linear time. Finally, we discuss approximate Maximum Variance Embedding being tractable in significantly lower dimensions. For trees and general graphs, for which Maximum Variance Embedding cannot be solved in less than 222 and Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) dimensions, unless P=NPPNP\\text{P}=\\text{NP}, we provide 1+ε1𝜀1+\\varepsilon approximation algorithms for embedding into 111 and O​(log⁡n/ε2)𝑂𝑛superscript𝜀2O(\\log n/\\varepsilon^{2}) dimensions, respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
