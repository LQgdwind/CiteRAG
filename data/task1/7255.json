      "content": "Paper Title: Partitioning a Polygon Into Small Pieces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the problem of partitioning a given simple polygon P𝑃P into a minimum number of polygonal pieces, each of which has bounded size. We give algorithms for seven notions of ‘bounded size,’ namely that each piece has bounded area, perimeter, straight-line diameter, geodesic diameter, or that each piece must be contained in a unit disk, an axis-aligned unit square or an arbitrarily rotated unit square. A more general version of the area problem has already been studied. Here we are, in addition to P𝑃P, given positive real values a1,…,aksubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k} such that the sum ∑i=1kaisuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑎𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_{i} equals the area of P𝑃P. The goal is to partition P𝑃P into exactly k𝑘k pieces Q1,…,Qksubscript𝑄1…subscript𝑄𝑘Q_{1},\\ldots,Q_{k} such that the area of Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i} is aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i}. Such a partition always exists, and an algorithm with running time O​(n​k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(nk) has previously been described, where n𝑛n is the number of corners of P𝑃P. We give an algorithm with optimal running time O​(n+k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(n+k). For polygons with holes, we get running time O​(n​log⁡n+k)𝑂𝑛𝑛𝑘O(n\\log n+k). For the other problems, it seems out of reach to compute optimal partitions for simple polygons; for most of them, even in extremely restricted cases such as when P𝑃P is a square. We therefore develop O​(1)𝑂1O(1)-approximation algorithms for these problems, which means that the number of pieces in the produced partition is at most a constant factor larger than the cardinality of a minimum partition. Existing algorithms do not allow Steiner points, which means that all corners of the produced pieces must also be corners of P𝑃P. This has the disappointing consequence that a partition does often not exist, whereas our algorithms always produce useful partitions. Furthermore, an optimal partition without Steiner points may require Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) pieces for polygons where a partition consisting of just 222 pieces exists when Steiner points are allowed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
