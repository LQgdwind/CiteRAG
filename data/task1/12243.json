Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the optimal growth of autocatalytic subnetworks A Mathematical Optimization Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are essential for modeling and analyzing complex systems across fields, from biochemistry to economics. Autocatalytic reaction networks—networks where certain species catalyze their own production—are particularly significant for understanding self-replication dynamics in biological systems and serve as foundational elements in formalizing the concept of a circular economy. In a previous study, we developed a mixed-integer linear optimization-based procedure to enumerate all minimal autocatalytic subnetworks within a network. In this work, we define the maximum growth factor (MGF) of an autocatalytic subnetwork, develop mathematical optimization approaches to compute this metric, and explore its implications in the field of economics and dynamical systems. We develop exact approaches to determine the MGF of any subnetwork based on an iterative procedure with guaranteed convergence, which allows for identifying autocatalytic subnetworks with the highest MGF. We report the results of computational experiments on synthetic CRNs and two well-known datasets, namely the Formose and E. coli reaction networks, identifying their autocatalytic subnetworks and exploring their scientific ramifications. Using advanced optimization techniques and interdisciplinary applications, our framework adds an essential resource to analyze complex systems modeled as reaction networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
