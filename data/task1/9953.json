Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: FedGKD: Unleashing the Power of Collaboration in Federated Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Federated training of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has become popular in recent years due to its ability to perform graph-related tasks under data isolation scenarios while preserving data privacy. However, graph heterogeneity issues in federated GNN systems continue to pose challenges. Existing frameworks address the problem by representing local tasks using different statistics and relating them through a simple aggregation mechanism. However, these approaches suffer from limited efficiency from two aspects: low quality of task-relatedness quantification and inefficacy of exploiting the collaboration structure. To address these issues, we propose FedGKD, a novel federated GNN framework that utilizes a novel client-side graph dataset distillation method to extract task features that better describe task-relatedness, and introduces a novel server-side aggregation mechanism that is aware of the global collaboration structure. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets of different scales, demonstrating our framework’s outperformance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
