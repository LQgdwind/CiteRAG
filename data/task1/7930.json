Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding Policy and Technical Aspects of AI-Enabled Smart Video Surveillance to Address Public Safety\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have seen the emergence of smart video surveillance (SVS) in many practical applications, particularly for building safer and more secure communities in our urban environments. Cognitive tasks, such as identifying objects, recognizing actions, and detecting anomalous behaviors, can produce data capable of providing valuable insights to the community through statistical and analytical tools. However, artificially intelligent surveillance systems design requires special considerations for ethical challenges and concerns. The use and storage of personally identifiable information (PII) commonly pose an increased risk to personal privacy. To address these issues, this paper identifies the privacy concerns and requirements needed to address when designing AI-enabled smart video surveillance. Further, we propose the first end-to-end AI-enabled privacy-preserving smart video surveillance system that holistically combines computer vision analytics, statistical data analytics, cloud-native services, and end-user applications. Finally, we propose quantitative and qualitative metrics to evaluate intelligent video surveillance systems. The system shows the 17.8 frame-per-second (FPS) processing in extreme video scenes. However, considering privacy in designing such a system results in preferring the pose-based algorithm to the pixel-based one. This choice resulted in dropping accuracy in both action and anomaly detection tasks. The results drop from 97.48 to 73.72 in anomaly detection and 96 to 83.07 in the action detection task. On average, the latency of the end-to-end system is 36.1 seconds.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
