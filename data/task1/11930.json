      "content": "Paper Title: UniqueQMA vs QMA: oracle separation and eigenstate thermalization hypothesis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the long-standing open question of the power of unique witness in quantum protocols, which asks if 𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{UniqueQMA}, a variant of 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QMA}} whose accepting witness space is 1-dimensional, is equal to 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QMA}}. We show a quantum oracle separation between 𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{UniqueQMA} and 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QMA}} via an extension of the Aaronson-Kuperberg’s 𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QCMA}} vs 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QMA}} oracle separation. In particular, we show that any 𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{UniqueQMA} protocol must make Ω​(D)Ω𝐷\\Omega(\\sqrt{D}) queries to a subspace phase oracle of unknown dimension ≤Dabsent𝐷\\leq D to ‘find’ the subspace. This presents an obstacle to relativizing techniques in resolving this question (unlike its classical analogue - the Valiant-Vazirani theorem - which is essentially a black-box reduction) and suggests the need to study the structure of the ground space of local Hamiltonians in distilling a potential unique witness. Our techniques also yield a quantum oracle separation between 𝖰𝖷𝖢𝖰𝖷𝖢\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QXC}}, the class characterizing quantum approximate counting, and 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QMA}}. Very few structural properties are known that place the complexity of local Hamiltonians (satisfying such a property) in 𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{UniqueQMA}. We expand this set of properties by showing that the ground energy of local Hamiltonians that satisfy (a variant of) the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) can be estimated through a 𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{UniqueQMA} protocol. Specifically, our protocol can be viewed as a quantum expander test in a low energy subspace of the Hamiltonian and verifies a unique entangled state in two copies of the subspace. This allows us to conclude that if 𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠≠𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{UniqueQMA}\\neq\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QMA}}, then 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QMA}}-hard Hamiltonians must violate ETH under adversarial perturbations (more accurately, under the quantum PCP conjecture if ETH only applies to extensive energy subspaces). Our results serve as evidence that chaotic local Hamiltonians, such as the SYK model, contain polynomial verifiable quantum states in their low energy regime and may be simpler than general local Hamiltonians if 𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠≠𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖴𝗇𝗂𝗊𝗎𝖾𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{UniqueQMA}\\neq\\operatorname{\\mathsf{QMA}}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
