      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Rematch Mismatched Pairs for Robust Cross-Modal Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Collecting well-matched multimedia datasets is crucial for training cross-modal retrieval models. However, in real-world scenarios, massive multimodal data are harvested from the Internet, which inevitably contains Partially Mismatched Pairs (PMPs). Undoubtedly, such semantical irrelevant data will remarkably harm the cross-modal retrieval performance. Previous efforts tend to mitigate this problem by estimating a soft correspondence to down-weight the contribution of PMPs. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge from a new perspective: the potential semantic similarity among unpaired samples makes it possible to excavate useful knowledge from mismatched pairs. To achieve this, we propose L2RM, a general framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) that learns to rematch mismatched pairs. In detail, L2RM aims to generate refined alignments by seeking a minimal-cost transport plan across different modalities. To formalize the rematching idea in OT, first, we propose a self-supervised cost function that automatically learns from explicit similarity-cost mapping relation. Second, we present to model a partial OT problem while restricting the transport among false positives to further boost refined alignments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate our L2RM significantly improves the robustness against PMPs for existing models. The code is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/L2RM.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
