Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mapping Matters: Application Process Mapping on 3-D Processor Topologies\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Applications‚Äô performance is influenced by the mapping of processes to computing nodes, the frequency and volume of exchanges among processing elements, the network capacity, and the routing protocol. A poor mapping of application processes degrades performance and wastes system resources. Process mapping is frequently ignored as an explicit optimization step since the system typically offers a default mapping, users may lack awareness of their applications‚Äô communication behavior, making the opportunities for improving performance through careful mapping are often unclear. This work studies the impact of application process mapping on several processor topologies. We propose a workflow that renders mapping as an explicit optimization step for parallel applications. We apply the workflow to a set of four applications, twelve mapping algorithms, and three direct network topologies. We assess the mappings‚Äô quality in terms of volume, frequency, and distance of exchanges using metrics such as dilation (measured in hop‚ãÖ‚ãÖ\\cdotByte). With a parallel trace-based simulator, we predict the applications‚Äô execution on the three topologies using the twelve mappings. We evaluate the impact of process mapping on the applications‚Äô simulated performance in terms of execution and communication times and identify the mappings that achieve the highest performance in both cases. To ensure the correctness of the simulations, we compare the pre- and post-simulation results. This work emphasizes the importance of process mapping as an explicit optimization step and, thereby, offers a solution for parallel applications to exploit the full potential of the allocated resources on a given system.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
