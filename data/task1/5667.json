Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: BELLATREX: Building Explanations through a LocaLly AccuraTe Rule EXtractor\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Tree-ensemble algorithms, such as random forest, are effective machine learning methods popular for their flexibility, high performance, and robustness to overfitting. However, since multiple learners are combined, they are not as interpretable as a single decision tree. In this work we propose a novel method that is Building Explanations through a LocalLy AccuraTe Rule EXtractor (Bellatrex), and is able to explain the forest prediction for a given test instance with only a few diverse rules. Starting from the decision trees generated by a random forest, our method 1) pre-selects a subset of the rules used to make the prediction, 2) creates a vector representation of such rules, 3) projects them to a low-dimensional space, 4) clusters such representations to pick a rule from each cluster to explain the instance prediction. We test the effectiveness of Bellatrex on 89 real-world datasets and we demonstrate the validity of our method for binary classification, regression, multi-label classification and time-to-event tasks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that an interpretability toolbox can handle all these tasks within the same framework. We also show that our extracted surrogate model can approximate the performance of the corresponding ensemble model in all considered tasks, while selecting only few trees from the whole forest. We also show that our proposed approach substantially outperforms other explainable methods in terms of predictive performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
