      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Knowledge-Data Driven Channel Semantic Acquisition and Beamforming for Cell-Free Massive MIMO\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper focuses on advancing outdoor wireless systems to better support ubiquitous extended reality (XR) applications, and close the gap with current indoor wireless transmission capabilities. We propose a hybrid knowledge-data driven method for channel semantic acquisition and multi-user beamforming in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we firstly propose a data-driven multiple layer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer-based auto-encoder for channel semantic acquisition, where the pilot signals, CSI quantizer for channel semantic embedding, and CSI reconstruction for channel semantic extraction are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, based on the acquired channel semantic, we further propose a knowledge-driven deep-unfolding multi-user beamformer, which is capable of achieving good spectral efficiency with robustness to imperfect CSI in outdoor XR scenarios. By unfolding conventional successive over-relaxation (SOR)-based linear beamforming scheme with deep learning, the proposed beamforming scheme is capable of adaptively learning the optimal parameters to accelerate convergence and improve the robustness to imperfect CSI. The proposed deep unfolding beamforming scheme can be used for access points (APs) with fully-digital array and APs with hybrid analog-digital array. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in improving the accuracy of channel acquisition, as well as reducing complexity in both CSI acquisition and beamformer design. The proposed beamforming method achieves approximately 96%percent9696\\% of the converged spectrum efficiency performance after only three iterations in downlink transmission, demonstrating its efficacy and potential to improve outdoor XR applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
