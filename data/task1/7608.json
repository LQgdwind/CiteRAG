Matthew Weinberg, and seminar participants at Princeton for illuminating discussions and helpful feedback.\n\nPaper Abstract: We study various novel complexity measures for two-sided matching mechanisms, applied to the two canonical strategyproof matching mechanisms, Deferred Acceptance (𝖣𝖠𝖣𝖠\\mathsf{DA}) and Top Trading Cycles (𝖳𝖳𝖢𝖳𝖳𝖢{{\\mathsf{TTC}}}). Our metrics are designed to capture the complexity of various structural (rather than computational) concerns, in particular ones of recent interest within economics. We consider a canonical, flexible approach to formalizing our questions: define a protocol or data structure performing some task, and bound the number of bits that it requires. Our main results apply this approach to four questions of general interest; for mechanisms matching applicants to institutions, our questions are: (1) How can one applicant affect the outcome matching? (2) How can one applicant affect another applicant’s set of options? (3) How can the outcome matching be represented / communicated? (4) How can the outcome matching be verified? We prove that 𝖣𝖠𝖣𝖠\\mathsf{DA} and 𝖳𝖳𝖢𝖳𝖳𝖢{{\\mathsf{TTC}}} are comparable in complexity under questions (1) and (4), giving new tight lower-bound constructions and new verification protocols. Under both questions (2) and (3), we prove that 𝖳𝖳𝖢𝖳𝖳𝖢{{\\mathsf{TTC}}} is more complex than 𝖣𝖠𝖣𝖠\\mathsf{DA}. For question (2), we prove this by giving a new combinatorial characterization of which institutions are removed from each applicant’s set of options when a new applicant is added in 𝖣𝖠𝖣𝖠\\mathsf{DA}; this characterization may be of independent interest. For question (3), our result gives lower bounds proving the tightness of existing constructions for 𝖳𝖳𝖢𝖳𝖳𝖢{{\\mathsf{TTC}}}. This shows that the relationship between the matching and the priorities is more complex in 𝖳𝖳𝖢𝖳𝖳𝖢{{\\mathsf{TTC}}} than in 𝖣𝖠𝖣𝖠\\mathsf{DA}, formalizing previous intuitions within the economics literature [LL21, AL16]. Together, our results complement recent work that models the complexity of observing strategyproofness and shows that 𝖣𝖠𝖣𝖠\\mathsf{DA} is more complex than 𝖳𝖳𝖢𝖳𝖳𝖢{{\\mathsf{TTC}}} [GHT22]. This emphasizes that diverse considerations must factor into gauging the complexity of matching mechanisms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 65 most likely reference titles for this paper.
