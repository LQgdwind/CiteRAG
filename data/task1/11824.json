Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Comprehensive Online Training and Deployment for Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered to have enormous potential in the future development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to their brain-inspired and energy-efficient properties. In the current supervised learning domain of SNNs, compared to vanilla Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) training, online training can effectively overcome the risk of GPU memory explosion and has received widespread academic attention. However, the current proposed online training methods cannot tackle the inseparability problem of temporal dependent gradients and merely aim to optimize the training memory, resulting in no performance advantages compared to the STBP training models in the inference phase. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Efficient Multi-Precision Firing (EM-PF) model, which is a family of advanced spiking models based on floating-point spikes and binary synaptic weights. We point out that EM-PF model can effectively separate temporal gradients and achieve full-stage optimization towards computation speed and memory footprint. Experimental results have demonstrated that EM-PF model can be flexibly combined with various techniques including random back-propagation, parallel computation and channel attention mechanism, to achieve state-of-the-art performance with extremely low computational overhead in the field of online learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
