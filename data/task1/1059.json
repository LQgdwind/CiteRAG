Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: High Performance Evaluation of Helmholtz Potentials using the Multi-Level Fast Multipole Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Evaluation of pair potentials is critical in a number of areas of physics. The classical NùëÅN-body problem has its root in evaluating the Laplace potential, and has spawned tree-algorithms, the fast multipole method (FMM), as well as kernel independent approaches. Over the years, FMM for Laplace potential has had a profound impact on a number of disciplines as it has been possible to develop highly scalable parallel algorithm for these potential evaluators. This is in stark contrast to parallel algorithms for the Helmholtz (oscillatory) potentials. The principal bottleneck to scalable parallelism are operations necessary to traverse up, across and down the tree, affecting both computation and communication. In this paper, we describe techniques to overcome bottlenecks and achieve high performance evaluation of the Helmholtz potential for a wide spectrum of geometries. We demonstrate that the resulting implementation has a load balancing effect that significantly reduces the time-to-solution and enhances the scale of problems that can be treated using full wave physics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
