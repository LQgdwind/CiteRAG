Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: LCDnet: A Lightweight Crowd Density Estimation Model for Real-time Video Surveillance\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Automatic crowd counting using density estimation has gained significant attention in computer vision research. As a result, a large number of crowd counting and density estimation models using convolution neural networks (CNN) have been published in the last few years. These models have achieved good accuracy over benchmark datasets. However, attempts to improve the accuracy often lead to higher complexity in these models. In real-time video surveillance applications using drones with limited computing resources, deep models incur intolerable higher inference delay. In this paper, we propose (i) a Lightweight Crowd Density estimation model (LCDnet) for real-time video surveillance, and (ii) an improved training method using curriculum learning (CL). LCDnet is trained using CL and evaluated over two benchmark datasets i.e., DroneRGBT and CARPK. Results are compared with existing crowd models. Our evaluation shows that the LCDnet achieves a reasonably good accuracy while significantly reducing the inference time and memory requirement and thus can be deployed over edge devices with very limited computing resources. …\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
