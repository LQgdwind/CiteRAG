Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This article utilizes the inspiration to apply the Wyel operators for producing the Kraus operators, which are crucial in the discrete-time open quantum walk. It assists us in extending the idea of discrete-time open quantum walk on arbitrary directed and undirected graphs. We make the new model of quantum walk useful to build up a quantum PageRank algorithm. In classical computation, Google‚Äôs PageRank is a significant algorithm for arranging web pages on the World Wide Web. In general, it is also a fundamental measure for quantifying the importance of vertices in a network. Similarly, the new quantum PageRank also represents the importance of the vertices of a network. We can compute the new quantum PageRank algorithm in polynomial time using a classical computer. We compare the classical PageRank and the newly defined quantum PageRank for different types of complex networks, such as the scale-free network, Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi random network, Watts-Strogatz network, spatial network, Zachary Karate club network, random_k_out_graph, binary tree graph, GNC network, Barab√°si and Albert network, etc. Keywords: PageRank, Quantum walk, Kraus operator, Complex Network.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
