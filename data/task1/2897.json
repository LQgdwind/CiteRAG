Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Minimization Networks: Training GANs Without Competition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many applications in machine learning can be framed as minimization problems and solved efficiently using gradient-based techniques. However, recent applications of generative models, particularly GANs, have triggered interest for solving min-max games for which standard optimization techniques are often not suitable. Among known problems experienced by practitioners are the lack of convergence guarantees or convergence to a non-optimum cycle. At the heart of these problems is the min-max structure of the GAN objective which creates non-trivial dependencies between the players. We propose to address this problem by optimizing a different objective that circumvents the min-max structure using the notion of duality gap from game theory. We provide novel convergence guarantees on this objective and demonstrate why the obtained limit point solves the problem better than known techniques.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
