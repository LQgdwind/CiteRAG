Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: ALP: Action-Aware Embodied Learning for Perception\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Current methods in training and benchmarking vision models exhibit an over-reliance on passive, curated datasets. Although models trained on these datasets have shown strong performance in a wide variety of tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation, they fundamentally are unable to generalize to an ever-evolving world due to constant out-of-distribution shifts of input data. Therefore, instead of training on fixed datasets, can we approach learning in a more human-centric and adaptive manner? In this paper, we introduce Action-Aware Embodied Learning for Perception (ALP), an embodied learning framework that incorporates action information into representation learning through a combination of optimizing a reinforcement learning policy and an inverse dynamics prediction objective. Our method actively explores in complex 3D environments to both learn generalizable task-agnostic visual representations as well as collect downstream training data. We show that ALP outperforms existing baselines in several downstream perception tasks. In addition, we show that by training on actively collected data more relevant to the environment and task, our method generalizes more robustly to downstream tasks compared to models pre-trained on fixed datasets such as ImageNet.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
