Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Query-based Video Summarization with Pseudo Label Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing datasets for manually labelled query-based video summarization are costly and thus small, limiting the performance of supervised deep video summarization models. Self-supervision can address the data sparsity challenge by using a pretext task and defining a method to acquire extra data with pseudo labels to pre-train a supervised deep model. In this work, we introduce segment-level pseudo labels from input videos to properly model both the relationship between a pretext task and a target task, and the implicit relationship between the pseudo label and the human-defined label. The pseudo labels are generated based on existing human-defined frame-level labels. To create more accurate query-dependent video summaries, a semantics booster is proposed to generate context-aware query representations. Furthermore, we propose mutual attention to help capture the interactive information between visual and textual modalities. Three commonly-used video summarization benchmarks are used to thoroughly validate the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed video summarization algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
