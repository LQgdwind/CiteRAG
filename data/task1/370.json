Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: NeuCrowd: Neural Sampling Network for Representation Learning with Crowdsourced Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Representation learning approaches require a massive amount of discriminative training data, which is unavailable in many scenarios, such as healthcare, smart city, education, etc. In practice, people refer to crowdsourcing to get annotated labels. However, due to issues like data privacy, budget limitation, shortage of domain-specific annotators, the number of crowdsourced labels is still very limited. Moreover, because of annotatorsâ€™ diverse expertise, crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent. Thus, directly applying existing supervised representation learning (SRL) algorithms may easily get the overfitting problem and yield suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose NeuCrowd, a unified framework for SRL from crowdsourced labels. The proposed framework (1) creates a sufficient number of high-quality n-tuplet training samples by utilizing safety-aware sampling and robust anchor generation; and (2) automatically learns a neural sampling network that adaptively learns to select effective samples for SRL networks. The proposed framework is evaluated on both one synthetic and three real-world data sets. The results show that our approach outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and AUC. To encourage reproducible results, we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/tal-ai/NeuCrowd_KAIS2021.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.

This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
