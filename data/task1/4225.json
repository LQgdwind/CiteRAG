Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 42 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Mapping for Near-Term Quantum Architectures based on Rydberg Atoms\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantum algorithms promise quadratic or exponential speedups for applications in cryptography, chemistry and material sciences. The topologies of today’s quantum computers offer limited connectivity, leading to significant overheads for implementing such quantum algorithms. One-dimensional topology displacements that remedy these limits have been recently demonstrated for architectures based on Rydberg atoms, and they are possible in principle in photonic and ion trap architectures. We present the first optimal quantum circuit-to-architecture mapping algorithm that exploits such one-dimensional topology displacements. We benchmark our method on quantum circuits with up to 15 qubits and investigate the improvements compared with conventional mapping based on inserting swap gates into the quantum circuits. Depending on underlying technology parameters, our approach can decrease the quantum circuit depth by up to 58% and increase the fidelity by up to 29%. We also study runtime and fidelity requirements on one-dimensional displacements and swap gates to derive conditions under which one-dimensional topology displacements provide benefits.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 42 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
