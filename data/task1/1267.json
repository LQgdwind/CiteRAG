Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting stance hierarchies for cost-sensitive stance detection of Web documents\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Fact checking is an essential challenge when combating fake news. Identifying documents that agree or disagree with a particular statement (claim) is a core task in this process. In this context, stance detection aims at identifying the position (stance) of a document towards a claim. Most approaches address this task through classification models that do not consider the highly imbalanced class distribution. Therefore, they are particularly ineffective in detecting the minority classes (for instance, ‘disagree’), even though such instances are crucial for tasks such as fact-checking by providing evidence for detecting false claims. In this paper, we exploit the hierarchical nature of stance classes which allows us to propose a modular pipeline of cascading binary classifiers, enabling performance tuning on a per step and class basis. We implement our approach through a combination of neural and traditional classification models that highlight the misclassification costs of minority classes. Evaluation results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our approach and its ability to significantly improve the classification performance of the important ‘disagree’ class.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
