Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dual regularized Laplacian spectral clustering methods on community detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Spectral clustering methods are widely used for detecting clusters in networks for community detection, while a small change on the graph Laplacian matrix could bring a dramatic improvement. In this paper, we propose a dual regularized graph Laplacian matrix and then employ it to three classical spectral clustering approaches under the degree-corrected stochastic block model. If the number of communities is known as KùêæK, we consider more than KùêæK leading eigenvectors and weight them by their corresponding eigenvalues in the spectral clustering procedure to improve the performance. Three improved spectral clustering methods are dual regularized spectral clustering (DRSC) method, dual regularized spectral clustering on Ratios-of-eigenvectors (DRSCORE) method, and dual regularized symmetrized Laplacian inverse matrix (DRSLIM) method. Theoretical analysis of DRSC and DRSLIM show that under mild conditions DRSC and DRSLIM yield stable consistent community detection, moreover, DRSCORE returns perfect clustering under the ideal case. We compare the performances of DRSC, DRSCORE and DRSLIM with several spectral methods by substantial simulated networks and eight real-world networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
