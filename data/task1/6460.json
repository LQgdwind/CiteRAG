      "content": "Paper Title: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Self-attention in Convolutional Neural Network♣\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently many plug-and-play self-attention modules (SAMs) are proposed to enhance the model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In general, previous works ignore where to plug in the SAMs since they connect the SAMs individually with each block of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental computational cost and the number of parameters with the growth of network depth. However, we empirically find and verify some counterintuitive phenomena that: (a) Connecting the SAMs to all the blocks may not always bring the largest performance boost, and connecting to partial blocks would be even better; (b) Adding the SAMs to a CNN may not always bring a performance boost, and instead it may even harm the performance of the original CNN backbone. Therefore, we articulate and demonstrate the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Self-attention Networks: a full self-attention network contains a subnetwork with sparse self-attention connections that can (1) accelerate inference, (2) reduce extra parameter increment, and (3) maintain accuracy. In addition to the empirical evidence, this hypothesis is also supported by our theoretical evidence. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective reinforcement-learning-based method to search the ticket, i.e., the connection scheme that satisfies the three above-mentioned conditions. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets and popular self-attention networks show the effectiveness of our method. Besides, our experiments illustrate that our searched ticket has the capacity of transferring to some vision tasks, e.g., crowd counting and segmentation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
