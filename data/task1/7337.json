      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient algorithms for certifying lower bounds on the discrepancy of random matrices\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We initiate the study of the algorithmic problem of certifying lower bounds on the discrepancy of random matrices: given an input matrix A∈ℝm×n𝐴superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}, output a value that is a lower bound on 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼(A)=minx∈{±1}n∥Ax∥∞\\mathsf{disc}(A)=\\min_{x\\in\\{\\pm 1\\}^{n}}\\left\\lVert Ax\\right\\rVert_{\\infty} for every A𝐴A, but is close to the typical value of 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼​(A)𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼𝐴\\mathsf{disc}(A) with high probability over the choice of a random A𝐴A. This problem is important because of its connections to conjecturally-hard average-case problems such as negatively-spiked PCA [BKW20], the number-balancing problem [GK21] and refuting random constraint satisfaction problems [RRS17]. We give the first polynomial-time algorithms with non-trivial guarantees for two main settings. First, when the entries of A𝐴A are i.i.d. standard Gaussians, it is known that 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼​(A)=Θ​(n​2−n/m)𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼𝐴Θ𝑛superscript2𝑛𝑚\\mathsf{disc}(A)=\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}2^{-n/m}) with high probability [CV14, APZ19, TMR20] and that super-constant levels of the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy fail to certify anything better than 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼​(A)≥0𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼𝐴0\\mathsf{disc}(A)\\geq 0 when m<n−o​(n)𝑚𝑛𝑜𝑛m<n-o(n) [GJJ+20]. In contrast, our algorithm certifies that 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼​(A)≥exp⁡(−O​(n2/m))𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼𝐴𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑚\\mathsf{disc}(A)\\geq\\exp(-O(n^{2}/m)) with high probability. As an application, this formally refutes a conjecture of Bandeira, Kunisky, and Wein [BKW20] on the computational hardness of the detection problem in the negatively-spiked Wishart model. Second, we consider the integer partitioning problem: given n𝑛n uniformly random b𝑏b-bit integers a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}, certify the non-existence of a perfect partition, i.e. certify that 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼​(A)≥1𝖽𝗂𝗌𝖼𝐴1\\mathsf{disc}(A)\\geq 1 for A=(a1,…,an)𝐴subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛A=(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}). Under the scaling b=α​n𝑏𝛼𝑛b=\\alpha n, it is known that the probability of the existence of a perfect partition undergoes a phase transition from 1 to 0 at α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1 [BCP01]; our algorithm certifies the non-existence of perfect partitions for some α=O​(n)𝛼𝑂𝑛\\alpha=O(n). We also give efficient non-deterministic algorithms with significantly improved guarantees, raising the possibility that the landscape of these certification problems closely resembles that of e.g. the problem of refuting random 3SAT formulas in the unsatisfiable regime. Our algorithms involve a reduction to the Shortest Vector Problem and employ the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász algorithm.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
