Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: SHELS: Exclusive Feature Sets for Novelty Detection and Continual Learning Without Class Boundaries\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive classification performance in closed-world learning scenarios, they typically fail to generalize to unseen categories in dynamic open-world environments, in which the number of concepts is unbounded. In contrast, human and animal learners have the ability to incrementally update their knowledge by recognizing and adapting to novel observations. In particular, humans characterize concepts via exclusive (unique) sets of essential features, which are used for both recognizing known classes and identifying novelty. Inspired by natural learners, we introduce a Sparse High-level-Exclusive, Low-level-Shared feature representation (SHELS) that simultaneously encourages learning exclusive sets of high-level features and essential, shared low-level features. The exclusivity of the high-level features enables the DNN to automatically detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data, while the efficient use of capacity via sparse low-level features permits accommodating new knowledge. The resulting approach uses OOD detection to perform class-incremental continual learning without known class boundaries. We show that using SHELS for novelty detection results in statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection approaches over a variety of benchmark datasets. Further, we demonstrate that the SHELS model mitigates catastrophic forgetting in a class-incremental learning setting, enabling a combined novelty detection and accommodation framework that supports learning in open-world settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
