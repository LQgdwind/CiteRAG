Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Entity Alignment For Knowledge Graphs: Progress, Challenges, and Empirical Studies\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Entity Alignment (EA) identifies entities across databases that refer to the same entity. Knowledge graph-based embedding methods have recently dominated EA techniques. Such methods map entities to a low-dimension space and align them based on their similarities. With the corpus of EA methodologies growing rapidly, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various existing EA methods, elaborating their applications and limitations. Further, we distinguish the methods based on their underlying algorithms and the information they incorporate to learn entity representations. Based on challenges in industrial datasets, we bring forward 444 research questions (RQs). These RQs empirically analyse the algorithms from the perspective of Hubness, Degree distribution, Non-isomorphic neighbourhood, and Name bias. For Hubness, where one entity turns up as the nearest neighbour of many other entities, we define an hℎh-score to quantify its effect on the performance of various algorithms. Additionally, we try to level the playing field for algorithms that rely primarily on name-bias existing in the benchmarking open-source datasets by creating a low name bias dataset. We further create an open-source repository for 141414 embedding-based EA methods and present the analysis for invoking further research motivations in the field of EA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
