Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Driver Identification through Stochastic Multi-State Car-Following Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Intra-driver and inter-driver heterogeneity has been confirmed to exist in human driving behaviors by many studies. In this study, a joint model of the two types of heterogeneity in car-following behavior is proposed as an approach of driver profiling and identification. It is assumed that all drivers share a pool of driver states; under each state a car-following data sequence obeys a specific probability distribution in feature space; each driver has his/her own probability distribution over the states, called driver profile, which characterize the intra-driver heterogeneity, while the difference between the driver profile of different drivers depict the inter-driver heterogeneity. Thus, the driver profile can be used to distinguish a driver from others. Based on the assumption, a stochastic car-following model is proposed to take both intra-driver and inter-driver heterogeneity into consideration, and a method is proposed to jointly learn parameters in behavioral feature extractor, driver states and driver profiles. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in driver identification on naturalistic car-following data: accuracy of 82.3% is achieved in an 8-driver experiment using 10 car-following sequences of duration 15 seconds for online inference. The potential of fast registration of new drivers are demonstrated and discussed.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
