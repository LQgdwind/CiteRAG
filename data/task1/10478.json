Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Low-power scalable multilayer optoelectronic neural networks enabled with incoherent light\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Optical approaches have made great strides towards the goal of high-speed, energy-efficient computing necessary for modern deep learning and AI applications. Read-in and read-out of data, however, limit the overall performance of existing approaches. This study introduces a multilayer optoelectronic computing framework that alternates between optical and optoelectronic layers to implement matrix-vector multiplications and rectified linear functions, respectively. Our framework is designed for real-time, parallelized operations, leveraging 2D arrays of LEDs and photodetectors connected via independent analog electronics. We experimentally demonstrate this approach using a system with a three-layer network with two hidden layers and operate it to recognize images from the MNIST database with a recognition accuracy of 92% and classify classes from a nonlinear spiral data with 86% accuracy. By implementing multiple layers of a deep neural network simultaneously, our approach significantly reduces the number of read-ins and read-outs required and paves the way for scalable optical accelerators requiring ultra low energy.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 46\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
