Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A multi-purpose automatic editing system based on lecture semantics for remote education\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Remote teaching has become popular recently due to its convenience and safety, especially under extreme circumstances like a pandemic. However, online students usually have a poor experience since the information acquired from the views provided by the broadcast platforms is limited. One potential solution is to show more camera views simultaneously, but it is technically challenging and distracting for the viewers. Therefore, an automatic multi-camera directing/editing system, which aims at selecting the most concerned view at each time instance to guide the attention of online students, is in urgent demand. However, existing systems mostly make simple assumptions and focus on tracking the position of the speaker instead of the real lecture semantics, and therefore have limited capacities to deliver optimal information flow. To this end, this paper proposes an automatic multi-purpose editing system based on the lecture semantics, which can both direct the multiple video streams for real-time broadcasting and edit the optimal video offline for review purposes. Our system directs the views by semantically analyzing the class events while following the professional directing rules, mimicking a human director to capture the regions of interest from the viewpoint of the onsite students. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative analyses to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system and its components.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 58\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
