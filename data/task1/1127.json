Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Quantum Finite Automata Approach to Modeling the Chemical Reactions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, the modeling interest has increased significantly from the molecular level to the atomic and quantum scale. The field of computational chemistry plays a significant role in designing computational models for the operation and simulation of systems ranging from atoms and molecules to industrial-scale processes. It is influenced by a tremendous increase in computing power and the efficiency of algorithms. The representation of chemical reactions using classical automata theory in thermodynamic terms had a great influence on computer science. The study of chemical information processing with quantum computational models is a natural goal. In this paper, we have modeled chemical reactions using two-way quantum finite automata, which are halted in linear time. Additionally, classical pushdown automata can be designed for such chemical reactions with multiple stacks. It has been proven that computational versatility can be increased by combining chemical accept/reject signatures and quantum automata models. Keywords: chemical reaction, quantum finite automata, pushdown automata, two-way quantum finite automata, Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
