      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of Order-Finding for ROABPs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the order-finding problem for Read-once Oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs (ROABPs). Given a polynomial f𝑓f and a parameter w𝑤w, the goal is to find an order σ𝜎\\sigma in which f𝑓f has an ROABP of width w𝑤w. We show that this problem is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard in the worst case, even when the input is a constant degree polynomial that is given in its dense representation. We provide a reduction from 𝙲𝚞𝚝𝚆𝚒𝚍𝚝𝚑𝙲𝚞𝚝𝚆𝚒𝚍𝚝𝚑\\mathtt{CutWidth} to prove these results. Owing to the exactness of our reduction, all the known results for the hardness of approximation of 𝙲𝚞𝚝𝚆𝚒𝚍𝚝𝚑𝙲𝚞𝚝𝚆𝚒𝚍𝚝𝚑\\mathtt{CutWidth} also transfer directly to the order-finding problem. Additionally, we also show that any constant-approximation algorithm for the order-finding problem would imply a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for it. On the algorithmic front, we design algorithms that solve the order-finding problem for generic ROABPs in polynomial time, when the width w𝑤w is polynomial in the individual degree d𝑑d of the polynomial f𝑓f. That is, our algorithm is efficient for most/random ROABPs, and requires more time only on a lower-dimensional subspace (or subvariety) of ROABPs. Even when the individual degree is constant, our algorithm runs in time nO​(log⁡w)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑤n^{O(\\log w)} for most/random ROABPs. This stands in strong contrast to the case of (Boolean) ROBPs, where only heuristic order-finding algorithms are known.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
