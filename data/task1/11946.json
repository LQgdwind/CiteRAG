      "content": "Paper Title: A Comprehensive Simulation Framework for CXL Disaggregated Memory\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Compute eXpress Link (CXL) has emerged as a key enabler of memory disaggregation for future heterogeneous computing systems to expand memory on-demand and improve resource utilization. However, CXL is still in its infancy stage and lacks commodity products on the market, thus necessitating a reliable system-level simulation tool for research and development. In this paper, we propose CXL-DMSim111Open sourced at https://github.com/ferry-hhh/CXL-DMSim., an open-source full-system simulator to simulate CXL disaggregated memory systems with high fidelity at a gem5-comparable simulation speed. CXL-DMSim incorporates a flexible CXL memory expander model along with its associated device driver, and CXL protocol support with CXL.io and CXL.mem. It can operate in both app-managed mode and kernel-managed mode, with the latter using a dedicated NUMA-compatible mechanism. The simulator has been rigorously verified against a real hardware testbed with both FPGA-based and ASIC-based CXL memory prototypes, which demonstrates the qualification of CXL-DMSim in simulating the characteristics of various CXL memory devices at an average simulation error of 4.1%. The experimental results using LMbench and STREAM benchmarks suggest that the CXL-FPGA memory exhibits a ∼similar-to\\sim2.88×\\times higher latency than local DDR while the CXL-ASIC latency is ∼similar-to\\sim2.18×\\times; CXL-FPGA achieves 45-69% of local DDR memory bandwidth, whereas the number for CXL-ASIC is 82-83%. We observed that the performance of CXL memory is 3×\\times more sensitive to Rd/Wr patterns than local DDR, with the max. bandwidth at 74%:26% rather than 50%:50% due to the current compromised CXL+DDR controller design. The study also reveals that CXL memory can significantly enhance the performance of memory-intensive applications, improved by 23×\\times at most with limited local memory for Viper and approximately 16% in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios such as MERCI. Moreover, the simulator’s observability and expandability are showcased with detailed case-studies, highlighting its great potential for research on future CXL-interconnected hybrid memory pool.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
