Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Hypergraph Network for Trust Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Trust plays an essential role in an individual’s decision-making. Traditional trust prediction models rely on pairwise correlations to infer potential relationships between users. However, in the real world, interactions between users are usually complicated rather than pairwise only. Hypergraphs offer a flexible approach to modeling these complex high-order correlations (not just pairwise connections), since hypergraphs can leverage hyperedeges to link more than two nodes. However, most hypergraph-based methods are generic and cannot be well applied to the trust prediction task. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Hypergraph Network for Trust Prediction (AHNTP), a novel approach that improves trust prediction accuracy by using higher-order correlations. AHNTP utilizes Motif-based PageRank to capture high-order social influence information. In addition, it constructs hypergroups from both node-level and structure-level attributes to incorporate complex correlation information. Furthermore, AHNTP leverages adaptive hypergraph Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layers and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to generate comprehensive user embeddings, facilitating trust relationship prediction. To enhance model generalization and robustness, we introduce a novel supervised contrastive learning loss for optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of trust prediction accuracy.
