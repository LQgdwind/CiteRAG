Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: mpNet: variable depth unfolded neural network for massive MIMO channel estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems have a huge potential both in terms of data rate and energy efficiency, although channel estimation becomes challenging for a large number of antennas. Using a physical model allows to ease the problem by injecting a priori information based on the physics of propagation. However, such a model rests on simplifying assumptions and requires to know precisely the configuration of the system, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper we present mpNet, an unfolded neural network specifically designed for massive MIMO channel estimation. It is trained online in an unsupervised way. Moreover, mpNet is computationally efficient and automatically adapts its depth to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The method we propose adds flexibility to physical channel models by allowing a base station (BS) to automatically correct its channel estimation algorithm based on incoming data, without the need for a separate offline training phase. It is applied to realistic millimeter wave channels and shows great performance, achieving a channel estimation error almost as low as one would get with a perfectly calibrated system. It also allows incident detection and automatic correction, making the BS resilient and able to automatically adapt to changes in its environment.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
