      "content": "Paper Title: Transferring Ultrahigh-Field Representations for Intensity-Guided Brain Segmentation of Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract 11footnotetext: Both authors equally contributed to this research.22footnotetext: Corresponding author: Heung-Il Suk (hisuk@korea.ac.kr) Ultrahigh-field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), i.e., 7T MRI, provides superior anatomical details of internal brain structures owing to its enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and susceptibility-induced contrast. However, the widespread use of 7T MRI is limited by its high cost and lower accessibility compared to low-field (LF) MRI. This study proposes a deep-learning framework that systematically fuses the input LF magnetic resonance feature representations with the inferred 7T-like feature representations for brain image segmentation tasks in a 7T-absent environment. Specifically, our adaptive fusion module aggregates 7T-like features derived from the LF image by a pre-trained network and then refines them to be effectively assimilable UHF guidance into LF image features. Using intensity-guided features obtained from such aggregation and assimilation, segmentation models can recognize subtle structural representations that are usually difficult to recognize when relying only on LF features. Beyond such advantages, this strategy can seamlessly be utilized by modulating the contrast of LF features in alignment with UHF guidance, even when employing arbitrary segmentation models. Exhaustive experiments demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed all baseline models on both brain tissue and whole-brain segmentation tasks; further, it exhibited remarkable adaptability and scalability by successfully integrating diverse segmentation models and tasks. These improvements were not only quantifiable but also visible in the superlative visual quality of segmentation masks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
