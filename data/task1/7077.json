Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

To establish the result, we translate the problem of exhibiting a graph fooling a level of the AIPAIP\\operatorname{AIP} hierarchy into the problem of constructing a highly symmetric crystal tensor. In order to prove the existence of crystals in arbitrary dimension, we provide a combinatorial characterisation for realisable systems of tensors; i.e., sets of low-dimensional tensors that can be realised as the projections of a single high-dimensional tensor.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
