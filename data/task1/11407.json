Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Agent Search-Type Problems on Polygons\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present several advancements in search-type problems for fleets of mobile agents operating in two dimensions under the wireless model. Potential hidden target locations are equidistant from a central point, forming either a disk (infinite possible locations) or regular polygons (finite possible locations). Building on the foundational disk evacuation problem, the disk priority evacuation problem with kùëòk Servants, and the disk wùë§w-weighted search problem, we make improvements on several fronts. First we establish new upper and lower bounds for the nùëõn-gon priority evacuation problem with 111 Servant for n‚â§13ùëõ13n\\leq 13, and for nksubscriptùëõùëòn_{k}-gons with k=2,3,4ùëò234k=2,3,4 Servants, where n2‚â§11subscriptùëõ211n_{2}\\leq 11, n3‚â§9subscriptùëõ39n_{3}\\leq 9, and n4‚â§10subscriptùëõ410n_{4}\\leq 10, offering tight or nearly tight bounds. The only previous results known were a tight upper bound for k=1ùëò1k=1 and n=6ùëõ6n=6 and lower bounds for k=1ùëò1k=1 and n‚â§9ùëõ9n\\leq 9. Second, our work improves the best lower bound known for the disk priority evacuation problem with k=1ùëò1k=1 Servant from 4.467984.467984.46798 to 4.646664.646664.64666 and for k=2ùëò2k=2 Servants from 3.63073.63073.6307 to 3.653323.653323.65332. Third, we improve the best lower bounds known for the disk wùë§w-weighted group search problem, significantly reducing the gap between the best upper and lower bounds for wùë§w values where the gap was largest. These improvements are based on nearly tight upper and lower bounds for the 111111-gon and 121212-gon wùë§w-weighted evacuation problems, while previous analyses were limited only to lower bounds and only to 777-gons.
