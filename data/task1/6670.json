Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Partitioning Hypergraphs is Hard: Models, Inapproximability, and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We study the balanced kùëòk-way hypergraph partitioning problem, with a special focus on its practical applications to manycore scheduling. Given a hypergraph on nùëõn nodes, our goal is to partition the node set into kùëòk parts of size at most (1+œµ)‚ãÖnk‚ãÖ1italic-œµùëõùëò(1+\\epsilon)\\cdot\\frac{n}{k} each, while minimizing the cost of the partitioning, defined as the number of cut hyperedges, possibly also weighted by the number of partitions they intersect. We show that this problem cannot be approximated to within a n1/poly‚Å°log‚Å°log‚Å°nsuperscriptùëõ1polyùëõn^{1/\\operatorname{poly}\\log\\log n} factor of the optimal solution in polynomial time if the Exponential Time Hypothesis holds, even for hypergraphs of maximal degree 222. We also study the hardness of the partitioning problem from a parameterized complexity perspective, and in the more general case when we have multiple balance constraints. Furthermore, we consider two extensions of the partitioning problem that are motivated from practical considerations. Firstly, we introduce the concept of hyperDAGs to model precedence-constrained computations as hypergraphs, and we analyze the adaptation of the balanced partitioning problem to this case. Secondly, we study the hierarchical partitioning problem to model hierarchical NUMA (non-uniform memory access) effects in modern computer architectures, and we show that ignoring this hierarchical aspect of the communication cost can yield significantly weaker solutions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
