Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Spot-adaptive Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a well established paradigm for compressing deep neural networks. The typical way of conducting knowledge distillation is to train the student network under the supervision of the teacher network to harness the knowledge at one or multiple spots (i.e., layers) in the teacher network. The distillation spots, once specified, will not change for all the training samples, throughout the whole distillation process. In this work, we argue that distillation spots should be adaptive to training samples and distillation epochs. We thus propose a new distillation strategy, termed spot-adaptive KD (SAKD), to adaptively determine the distillation spots in the teacher network per sample, at every training iteration during the whole distillation period. As SAKD actually focuses on “where to distill” instead of “what to distill” that is widely investigated by most existing works, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing distillation methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments with 10 state-of-the-art distillers are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of SAKD for improving their distillation performance, under both homogeneous and heterogeneous distillation settings. Code is available at https://github.com/zju-vipa/spot-adaptive-pytorch.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
