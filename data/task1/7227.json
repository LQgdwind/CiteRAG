Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Search to Pass Messages for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Completing missing facts is a fundamental task for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). Recently, graph neural network (GNN) based methods, which can simultaneously explore topological and temporal information, have become the state-of-the-art (SOTA) to complete TKGs. However, these studies are based on hand-designed architectures and fail to explore the diverse topological and temporal properties of TKG. To address this issue, we propose to use neural architecture search (NAS) to design data-specific message passing architecture for TKG completion. In particular, we develop a generalized framework to explore topological and temporal information in TKGs. Based on this framework, we design an expressive search space to fully capture various properties of different TKGs. Meanwhile, we adopt a search algorithm, which trains a supernet structure by sampling single path for efficient search with less cost. We further conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. The results show that the searched architectures by our method achieve the SOTA performances. Besides, the searched models can also implicitly reveal diverse properties in different TKGs. Our code is released in https://github.com/striderdu/SPA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
