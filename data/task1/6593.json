Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 69 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the independence between phenomenal consciousness and computational intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Consciousness and intelligence are properties commonly understood as dependent by folk psychology and society in general. The term artificial intelligence and the kind of problems that it managed to solve in the recent years has been shown as an argument to establish that machines experience some sort of consciousness. Following Russell’s analogy, if a machine is able to do what a conscious human being does, the likelihood that the machine is conscious increases. However, the social implications of this analogy are catastrophic. Concretely, if rights are given to entities that can solve the kind of problems that a neurotypical person can, does the machine have potentially more rights that a person that has a disability? For example, the autistic syndrome disorder spectrum can make a person unable to solve the kind of problems that a machine solves. We believe that the obvious answer is no, as problem solving does not imply consciousness. Consequently, we will argue in this paper how phenomenal consciousness and, at least, computational intelligence are independent and why machines do not possess phenomenal consciousness, although they can potentially develop a higher computational intelligence that human beings. In order to do so, we try to formulate an objective measure of computational intelligence and study how it presents in human beings, animals and machines. Analogously, we study phenomenal consciousness as a dichotomous variable and how it is distributed in humans, animals and machines. As phenomenal consciousness and computational intelligence are independent, this fact has critical implications for society that we also analyze in this work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 69 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
