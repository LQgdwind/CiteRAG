Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: QSAN: A Near-term Achievable Quantum Self-Attention Network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) is good at capturing the internal connections of features and greatly improves the performance of machine learning models, espeacially requiring efficient characterization and feature extraction of high-dimensional data. A novel Quantum Self-Attention Network (QSAN) is proposed for image classification tasks on near-term quantum devices. First, a Quantum Self-Attention Mechanism (QSAM) including Quantum Logic Similarity (QLS) and Quantum Bit Self-Attention Score Matrix (QBSASM) is explored as the theoretical basis of QSAN to enhance the data representation of SAM. QLS is employed to prevent measurements from obtaining inner products to allow QSAN to be fully implemented on quantum computers, and QBSASM as a result of the evolution of QSAN to produce a density matrix that effectively reflects the attention distribution of the output. Then, the framework for one-step realization and quantum circuits of QSAN are designed for fully considering the compression of the measurement times to acquire QBSASM in the intermediate process, in which a quantum coordinate prototype is introduced as well in the quantum circuit for describing the mathematical relation between the output and control bits to facilitate programming. Ultimately, the method comparision and binary classification experiments on MNIST with the pennylane platform demonstrate that QSAN converges about 1.7x and 2.3x faster than hardware-efficient ansatz and QAOA ansatz respevtively with similar parameter configurations and 100% prediction accuracy, which indicates it has a better learning capability. QSAN is quite suitable for fast and in-depth analysis of the primary and secondary relationships of image and other data, which has great potential for applications of quantum computer vision from the perspective of enhancing the information extraction ability of models.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
