We wish to preprocess 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} into a data structure so that for a query object γ𝛾\\gamma, which is also a plate, we can quickly answer various intersection queries, such as detecting whether γ𝛾\\gamma intersects any plate of 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T}, reporting all the plates intersected by γ𝛾\\gamma, or counting them. We also consider two simpler cases of this general setting: (i) the input objects are plates and the query objects are constant-degree parametrized algebraic arcs in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3} (arcs, for short), or (ii) the input objects are arcs and the query objects are plates in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. Besides being interesting in their own right, the data structures for these two special cases form the building blocks for handling the general case. By combining the polynomial-partitioning technique with additional tools from real algebraic geometry, we present many different data structures for intersection queries, which also provide trade-offs between their size and query time. For example, if 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} is a set of plates and the query objects are algebraic arcs, we obtain a data structure that uses O∗​(n4/3)superscript𝑂superscript𝑛43O^{*}(n^{4/3}) storage (where the O∗​(⋅)superscript𝑂⋅O^{*}(\\cdot) notation hides subpolynomial factors) and answers an arc-intersection query in O∗​(n2/3)superscript𝑂superscript𝑛23O^{*}(n^{2/3}) time. This result is significant since the exponents do not depend on the specific shape of the input and query objects. For a parameter s∈[n4/3,ntq]𝑠superscript𝑛43superscript𝑛subscript𝑡𝑞s\\in[n^{4/3},n^{t_{q}}], where tq≥3subscript𝑡𝑞3{t_{q}}\\geq 3 is the number of real parameters needed to specify a query arc, the query time can be decreased to O∗​((n/s1/tq)23​(1−1/tq))superscript𝑂superscript𝑛superscript𝑠1subscript𝑡𝑞2311subscript𝑡𝑞O^{*}((n/s^{1/{t_{q}}})^{\\tfrac{2}{3}(1-1/{t_{q}})}) by increasing the storage to O∗​(s)superscript𝑂𝑠O^{*}(s). Our approach can be extended to many additional intersection-searching problems in three dimensions, even when the input or query objects are not flat.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
