Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-View Clustering for Open Knowledge Base Canonicalization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Open information extraction (OIE) methods extract plenty of OIE triples ¡noun phrase, relation phrase, noun phrase¿ from unstructured text, which compose large open knowledge bases (OKBs). Noun phrases and relation phrases in such OKBs are not canonicalized, which leads to scattered and redundant facts. It is found that two views of knowledge (i.e., a fact view based on the fact triple and a context view based on the fact triple’s source context) provide complementary information that is vital to the task of OKB canonicalization, which clusters synonymous noun phrases and relation phrases into the same group and assigns them unique identifiers. However, these two views of knowledge have so far been leveraged in isolation by existing works. In this paper, we propose CMVC, a novel unsupervised framework that leverages these two views of knowledge jointly for canonicalizing OKBs without the need of manually annotated labels. To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-view CH K-Means clustering algorithm to mutually reinforce the clustering of view-specific embeddings learned from each view by considering their different clustering qualities. In order to further enhance the canonicalization performance, we propose a training data optimization strategy in terms of data quantity and data quality respectively in each particular view to refine the learned view-specific embeddings in an iterative manner. Additionally, we propose a Log-Jump algorithm to predict the optimal number of clusters in a data-driven way without requiring any labels. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple real-world OKB data sets against state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
