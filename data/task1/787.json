Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Consistent and Flexible Selectivity Estimation for High-Dimensional Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Selectivity estimation aims at estimating the number of database objects that satisfy a selection criterion. Answering this problem accurately and efficiently is essential to many applications, such as density estimation, outlier detection, query optimization, and data integration. The estimation problem is especially challenging for large-scale high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality, the large variance of selectivity across different queries, and the need to make the estimator consistent (i.e., the selectivity is non-decreasing in the threshold). We propose a new deep learning-based model that learns a query-dependent piecewise linear function as selectivity estimator, which is flexible to fit the selectivity curve of any distance function and query object, while guaranteeing that the output is non-decreasing in the threshold. To improve the accuracy for large datasets, we propose to partition the dataset into multiple disjoint subsets and build a local model on each of them. We perform experiments on real datasets and show that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy in an efficient way and is useful for real applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
