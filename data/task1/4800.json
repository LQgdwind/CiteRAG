      "content": "Paper Title: The Acrobatics of 𝖡𝖰𝖯\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract One can fix the randomness used by a randomized algorithm, but there is no analogous notion of fixing the quantumness used by a quantum algorithm. Underscoring this fundamental difference, we show that, in the black-box setting, the behavior of quantum polynomial-time (𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯\\mathsf{BQP}) can be remarkably decoupled from that of classical complexity classes like 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}. Specifically: • There exists an oracle relative to which 𝖭𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯⊄𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖯𝖧not-subset-ofsuperscript𝖭𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯superscript𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖯𝖧\\mathsf{NP}^{\\mathsf{BQP}}\\not\\subset\\mathsf{BQP}^{\\mathsf{PH}}, resolving a 2005 problem of Fortnow. As a corollary, there exists an oracle relative to which 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{P}=\\mathsf{NP} but 𝖡𝖰𝖯≠𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{BQP}\\neq\\mathsf{QCMA}. • Conversely, there exists an oracle relative to which 𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖭𝖯⊄𝖯𝖧𝖡𝖰𝖯not-subset-ofsuperscript𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖭𝖯superscript𝖯𝖧𝖡𝖰𝖯\\mathsf{BQP}^{\\mathsf{NP}}\\not\\subset\\mathsf{PH}^{\\mathsf{BQP}}. • Relative to a random oracle, 𝖯𝖯=𝖯𝗈𝗌𝗍𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯𝗈𝗌𝗍𝖡𝖰𝖯\\mathsf{PP}=\\mathsf{PostBQP} is not contained in the “𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{QMA} hierarchy” 𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖬𝖠⋯superscript𝖰𝖬𝖠superscript𝖰𝖬𝖠superscript𝖰𝖬𝖠⋯\\mathsf{QMA}^{\\mathsf{QMA}^{\\mathsf{QMA}^{\\cdots}}}. • Relative to a random oracle, Σk+1𝖯⊄𝖡𝖰𝖯Σk𝖯not-subset-ofsuperscriptsubscriptsans-serif-Σ𝑘1𝖯superscript𝖡𝖰𝖯superscriptsubscriptsans-serif-Σ𝑘𝖯\\mathsf{\\Sigma}_{k+1}^{\\mathsf{P}}\\not\\subset\\mathsf{BQP}^{\\mathsf{\\Sigma}_{k}^{\\mathsf{P}}} for every k𝑘k. • There exists an oracle relative to which 𝖡𝖰𝖯=𝖯#​𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯superscript𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{BQP}=\\mathsf{P^{\\#P}} and yet 𝖯𝖧𝖯𝖧\\mathsf{PH} is infinite. (By contrast, relative to all oracles, if 𝖭𝖯⊆𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{NP}\\subseteq\\mathsf{BPP}, then 𝖯𝖧𝖯𝖧\\mathsf{PH} collapses.) • There exists an oracle relative to which 𝖯=𝖭𝖯≠𝖡𝖰𝖯=𝖯#​𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯superscript𝖯#𝖯\\mathsf{P}=\\mathsf{NP}\\neq\\mathsf{BQP}=\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{\\#P}}. To achieve these results, we build on the 2018 achievement by Raz and Tal of an oracle relative to which 𝖡𝖰𝖯⊄𝖯𝖧not-subset-of𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖯𝖧\\mathsf{BQP}\\not\\subset\\mathsf{PH}, and associated results about the Forrelation problem. We also introduce new tools that might be of independent interest. These include a “quantum-aware” version of the random restriction method, a concentration theorem for the block sensitivity of 𝖠𝖢𝟢superscript𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{AC^{0}} circuits, and a (provable) analogue of the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture for sparse oracles.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 63 most likely reference titles for this paper.
