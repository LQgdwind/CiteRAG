      "content": "Paper Title: Stochastic Constrained DRO with a Complexity Independent of Sample Size\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), as a popular method to train robust models against distribution shift between training and test sets, has received tremendous attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose and analyze stochastic algorithms that apply to both non-convex and convex losses for solving Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence constrained DRO problem. Compared with existing methods solving this problem, our stochastic algorithms not only enjoy competitive if not better complexity independent of sample size but also just require a constant batch size at every iteration, which is more practical for broad applications. We establish a nearly optimal complexity bound for finding an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-stationary solution for non-convex losses and an optimal complexity for finding an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-optimal solution for convex losses. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for solving non-convex and convex constrained DRO problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
