Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Competing for the most profitable tour: The orienteering interdiction game\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The orienteering problem is a well-studied and fundamental problem in transportation science. In the problem, we are given a graph with prizes on the nodes and lengths on the edges, together with a budget on the overall tour length. The goal is to find a tour that respects the length budget and maximizes the collected prizes. In this work, we introduce the orienteering interdiction game, in which a competitor (the leader) tries to minimize the total prize that the follower can collect within a feasible tour. To this end, the leader interdicts some of the nodes so that the follower cannot collect their prizes. The resulting interdiction game is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, and a single-level reformulation is obtained based on interdiction cuts. A branch-and-cut algorithm with several enhancements, including the use of a solution pool, a cut pool and a heuristic method for the follower’s problem, is proposed. In addition to this exact approach, a genetic algorithm is developed to obtain high-quality solutions in a short computing time. In a computational study based on instances from the literature for the orienteering problem, the usefulness of the proposed algorithmic components is assessed, and the branch-and-cut and genetic algorithms are compared in terms of solution time and quality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
