Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Fluent Query Reformulations with Text-to-Text Transformers and Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Query reformulation aims to alter noisy or ambiguous text sequences into coherent ones closer to natural language questions. This is to prevent errors from propagating in a client-facing pipeline and promote better communication with users. Besides, it is crucial to maintain performance in downstream environments like question answering when rephrased queries are given as input. We show that under the previous framework (AQA), attempts to alter RL algorithms do not bring significant benefits to either reward acquisition or sequence fluency. Instead, we leverage a query-reformulating text-to-text transformer (QRT5) and apply policy-based RL algorithms to further nudge this reformulator and obtain better answers downstream by generating reward-acquiring query trajectories. QRT5 shows better sample efficiency in RL to achieve the same level of QA performance as the previous approach. It can generate reformulations with more readability based on query well-formedness evaluations and can generalize to out-of-sample data. Our framework is demonstrated to be flexible, allowing reward signals to be sourced from different downstream environments such as intent classification.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
