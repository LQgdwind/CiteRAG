Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Digital Twin prototype for traffic sign recognition of a learning-enabled autonomous vehicle\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we present a novel digital twin prototype for a learning-enabled self-driving vehicle. The primary objective of this digital twin is to perform traffic sign recognition and lane keeping. The digital twin architecture relies on co-simulation and uses the Functional Mock-up Interface and SystemC Transaction Level Modeling standards. The digital twin consists of four clients, i) a vehicle model that is designed in Amesim tool, ii) an environment model developed in Prescan, iii) a lane-keeping controller designed in Robot Operating System, and iv) a perception and speed control module developed in the formal modeling language of BIP (Behavior, Interaction, Priority). These clients interface with the digital twin platform, PAVE360-Veloce System Interconnect (PAVE360-VSI). PAVE360-VSI acts as the co-simulation orchestrator and is responsible for synchronization, interconnection, and data exchange through a server. The server establishes connections among the different clients and also ensures adherence to the Ethernet protocol. We conclude with illustrative digital twin simulations and recommendations for future work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
