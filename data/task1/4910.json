Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Active Learning for Event Extraction with Memory-based Loss Prediction Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Event extraction (EE) plays an important role in many industrial application scenarios, and high-quality EE methods require a large amount of manual annotation data to train supervised learning models. However, the cost of obtaining annotation data is very high, especially for annotation of domain events, which requires the participation of experts from corresponding domain. So we introduce active learning (AL) technology to reduce the cost of event annotation. But the existing AL methods have two main problems, which make them not well used for event extraction. Firstly, the existing pool-based selection strategies have limitations in terms of computational cost and sample validity. Secondly, the existing evaluation of sample importance lacks the use of local sample information. In this paper, we present a novel deep AL method for EE. We propose a batch-based selection strategy and a Memory-Based Loss Prediction model (MBLP) to select unlabeled samples efficiently. During the selection process, we use an internal-external sample loss ranking method to evaluate the sample importance by using local information. Finally, we propose a delayed training strategy to train the MBLP model. Extensive experiments are performed on three domain datasets, and our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
