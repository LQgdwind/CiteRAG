      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal design of compliant displacement magnification mechanisms using stress-constrained topology optimization based on effective energy\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, stress-constrained topology optimization is applied to the design of compliant displacement magnification mechanisms. By formulating the objective function based on the concept of effective energy, it is not necessary to place artificial spring components at the boundaries of the output and input ports as in previous methods. This makes it possible to design mechanisms that do not receive a reaction force at the output port, such as sensors. Furthermore, by imposing a constraint on the maximum stress evaluated in terms of the p-norm of the von Mises equivalent stress, problems such as stress concentration can be avoided. Several numerical examples of displacement magnification mechanisms are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
