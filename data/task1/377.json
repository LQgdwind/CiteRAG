Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Toward Tag-free Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis: A Multiple Attention Network Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) approaches leverage various neural network models to extract the aspect sentiments via learning aspect-specific feature representations. However, these approaches heavily rely on manual tagging of user reviews according to the predefined aspects as the input, a laborious and time-consuming process. Moreover, the underlying methods do not explain how and why the opposing aspect level polarities in a user review lead to the overall polarity. In this paper, we tackle these two problems by designing and implementing a new Multiple-Attention Network (MAN) approach for more powerful ABSA without the need for aspect tags using two new tag-free data sets crawled directly from TripAdvisor (https://www.tripadvisor.com). With the Self- and Position-Aware attention mechanism, MAN is capable of extracting both aspect level and overall sentiments from the text reviews using the aspect level and overall customer ratings, and it can also detect the vital aspect(s) leading to the overall sentiment polarity among different aspects via a new aspect ranking scheme. We carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate the strong performance of MAN compared to other state-of-the-art ABSA approaches and the explainability of our approach by visualizing and interpreting attention weights in case studies.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
