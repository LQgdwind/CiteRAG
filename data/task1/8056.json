      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Contextual Anomaly Detection using Quantile Regression Forests 1footnote 11footnote 1Manuscript accepted by Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journal for publication (June 2023). This is a preprint version.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Traditional anomaly detection methods aim to identify objects that deviate from most other objects by treating all features equally. In contrast, contextual anomaly detection methods aim to detect objects that deviate from other objects within a context of similar objects by dividing the features into contextual features and behavioral features. In this paper, we develop connections between dependency-based traditional anomaly detection methods and contextual anomaly detection methods. Based on resulting insights, we propose a novel approach to inherently interpretable contextual anomaly detection that uses Quantile Regression Forests to model dependencies between features. Extensive experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in identifying contextual anomalies in terms of accuracy and interpretability.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 66 most likely reference titles for this paper.
