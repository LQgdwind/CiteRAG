      "content": "Paper Title: Incremental Verification of Fixed-Point Implementations of Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Implementations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) might lead to failures, which are hardly predicted in the design phase since ANNs are highly parallel and their parameters are barely interpretable. Here, we develop and evaluate a novel symbolic verification framework using incremental bounded model checking (BMC), satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), and invariant inference, to obtain adversarial cases and validate coverage methods in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We exploit incremental BMC based on interval analysis to compute boundaries from a neuron’s input. Then, the latter are propagated to effectively find a neuron’s output since it is the input of the next one. This paper describes the first bit-precise symbolic verification framework to reason over actual implementations of ANNs in CUDA, based on invariant inference, therefore providing further guarantees about finite-precision arithmetic and its rounding errors, which are routinely ignored in the existing literature. We have implemented the proposed approach on top of the efficient SMT-based bounded model checker (ESBMC), and its experimental results show that it can successfully verify safety properties, in actual implementations of ANNs, and generate real adversarial cases in MLPs. Our approach was able to verify and produce adversarial examples for 85.8% of 21 test cases considering different input images, and 100% of the properties related to covering methods. Although our verification time is higher than existing approaches, our methodology can consider fixed-point implementation aspects that are disregarded by the state-of-the-art verification methodologies.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
