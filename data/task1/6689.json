      "content": "Paper Title: A biologically-inspired multi-modal evaluation of molecular generative machine learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While generative models have recently become ubiquitous in many scientific areas, less attention has been paid to their evaluation. For molecular generative models, the state-of-the-art examines their output in isolation or in relation to its input. However, their biological and functional properties, such as ligand-target interaction is not being addressed. In this study, a novel biologically-inspired benchmark for the evaluation of molecular generative models is proposed. Specifically, three diverse reference datasets are designed and a set of metrics are introduced which are directly relevant to the drug discovery process. In particular we propose a recreation metric, apply drug-target affinity prediction and molecular docking as complementary techniques for the evaluation of generative outputs. While all three metrics show consistent results across the tested generative models, a more detailed comparison of drug-target affinity binding and molecular docking scores revealed that unimodal predictiors can lead to erroneous conclusions about target binding on a molecular level and a multi-modal approach is thus preferrable. The key advantage of this framework is that it incorporates prior physico-chemical domain knowledge into the benchmarking process by focusing explicitly on ligand-target interactions and thus creating a highly efficient tool not only for evaluating molecular generative outputs in particular, but also for enriching the drug discovery process in general.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 59\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
