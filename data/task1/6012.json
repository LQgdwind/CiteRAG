Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Co-design of Embodied Neural Intelligence via Constrained Evolution\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We introduce a novel co-design method for autonomous moving agents’ shape attributes and locomotion by combining deep reinforcement learning and evolution with user control. Our main inspiration comes from evolution, which has led to wide variability and adaptation in Nature and has the potential to significantly improve design and behavior simultaneously. Our method takes an input agent with optional simple constraints such as leg parts that should not evolve or allowed ranges of changes. It uses physics-based simulation to determine its locomotion and finds a behavior policy for the input design, later used as a baseline for comparison. The agent is then randomly modified within the allowed ranges creating a new generation of several hundred agents. The generation is trained by transferring the previous policy, which significantly speeds up the training. The best-performing agents are selected, and a new generation is formed using their crossover and mutations. The next generations are then trained until satisfactory results are reached. We show a wide variety of evolved agents, and our results show that even with only 10% of changes, the overall performance of the evolved agents improves 50%. If more significant changes to the initial design are allowed, our experiments’ performance improves even more to 150%. Contrary to related work, our co-design works on a single GPU and provides satisfactory results by training thousands of agents within one hour.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper.
