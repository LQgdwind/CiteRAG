      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised sequence-to-sequence learning for automatic signal quality assessment in multi-channel electrical impedance-based hemodynamic monitoring\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This study proposes an unsupervised sequence-to-sequence learning approach that automatically assesses the motion-induced reliability degradation of the cardiac volume signal (CVS) in multi-channel electrical impedance-based hemodynamic monitoring. The proposed method attempts to tackle shortcomings in existing learning-based assessment approaches, such as the requirement of manual annotation for motion influence and the lack of explicit mechanisms for realizing motion-induced abnormalities under contextual variations in CVS over time. By utilizing long-short term memory and variational auto-encoder structures, an encoder–decoder model is trained not only to self-reproduce an input sequence of the CVS but also to extrapolate the future in a parallel fashion. By doing so, the model can capture contextual knowledge lying in a temporal CVS sequence while being regularized to explore a general relationship over the entire time-series. A motion-influenced CVS of low-quality is detected, based on the residual between the input sequence and its neural representation with a cut–off value determined from the two-sigma rule of thumb over the training set. Our experimental observations validated two claims: (i) in the learning environment of label-absence, assessment performance is achievable at a competitive level to the supervised setting, and (ii) the contextual information across a time series of CVS is advantageous for effectively realizing motion-induced unrealistic distortions in signal amplitude and morphology. We also investigated the capability as a pseudo-labeling tool to minimize human-craft annotation by preemptively providing strong candidates for motion-induced anomalies. Empirical evidence has shown that machine-guided annotation can reduce inevitable human-errors during manual assessment while minimizing cumbersome and time-consuming processes. The proposed method has a significance especially in the industrial field, where it is unavoidable to gather and utilize a large amount of CVS data to achieve high accuracy and robustness in real-world applications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
