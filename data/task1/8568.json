      "content": "Paper Title: Real-time Safety Assessment of Dynamic Systems in Non-stationary Environments: A Review of Methods and Techniques\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Real-time safety assessment (RTSA) of dynamic systems is a critical task that has significant implications for various fields such as industrial and transportation applications, especially in non-stationary environments. However, the absence of a comprehensive review of real-time safety assessment methods in non-stationary environments impedes the progress and refinement of related methods. In this paper, a review of methods and techniques for RTSA tasks in non-stationary environments is provided. Specifically, the background and significance of RTSA approaches in non-stationary environments are firstly highlighted. We then present a problem description that covers the definition, classification, and main challenges. We review recent developments in related technologies such as online active learning, online semi-supervised learning, online transfer learning, and online anomaly detection. Finally, we discuss future outlooks and potential directions for further research. Our review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of real-time safety assessment methods in non-stationary environments, which can serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
