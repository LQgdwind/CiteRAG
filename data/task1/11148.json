Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2. Title: Glove: Global vectors for word representation\n   Abstract: We present a new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"titles\": [\n    \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Glove: Global vectors for word representation\",\n    \"Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks\",\n    \"A Comparative Study of Neural Network Models for Sentence Classification\",\n    \"Deep lstm based feature mapping for query classification\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the paper's focus on question classification using neural networks, I predict these references because: 1) CNN paper is directly relevant to the convolutional approach used; 2) GloVe embeddings are mentioned as pre-trained features; 3) QRNN is one of the compared methods; 4) Comparative study papers are common in this field; 5) LSTM-based query classification is closely related to question classification.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Evolution of Learning: Assessing the Transformative Impact of Generative AI on Higher Education\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models such as ChatGPT have experienced a surge in popularity, attracting 100 million active users in 2 months and generating an estimated 10 million daily queries. Despite this remarkable adoption, there remains a limited understanding to which extent this innovative technology influences higher education. This research paper investigates the impact of GAI on university students and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining a comprehensive survey with scenario analysis to explore potential benefits, drawbacks, and transformative changes the new technology brings. Using an online survey with 130 participants we assessed students’ perspectives and attitudes concerning present ChatGPT usage in academics. Results show that students use the current technology for tasks like assignment writing and exam preparation and believe it to be a effective help in achieving academic goals. The scenario analysis afterwards projected potential future scenarios, providing valuable insights into the possibilities and challenges associated with incorporating GAI into higher education. The main motivation is to gain a tangible and precise understanding of the potential consequences for HEIs and to provide guidance responding to the evolving learning environment. The findings indicate that irresponsible and excessive use of the technology could result in significant challenges. Hence, HEIs must develop stringent policies, reevaluate learning objectives, upskill their lecturers, adjust the curriculum and reconsider examination approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
