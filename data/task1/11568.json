Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: MultiHateClip: A Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Hateful Video Detection on YouTube and Bilibili\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Hate speech is a pressing issue in modern society, with significant effects both online and offline. Recent research in hate speech detection has primarily centered on text-based media, largely overlooking multimodal content such as videos. Existing studies on hateful video datasets have predominantly focused on English content within a Western context and have been limited to binary labels (hateful or non-hateful), lacking detailed contextual information. This study presents MultiHateClip111https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/MultiHateClip , an novel multilingual dataset created through hate lexicons and human annotation. It aims to enhance the detection of hateful videos on platforms such as YouTube and Bilibili, including content in both English and Chinese languages. Comprising 2,000 videos annotated for hatefulness, offensiveness, and normalcy, this dataset provides a cross-cultural perspective on gender-based hate speech. Through a detailed examination of human annotation results, we discuss the differences between Chinese and English hateful videos and underscore the importance of different modalities in hateful and offensive video analysis. Evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification models, such as VLM, GPT-4V and Qwen-VL, on MultiHateClip highlight the existing challenges in accurately distinguishing between hateful and offensive content and the urgent need for models that are both multimodally and culturally nuanced. MultiHateClip represents a foundational advance in enhancing hateful video detection by underscoring the necessity of a multimodal and culturally sensitive approach in combating online hate speech. Disclaimer: This paper contains sensitive content that may be disturbing to some readers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
