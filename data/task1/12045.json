Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A computational model for inelastic behaviour and fracture of refractory industrial components under high-temperature conditions, application to slide gate plates\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work aims to provide a computational model that can describe the complex behaviour of refractory industrial components under working conditions. Special attention is given to the asymmetric tension-compression behaviour and its evolution in the full range of working temperatures. The model accounts for inelastic flow in compression and brittle fracture behaviour in tension by leveraging the continuum-mechanics theory of plasticity and phase-field fracture damage. The model is implemented in the Finite Element open-source platform FEniCS and is used to analyze the fracture phenomenon in the refractory plate used in ladle slide gate systems to control the liquid steel flow from the ladle to the tundish.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
