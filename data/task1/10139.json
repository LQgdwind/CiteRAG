      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Rates of Kernel Ridge Regression under Source Condition in Large Dimensions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Motivated by the studies of neural networks (e.g.,the neural tangent kernel theory), we perform a study on the large-dimensional behavior of kernel ridge regression (KRR) where the sample size n‚âçdŒ≥asymptotically-equalsùëõsuperscriptùëëùõæn\\asymp d^{\\gamma} for some Œ≥>0ùõæ0\\gamma>0. Given an RKHS ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H} associated with an inner product kernel defined on the sphere ùïädsuperscriptùïäùëë\\mathbb{S}^{d}, we suppose that the true function fœÅ‚àó‚àà[‚Ñã]ssuperscriptsubscriptùëìùúåsuperscriptdelimited-[]‚Ñãùë†f_{\\rho}^{*}\\in[\\mathcal{H}]^{s}, the interpolation space of ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H} with source condition s>0ùë†0s>0. We first determined the exact order (both upper and lower bound) of the generalization error of kernel ridge regression for the optimally chosen regularization parameter ŒªùúÜ\\lambda. We then further showed that when 0<s‚â§10ùë†10<s\\leq 1, KRR is minimax optimal; and when s>1ùë†1s>1, KRR is not minimax optimal (a.k.a. the saturation effect). Our results illustrate that the curves of rate varying along Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma exhibit the periodic plateau behavior and the multiple descent behavior and show how the curves evolve with s>0ùë†0s>0. Interestingly, our work provides a unified viewpoint of several recent works on kernel regression in the large-dimensional setting, which correspond to s=0ùë†0s=0 and s=1ùë†1s=1 respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
