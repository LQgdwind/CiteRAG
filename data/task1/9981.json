Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Trace Monomial Boolean Functions with Large High-Order Nonlinearities\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Exhibiting an explicit Boolean function with a large high-order nonlinearity is an important problem in cryptography, coding theory, and computational complexity. We prove lower bounds on the second-order, third-order, and higher-order nonlinearities of some trace monomial Boolean functions. We prove lower bounds on the second-order nonlinearities of functions trn​(x7)subscripttr𝑛superscript𝑥7\\mathrm{tr}_{n}(x^{7}) and trn​(x2r+3)subscripttr𝑛superscript𝑥superscript2𝑟3\\mathrm{tr}_{n}(x^{2^{r}+3}) where n=2​r𝑛2𝑟n=2r. Among all trace monomials, our bounds match the best second-order nonlinearity lower bounds by [Car08] and [YT20] for odd and even n𝑛n respectively. We prove a lower bound on the third-order nonlinearity for functions trn​(x15)subscripttr𝑛superscript𝑥15\\mathrm{tr}_{n}(x^{15}), which is the best third-order nonlinearity lower bound. For any r𝑟r, we prove that the r𝑟r-th order nonlinearity of trn​(x2r+1−1)subscripttr𝑛superscript𝑥superscript2𝑟11\\mathrm{tr}_{n}(x^{2^{r+1}-1}) is at least 2n−1−2(1−2−r)​n+r2r−1−1−O​(2n2)superscript2𝑛1superscript21superscript2𝑟𝑛𝑟superscript2𝑟11𝑂superscript2𝑛22^{n-1}-2^{(1-2^{-r})n+\\frac{r}{2^{r-1}}-1}-O(2^{\\frac{n}{2}}). For r≪log2⁡nmuch-less-than𝑟subscript2𝑛r\\ll\\log_{2}n, this is the best lower bound among all explicit functions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
