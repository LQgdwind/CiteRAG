Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MUFASA: Multimodal Fusion Architecture Search for Electronic Health Records\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract One important challenge of applying deep learning to electronic health records (EHR) is the complexity of their multimodal structure. EHR usually contains a mixture of structured (codes) and unstructured (free-text) data with sparse and irregular longitudinal features – all of which doctors utilize when making decisions. In the deep learning regime, determining how different modality representations should be fused together is a difficult problem, which is often addressed by handcrafted modeling and intuition. In this work, we extend state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods and propose MUltimodal Fusion Architecture SeArch (MUFASA) to simultaneously search across multimodal fusion strategies and modality-specific architectures for the first time. We demonstrate empirically that our MUFASA method outperforms established unimodal NAS on public EHR data with comparable computation costs. In addition, MUFASA produces architectures that outperform Transformer and Evolved Transformer. Compared with these baselines on CCS diagnosis code prediction, our discovered models improve top-5 recall from 0.88 to 0.91 and demonstrate the ability to generalize to other EHR tasks. Studying our top architecture in depth, we provide empirical evidence that MUFASA’s improvements are derived from its ability to both customize modeling for each data modality and find effective fusion strategies.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
