Tardos is supported by the National Research, Development and Innovation Office projects K-132696 and SNN-135643 and by the ERC Advanced Grants “ERMiD” and “GeoScape.”\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The theory of forbidden 0–1 matrices generalizes Turán-style (bipartite) subgraph avoidance, Davenport-Schinzel theory, and Zarankiewicz-type problems, and has been influential in many areas, such as discrete and computational geometry, the analysis of self-adjusting data structures, and the development of the graph parameter twin width. The foremost open problems in this area is to resolve the Pach-Tardos conjecture from 2005, which states that if a forbidden pattern P∈{0,1}k×l𝑃superscript01𝑘𝑙P\\in\\{0,1\\}^{k\\times l} is the bipartite incidence matrix of an acyclic graph (forest), then Ex⁡(P,n)=O​(n​logCP⁡n)Ex𝑃𝑛𝑂𝑛superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑃𝑛\\operatorname{Ex}(P,n)=O(n\\log^{C_{P}}n), where CPsubscript𝐶𝑃C_{P} is a constant depending only on P𝑃P. This conjecture has been confirmed on many small patterns, specifically all P𝑃P with weight at most 5, and all but two with weight 6. The main result of this paper is a clean refutation of the Pach-Tardos conjecture. Specifically, we prove that Ex⁡(S0,n),Ex⁡(S1,n)≥n​2Ω​(log⁡n)Exsubscript𝑆0𝑛Exsubscript𝑆1𝑛𝑛superscript2Ω𝑛\\operatorname{Ex}(S_{0},n),\\operatorname{Ex}(S_{1},n)\\geq n2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})}, where S0,S1subscript𝑆0subscript𝑆1S_{0},S_{1} are the outstanding weight-6 patterns.
