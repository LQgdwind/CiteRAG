Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting Offline Reinforcement Learning with Action Preference Query\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Training practical agents usually involve offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) to balance the policy’s performance and interaction costs. In particular, online fine-tuning has become a commonly used method to correct the erroneous estimates of out-of-distribution data learned in the offline training phase. However, even limited online interactions can be inaccessible or catastrophic for high-stake scenarios like healthcare and autonomous driving. In this work, we introduce an interaction-free training scheme dubbed Offline-with-Action-Preferences (OAP). The main insight is that, compared to online fine-tuning, querying the preferences between pre-collected and learned actions can be equally or even more helpful to the erroneous estimate problem. By adaptively encouraging or suppressing policy constraint according to action preferences, OAP could distinguish overestimation from beneficial policy improvement and thus attains a more accurate evaluation of unseen data. Theoretically, we prove a lower bound of the behavior policy’s performance improvement brought by OAP. Moreover, comprehensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark and state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that OAP yields higher (29% on average) scores, especially on challenging AntMaze tasks (98% higher).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
