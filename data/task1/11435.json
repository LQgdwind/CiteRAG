Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of Symmetry Breaking Beyond Lex-Leader\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Symmetry breaking is a widely popular approach to enhance solvers in constraint programming, such as those for SAT or MIP. Symmetry breaking predicates (SBPs) typically impose an order on variables and single out the lexicographic leader (lex-leader) in each orbit of assignments. Although it is NP-hard to find complete lex-leader SBPs, incomplete lex-leader SBPs are widely used in practice. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing complete SBPs, lex-leader or otherwise, for SAT. Our main result proves a natural barrier for efficiently computing SBPs: efficient certification of graph non-isomorphism. Our results explain the difficulty of obtaining short SBPs for important CP problems, such as matrix-models with row-column symmetries and graph generation problems. Our results hold even when SBPs are allowed to introduce additional variables. We show polynomial upper bounds for breaking certain symmetry groups, namely automorphism groups of trees and wreath products of groups with efficient SBPs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
