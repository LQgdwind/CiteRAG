That is, for a graph Gùê∫G, the goal is to construct a straight-line drawing ŒìŒì\\Gamma of Gùê∫G in the plane such that, for any two vertices uùë¢u and vùë£v of Gùê∫G, the ratio between the minimum length of any path from uùë¢u to vùë£v and the Euclidean distance between uùë¢u and vùë£v is small. The maximum such ratio, over all pairs of vertices of Gùê∫G, is the spanning ratio of ŒìŒì\\Gamma. First, we show that deciding whether a graph admits a straight-line drawing with spanning ratio 111, a proper straight-line drawing with spanning ratio 111, and a planar straight-line drawing with spanning ratio 111 are NP-complete, ‚àÉ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete, and linear-time solvable problems, respectively, where a drawing is proper if no two vertices overlap and no edge overlaps a vertex. Second, we show that moving from spanning ratio 111 to spanning ratio 1+œµ1italic-œµ1+\\epsilon allows us to draw every graph. Namely, we prove that, for every œµ>0italic-œµ0\\epsilon>0, every (planar) graph admits a proper (resp. planar) straight-line drawing with spanning ratio smaller than 1+œµ1italic-œµ1+\\epsilon. Third, our drawings with spanning ratio smaller than 1+œµ1italic-œµ1+\\epsilon have large edge-length ratio, that is, the ratio between the length of the longest edge and the length of the shortest edge is exponential. We show that this is sometimes unavoidable. More generally, we identify having bounded toughness as the criterion that distinguishes graphs that admit straight-line drawings with constant spanning ratio and polynomial edge-length ratio from graphs that require exponential edge-length ratio in any straight-line drawing with constant spanning ratio.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
