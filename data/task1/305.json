      "content": "Paper Title: Maximum Clique in Disk-Like Intersection Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the complexity of Maximum Clique in intersection graphs of convex objects in the plane. On the algorithmic side, we extend the polynomial-time algorithm for unit disks [Clark ‚Äô90, Raghavan and Spinrad ‚Äô03] to translates of any fixed convex set. We also generalize the efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS) and subexponential algorithm for disks [Bonnet et al. ‚Äô18, Bonamy et al. ‚Äô18] to homothets of a fixed centrally symmetric convex set. The main open question on that topic is the complexity of Maximum Clique in disk graphs. It is not known whether this problem is NP-hard. We observe that, so far, all the hardness proofs for Maximum Clique in intersection graph classes ‚Ñê‚Ñê\\mathcal{I} follow the same road. They show that, for every graph Gùê∫G of a large-enough class ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C}, the complement of an even subdivision of Gùê∫G belongs to the intersection class ‚Ñê‚Ñê\\mathcal{I}. Then they conclude invoking the hardness of Maximum Independent Set on the class ùíûùíû\\mathcal{C}, and the fact that the even subdivision preserves that hardness. However there is a strong evidence that this approach cannot work for disk graphs [Bonnet et al. ‚Äô18]. We suggest a new approach, based on a problem that we dub Max Interval Permutation Avoidance, which we prove unlikely to have a subexponential-time approximation scheme. We transfer that hardness to Maximum Clique in intersection graphs of objects which can be either half-planes (or unit disks) or axis-parallel rectangles. That problem is not amenable to the previous approach. We hope that a scaled down (merely NP-hard) variant of Max Interval Permutation Avoidance could help making progress on the disk case, for instance by showing the NP-hardness for (convex) pseudo-disks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
