Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Examining average and discounted reward optimality criteria in reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In reinforcement learning (RL), the goal is to obtain an optimal policy, for which the optimality criterion is fundamentally important. Two major optimality criteria are average and discounted rewards. While the latter is more popular, it is problematic to apply in environments without an inherent notion of discounting. This motivates us to revisit a) the progression of optimality criteria in dynamic programming, b) justification for and complication of an artificial discount factor, and c) benefits of directly maximizing the average reward criterion, which is discounting-free. Our contributions include a thorough examination of the relationship between average and discounted rewards, as well as a discussion of their pros and cons in RL. We emphasize that average-reward RL methods possess the ingredient and mechanism for applying a family of discounting-free optimality criteria (Veinott,, 1969) to RL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper.
