Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Control Admissibility Models with Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Agent Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep reinforcement learning in continuous domains focuses on learning control policies that map states to distributions over actions that ideally concentrate on the optimal choices in each step. In multi-agent navigation problems, the optimal actions depend heavily on the agentsâ€™ density. Their interaction patterns grow exponentially with respect to such density, making it hard for learning-based methods to generalize. We propose to switch the learning objectives from predicting the optimal actions to predicting sets of admissible actions, which we call control admissibility models (CAMs), such that they can be easily composed and used for online inference for an arbitrary number of agents. We design CAMs using graph neural networks and develop training methods that optimize the CAMs in the standard model-free setting, with the additional benefit of eliminating the need for reward engineering typically required to balance collision avoidance and goal-reaching requirements. We evaluate the proposed approach in multi-agent navigation environments. We show that the CAM models can be trained in environments with only a few agents and be easily composed for deployment in dense environments with hundreds of agents, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
