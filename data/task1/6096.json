Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Distributionally Robust Decentralized Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Decentralized learning algorithms empower interconnected devices to share data and computational resources to collaboratively train a machine learning model without the aid of a central coordinator. In the case of heterogeneous data distributions at the network nodes, collaboration can yield predictors with unsatisfactory performance for a subset of the devices. For this reason, in this work, we consider the formulation of a distributionally robust decentralized learning task and we propose a decentralized single loop gradient descent/ascent algorithm (AD-GDA) to directly solve the underlying minimax optimization problem. We render our algorithm communication-efficient by employing a compressed consensus scheme and we provide convergence guarantees for smooth convex and non-convex loss functions. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical findings with empirical results that highlight AD-GDA‚Äôs ability to provide unbiased predictors and to greatly improve communication efficiency compared to existing distributionally robust algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
