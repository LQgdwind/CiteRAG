Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: HYPER2: Hyperbolic Poincaré Embedding for Hyper-Relational Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Link Prediction, addressing the issue of completing KGs with missing facts, has been broadly studied. However, less light is shed on the ubiquitous hyper-relational KGs. Most existing hyper-relational KG embedding models still tear an n-ary fact into smaller tuples, neglecting the indecomposability of some n-ary facts. While other frameworks work for certain arity facts only or ignore the significance of primary triple. In this paper, we represent an n-ary fact as a whole, simultaneously keeping the integrity of n-ary fact and maintaining the vital role that the primary triple plays. In addition, we generalize hyperbolic Poincaré embedding from binary to arbitrary arity data, which has not been studied yet. To tackle the weak expressiveness and high complexity issue, we propose HYPER2 which is qualified for capturing the interaction between entities within and beyond triple through information aggregation on the tangent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate HYPER2 achieves superior performance to its translational and deep analogues, improving SOTA by up to 34.5% with relatively few dimensions. Moreover, we study the side effect of literals and we theoretically and experimentally compare the computational complexity of HYPER2 against several best performing baselines, HYPER2 is 49-61 times quicker than its counterparts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
