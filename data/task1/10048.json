Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract With the proliferation of electronic devices, third-party intellectual property (3PIP) integration in the supply chain of the semiconductor industry and untrusted actors/fields have raised hardware security concerns that enable potential attacks, such as unauthorized access to data, fault injection and privacy invasion. Different security techniques have been proposed to provide resilience to secure devices from potential vulnerabilities; however, no one technique can be applied as an overarching solution. We propose an integrated Information Flow Tracking (IFT) technique to enable runtime security to protect system integrity by tracking the flow of data from untrusted communication channels. Existing hardware-based IFT schemes are either fine-, which are resource-intensive, or coarse-grained models, which have minimal precision logic, providing either control-flow or data-flow integrity. No current security model provides multi-granularity due to the difficulty in balancing both the flexibility and hardware overheads at the same time. This study proposes a multi-level granularity IFT model that integrates a hardware-based IFT technique with a gate-level-based IFT (GLIFT) technique, along with flexibility, for better precision and assessments. Translation from the instruction level to the data level is based on module instantiation with security-critical data for accurate information flow behaviors without any false conservative flows. A simulation-based IFT model is demonstrated, which translates the architecture-specific extensions into a compiler-specific simulation model with toolchain extensions for Reduced Instruction Set Architecture (RISC-V) to verify the security extensions. This approach provides better precision logic by enhancing the tagged mechanism with 1-bit tags and implementing an optimized shadow logic that eliminates the area overhead by tracking the data for only security-critical modules.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
