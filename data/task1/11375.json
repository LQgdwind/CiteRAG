      "content": "Paper Title: rKAN: Rational Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The development of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) marks a significant shift from traditional multi-layer perceptrons in deep learning. Initially, KANs employed B-spline curves as their primary basis function, but their inherent complexity posed implementation challenges. Consequently, researchers have explored alternative basis functions such as Wavelets, Polynomials, and Fractional functions. In this research, we explore the use of rational functions as a novel basis function for KANs. We propose two different approaches based on Padé approximation and rational Jacobi functions as trainable basis functions, establishing the rational KAN (rKAN). We then evaluate rKAN’s performance in various deep learning and physics-informed tasks to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness in function approximation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
