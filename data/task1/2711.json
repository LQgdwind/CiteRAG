Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: SBI: A Simulation-Based Test of Identifiability for Bayesian Causal Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A growing family of approaches to causal inference rely on Bayesian formulations of assumptions that go beyond causal graph structure. For example, Bayesian approaches have been developed for analyzing instrumental variable designs, regression discontinuity designs, and within-subjects designs. This paper introduces simulation-based identifiability (SBI), a procedure for testing the identifiability of queries in Bayesian causal inference approaches that are implemented as probabilistic programs. SBI complements analytical approaches to identifiability, leveraging a particle-based optimization scheme on simulated data to determine identifiability for analytically intractable models. We analyze SBI’s soundness for a broad class of differentiable, finite-dimensional probabilistic programs with bounded effects. Finally, we provide an implementation of SBI using stochastic gradient descent, and show empirically that it agrees with known identification results on a suite of graph-based and quasi-experimental design benchmarks, including those using Gaussian processes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
