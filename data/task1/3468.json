      "content": "Paper Title: Expected Scalarised Returns Dominance: A New Solution Concept for Multi-Objective Decision Making An earlier version of this work was presented at the Adaptive and Learning Agents Workshop 2021 [1]. This article extends our workshop paper with additional theoretical analysis and new empirical results.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In many real-world scenarios, the utility of a user is derived from a single execution of a policy. In this case, to apply multi-objective reinforcement learning, the expected utility of the returns must be optimised. Various scenarios exist where a user’s preferences over objectives (also known as the utility function) are unknown or difficult to specify. In such scenarios, a set of optimal policies must be learned. However, settings where the expected utility must be maximised have been largely overlooked by the multi-objective reinforcement learning community and, as a consequence, a set of optimal solutions has yet to be defined. In this work we propose first-order stochastic dominance as a criterion to build solution sets to maximise expected utility. We also define a new dominance criterion, known as expected scalarised returns (ESR) dominance, that extends first-order stochastic dominance to allow a set of optimal policies to be learned in practice. Additionally, we define a new solution concept called the ESR set, which is a set of policies that are ESR dominant. Finally, we present a new multi-objective tabular distributional reinforcement learning (MOTDRL) algorithm to learn the ESR set in multi-objective multi-armed bandit settings.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
