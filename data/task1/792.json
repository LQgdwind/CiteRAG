Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A simple extrapolated predictor for overcoming the starting and tracking issues in the arc-length method for nonlinear structural mechanics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents a simplified implementation of the arc-length method for computing the equilibrium paths of nonlinear structural mechanics problems using the finite element method. In the proposed technique, the predictor is computed by extrapolating the solutions from two previously converged load steps. The extrapolation is a linear combination of the previous solutions; therefore, it is simple and inexpensive. Additionally, the proposed extrapolated predictor also serves as a means for identifying the forward movement along the equilibrium path without the need for any sophisticated techniques commonly employed for explicit tracking. The ability of the proposed technique to successfully compute complex equilibrium paths in static structural mechanics problems is demonstrated using seven numerical examples involving truss, beam-column and shell models. The computed numerical results are in excellent agreement with the reference solutions. The present approach does not require prohibitively small increments for its success.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
