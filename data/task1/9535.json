Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: UniFormaly: Towards Task-Agnostic Unified Framework for Visual Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Visual anomaly detection aims to learn normality from normal images, but existing approaches are fragmented across various tasks: defect detection, semantic anomaly detection, multi-class anomaly detection, and anomaly clustering. This one-task-one-model approach is resource-intensive and incurs high maintenance costs as the number of tasks increases. We present UniFormaly, a universal and powerful anomaly detection framework. We emphasize the necessity of our off-the-shelf approach by pointing out a suboptimal issue in online encoder-based methods. We introduce Back Patch Masking (BPM) and top kùëòk-ratio feature matching to achieve unified anomaly detection. BPM eliminates irrelevant background regions using a self-attention map from self-supervised ViTs. This operates in a task-agnostic manner and alleviates memory storage consumption, scaling to tasks with large-scale datasets. Top kùëòk-ratio feature matching unifies anomaly levels and tasks by casting anomaly scoring into multiple instance learning. Finally, UniFormaly achieves outstanding results on various tasks and datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/YoojLee/Uniformaly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
