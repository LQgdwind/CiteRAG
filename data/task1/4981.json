Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Style and Semantic Memory Mechanism for Domain GeneralizationThis work was performed at JD AI Research.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Mainstream state-of-the-art domain generalization algorithms tend to prioritize the assumption on semantic invariance across domains. Meanwhile, the inherent intra-domain style invariance is usually underappreciated and put on the shelf. In this paper, we reveal that leveraging intra-domain style invariance is also of pivotal importance in improving the efficiency of domain generalization. We verify that it is critical for the network to be informative on what domain features are invariant and shared among instances, so that the network sharpens its understanding and improves its semantic discriminative ability. Correspondingly, we also propose a novel “jury” mechanism, which is particularly effective in learning useful semantic feature commonalities among domains. Our complete model called STEAM can be interpreted as a novel probabilistic graphical model, for which the implementation requires convenient constructions of two kinds of memory banks: semantic feature bank and style feature bank. Empirical results show that our proposed framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by clear margins.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
