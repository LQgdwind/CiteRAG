Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Purely Unsupervised Disentanglement of Appearance and Shape for Person Images Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract There have been a fairly of research interests in exploring the disentanglement of appearance and shape from human images. Most existing endeavours pursuit this goal by either using training images with annotations or regulating the training process with external clues such as human skeleton, body segmentation or cloth patches etc. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge in a more unsupervised mannerâ€”we do not require any annotation nor any external task-specific clues. To this end, we formulate an encoder-decoder-like network to extract both the shape and appearance features from input images at the same time, and train the parameters by three losses: feature adversarial loss, color consistency loss and reconstruction loss. The feature adversarial loss mainly impose little to none mutual information between the extracted shape and appearance features, while the color consistency loss is to encourage the invariance of person appearance conditioned on different shapes. More importantly, our unsupervised111Unsupervised learning has many interpretations in different tasks. To be clear, in this paper, we refer unsupervised learning as learning without task-specific human annotations, pairs or any form of weak supervision. framework utilizes learned shape features as masks which are applied to the input itself in order to obtain clean appearance features. Without using fixed input human skeleton, our network better preserves the conditional human posture while requiring less supervision. Experimental results on DeepFashion and Market1501 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves clean disentanglement and is able to synthesis novel images of comparable quality with state-of-the-art weakly-supervised or even supervised methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
