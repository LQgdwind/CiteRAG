Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: QTN-VQC: An End-to-End Learning framework for Quantum Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers raises a crucial challenge to design quantum neural networks for fully quantum learning tasks. To bridge the gap, this work proposes an end-to-end learning framework named QTN-VQC, by introducing a trainable quantum tensor network (QTN) for quantum embedding on a variational quantum circuit (VQC). The architecture of QTN is composed of a parametric tensor-train network for feature extraction and a tensor product encoding for quantum embedding. We highlight the QTN for quantum embedding in terms of two perspectives: (1) we theoretically characterize QTN by analyzing its representation power of input features; (2) QTN enables an end-to-end parametric model pipeline, namely QTN-VQC, from the generation of quantum embedding to the output measurement. Our experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate the advantages of QTN for quantum embedding over other quantum embedding approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
