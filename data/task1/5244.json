Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 69 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Algorithmic Framework for Locally Constrained Homomorphisms\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A homomorphism fùëìf from a guest graph Gùê∫G to a host graph HùêªH is locally bijective, injective or surjective if for every u‚ààV‚Äã(G)ùë¢ùëâùê∫u\\in V(G), the restriction of fùëìf to the neighbourhood of uùë¢u is bijective, injective or surjective, respectively. The corresponding decision problems, LBHom, LIHom and LSHom, are well studied both on general graphs and on special graph classes. Apart from complexity results when the problems are parameterized by the treewidth and maximum degree of the guest graph, the three problems still lack a thorough study of their parameterized complexity. This paper fills this gap: we prove a number of new FPT, W[1]-hard and para-NP-complete results by considering a hierarchy of parameters of the guest graph Gùê∫G. For our FPT results, we do this through the development of a new algorithmic framework that involves a general ILP model. To illustrate the applicability of the new framework, we also use it to prove FPT results for the Role Assignment problem, which originates from social network theory and is closely related to locally surjective homomorphisms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 69 most likely reference titles for this paper.
