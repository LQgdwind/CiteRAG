Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Metapath-based Context Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph anomaly detection has attracted considerable attention in recent years. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages metapath-based semi-supervised learning, addressing the limitations of previous methods. We present a new framework, Metapath-based Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection (MSAD), incorporating GCN layers in both the encoder and decoder to efficiently propagate context information between abnormal and normal nodes. The design of metapath-based context information and a specifically crafted anomaly community enhance the process of learning differences in structures and attributes, both globally and locally. Through a comprehensive set of experiments conducted on seven real-world networks, this paper demonstrates the superiority of the MSAD method compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The promising results of this study pave the way for future investigations, focusing on the optimization and analysis of metapath patterns to further enhance the effectiveness of anomaly detection on attributed networks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
