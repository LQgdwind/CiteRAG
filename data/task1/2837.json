      "content": "Paper Title: FES: A Fast Efficient Scalable QoS Prediction Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quality-of-Service (QoS) prediction of web service is an integral part of services computing due to its diverse applications in service composition/selection/recommendation. One of the primary objectives of designing a QoS prediction algorithm is to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. However, accuracy is not the only criteria to meet while developing a QoS prediction algorithm. The algorithm should be faster in terms of prediction time to be compatible with a real-time system. The other important factor to consider is scalability to tackle large-scale datasets. The existing QoS prediction algorithms often satisfy one goal while compromising the others. In this paper, we propose a semi-offline QoS prediction framework to achieve three important goals together: higher accuracy, faster prediction time, and scalability. Here, we aim to predict the QoS value of service that varies across users. Our framework (FES) consists of multi-phase prediction algorithms: preprocessing-phase prediction, online prediction, and prediction using the proposed pre-trained model. In the preprocessing phase, we first apply multi-level clustering on the dataset to obtain correlated users and services. We then preprocess the clusters using collaborative filtering to remove the sparsity. Finally, we create a two-staged, semi-offline regression model using neural networks to predict the QoS value of service to be invoked by a user in real-time. Our experimental results on WS-DREAM datasets show the efficiency (in terms of accuracy), scalability, and fast responsiveness (in terms of prediction time) of FES as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
