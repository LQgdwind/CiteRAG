Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Theory of Auto-Scaling for Resource Reservation in Cloud Services\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We consider a distributed server system consisting of a large number of servers, each with limited capacity on multiple resources (CPU, memory, disk, etc.). Jobs with different rewards arrive over time and require certain amounts of resources for the duration of their service. When a job arrives, the system must decide whether to admit it or reject it, and if admitted, in which server to schedule the job. The objective is to maximize the expected total reward received by the system. This problem is motivated by control of cloud computing clusters, in which, jobs are requests for Virtual Machines or Containers that reserve resources for various services, and rewards represent service priority of requests or price paid per time unit of service by clients. We study this problem in an asymptotic regime where the number of servers and jobs‚Äô arrival rates scale by a factor LùêøL, as LùêøL becomes large. We propose a resource reservation policy that asymptotically achieves at least 1/2121/2, and under certain monotone property on jobs‚Äô rewards and resources, at least 1‚àí1/e11ùëí1-1/e of the optimal expected reward. The policy automatically scales the number of VM slots for each job type as the demand changes, and decides in which servers the slots should be created in advance, without the knowledge of traffic rates. It effectively tracks a low-complexity greedy packing of existing jobs in the system while maintaining only a small number, g‚Äã(L)=œâ‚Äã(log‚Å°L)ùëîùêøùúîùêøg(L)=\\omega(\\log L), of reserved VM slots for high priority jobs that pack well.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
