Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Provably Approximated ICP\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The goal of the alignment problem is to align a (given) point cloud P={p1,⋯,pn}𝑃subscript𝑝1⋯subscript𝑝𝑛P=\\{p_{1},\\cdots,p_{n}\\} to another (observed) point cloud Q={q1,⋯,qn}𝑄subscript𝑞1⋯subscript𝑞𝑛Q=\\{q_{1},\\cdots,q_{n}\\}. That is, to compute a rotation matrix R∈ℝ3×3𝑅superscriptℝ33R\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times 3} and a translation vector t∈ℝ3𝑡superscriptℝ3t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3} that minimize the sum of paired distances ∑i=1nD​(R​pi−t,qi)superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛𝐷𝑅subscript𝑝𝑖𝑡subscript𝑞𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{n}D(Rp_{i}-t,q_{i}) for some distance function D𝐷D. A harder version is the registration problem, where the correspondence is unknown, and the minimum is also over all possible correspondence functions from P𝑃P to Q𝑄Q. Heuristics such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and its variants were suggested for these problems, but none yield a provable non-trivial approximation for the global optimum. We prove that there always exists a “witness” set of 333 pairs in P×Q𝑃𝑄P\\times Q that, via novel alignment algorithm, defines a constant factor approximation (in the worst case) to this global optimum. We then provide algorithms that recover this witness set and yield the first provable constant factor approximation for the: (i) alignment problem in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) expected time, and (ii) registration problem in polynomial time. Such small witness sets exist for many variants including points in d𝑑d-dimensional space, outlier-resistant cost functions, and different correspondence types. Extensive experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that our approximation constants are, in practice, close to 111, and up to x101010 times smaller than state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
