Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Virus2Vec: Viral Sequence Classification Using Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Understanding the host-specificity of different families of viruses sheds light on the origin of, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, rabies, and other such zoonotic pathogens in humans. It enables epidemiologists, medical professionals, and policymakers to curb existing epidemics and prevent future ones promptly. In the family Coronaviridae (of which SARS-CoV-2 is a member), it is well-known that the spike protein is the point of contact between the virus and the host cell membrane. On the other hand, the two traditional mammalian orders, Carnivora (carnivores) and Chiroptera (bats) are recognized to be responsible for maintaining and spreading the Rabies Lyssavirus (RABV). We propose Virus2Vec, a feature-vector representation for viral (nucleotide or amino acid) sequences that enable vector-space-based machine learning models to identify viral hosts. Virus2Vec generates numerical feature vectors for unaligned sequences, allowing us to forego the computationally expensive sequence alignment step from the pipeline. Virus2Vec leverages the power of both the minimizer and position weight matrix (PWM) to generate compact feature vectors. Using several classifiers, we empirically evaluate Virus2Vec on real-world spike sequences of Coronaviridae and rabies virus sequence data to predict the host (identifying the reservoirs of infection). Our results demonstrate that Virus2Vec outperforms the predictive accuracies of baseline and state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
