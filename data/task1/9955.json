Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: GradPaint: Gradient-Guided Inpainting with Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently achieved remarkable results in conditional and unconditional image generation. The pre-trained models can be adapted without further training to different downstream tasks, by guiding their iterative denoising process at inference time to satisfy additional constraints. For the specific task of image inpainting, the current guiding mechanism relies on copying-and-pasting the known regions from the input image at each denoising step. However, diffusion models are strongly conditioned by the initial random noise, and therefore struggle to harmonize predictions inside the inpainting mask with the real parts of the input image, often producing results with unnatural artifacts. Our method, dubbed GradPaint, steers the generation towards a globally coherent image. At each step in the denoising process, we leverage the model’s “denoised image estimation” by calculating a custom loss measuring its coherence with the masked input image. Our guiding mechanism uses the gradient obtained from backpropagating this loss through the diffusion model itself. GradPaint generalizes well to diffusion models trained on various datasets, improving upon current state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Our code will be made available upon publication.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
