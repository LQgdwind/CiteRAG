      "content": "Paper Title: NEMR: Network Embedding on Metric of Relation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Network embedding maps the nodes of a given network into a low-dimensional space such that the semantic similarities among the nodes can be effectively inferred. Most existing approaches use inner-product of node embeddings to measure the similarity between nodes leading to the fact that they lack the capacity to capture complex relationships among nodes. Besides, they take the path in the network just as structural auxiliary information when inferring node embeddings, while paths in the network are formed with rich user informations which are semantically relevant and cannot be ignored. In this paper, We propose a novel method called Network Embedding on the Metric of Relation, abbreviated as NEMR, which can learn the embeddings of nodes in a relational metric space efficiently. First, our NEMR models the relationships among nodes in a metric space with deep learning methods including variational inference that maps the relationship of nodes to a gaussian distribution so as to capture the uncertainties. Secondly, our NEMR considers not only the equivalence of multiple-paths but also the natural order of a single-path when inferring embeddings of nodes, which makes NEMR can capture the multiple relationships among nodes since multiple paths contain rich user information, e.g., age, hobby and profession. Experimental results on several public datasets show that the NEMR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on relevant inference tasks including link prediction and node classification.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
