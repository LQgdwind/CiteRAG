Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: OverChain: Building a robust overlay with a blockchain\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Blockchains use peer-to-peer networks for disseminating information among peers, but these networks currently do not have any provable guarantees for desirable properties such as Byzantine fault tolerance, good connectivity and small diameter. This is not just a theoretical problem, as recent works have exploited unsafe peer connection policies and weak network synchronization to mount partitioning attacks on Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency blockchains are safety critical systems, so we need principled algorithms to maintain their networks. Our key insight is that we can leverage the blockchain itself to share information among the peers, and thus simplify the network maintenance process. Given that the peers have restricted computational resources, and at most a constant fraction of them are Byzantine, we provide communication-efficient protocols to maintain a hypercubic network for blockchains, where peers can join and leave over time. Interestingly, we discover that our design can recover from substantial adversarial failures. Moreover, these properties hold despite significant churn. A key contribution is a secure mechanism for joining the network that uses the blockchain to help new peers to contact existing peers. Furthermore, by examining how peers join the network, i.e., the “bootstrapping service,” we give a lower bound showing that (within log factors) our network tolerates the maximum churn rate possible. In fact, we can give a lower bound on churn for any fully distributed service that requires connectivity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
