      "content": "Paper Title: The Computational Complexity of Quantum Determinants\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we study the computational complexity of quantum determinants, a q𝑞q-deformation of matrix permanents: Given a complex number q𝑞q on the unit circle in the complex plane and an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrix X𝑋X, the q𝑞q-permanent of X𝑋X is defined as Perq​(X)=∑σ∈Snqℓ​(σ)​X1,σ​(1)​…​Xn,σ​(n),subscriptPer𝑞𝑋subscript𝜎subscript𝑆𝑛superscript𝑞ℓ𝜎subscript𝑋1𝜎1…subscript𝑋𝑛𝜎𝑛\\mathrm{Per}_{q}(X)=\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_{n}}q^{\\ell(\\sigma)}X_{1,\\sigma(1)}\\ldots X_{n,\\sigma(n)}, where ℓ​(σ)ℓ𝜎\\ell(\\sigma) is the inversion number of permutation σ𝜎\\sigma in the symmetric group Snsubscript𝑆𝑛S_{n} on n𝑛n elements. The function family generalizes determinant and permanent, which correspond to the cases q=−1𝑞1q=-1 and q=1𝑞1q=1 respectively. For worst-case hardness, by Liouville’s approximation theorem and facts from algebraic number theory, we show that for primitive m𝑚m-th root of unity q𝑞q for odd prime power m=pk𝑚superscript𝑝𝑘m=p^{k}, exactly computing q𝑞q-permanent is 𝖬𝗈𝖽p​𝖯subscript𝖬𝗈𝖽𝑝𝖯\\mathsf{Mod}_{p}\\mathsf{P}-hard. This implies that an efficient algorithm for computing q𝑞q-permanent results in a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. Next, we show that computing q𝑞q-permanent can be achieved using an oracle that approximates to within a polynomial multiplicative error and a membership oracle for a finite set of algebraic integers. From this, an efficient approximation algorithm would also imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. By random self-reducibility, computing q𝑞q-permanent remains to be hard for a wide range of distributions satisfying a property called the strong autocorrelation property. Specifically, this is proved via a reduction from 111-permanent to q𝑞q-permanent for O​(1/n2)𝑂1superscript𝑛2O(1/n^{2}) points z𝑧z on the unit circle. Since the family of permanent functions shares common algebraic structure, various techniques developed for the hardness of permanent can be generalized to q𝑞q-permanents.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
