Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cut-and-Paste Object Insertion by Enabling Deep Image Prior for Reshading\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We show how to insert an object from one image to another and get realistic results in the hard case, where the shading of the inserted object clashes with the shading of the scene. Rendering objects using an illumination model of the scene doesn’t work, because doing so requires a geometric and material model of the object, which is hard to recover from a single image. In this paper, we introduce a method that corrects shading inconsistencies of the inserted object without requiring a geometric and physical model or an environment map. Our method uses a deep image prior (DIP), trained to produce reshaded renderings of inserted objects via consistent image decomposition inferential losses. The resulting image from DIP aims to have (a) an albedo similar to the cut-and-paste albedo, (b) a similar shading field to that of the target scene, and (c) a shading that is consistent with the cut-and-paste surface normals. The result is a simple procedure that produces convincing shading of the inserted object. We show the efficacy of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively for several objects with complex surface properties and also on a dataset of spherical lampshades for quantitative evaluation. Our method significantly outperforms an Image Harmonization (IH) baseline for all these objects. They also outperform the cut-and-paste and IH baselines in a user study with over 100 users.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 59\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
