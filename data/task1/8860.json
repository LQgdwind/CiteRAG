Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Stock and market index prediction using Informer network\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Applications of deep learning in financial market prediction has attracted huge attention from investors and researchers. In particular, intra-day prediction at the minute scale, the dramatically fluctuating volume and stock prices within short time periods have posed a great challenge for the convergence of networks result. Informer is a more novel network, improved on Transformer with smaller computational complexity, longer prediction length and global time stamp features. We have designed three experiments to compare Informer with the commonly used networks LSTM, Transformer and BERT on 1-minute and 5-minute frequencies for four different stocks/ market indices. The prediction results are measured by three evaluation criteria: MAE, RMSE and MAPE. Informer has obtained best performance among all the networks on every dataset. Network without the global time stamp mechanism has significantly lower prediction effect compared to the complete Informer; it is evident that this mechanism grants the time series to the characteristics and substantially improves the prediction accuracy of the networks. Finally, transfer learning capability experiment is conducted, Informer also achieves a good performance. Informer has good robustness and improved performance in market prediction, which can be exactly adapted to real trading.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
