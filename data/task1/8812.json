Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mol-PECO: a deep learning model to predict human olfactory perception from molecular structures\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract While visual and auditory information conveyed by wavelength of light and frequency of sound have been decoded, predicting olfactory information encoded by the combination of odorants remains challenging due to the unknown and potentially discontinuous perceptual space of smells and odorants. Herein, we develop a deep learning model called Mol-PECO (Molecular Representation by Positional Encoding of Coulomb Matrix) to predict olfactory perception from molecular structures. Mol-PECO updates the learned atom embedding by directional graph convolutional networks (GCN), which model the Laplacian eigenfunctions as positional encoding, and Coulomb matrix, which encodes atomic coordinates and charges. With a comprehensive dataset of 8,50385038,503 molecules, Mol-PECO directly achieves an area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic (AUROC) of 0.8130.8130.813 in 118118118 odor descriptors, superior to the machine learning of molecular fingerprints (AUROC of 0.7610.7610.761) and GCN of adjacency matrix (AUROC of 0.6780.6780.678). The learned embeddings by Mol-PECO also capture a meaningful odor space with global clustering of descriptors and local retrieval of similar odorants. Our work may promote the understanding and decoding of the olfactory sense and mechanisms.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
