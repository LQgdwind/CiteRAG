Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Semantic Labeling Using a Deep Contextualized Language Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Generating schema labels automatically for column values of data tables has many data science applications such as schema matching, and data discovery and linking. For example, automatically extracted tables with missing headers can be filled by the predicted schema labels which significantly minimizes human effort. Furthermore, the predicted labels can reduce the impact of inconsistent names across multiple data tables. Understanding the connection between column values and contextual information is an important yet neglected aspect as previously proposed methods treat each column independently. In this paper, we propose a context-aware semantic labeling method using both the column values and context. Our new method is based on a new setting for semantic labeling, where we sequentially predict labels for an input table with missing headers. We incorporate both the values and context of each data column using the pre-trained contextualized language model, BERT, that has achieved significant improvements in multiple natural language processing tasks. To our knowledge, we are the first to successfully apply BERT to solve the semantic labeling task. We evaluate our approach using two real-world datasets from different domains, and we demonstrate substantial improvements in terms of evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art feature-based methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
