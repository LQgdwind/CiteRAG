      "content": "Paper Title: Poly-time universality and limitations of deep learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The goal of this paper is to characterize function distributions that deep learning can or cannot learn in poly-time. A universality result is proved for SGD-based deep learning and a non-universality result is proved for GD-based deep learning; this also gives a separation between SGD-based deep learning and statistical query algorithms: (1) Deep learning with SGD is efficiently universal. Any function distribution that can be learned from samples in poly-time can also be learned by a poly-size neural net trained with SGD on a poly-time initialization with poly-steps, poly-rate and possibly poly-noise. Therefore deep learning provides a universal learning paradigm: it was known that the approximation and estimation errors could be controlled with poly-size neural nets, using ERM that is NP-hard; this new result shows that the optimization error can also be controlled with SGD in poly-time. The picture changes for GD with large enough batches: (2) Result (1) does not hold for GD: Neural nets of poly-size trained with GD (full gradients or large enough batches) on any initialization with poly-steps, poly-range and at least poly-noise cannot learn any function distribution that has super-polynomial cross-predictability, where the cross-predictability gives a measure of ‚Äúaverage‚Äù function correlation ‚Äì relations and distinctions to the statistical dimension are discussed. In particular, GD with these constraints can learn efficiently monomials of degree kùëòk if and only if kùëòk is constant. Thus (1) and (2) point to an interesting contrast: SGD is universal even with some poly-noise while full GD or SQ algorithms are not (e.g., parities). This thus gives a separation between SGD-based deep learning and SQ algorithms. Finally, we complete these by showing that the cross-predictability also impedes SGD once larger amounts of noise are added on the initialization and gradients, or when sufficiently few weight are updating per time step (as in coordinate descent).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
