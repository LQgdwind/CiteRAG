Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), as an alternative algorithm, aims to degrade the computing cost level by updating partial parameters instead of entire ones. As in [ref]23 [ref]50, a straightforward idea is to only update parameters of selected layers (e.g., the output embedding layer) and meanwhile freeze parameters of the other layers. Alternatively, we can also append one or multiple additional layers to the base model and only parameters of these additional layers are trainable. As a modified version of the latter one, Adapter Tuning [ref]51 incorporates a lightweight adapter network with only a few trainable parameters into LLMs and it demonstrates competitive performance to fine-tuning the top layers. Considering Prefix-tuning  and P-tuning , one or several task-specific virtual token, serving as an additional, trainable, continuous prompt or embedding, is appended to the original input and compared with the discrete prompt, the continuous one is more feasible and is not restricted to discrete real tokens . To further break the limit of sequence length of LLMs, LoRA propose another train of thought, which incorporates a pair of trainable low-rank matrices into each dense layer and it also demonstrates comparable performance to full-parameter fine-tuning . Two outstanding advantages of LoRA are: (i) Low computing cost during fine-tuning. (ii) High efficiency during inference. However, LoRA can only learn paired integral matrices for all tasks that is not an effective and efficient way to capture the task-common and task-specific knowledge across distinct tasks in MTL. In this work, we proposed a framework to implement 1+N1ùëÅ1+N multi-task fine-tuning pattern in LLMs powered by CGC-LoRA network and it takes advantage of both MTL (e.g., MMOE and PLE) and PEFT (e.g., P-tunig and LoRA) and reveals its parameter efficient fine-tuning capability in MTL cases.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: and impractical.
