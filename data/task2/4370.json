      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Contrastive Learning via Asymmetric InfoNCE\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWell-performed models trained on clean data can suffer miserably when exposed to simply-crafted adversarial samples¬†   . There has been many adversarial defense mechanisms designed to boost model robustness using labeled data¬† 0  7   . In practice, however, obtaining large-scale annotated data can be far more difficult and costly than acquiring unlabeled data. Leveraging easily-acquired unlabeled data for adversarial learning, thus becomes particularly attractive. Contrastive Learning (CL)¬†3, which performs instance discrimination¬†8 (Figure 1 (a)) by maximizing agreement between augmentations of the same instance in the learned latent features while minimizing the agreement between different instances,\nhas made encouraging progress in self-supervised learning¬† 4  2. Due to its effectiveness in learning rich representations and competitive performance over fully-supervised methods, CL has seen a surge of research in recent years, such as\npositive sampling¬† 4  5, negative sampling¬†4 8  8,\npair reweighting¬† 9, and different contrast methods¬†2  3. Recently, contrastive learning has been extended to adversarial learning tasks in a self-supervised manner, leading to a new area of adversarial contrastive learning (Adversarial CL) ¬†2 [ref]18 7 1.\nThe main idea is to generate adversarial samples as additional positives of the same instance¬†2 [ref]18 7 for instance-wise attack, and maximize the similarity between clean views of the instance and their adversarial counterparts as in CL, while also solving the min-max optimization problem following canonical adversarial learning objective¬†5 0  7  .\nFor example, RoCL2 first proposed an attack mechanism against contrastive loss to confuse the model on instance-level identity, in a self-supervised adversarial training framework. AdvCL[ref]18 proposed to minimize the gap between unlabeled contrast and labeled finetuning by introducing pseudo-supervision in the pre-training stage. Although these Adversarial CL methods showed improvement on model robustness, we observe that a direct\nextension from CL to adversarial learning (AL) can introduce ineffective CL updates during training.\nThe core problem lies in that they add worst-case perturbations Œ¥ùõø\\delta that no longer guarantee the preservation of instance-level identity¬†2 (i.e., different from other data augmentation methods, adversarial samples can reside faraway from the current instance in the feature space after several attack iterations, because the attack objective is to make adversaries away from the current instance while approximating other instances, against the CL objective).\nAs illustrated in Figure¬†1(b), when the adversarial sample (A) of the current instance (I) are in close proximity to negative samples (N), CL objective minimizes the agreement between negative samples and current instance (I and N are pushed away from each other), while AL objective maximizes the agreement between adversarial samples and current instance (A and I are pulled together as A is considered as an augmented view of I). Meanwhile, A and N share similar representations, which renders the two objectives contradicting to each other. We term this conflict as ‚Äúidentity confusion‚Äù, it means Aùê¥A attracts and ‚Äòconfuses‚Äô IùêºI with a false identity induced by NùëÅN, which impedes both CL and AL from achieving their respective best performance. To address this issue of identity confusion, we propose to treat adversarial samples unequally and discriminatingly, and design a generic asymmetric InfoNCE objective (A-InfoNCE), in order to model the asymmetric contrast strengths between positive/negative samples.\nFirstly, to mitigate the direct pull between adversarial sample (A) and current instance (I) (Figure¬†1 (c)) that might dampen the effectiveness of CL, we propose to treat adversarial samples as inferior positives that induce weaker learning signals to attract their counterparts in a lower degree when performing positive contrasts.\nThis asymmetric consideration in AL promises a trade-off and reduces conflicting impact on the CL loss.\n Secondly, to encourage adversarial samples (A) to escape from false identities induced by negative samples (N) that share similar representations to (A) (pushing A away from N) (Figure¬†1(d)), we consider adversarial samples (A) as hard negatives¬†9 of other negative samples (N), by strengthening the negative contrast between A and N in CL computation.\nTo effectively sample true adversarial negatives and re-weight each sample, we follow positive-unlabeled learning¬†  and contrastive negatives reweighting¬†9  practice. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n1)1)\nWe propose an generic asymmetric InfoNCE loss, A-InfoNCE, to address the identity confusion problem in Adversarial CL, by viewing adversarial samples\nas inferior positives or hard negatives.\n2) Our approach is compatible to existing Adversarial CL methods, by simply replacing standard CL loss with A-InfoNCE.\n3) Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10 show that our approach consistently outperforms existing Adversarial CL methods.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: 3.
