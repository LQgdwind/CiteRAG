      "content": "Paper Title: UniNet: Unified Architecture Search with Convolution, Transformer, and MLP\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, transformer and MLP based architectures are able to achieve comparable performance to convolution networks on different visual tasks. To achieve better performance, it is intuitive to assemble all the types of operators to build high-performance hybrid networks.\nActually, a few works [ref]51   have been studied to empirically combine convolution and self-attention. However, manually searching network architectures is quite time-consuming and cannot ensure optimal performances with different computational budgets. We introduce a unified search space that contains General Operators (GOPs, including convolution, transformer, and MLP), and then search for the optimal combination of those operators jointly. Compared with the prior art, we propose a unified form to characterize different operators. Specifically, we use the inverted residual  to model a general operator block, which first expands the input channel 𝚌𝚌\\mathtt{c} to a larger size 𝚎𝚌𝚎𝚌\\mathtt{ec}, and then projects the 𝚎𝚌𝚎𝚌\\mathtt{ec} channels back to 𝚌𝚌\\mathtt{c} for residual connection. The 𝚎𝚎\\mathtt{e} is defined as the expansion ratio, which is usually a small integer number, e.g., 4. The general operation block is therefore modeled as where 𝙾𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝙾𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗\\mathtt{Operation} can be convolution, MLP, or transformer, and 𝚡,𝚢𝚡𝚢\\mathtt{x,y} represent input and output features, respectively. For convolution, we place the convolution operation inside the bottleneck , which can be expressed as The 𝙲𝚘𝚗𝚟𝙲𝚘𝚗𝚟\\mathtt{Conv} operation can be either regular convolution or depth-wise convolution (𝙳𝚆𝙲𝚘𝚗𝚟𝙳𝚆𝙲𝚘𝚗𝚟\\mathtt{DWConv}) [ref]4, and the 𝙿𝚛𝚘𝚓𝙿𝚛𝚘𝚓\\mathtt{Proj} represents a linear projection.\nFor self-attention in transformer and token-mixing in MLP, the computation cost on the large bottleneck feature map is quite huge. Following previous works  [ref]41, we separate them from the bottleneck for computation efficiency, and the 𝙿𝚛𝚘𝚓𝙿𝚛𝚘𝚓\\mathtt{Proj} is implemented inside the FFN  sub-layer. Each transformer block has a query-key-value self-attention sub-layer and an FFN sub-layer, and the token-mixing in the MLP block is implemented by transpose-FFN-transpose\nas that in [ref]41, where 𝚂𝙰𝚂𝙰\\mathtt{SA} can be either vanilla self-attention or local self-attention 𝙻𝚂𝙰𝙻𝚂𝙰\\mathtt{LSA}, and 𝙼𝙻𝙿𝙼𝙻𝙿\\mathtt{MLP} refers to the token-mixing operation. There are two main advantages of representing the different types of operators in a unified format and search space: (1) We can characterize each operator with the same set of configuration parameters (i.e., OP type, expansion, channels, etc). As a result, the overall search space is greatly reduced, and the total search cost becomes affordable. (2) With the unified form, the comparison between different operators is fairer, which is important for NAS  to identify the optimal hybrid architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: convolution networks on different visual tasks. To achieve better performance, it is intuitive to assemble all the types of operators to build high-performance hybrid networks.\nActually, a few works [ref]51   have been studied to empirically combine convolution and self-attention. However, manually searching network architectures is quite time-consuming and cannot ensure optimal performances\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
