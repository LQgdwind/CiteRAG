      "content": "Paper Title: Prefender: A Prefetching Defender against Cache Side Channel Attacks as A Pretender\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany countermeasures have been proposed to defend against cache side channel attacks, including software and hardware approaches.\nSoftware defenses are more compatible with current platforms, but they may not fundamentally defeat the attacks, and they can incur high performance overhead. Therefore, microarchitectural defenses are further proposed in many studies. The comparisons between Prefender and related work are shown in Tables I and II.\nCache side channel attacks can be combined with transient speculative execution for data leakage, such as Spectre  attacks.\nTo mitigate cache side channel attacks caused by transient execution, some of the prior work restricts speculation by constraining the execution of speculative loads, such as Conditional Speculation , NDA  and SpecShield . They seek to identify the dangerous load instructions that can be potentially exploited by attackers and then delay their execution until all the past instructions are guaranteed to be safe. However, this method may lead to high overhead if they fail to accurately detect the dangerous loads. Another category, such as InvisiSpec , SafeSpec [ref]24 and MuonTrap , designs a shadow structure to temporarily hold the data brought by speculative loads during transient execution, but they require many modifications to the existing hardware systems.\nAlthough SafeSpec  achieves a 3% performance improvement by avoiding cache pollution, its threat model is attacks on transient speculative execution, which are different from our threat model on cache timing side channel attacks.\nSpecPref  also aims at speculative execution vulnerabilities and prefetchers, but the role of the prefetchers in SpecPref is the source of the data leakage instead of the way of defense, which is a different threat model. The above defenses only prevent data leakage caused by transient execution. They are ineffective in defending against other traditional cache side channel attacks. For the traditional ones, some new cache policies were introduced.\nCatalyst  and StealthMem  partition the cache into different regions for private data and shared resources, respectively. For Catalyst , software modifications are needed. DAWG  achieves a higher granularity, which dynamically partitions cache ways to avoid cache sharing among different security domains. However, these methods require programmers to rewrite the source codes to flag the sensitive data. In contrast, the key idea of CEASER  and RPcache 0 is to randomize the cache mapping algorithm in order to prevent the attacker from evicting the cache.\nSHARP 1 also designs a new cache replacement policy to prevent the eviction and flush from forcing out dedicated cachelines. It requires operating system support to handle interrupts generated by alarm counters and does not defend against single-core attacks in the private cache.\nIndicated in Table I, almost all the approaches for cache timing side channel attacks pay some level of performance for the security strength, or are not able to defeat general cache side channel attacks.\nTo sum up, it is always a challenging task to design both efficient and effective defenses for both security and performance.  Besides the above studies with different approaches from Prefender, there are also multiple studies using prefetchers for defense, as summarized in Table II.\nPrefetch-guard , PrODACT  and Reuse-trap  propose several methods to detect the spy and leverage prefetching to obfuscate the spy based on previously recorded information, sharing the same idea with Prefender.\nHowever, their threat model is different from ours. They focus on covert channel attacks. One key feature their defenses are based on is that the attacker needs to access one cacheline multiple times. As this assumption is not included in our threat model, they cannot defeat the targeting attacks of this paper.\nIn addition, the attacker in our threat model might access the caches randomly to mislead the prefetchers, and this is not handled by the studies , , . Moreover, no techniques are proposed in these studies to handle the noise from the benign memory accesses. These studies need software modifications and can be intrusive. For hardware consumption, since they need one tracker for each cache set, the hardware overhead can be highly increased with the growth of the cache size.\nBesides, Reuse-trap needs to know the victim’s process ID in advance to record the victim’s cache misses, which may cause software modifications.\nFinally, they still trade some level of performance and fail in gaining performance improvement that can be achieved with prefetching.\nDisruptive Prefetching  also modifies the prefetchers to defeat cache side channel attacks. But it manipulates in a granularity of cacheset instead of cacheline, and only Prime+Probe is discussed, so the security is restricted.\nMeanwhile, it may cause cache pollution due to its random prefetching policy.\nBITP  prefetches the data when identifying cross-core back-invalidation-hits in multicore systems. So, it targets cross-core attacks but not single-core attacks. In contrast, Prefender can also be applied to single-core attacks as it is able to filter the benign memory accesses in the single-core executions. Both BITP and Prefender improve performance, and Prefender achieves higher improvement. Compared with related work, Prefender is a completely hardware-based and resource-efficient method without modifying any policy of speculative execution or cache in modern processors. It can effectively defend against the multi-cacheline (cacheset) access-based cache attacks, as well as single-core and cross-core attacks. It also considers the random accesses from the attacks and the noise from the benign accesses, and the defense granularity is each cacheline.\nOn the premise of ensuring security,\nit further achieves a performance enhancement better than prior work through accurate runtime analyses and well-designed hardware prefetching strategies.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: the past instructions are guaranteed to be safe. However, this method may lead to high overhead if they fail to accurately detect the dangerous loads. Another category, such as InvisiSpec , SafeSpec [ref]24 and MuonTrap , designs a shadow structure to temporarily hold the data brought by speculative loads during transient execution, but they require many modifications to the existing hardware\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
