      "content": "Paper Title: FedGroup: Efficient Federated Learning via Decomposed Similarity-Based Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate FedGroup and FedGrouProx on four federated datasets, which including two image classification tasks, a synthetic dataset, a sentiment analysis task.\nIn this section, we adopt the same notation for federated learning settings as Section¬†III and as¬†: the local epoch E=20ùê∏20E=20, the number of selected clients per round K=20ùêæ20K=20, the pre-training scale Œ±=20ùõº20\\alpha=20, the inter-group aggregation is disable. The local solver is mini-batch SGD with B=10ùêµ10B=10. Besides, the learning rate Œ∑ùúÇ\\eta and FedProx hyperparameter Œºùúá\\mu in our experiments are consistent with the recommended settings of¬†. Datasets and Models MNIST¬†. A 10-class handwritten digits image classification task, which is divided into 1,000 clients, each with only two classes of digits. We train a convex multinomial logistic regression (MCLR) model and a non-convex multilayer perceptron (MLP) model based on it. The MLP has one hidden layer with 128 hidden units. Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST)¬†. A 62-class handwritten digits and characters image classification task, which is built by resampling the EMNIST¬† according to the writer. Similar to the experiment of EMNIST, we train a MCLR model and a MLP model (one hidden layer with 512 hidden units) based on it. Synthetic. It‚Äôs a synthetic federated dataset proposed by Shamir et. al¬†. Our hyperparameter settings of this data-generated algorithm are Œ±=1,Œ≤=1formulae-sequenceùõº1ùõΩ1\\alpha=1,\\beta=1, which control the statistical heterogeneity among clients. We study a MCLR model based on it. Sentiment140 (Sent140)¬†. A tweets sentiment analysis task, which contains 772 clients, each client is a different twitter account. We explore a LSTM classifier based on it. The statistics of our experimental datasets and models are summarized in TABLE¬†II. Baselines FedAvg¬†: the vanilla federated learning framework. FedProx¬†: the popular federated learning optimizer toward heterogeneous networks. IFCA¬†: An CFL framework that minimizes the loss functions while estimating the cluster identities. FeSEM¬†[ref]15: An ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} distance-based CFL framework that minimizes the expectation of discrepancies between clients and groups stochastically. Evaluation Metrics Since each client has a local test set in our experimental setting, we evaluate its corresponding group model based on these data.\nFor example, in FedAvg and FedProx we evaluate the global model based on the test set for all clients.\nAnd in FedGroup and FedGrouProx we evaluate the group model based on the test set for the clients in this group.\nWe use top-1 classification accuracy to measure the performance of the classifiers.\nGiven that FedGroup has multiple accuracies of groups with different sizes, we use a ‚Äùweighted‚Äù accuracy to measure the overall performance and the weight is proportional to the test data size of each group.\nIn fact, the ‚Äùweighted‚Äù accuracy is equivalent to the sum of the misclassified sample count in all groups divided by the total test size. To make our results more comparable, the test clients of the group model is all the clients historically assigned to this group.\nAs the number of training rounds increases, all clients would be included in the test.\nNote that the heterogeneity will affect the convergence, resulting in greater fluctuations in model accuracy during the training process.\nTherefore, we assume the early stopping¬† strategy is applied and we regard the maximum test accuracy during training as the final score. The number of groups of all CFL-based frameworks remains the same for each dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: framework.
