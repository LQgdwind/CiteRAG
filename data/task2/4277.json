      "content": "Paper Title: Target-absent Human Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUsing FFMs as our state representation, we train a policy that mimics human gaze behavior using the IRL framework . However, we found that the GAIL  IRL algorithm used in  is too sensitive to its hyper-parameters, due to its adversarial learning design, which is also shown in [ref]23. We therefore use IQ-Learn [ref]12 as our IRL algorithm instead. Based on soft Q-Learning [ref]14, IQ-Learn encodes both the reward and the policy in a single Q-function, and thus is able to optimize both reward and policy simultaneously. Let Q​(s,a)𝑄𝑠𝑎Q(s,a) be the Q-function, which maps a state-action pair (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a) to a scalar value representing the amount of future reward gained by taking action a𝑎a under state s𝑠s. We want to find a reward function that maximizes the expected amount of cumulative rewards that the expert policy obtains over all other possible policies. Hence, IQ-Learn trains the Q-function by minimizing the following loss: where V​(s)=log​∑aexp⁡(Q​(s,a))𝑉𝑠subscript𝑎𝑄𝑠𝑎V(s)=\\log\\sum_{a}\\exp(Q(s,a)), ρEsubscript𝜌𝐸\\rho_{E} and 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} denote the occupancy measure of the expert policy  and the dynamics, respectively. We do not apply the χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2}-divergence proposed in [ref]12 on the reward function since it did not lead to any notable improvement on our task. Given the learned Q-function Q𝑄Q, we can compute the reward as a function of the state and action: and the policy as a function of the state: τ𝜏\\tau is the temperature coefficient, controlling the entropy of the action distribution. Action space. Our task is to predict the next fixation given the previous fixations, the input image, and the categorical target. To predict fixations on an image, we follow  and discretize the image space into a 20×32203220{\\times}32 grid (action space). At each time step, the policy samples one cell out of 640 grid cells according to the predicted categorical action distribution π(⋅|s)\\pi(\\cdot|s). For the selected grid cell, we set the predicted fixation to be the center of the cell. Auxiliary detection task.  A visual search task is essentially a detection task, so it is important for the state representation to capture features of the target object. Moreover, in target-absent search where the target object is absent, human behavior is driven by the expected location of the target in relation to other commonly co-occurring objects. In contrast to  which directly uses the output of a pretrained panoptic segmentation network, we train the Q-function with an auxiliary task of predicting the center maps of the objects. Specifically, we add a detection network module on top of FFMs. This module outputs 80 heatmaps Y^^𝑌\\hat{Y} for the 80 object categories in the COCO dataset . Let Y^x​y​csubscript^𝑌𝑥𝑦𝑐\\hat{Y}_{xyc} denote the value of the c𝑐c-th heatmap at location (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y). Following CenterNet , we use pixel-wise focal loss  as an additional loss to train the whole network: where Y𝑌Y is the ground-truth heatmap created by an object size dependent Gaussian kernel . We set κ=2𝜅2\\kappa=2 and λ=4𝜆4\\lambda=4 as in .\nNote that we do not predict the exact heights and widths of the objects in the image because we think rough estimates of the locations of different objects are sufficient to help predict the target-absent fixations. We learn the Q-function using both the IRL loss and the auxiliary detection loss: where ω𝜔\\omega is a weight to balance the two loss terms. Termination Prediction.\n\nWhen a person will stop searching is a question intrinsic to target-absent search. Different from , which formulates termination as an extra action to fixation prediction in policy learning, we treat termination prediction as an additional task that occurs every step after a new fixation has been made. We found that if we treat termination as an extra action, the policy would overfit to the termination action as it appears much more frequent than other actions. To this end, we train a binary classifier on top of the Q-function (see Sec. 3.2) for termination prediction using binary cross entropy loss. We weigh the loss computed on the termination and non-termination actions inversely proportionally to their frequencies. In addition, psychology studies   have suggested that time could be an important ingredient in predicting stopping. However, we do not predict the duration of fixations in our model. Instead, we use the number of previous fixations as an approximation of time and concatenate it with the Q-values from the Q-function as input to train the termination classifier.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: behavior using the IRL framework .
