      "content": "Paper Title: Active Learning Polynomial Threshold Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile to our knowledge active learning polynomial threshold functions has not been studied in the literature, the closely related problem of learning halfspaces is perhaps one of the best-studied problems in the field, and indeed in learning theory in general. It has long been known that halfspaces cannot be active learned in the standard model [ref]2, but several series of works have gotten around this fact either by restricting the adversary, or empowering the learner. The first of these two methods generally involves forcing the learner to choose a nice marginal distribution over the data, e.g. over the unit sphere , unit ball , log-concave , or more generally s𝑠s-concave distributions . The second approach usually involves allowing the learner to ask some type of additional questions. This encompasses not only KLMZ’s  notion of enriched queries, but also the original “Membership query” model of Angluin  who allowed the learner to query any point in the overall instance space X𝑋X rather than just on the subsample S⊂X𝑆𝑋S\\subset X. This model is also particularly well-studied for halfspaces where it is called the point-location problem     [ref]7 , and was actually studied originally by Meyer auf der Heide  in the perfect learning model even before Angluin’s introduction of active learning. Bounded degree PTFs may be viewed as a special set of halfspaces via the natural embedding to {1,x,x2,…}1𝑥superscript𝑥2…\\{1,x,x^{2},\\ldots\\}. Given this fact, it is reasonable to ask why our work is not superseded by these prior methods for learning halfspaces. The answer lies in the fact that the query types used in these works are generally very complicated and require infinite precision. For instance, many use arbitrary membership queries (which are known to behave poorly in practice ), and even those that sacrifice on query complexity for simpler queries still require arbitrary precision (e.g. the “generalized comparisons” of [ref]8). Indeed, learning halfspaces even in three dimensions with a simple query set remains an interesting open problem, and our work can be viewed as partial progress in this direction for sets of points that lie on an embedded low-degree univariate polynomial. For instance, one could learn the set S={(x,3​x5,5​x7):x∈[n]}⊂ℝ3𝑆conditional-set𝑥3superscript𝑥55superscript𝑥7𝑥delimited-[]𝑛superscriptℝ3S=\\{(x,3x^{5},5x^{7}):x\\in[n]\\}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{3} with respect to any underlying halfspace sign​(⟨v,⋅⟩+b)sign𝑣⋅𝑏\\text{sign}(\\langle v,\\cdot\\rangle+b) in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) queries using access to standard labels and the derivatives of the underlying polynomial. Our work also fits into a long line of recent studies on learning with enriched queries in theory and in practice. As previously mentioned, Angluin’s  original membership query model can in a sense be viewed as the seminal work in this direction, and many types of problem-specific enriched queries such as comparisons      [ref]8 [ref]7    0, cluster-queries 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, mistake queries 0, separation queries 1, and more have been studied since. Along with providing exponential improvements in query complexity in theory, many of these query types have also found use in practice   2 3 . Indeed even complicated queries such as Angluin’s original model that cannot be accurately assessed by humans  have found significant use in application to automated experimental design, where the relevant oracle is given by precise scientific measurements rather than a human (see e.g. the seminal work of King et al. “The Automation of Science” 3). While we view first or second order derivatives as reasonable query types for human experts, higher order derivatives are likely more useful in this latter setting, e.g. in application to dynamical systems where one tracks object movement with physical sensors. The average-case model we study in this work is the ‘perfect’ or ‘zero-error’ variant of the average-case active learning model introduced by Dasgupta [ref]2 (and implicitly in earlier work of Kosaraju, Przytycka, and Borgstrom 4). These works gave a generic greedy algorithm for active learning finite concept classes (X,H)𝑋𝐻(X,H) over arbitrary prior distributions whose query complexity is optimal to within a factor of O​(log⁡(|H|))𝑂𝐻O(\\log(|H|)). The exact constants of this approximation were later optimized in the literature on submodular optimization 5, and more recently extended to the batch setting 6. These works differ substantially from our setting as they focus on giving a generic algorithm for average-case active learning, rather than giving query complexity bounds for any specific class. Perhaps more similar to our general approach are active learning methods based on Hanneke’s disagreement coefficient 7, and Balcan, Hanneke, and Wortman’s 8 work on active learning rates over fixed instead of worst-case hypotheses. Analysis based on these approaches typically takes advantage of the fact that for a fixed distribution and classifier, the minimum measure of any interval can be considered constant. Our average-case setting can be thought of as a strengthening of this approach in two ways: first we are only promised (weak) concentration bounds on the probability this measure is small, and second we work in the harder perfect learning model. This latter fact is largely what separates our analysis, as naive attempts at combining prior techniques with concentration lead to ‘imperfect’ algorithms (ones with a small probability of error). Moving from the low-error to zero-error regime is in general a difficult problem,333While the low-error (active) and zero-error (perfect) models are equivalent in the worst-case setting , it is not clear whether this is true in average-case settings. but is important in high-risk applications like medical diagnoses.444We note that in this setting, the more natural model is Rivest and Sloan’s  Reliable and Probably Useful (RPU) Learning, where the learner can abstain with low probability but may never err. Perfect learning finite samples is essentially equivalent to the RPU model in most settings by standard generalization techniques, including all settings we study. Fixing this issue requires analysis of a new ‘capped’ variant of the coupon collector problem, and proving optimal query bounds requires further involved calculation that would be unnecessary in the low-error active regime.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: halfspaces is perhaps one of the best-studied problems in the field, and indeed in learning theory in general.
