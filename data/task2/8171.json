      "content": "Paper Title: A two-scale computational homogenization approach for elastoplastic truss-based lattice structures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the present work, a two-scale computational homogenization framework with on-the-fly transition of information was adopted to study the elastoplastic behavior of stretching-dominated truss-based metamaterials. Two BVPs were considered at the macroscale and the microscale to represent the overall homogenized structure and the underlying lattice structures, respectively. The macroscopic BVP was solved by the FE method with four-node bi-linear quadrilateral elements, while the microscale lattice structures were discretized by two-node linear displacement truss elements. The transition between the two scales was performed through the Hill-Mandel macrohomogenity condition. The macroscopic strain field was transferred to the microscale, where it was employed to compute the nodal displacements and, consequently, the axial strain of the lattice struts. An elastoplastic material behavior with nonlinear Voce isotropic hardening and linear kinematic hardening was considered for the microscale struts. Following the computation of the unit cell stiffness matrix by employing the return mapping algorithm for each lattice strut, the homogenized stress and tangent stiffness were transferred back to the macroscale. The performance of the homogenization approach was investigated through a number of numerical examples considering three different unit cell topologies, including the triangular, X-braced and XP-braced lattices. The mesh convergence behavior as well as the fulfilment of the principle of scale separation were studied for a double-clamped beam. It was shown that by using a sufficiently large number of lattice structures, the homogenization framework provides force-displacement curves in close agreement with those obtained from full-scale simulations of the discrete structure. In the second numerical example, a square-shaped plate under tensile loading was considered, where it was shown that in addition to the force-displacement curves, the employed homogenization approach can also almost precisely track the displacement of the boundary transverse to the direction of loading. Moreover, the effective Poisson‚Äôs ratios of the studied lattice topologies were computed. It was observed that the X-braced lattice exhibits the highest effective elastic Poisson‚Äôs ratio, while such a value is the lowest for the triangular lattice when loaded in the xùë•x direction. The principle of scale separation was examined for the triangular lattice under yùë¶y-direction loading by considering an equivalent elastoplastic Poisson‚Äôs ratio as the basis for assessment. It was once again shown that as the number of considered unit cells increased, the equivalent elastoplastic Poisson‚Äôs ratio obtained from homogenization was closer to that of DNS. Ultimately, a more complex structure, i.e., a dog-bone specimen with symmetric notches under cyclic loading, was considered as the last numerical study. The homogenization scheme was shown to be able to follow the same force-displacement path as DNS not only when the structure is monotonically loaded but also when it experiences unloading and reverse loading. In general, for all three numerical examples and all three lattice families, it was observed that the accuracy of the homogenization framework is slightly higher in the elastic regime, and as the structure undergoes more plastic deformation, such accuracy is slightly decreased. However, with a sufficient number of unit cells, the adopted homogenization approach provided precise enough solutions in both the elastic and elastoplastic zones. Finally, future studies may proceed by extending the present model to finite deformations and rotations through corotational beam formulations , similar to the approach adopted for elastic   and viscoelastic  truss-based metamaterials. Furthermore, enhancing the model by considering more complicated material behaviors, such as damage, may be of great interest, especially for metallic lattice structures, which experience a mixed elastic-plastic-damage behavior   . In the present work, the geometrical dimensions of the lattice struts were considered in such a way that buckling would not happen within the range of applied loadings. Accounting for such instabilities of lattice struts in combination with plasticity, similar to the approach employed in  for elastic lattices, would be insightful for the precise modeling of truss-based metamaterials. This requires the implementation of a robust solver capable of detecting bifurcation points and switching to the most critical branch to follow the lowest equilibrium path (e.g., see [ref]61  ). Topology optimization in a two-scale computational homogenization framework has already been considered in  for elastic lattice structures. Topology and size optimization studies beyond the proportional limit within the presented two-scale framework would be interesting to perform. In the present work, the number of DoFs was significantly decreased at the microscale by utilizing truss elements instead of discretizing the lattice structures with continuum solid elements. The computational cost of the present two-scale approach can be further decreased by employing reduced integration elements with hourglass stabilization at the macroscale, such as the well-established elements developed in   . Another interesting advancement to further speed up computational time is the possibility of employing machine learning approaches. Among others, the recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [ref]66 [ref]67  have been shown in , specifically for truss structures, to have a speed-up factor one order of magnitude faster than the implicit return mapping algorithm while maintaining accuracy. Replacing the conventional return mapping algorithm employed in the present work with such a machine learning approach can significantly improve the computational time by bypassing the repetitive iterations required to solve the nonlinear elastoplastic equations for each strut.\n\nReference markers found: [61]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]61: metamaterials.
