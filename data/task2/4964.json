      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Correlated Sequential Rules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAwide variety of devices generate massive amounts of data, precipitating the arrival of the data age. Data mining has become a popular research area because it uncovers useful and valid information in vast amounts of data, promoting economic and social progress  . Initially, researchers considered that items in transaction databases either existed or did not, and that the extracted patterns occurred frequently, which is called frequent pattern mining (FPM)  . The FPM assumes that all items in a transaction occur simultaneously, but in reality, items occur in a specific order. A sequential pattern is a collection of items with a time dimension, and sequential pattern mining (SPM) is the process of discovering critical information derived from sequential databases  [ref]6  . SPM is expected to find sequential patterns that satisfy the support requirements. Its application involves a host of aspects, such as web logs and market analysis. Agrawal and Srikant  first introduced the problem of SPM in the early 1990s. However, even though some frequently occurring sequential patterns are known, there is insufficient evidence to make predictions regarding the events. For example, suppose there is a frequent sequential pattern a‚Äãbùëéùëèab in which aùëéa may occur before or after bùëèb, it is unwise to apply this pattern to predict whether aùëéa occurs and bùëèb follows. In terms of chronological properties and prediction of events, sequential rule mining (SRM) 0 1 outperforms SPM. A sequential rule states that if some items occur as antecedents, some non-overlapping items may appear later as consequent with a given degree of confidence. The task of mining rules aims to predict patterns or events that have not yet occurred. We can predict the likelihood or relevance of a pattern in the future based on the existence of a pattern. Several algorithms have been proposed for SRM. Some of them discover rules from a single sequence, and others find rules from multiple sequences. Some of the sequential rules, both the antecedent and the consequent, are sequential patterns, while the others are composed of two unordered collections of items. Mannila et al. 2 discovered frequent events partially ordered in a sequence. Hamilton et al. 3 presented a temporal investigation method for registered record sequences. Harms et al. 4 proposed the MOWCATL algorithm to find rules whose support and confidence are both greater than the corresponding thresholds. In this study, we only consider SRM from a few sequences and partially disordered items. In terms of FPM, it removes the limitations that items in a transaction may appear more than once and that the weight or profit of items varies in real life 5. Therefore, FPM leads to the discovery of frequent patterns, but the profits obtained are not satisfactory, particularly for dissatisfied retailers or manufacturers. To address these issues, high-utility pattern mining (HUPM) 6 was developed, which considers not only the number of patterns but also their unit profit. In general, HUPM can be divided into two categories: two-phase and one-phase algorithms, where the former generates many candidates, but the latter does not. Some representative two-phase algorithms include Two-Phase 7, UP-Growth 8, and UP-Growth+ 9. Representative one-phase algorithms include HUI-Miner 0 and FHM 1. High-utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM) is derived by extending HUPM to the temporal aspect 2 3. Yin et al. 2 developed a generic framework and proposed an efficient algorithm called USpan. They designed a lexicographic quantitative sequence tree for searching full high-utility sequential patterns (HUSPs). To cope with the requirements of prediction with utility, HUSRM 4 was developed. HUSRM 4 is a one-phase algorithm that depends on the utility-table structure. Additionally, several optimization strategies have been employed to improve the performance of the algorithm. However, because these rules are constrained only by utility and confidence, the items in those are uncorrelated, which may lead to decision-making errors 5 6. For example, the existing algorithm reveals that the rule of first selling a TV and bread together in a sequential database, followed by apples and sofas being sold together with a certain degree of confidence, is a HUSR. It is clear that the items in the antecedent and the consequent of the rule are hardly correlated, and the rule‚Äôs antecedent and consequent are also weakly correlated. To date, several correlated HUPM algorithms have been developed, such as HUIPM 7, FDHUP 8, and CoUPM 5. However, the algorithms for mining no correlated HUSRs (CHUSRs) have been proposed. To deal with the problems mentioned above, we incorporate the concept of correlation to HUSRM. Here are the new ideas and contributions of this study: This study develops an efficient CoUSR algorithm for mining CHUSRs from a given sequence database. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to involve mining correlated utility-based sequential rules. The correlation of rules has two aspects. On the one hand, it is a local correlation that the antecedent or consequent within the rule is constrained by the bond measure. On the other hand, it is a global correlation in which sequential rules are constrained by the lift method. CoUSR is a one-phase algorithm that uses a utility-list structure to maintain data and does not require multiple database scans. Two novel structures called BondMatrix and estimated sequence utility co-occurrence structure (ESUCS) are constructed, and several pruning strategies are designed to assist in pruning those unpromising sequential rules and reduce the search space. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, subsequent experiments measure the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed algorithm under different strategies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents relevant literature on the proposed algorithm. Some preliminaries and problem statements are introduced in Section III. Section IV describes the details of the designed strategies and the proposed algorithm. The experimental comparison is presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes this study and highlights future studies.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: order.
