      "content": "Paper Title: SoK: Software Compartmentalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite decades of effort, vulnerabilities still plague software, and thwarting them remains a game of cat and mouse.\nThe principle of least privilege (PoLP)  is the last line of defense when protections fail or when flaws are unknown.\nBy granting each entity only the privileges needed, the PoLP ensures that a compromise of one part will not imply that of the whole.\nSoftware compartmentalization is a prominent implementation of the\nPoLP, in which developers divide a\nlarge program into smaller, lesser privileged components, to reduce the impact of potential security breaches. Software compartmentalization inherits from a large body of work, starting with processes ; including OS models such as microkernels     , security and separation kernels     , or capability OSes  ; all the way to fine-grain application compartmentalization in the 2000s     following qmail , Postfix , or OpenSSH .\nIts promises are plenty: containing memory safety issues  , untrusted third parties [ref]54 , or unsafe parts of safe languages     , isolating cryptographic secrets    or shadow stacks [ref]74, thwarting supply-chain attacks   and side-channels   , or providing fault resilience  . Despite longstanding recognition within the academic sphere and proven effectiveness in seminal industry projects, the adoption of compartmentalization techniques in mainstream software remains inconsistent: compartmentalizing is still far from being a common engineering practice.\nTake as example the isolation of cryptographic secrets, a practice long advocated by the community   [ref]211            but without viable adoption by leading cryptography libraries.\nAt a time of growing threats, we are missing out on the security benefits compartmentalization can bring.\nThis paper investigates the reasons behind this status quo, and how to improve it. Research speculated that this situation is due to a lack of automation  , limitations of mechanisms  , excessive performance overheads  , a lack of strong security guarantees  , among others.\nAll are likely part of the problem, and through decades of research progress was made on every front.\nToday the community lacks a global overview of this progress.\nDesigning for or retrofitting compartmentalization is often hampered by inconsistencies in the understanding and application of its concepts.\nExisting models and terminologies are numerous, ad-hoc, and often contradictory, leading to confusion and a growing body of work that cannot be compared.\nThe lack of a systematic perspective leads to a mismatch between what software compartmentalization needs to progress towards the mainstream, and the focus and framing of research efforts: most do not tackle compartmentalization’s key aspects as a whole and thus produce solutions that cannot be relevant to making it a mainstream practice. Recognizing these challenges, we propose a unified model providing a consistent framework for defining, understanding, and implementing compartmentalization.\nThis model comes with a comprehensive taxonomy that allows to classify compartmentalization strategies based on their policy definition methods, abstractions, and mechanisms, providing a basis for systematic evaluation and comparison. We validate our model and taxonomy by systematizing 211 research and 61 mainstream software systems implementing compartmentalization.\nDoing so, this study provides unique insights into where mainstream efforts have fallen behind, and which problems research needs to focus on to reach the mainstream.\nWe show how modern production software, if at all compartmentalizing, still vastly relies on manual separation, custom abstractions, and heavyweight legacy\nmechanisms, failing to adapt to the evolving security landscape.\nFor future research, we stress the need for a more holistic approach to compartmentalization, the simplification of policy definition, stronger and more holistic threat models in the light of confused deputies and hardware limitations, as well as more attention to the gaps we highlight between research and production. Overall, this SoK contributes: A fundamental model and conceptual framework for compartmentalization (§2). A taxonomy for evaluating compartmentalization approaches and its systematic application to a wide set of research (§3) and mainstream (§4) efforts. Insights throughout §2, §3 and §4 and their consolidation into high-level challenges (§5) that compartmentalization research should focus on to foster mainstream adoption.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: the way to fine-grain application compartmentalization in the 2000s     following qmail , Postfix , or OpenSSH .\nIts promises are plenty: containing memory safety issues  , untrusted third parties [ref]54 , or unsafe parts of safe languages     , isolating cryptographic secrets    or shadow stacks [ref]74, thwarting supply-chain attacks   and side-channels   , or providing fault resilience  .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
