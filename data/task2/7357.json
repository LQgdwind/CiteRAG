      "content": "Paper Title: The Maude strategy language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRewriting logic specifications describe computational systems as collections of rewriting rules that are applied to the terms of an equational specification. A great generality is achieved by allowing the rules not to be confluent or terminating. However, and specially when the specifications become executable, it may be convenient to control this non-determinism in order to avoid undesired evolutions. This control is realized by strategies, whose need has been identified since the first developments of rewriting logic and its implementations¬†. Maude¬† is a specification language based on rewriting logic as well as an interpreter with several formal analysis features and a formal tool environment  that allows executing, verifying, and analyzing the specified systems. The non-deterministic rewriting process can be explored in different ways in Maude. In some cases, it is enough to see where a single path of exhaustive rewriting leads to, and this is possible with the rewrite and frewrite commands that select the next rewrite by some fixed criteria ensuring some fairness properties of the chosen path. Sometimes, all possible execution paths need to be explored using the search command; for example, to search for a violation of an invariant. However, to observe paths satisfying some user-chosen restrictions, strategies are required. Due to the reflective properties of rewriting logic, and using some Maude metalevel functions that reproduce the rule application operations, strategies have been traditionally expressed as metacomputations inside the logic¬†[ref]18. This mechanism is complete and powerful, but it is sometimes cumbersome for users that are not familiar with the metalevel, because of its conceptual complexity and the verbosity of its notation.\nHence, following the influence of previous implementations of strategic rewriting such as ELAN¬†, Stratego¬† and TOM¬†, a simple but expressive object-level strategy language has been proposed for Maude. Its design is based on the previous Maude experience with strategies at the metalevel and on its predecessors, but it deviates from the treatment of strategies in ELAN in a remarkable aspect. In ELAN, rules and strategies are tightly coupled and strategies can be used in the definition of rules. The Maude language advocates a clear separation between them, making strategies a separate layer above rules. This is enforced and emphasized by banning strategies from system modules, i.e., from rewrite theory specifications. Instead, different kinds of strategies can be specified separately for the same system module in different strategy modules, so that the same rewrite rules can be controlled with different strategies by means of the chosen strategy module. Of course, for simplicity and ease of use, each strategy language design favors some features and may not directly support others.\nNevertheless, besides the fact that Maude‚Äôs strategy language supports user-definable recursive strategies, which may be used to specify various additional features, Maude itself, including its strategy language, is user-extensible thanks to its reflective nature, supported by Maude‚Äôs META-LEVEL module, so that new features can be added by reflective extension. Strategies are a useful specification and execution tool¬†. Its origins date back to combinatory logic and the ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculus, where choosing the next reduction position by a fixed structural criterion ensures finding a normal form in case it exists. In this vein, strategies can be used to make systems confluent or terminating by imposing additional restrictions. Moreover, they can provide specifications with a notion of global control over the eminently local meaning of rules in various ways: as simple as choosing a rule precedence, or arbitrarily complex by depending on the execution history. The Rule + Strategies approach¬† , as an evolution of the Kowalski‚Äôs motto Algorithm = Logic + Control¬†, can be exploited to build specifications with a clear separation of concerns. Typically, it is easier to prove that the logical part given by rules ensures correct deductions or computations, while leaving to the strategies the responsibilities on efficiency and goal directedness (as shown in Section¬†4.4). In some other cases, strategies are actually needed to ensure that the system behaves as intended. In addition, strategies can be used to analyze plain rewriting logic specifications too, by the observation of selected rewriting evolutions. Many examples from different fields have already been specified using the Maude strategy language: it has been applied to express deduction procedures as strategies controlling a declarative inference system¬† , to specify aspects of the semantics of programming languages¬† , of the ambient calculus¬†, Milner‚Äôs CCS¬†, process scheduling policies¬†,111Process scheduling policies, implemented by operating systems to distribute the processor time among multiple simultaneous processes, are an archetypical example of strategies programmed in real software using standard programming languages. Specifying these strategies at a higher level in Maude can be useful for better reasoning about them. membrane systems¬† , etc. The first prototype of the strategy language was written at the metalevel as an extension of Full Maude¬†. Now, the complete language is available and efficiently supported at the Maude interpreter level, implemented in C++, from its version 3.0 onwards¬† . The most recent version of Maude can be downloaded from maude.cs.illinois.edu, and the examples described in this article and many more are available at maude.ucm.es/strategies and github.com/fadoss/strat-examples. This article extends, updates, and integrates the information already presented in some workshop and conference talks¬†   9 , and a PhD thesis¬†6. For the first time, this article describes strategy modules and the meta-representation of the strategy language, and provides a complete and formal denotational semantics of the language with strategy calls. More details are given on the strategy language constructors, and design and implementation decisions are discussed. New and significantly improved examples are included, as well as a comparison with the similar strategy languages of ELAN, Stratego, TOM, and œÅLog.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: of rewriting logic, and using some Maude metalevel functions that reproduce the rule application operations, strategies have been traditionally expressed as metacomputations inside the logic¬†[ref]18.
