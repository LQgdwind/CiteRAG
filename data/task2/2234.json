Sections 3 and 4\nwill work with\nfinite state and action spaces 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} and 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, but our algorithms and experiments later in the\npaper use continuous environments. ΠΠ\\Pi is the set of all stationary stochastic\npolicies that take actions in 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} given states in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}.\nWe work in the γ𝛾\\gamma-discounted infinite horizon setting, and we will use an expectation with respect to a policy π∈Π𝜋Π\\pi\\in\\Pi to denote an expectation with respect to the trajectory it generates:\n𝔼π​[r​(s,a)]≜𝔼​[∑t=0∞γt​r​(st,at)]≜subscript𝔼𝜋delimited-[]𝑟𝑠𝑎𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑡0superscript𝛾𝑡𝑟subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[r(s,a)]\\triangleq\\mathbb{E}[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{t}r(s_{t},a_{t})], where s0∼p0similar-tosubscript𝑠0subscript𝑝0s_{0}\\sim p_{0}, at∼π(⋅|st)a_{t}\\sim\\pi(\\cdot|s_{t}), and st+1∼𝒫(⋅|st,at)s_{t+1}\\sim\\mathcal{P}(\\cdot|s_{t},a_{t}) for t≥0𝑡0t\\geq 0.

For a reward r∈ℛ𝑟ℛr\\in\\mathcal{R} and π∈Π𝜋Π\\pi\\in\\Pi, the soft Bellman operator\nℬrπ:ℝ𝒮×𝒜→ℝ𝒮×𝒜:subscriptsuperscriptℬ𝜋𝑟→superscriptℝ𝒮𝒜superscriptℝ𝒮𝒜\\mathcal{B}^{\\pi}_{r}:\\mathbb{R^{\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}}}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R^{\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}}} is defined as\n(ℬrπ​Q)​(s,a)=r​(s,a)+γ​𝔼s′∼𝒫​(s,a)​Vπ​(s′)subscriptsuperscriptℬ𝜋𝑟𝑄𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑎𝛾subscript𝔼similar-tosuperscript𝑠′𝒫𝑠𝑎superscript𝑉𝜋superscript𝑠′(\\mathcal{B}^{\\pi}_{r}Q)(s,a)=r(s,a)+\\gamma\\mathbb{E}_{s^{\\prime}\\sim\\mathcal{P}(s,a)}V^{\\pi}(s^{\\prime})\nwith Vπ​(s)=𝔼a∼π(⋅|s)​[Q​(s,a)−log⁡π​(a|s)]V^{\\pi}(s)=\\mathbb{E}_{a\\sim\\pi(\\cdot|s)}\\left[Q(s,a)-\\log\\pi(a|s)\\right].

For a given reward function r∈ℛ𝑟ℛr\\in\\mathcal{R}, maximum entropy RL  [ref]5 aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward along with the entropy in each state: maxπ∈Π⁡𝔼ρπ​[r​(s,a)]+H​(π)subscript𝜋Πsubscript𝔼subscript𝜌𝜋delimited-[]𝑟𝑠𝑎𝐻𝜋\\max_{\\pi\\in\\Pi}\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{\\pi}}[r(s,a)]+H(\\pi), where H​(π)≜𝔼ρπ​[−log⁡π​(a|s)]≜𝐻𝜋subscript𝔼subscript𝜌𝜋delimited-[]𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠H(\\pi)\\triangleq\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{\\pi}}[-\\log\\pi(a|s)] is the discounted causal entropy of the policy π𝜋\\pi.\nThe optimal policy satisfies  [ref]5: where Zssubscript𝑍𝑠Z_{s} is the normalization factor given as ∑a′exp⁡(Q∗​(s,a′))subscriptsuperscript𝑎′superscript𝑄𝑠superscript𝑎′\\sum_{a^{\\prime}}\\exp\\left(Q^{*}\\left(s,a^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) and Q∗superscript𝑄Q^{*} is the optimal soft Q𝑄Q-function. Q∗superscript𝑄Q^{*} satisfies the soft-Bellman equation: In continuous action spaces, Zssubscript𝑍𝑠Z_{s} becomes computationally intractable\nand soft actor-critic methods like SAC [ref]13 can be used to learn an explicit policy. Given demonstrations sampled using the policy πEsubscript𝜋𝐸\\pi_{E}, maximum entropy Inverse RL aims to recover the reward function in a family of functions ℛ⊂ℝ𝒮×𝒜ℛsuperscriptℝ𝒮𝒜\\mathcal{R}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}} that rationalizes the expert behavior by solving the optimization problem: maxr∈ℛ⁡minπ∈Π⁡𝔼ρE​[r​(s,a)]−(𝔼ρπ​[r​(s,a)]+H​(π))subscript𝑟ℛsubscript𝜋Πsubscript𝔼subscript𝜌𝐸delimited-[]𝑟𝑠𝑎subscript𝔼subscript𝜌𝜋delimited-[]𝑟𝑠𝑎𝐻𝜋\\max_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}\\min_{\\pi\\in\\Pi}\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{E}}[r(s,a)]-\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{\\pi}}[r(s,a)]+H(\\pi)\\right), where the expected reward of πEsubscript𝜋𝐸\\pi_{E} is empirically approximated using a dataset 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}.\nIt looks for a reward function that assigns high reward to the expert policy and low reward to other ones, while searching for the best policy for the reward function in an inner loop.
