      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion model for relational inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBackground\nMachine learning-based approaches have demonstrated considerable success in computational tasks such as time series forecasting, classification, and imputation, as evidenced by a growing body of research    [ref]3 [ref]4 . Despite these rapid-pace advancements, the crucial task of inferring relations between components in interacting systems from observable temporal behavior of their states is still challenging. Unearthing the underlying mechanisms of interacting systems is frequently of greater significance than simply predicting system behavior under known interaction information. In fact, inferring relations between multiple or multivariate time series offers a useful step for comprehending the whole system dynamics resulting from interacting dynamical components. For instance, neuroscientists strive to discern relations between neural signals to elucidate functional connectivity amongst various ROIs (Region of Interests) of the brain   . Similarly, financial analysts employ causal inference methodologies to uncover cause-and-effect connections within financial time series data  0. In this way, relational inference from observed dynamics is a pervasive and fundamental challenge that spans many disciplines. In the machine learning community, there has been a concerted effort to devise advanced techniques for relational inference from observable time series data. A pioneering contribution in this field is the Neural Relational Inference (NRI) model, introduced by Kipf et al., which integrates a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) with Graph Neural Network (GNN) operations to construct neural representations 1. NRI is designed to infer interactions of entities (or components) in an encoder part while simultaneously learning their dynamics for forecasting future states in a decoder part. Building upon this foundational framework, variants of the NRI model have emerged, including Dynamic NRI 2, NRI-MPM 3, and ACD 4, each aiming to refine and improve the capabilities of the original method. More recent developments include a relational inference model proposed by Wang et al., which employs reservoir networks for computationally efficient relational inference 5. Nevertheless, most relational inference models developed so far are based on a VAE and trained in the framework of time series prediction. Recently, a family of diffusion models (or score-based generative models) 6 7 8 following the original one 9 have shown excellent performance in various tasks, ranging from multimodal information processing 0 1 to tabular data imputation 2 3. Successful applications in practice suggest that the diffusion model can accurately estimate high-dimensional data distribution through score matching 4. On the theoretical side, Oko et al. showed that under certain assumptions, compared with the true distribution, the generated data distribution achieves the nearly minimax optimal estimation rates in the total variation distance and in the Wasserstein distance of order one 5. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has applied a diffusion model to relational inference for interacting systems. Motivations The powerful computational ability of the diffusion models inspired us to evaluate its potential in relational inference tasks. What if the prediction-based VAE framework (as developed in the seminal NRI work 1) is not the only neural network-based approach for relational inference? Our study explores the possibility of using the diffusion-generative approach for relational inference from time series data for the first time. Diffusion-based models can outperform VAE-based models in various time series data processing. Experimental results in time series imputation tasks show that diffusion-based imputation models perform better than VAE-based models 6 7. Regarding time series forecasting tasks, the diffusion-based TimeGrad model performs best for 5 out of 6 datasets compared to VAE, Gaussian process, and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)-based methods 8. The motivation led us to propose a novel time series generative model: a Diffusion model for Relational Inference (DiffRI). Specifically, we designed a diffusion-based model that combines self-supervised time series imputation with relational learning.\nDiffRI is constructed on the basis of a conditional time series diffusion model 6 that separates observed multivariate time series into an imputation target time series and the other conditional time series. We let the model select informative time series from the conditional part and perturb non-informative parts. Different from prediction-based models like NRI, DiffRI is trained to impute masked parts in the target time series. If the model is properly designed and optimized, the perturbation should not negatively affect imputation. The selected time series are regarded to be interacting with the target time series. Meanwhile, the perturbed parts are regarded as not interacting with the target feature. The target time series is randomly sampled in each iteration so that DiffRI can learn to infer whole relations between all time series. Our main contributions are as follows: To our knowledge, DiffRI is the first model that attempts neural networks-based relational inference through diffusion generative modeling. We demonstrate the potential of diffusion models in relational inference tasks, leading to a better understanding and modeling of interacting systems ubiquitous in nature. The proposed method can infer relations within a set of multiple time series data with high accuracy across different interaction mechanisms. Moreover, DiffRI does not need additional data augmentation to achieve good results. The proposed method can correctly identify relations in a quasi-real neural signal dataset with realistic settings without any regularization techniques. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec 2, we mention related works on relational inference. In Sec 3, we give a formulation of the relational inference problem. In Sec 4, we explain our methodology utilizing diffusion models. In Sec 5, we show experimental results on the performance of the proposed model while comparing with several baseline models.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: learning-based approaches have demonstrated considerable success in computational tasks such as time series forecasting, classification, and imputation, as evidenced by a growing body of research    [ref]3 [ref]4 .
