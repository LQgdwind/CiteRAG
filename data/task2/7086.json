See 26 We first prove the following technical lemma.181818A variant of this lemma\nexists implicitly within [KKMO07], in the proof of [KKMO07, Proposition\n12], but this assumes that FTsubscript𝐹𝑇F_{T} is convex on an interval of the form (0,c)0𝑐(0,c) where c𝑐c does not depend on T𝑇T. This seems to not be the case, so we give a different proof here. The proof in [GS13] claims their bound follows precisely as in [KKMO07], so it also implicitly makes this claim about FTsubscript𝐹𝑇F_{T} Let FT​(x)=x2​(1+T​ln⁡x)subscript𝐹𝑇𝑥superscript𝑥21𝑇𝑥F_{T}(x)=x^{2}(1+T\\ln x), where FT​(0)=0subscript𝐹𝑇00F_{T}(0)=0. Fix ℓℓ\\ell and take some T>0𝑇0T>0 smaller than an absolute constant, such that ℓ<e1/Tℓsuperscript𝑒1𝑇\\ell<e^{1/T}. Suppose x1+⋯+xℓ=1subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥ℓ1x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{\\ell}=1, xi≥0subscript𝑥𝑖0x_{i}\\geq 0. Then, ∑i=1ℓFT​(x)≥1/ℓ−T​ln⁡ℓ/ℓ−4​ℓ​e−1/Tsuperscriptsubscript𝑖1ℓsubscript𝐹𝑇𝑥1ℓ𝑇ℓℓ4ℓsuperscript𝑒1𝑇\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell}F_{T}(x)\\geq 1/\\ell-T\\ln\\ell/\\ell-4\\ell e^{-1/T}. Note that FT′​(x)=2​T​x​ln⁡x+T​x+2​xsuperscriptsubscript𝐹𝑇′𝑥2𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑇𝑥2𝑥F_{T}^{\\prime}(x)=2Tx\\ln x+Tx+2x and FT′′​(x)=2​T​ln⁡(x)+3​T+2superscriptsubscript𝐹𝑇′′𝑥2𝑇𝑥3𝑇2F_{T}^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=2T\\ln(x)+3T+2. The second derivative is negative for x<e−1/T−3/2𝑥superscript𝑒1𝑇32x<e^{-1/T-3/2}, positive for x>e−1/T−3/2𝑥superscript𝑒1𝑇32x>e^{-1/T-3/2} and zero for x=e−1/T−3/2𝑥superscript𝑒1𝑇32x=e^{-1/T-3/2}. The first derivative is zero at e−1/T−1/2superscript𝑒1𝑇12e^{-1/T-1/2}, negative for smaller x≥0𝑥0x\\geq 0, and positive for greater x𝑥x.\nHence the function decreases below e−1/T−1/2superscript𝑒1𝑇12e^{-1/T-1/2}, then increases above it, and is convex whenever x>e−1/T−3/2𝑥superscript𝑒1𝑇32x>e^{-1/T-3/2}. These functions can be seen for T=10𝑇10T=10 in Figure 2. We wish first to prove that the function is Lipschitz continuous on   . Observe that the derivative is minimised at e−1/T−3/2superscript𝑒1𝑇32e^{-1/T-3/2}, and is maximised at 111. At e−1/T−3/2superscript𝑒1𝑇32e^{-1/T-3/2} the derivative is which for small T𝑇T is at least −11-1; furthermore at 1 the derivative is just T+2𝑇2T+2, which for small T𝑇T is at most 333. So we find that FTsubscript𝐹𝑇F_{T} is Lipschitz continuous with constant 3 for all small enough T𝑇T. Split [ℓ]delimited-[]ℓ[\\ell] into two sets A,B𝐴𝐵A,B:\nlet i∈A𝑖𝐴i\\in A if xi>e−1/T−3/2subscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑒1𝑇32x_{i}>e^{-1/T-3/2}, and let i∈B𝑖𝐵i\\in B otherwise. Since ℓ​e−1/T−3/2<1ℓsuperscript𝑒1𝑇321\\ell e^{-1/T-3/2}<1, we have that |A|≥1𝐴1|A|\\geq 1. Now consider two cases. Observe that ∑i∈Axi=1−∑i∈Bxisubscript𝑖𝐴subscript𝑥𝑖1subscript𝑖𝐵subscript𝑥𝑖\\sum_{i\\in A}x_{i}=1-\\sum_{i\\in B}x_{i}. Note that since FTsubscript𝐹𝑇F_{T} is convex above e−1/T−3/2superscript𝑒1𝑇32e^{-1/T-3/2}, the minimum value of ∑i∈AFT​(xi)subscript𝑖𝐴subscript𝐹𝑇subscript𝑥𝑖\\sum_{i\\in A}F_{T}(x_{i}) when ∑i∈Axisubscript𝑖𝐴subscript𝑥𝑖\\sum_{i\\in A}x_{i} is fixed is attained when all xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} for i∈A𝑖𝐴i\\in A are equal. Hence by Lipschitz continuity, and since xi≤e−1/T−3/2subscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑒1𝑇32x_{i}\\leq e^{-1/T-3/2} when i∈B𝑖𝐵i\\in B. Observe that this quantity is just Now consider the function The first derivative of this is For a≤ℓ≤e1/T𝑎ℓsuperscript𝑒1𝑇a\\leq\\ell\\leq e^{1/T}, we have that this derivative is negative. Thus the function is minimised when a𝑎a is as large as possible i.e. |A|=ℓ𝐴ℓ|A|=\\ell. Hence, we find that. For xi≤e−1/T−3/2subscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑒1𝑇32x_{i}\\leq e^{-1/T-3/2} we have that that FT​(xi)subscript𝐹𝑇subscript𝑥𝑖F_{T}(x_{i}) is decreasing, with its minimum at e−1/T−3/2superscript𝑒1𝑇32e^{-1/T-3/2}. Note that this minimum is for small enough T>0𝑇0T>0. Hence, summing over B𝐵B, we find that Thus we conclude that The proof of Proposition 26 given below follows the proof of [KKMO07, Proposition 12] and of [GS13, Propositoin 3.21]. We also use the following notation from [KKMO07]: let [x]+=max⁡(x,0)superscriptdelimited-[]𝑥𝑥0{[x]}^{+}=\\max(x,0). Observe that, as in the proof of Proposition 10, we need only prove this result for large enough k𝑘k. Thus assume k𝑘k is large. Fix τ,d𝜏𝑑\\tau,d to be those numbers given by Theorem 37 for k,ρ=c/(k−1),ε=1/ℓ3formulae-sequence𝑘𝜌𝑐𝑘1𝜀1superscriptℓ3k,\\rho=c/(k-1),\\varepsilon=1/\\ell^{3}. We will actually prove that for some absolute constants C,D>0𝐶𝐷0C,D>0.\nSince ℓ≤M​(k)=o​(ek3)ℓ𝑀𝑘𝑜superscript𝑒3𝑘\\ell\\leq M(k)=o(e^{\\sqrt[ref]3{k}}), 2​c​ln⁡ℓ/(k−1)​ℓ=2​c​ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ+2​c​ln⁡ℓ/k​(k−1)​ℓ=2​c​ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ+o​(ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ)2𝑐ℓ𝑘1ℓ2𝑐ℓ𝑘ℓ2𝑐ℓ𝑘𝑘1ℓ2𝑐ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ2c\\ln\\ell/(k-1)\\ell=2c\\ln\\ell/k\\ell+2c\\ln\\ell/k(k-1)\\ell=2c\\ln\\ell/k\\ell+o(\\ln\\ell/k\\ell), and also 1/ℓ2≤1/k​ℓ=o​(ln⁡ℓ/k​ℓ)1superscriptℓ21𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ1/\\ell^{2}\\leq 1/k\\ell=o(\\ln\\ell/k\\ell), our conclusion that follows immediately. Define f1,…,fℓ:[k]r→Δℓ:superscript𝑓1…superscript𝑓ℓ→superscriptdelimited-[]𝑘𝑟subscriptΔℓf^{1},\\ldots,f^{\\ell}:{[k]}^{r}\\to\\Delta_{\\ell} by f​(𝐱)=(f1​(𝐱),…,fℓ​(𝐱))𝑓𝐱superscript𝑓1𝐱…superscript𝑓ℓ𝐱f(\\mathbf{x})=(f^{1}(\\mathbf{x}),\\ldots,f^{\\ell}(\\mathbf{x})), and define μi=𝔼𝐱[fi​(𝐱)]subscript𝜇𝑖subscript𝔼𝐱superscript𝑓𝑖𝐱\\mu_{i}=\\operatorname*{\\mathbb{E}}_{\\mathbf{x}}[f^{i}(\\mathbf{x})]. Since ∑ifi​(𝐱)=1subscript𝑖superscript𝑓𝑖𝐱1\\sum_{i}f^{i}(\\mathbf{x})=1, by linearity we have that ∑iμi=1subscript𝑖subscript𝜇𝑖1\\sum_{i}\\mu_{i}=1.\nBy Lemma 38, Furthermore, since the codomain of fisuperscript𝑓𝑖f^{i} contains only nonnegative numbers we have that ⟨fi,T⊗r​fi⟩≥0superscript𝑓𝑖superscript𝑇tensor-productabsent𝑟superscript𝑓𝑖0\\langle f^{i},T^{\\otimes r}f^{i}\\rangle\\geq 0. Hence and summing over ℓℓ\\ell, we have Our goal will now be to prove the inequality for some absolute constants C,D>0𝐶𝐷0C,D>0. We take the convention that μi2​ln⁡(1/μi)=0superscriptsubscript𝜇𝑖21subscript𝜇𝑖0\\mu_{i}^{2}\\ln(1/\\mu_{i})=0 when μi=0subscript𝜇𝑖0\\mu_{i}=0. We now split the integers [ℓ]delimited-[]ℓ[\\ell] into two sets A,B𝐴𝐵A,B.\nLet i∈A𝑖𝐴i\\in A if c/(k−1)≤1/ln3⁡(1/μi)𝑐𝑘11superscript31subscript𝜇𝑖c/(k-1)\\leq 1/\\ln^{3}(1/\\mu_{i}) i.e. e−(k−1)/c3≤μisuperscript𝑒3𝑘1𝑐subscript𝜇𝑖e^{-\\sqrt[ref]3{(k-1)/c}}\\leq\\mu_{i}, and let i∈B𝑖𝐵i\\in B otherwise. We will prove (12) first on A𝐴A, then on B𝐵B, then sum. We will fix C𝐶C when looking at A𝐴A, then fix D𝐷D depending on C𝐶C when looking at B𝐵B. We wish to prove that for some value of C𝐶C that does not depend on c,μi,k𝑐subscript𝜇𝑖𝑘c,\\mu_{i},k.\nFirst, by Theorem 37 with ε=1/ℓ3𝜀1superscriptℓ3\\varepsilon=1/\\ell^{3}, we find that If any μi=1subscript𝜇𝑖1\\mu_{i}=1, then the bound we want holds immediately (for large enough k𝑘k), as then Λc/(k−1)​(μi)=1subscriptΛ𝑐𝑘1subscript𝜇𝑖1\\Lambda_{c/(k-1)}(\\mu_{i})=1, and all other μj=0subscript𝜇𝑗0\\mu_{j}=0. Thus suppose μi<1subscript𝜇𝑖1\\mu_{i}<1. Note that by Proposition 40, each term for i∈A𝑖𝐴i\\in A within the sum from the right-hand side of (11) contributes (for large k𝑘k) at least μi2−3​c/(k−1)−1/ℓ3superscriptsubscript𝜇𝑖23𝑐𝑘11superscriptℓ3\\mu_{i}^{2}-3c/(k-1)-1/\\ell^{3} to the sum. If there exists some μi>(1/k)1/10subscript𝜇𝑖superscript1𝑘110\\mu_{i}>(1/k)^{1/10}, say, then these values are large enough (for large k𝑘k) to make (10) hold automatically (since for large enough k𝑘k we have that (1/k)1/5superscript1𝑘15(1/k)^{1/5} is larger than O​(1/k)𝑂1𝑘O(1/k)). Thus we can assume that μi≤(1/k)1/10subscript𝜇𝑖superscript1𝑘110\\mu_{i}\\leq(1/k)^{1/10} for all i∈A𝑖𝐴i\\in A i.e. all μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i} are small for i∈A𝑖𝐴i\\in A. Since c/(k−1)≤1/ln3⁡(1/μi)𝑐𝑘11superscript31subscript𝜇𝑖c/(k-1)\\leq 1/\\ln^{3}(1/\\mu_{i}) and all μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i} are small when i∈A𝑖𝐴i\\in A, we apply Theorem 39 to find that We observe that as e−(k−1)/c3≤μi≤(1/k)1/10superscript𝑒3𝑘1𝑐subscript𝜇𝑖superscript1𝑘110e^{-\\sqrt[ref]3{(k-1)/c}}\\leq\\mu_{i}\\leq(1/k)^{1/10} for i∈A𝑖𝐴i\\in A there exists some constant C𝐶C such that for large k𝑘k this quantity is bounded by Hence by rearranging the sum, we get that We wish to prove that Note that the left-hand side is nonnegative; furthermore, every term in S𝑆S is, for large k𝑘k, at most some universal constant times e−2​(k−1)/c3superscript𝑒23𝑘1𝑐e^{-2\\sqrt[ref]3{(k-1)/c}}. By assumption c≤4𝑐4c\\leq 4, so e−2​(k−1)/c3≤e−k−13superscript𝑒23𝑘1𝑐superscript𝑒3𝑘1e^{-2\\sqrt[ref]3{(k-1)/c}}\\leq e^{-\\sqrt[ref]3{k-1}}. Thus setting D𝐷D large enough makes the inequality true. Now, by adding the bound when summing over A𝐴A and B𝐵B, we get that (12) is true. Combined with (12) with (11), what we must now show to prove (10) is: Recall the function FT​(x)subscript𝐹𝑇𝑥F_{T}(x) from Lemma 43.\nWe observe that (13) is equivalent to where For large k𝑘k, we have that T≤3​c/k𝑇3𝑐𝑘T\\leq 3c/k. Hence for large k𝑘k we have T𝑇T arbitrarily small; furthermore, by assumption ℓ<M​(k)=o​(ek3)=o​(ek/3​c)=o​(e1/T)ℓ𝑀𝑘𝑜superscript𝑒3𝑘𝑜superscript𝑒𝑘3𝑐𝑜superscript𝑒1𝑇\\ell<M(k)=o(e^{\\sqrt[ref]3{k}})=o(e^{k/3c})=o(e^{1/T}). Thus, for large k𝑘k, we have that ℓ<e1/Tℓsuperscript𝑒1𝑇\\ell<e^{1/T}. Thus, applying Lemma 43, we have simply that which by rearranging yields (13).\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: We will actually prove that for some absolute constants C,D>0𝐶𝐷0C,D>0.\nSince ℓ≤M​(k)=o​(ek3)ℓ𝑀𝑘𝑜superscript𝑒3𝑘\\ell\\leq M(k)=o(e^{\\sqrt[ref]3{k}}),\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
