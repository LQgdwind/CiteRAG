      "content": "Paper Title: Explaining Local, Global, And Higher-Order Interactions In Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Deep Learning  Recently, there have been several attempts to compute statistical interactions with deep learning. Neural Interaction Detection (NID)  used neural network weights to interpret interactions, observing that interactions occur at nonlinear activations in the first hidden layer of an MLP. Like our approach T-NID,  used gradient information to compute statistical interaction effects. However, they relied on Bayesian neural networks, required averaging a high number of Hessians, and only computed global interaction effects, not focusing on local or higher-order interactions.  used cross derivatives between single features to explain interactions in deep similarity models, whereas we use an adaptation of Grad-CAM to demonstrate explainability in a more general computer vision setting.  relied on self attention  to compute a measure analogous to non-emergent interaction effects and apply this to an analysis in the biomedical domain.\nHigher-order interactions have been considered throughout biomedicine, particularly for understanding gene interactions    5 . Cui et al.  applied their approach to a toy MNIST dataset consisting of a fixed set of feature vectors such that they could compute global interaction effects, but they mapped those feature vectors to single neurons and computed standard interaction effects between those mapped neurons. The limitation of this approach is that it cannot be used to explain local phenomena, which is traditionally what is of interest in computer vision, NLP, and other areas where multidimensional feature vectors are used. 0 and [ref]44, like our substitution of ReLU with GELU, substitute ReLU with Softplus in order to induce differentiability. The latter, like our work, translate local interaction effects to global interaction effects by aggregating across representative samples. While they use a random batch, we use a small subset of common aggregates.\nWhile our Taylor-CAM formulation is expressly adapted from Grad-CAM for intuitively explaining feature vectors in CNNs, 0 derive their formulation from integrated gradients and [ref]44  directly use cross partials. Individual Importances     used input gradients to explain the reasoning of a neural network.  did so with class activation maps. Grad-CAM  and Grad-CAM++  combined both approaches to localize important feature vectors in computer vision with class activation maps and gradients, visualized by heatmaps. Similar to us, 7 used Taylor decomposition to explain neural network decisions, but only for main effects, not interactions. Relational Reasoning  We also connect interaction effects with relational reasoning, which has received increased attention in deep learning  4 5 , and use Taylor-CAM to interpret the reasoning process of Relation Networks 5. While most past works have mainly focused on explaining individual factors of a neural network’s predictions, the weights in multi-head dot product attention  could be interpreted as relational explanations for neural networks that include MHDPA in their architecture . In contrast, Taylor-CAM is architecture agnostic and can explain decisions unique to each output dimension directly from gradient information. Unlike other works, we expressly derived Taylor-CAM for the purpose of explaining interactions between higher level representations, such as feature maps from a CNN, which standardly represent objects in computer vision (rather than using raw RGB pixels).\nAs Grad-CAM is built on projected feature vectors in addition to gradients, so is our higher-order extension w.r.t. cross derivatives to explain interactions rather than isolated phenomena.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: is that it cannot be used to explain local phenomena, which is traditionally what is of interest in computer vision, NLP, and other areas where multidimensional feature vectors are used. 0 and [ref]44, like our substitution of ReLU with GELU, substitute ReLU with Softplus in order to induce differentiability.
