All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe give complete complexity classifications for #​DirSubd​(C→)#subscriptDirSubd→𝐶\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}) and #​DirIndSubd​(C→)#subscriptDirIndSubd→𝐶\\#\\textsc{DirIndSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}), into 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT} versus non-𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT} cases, as a function of C→→𝐶\\vec{C}. These complexity classifications, which are formally stated below, have the succinct form “The problem is in 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT} if and only if p​(C→)𝑝→𝐶p(\\vec{C}) is bounded”, where p𝑝p is some parameter measuring the structural complexity of the graphs in C→→𝐶\\vec{C}. The definition of those parameters is not elementary and requires the introduction of some ancillary notation and definitions, which we are going to do next. In order to understand why those parameters are the right ones, instead, one should take the technical tour of Section 3. Let us then introduce our structural parameters. First, we need to define reachability hypergraphs and contours. Let H→→𝐻\\vec{H} be a directed graph, and let 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} be the set of its strongly connected components. Denote by ∼similar-to\\sim the equivalence relation over V​(H→)𝑉→𝐻V(\\vec{H}) given by 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, and let H→/∼limit-from→𝐻italic-/∼\\vec{H}\\mathbin{{/}{\\sim}} be the quotient of H→→𝐻\\vec{H} w.r.t. ∼similar-to\\sim; with a little abuse of notation we let 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} be the vertex set of H→/∼limit-from→𝐻italic-/∼\\vec{H}\\mathbin{{/}{\\sim}}. A strongly connected component S∈V​(H→/∼)𝑆𝑉limit-from→𝐻italic-/∼S\\in V(\\vec{H}\\mathbin{{/}{\\sim}}) is a source if it has indegree 00 in H→/∼limit-from→𝐻italic-/∼\\vec{H}\\mathbin{{/}{\\sim}}. Let S1,…,Sksubscript𝑆1…subscript𝑆𝑘S_{1},\\ldots,S_{k} be the set of all such sources. For any S∈V​(H→/∼)𝑆𝑉limit-from→𝐻italic-/∼S\\in V(\\vec{H}\\mathbin{{/}{\\sim}}) let R​(S)𝑅𝑆R(S) be the set of vertices reachable from S𝑆S in H→→𝐻\\vec{H}. The reachability hypergraph of H→→𝐻\\vec{H}, denoted by ℛ​(H→)ℛ→𝐻\\mathcal{R}(\\vec{H}), is the hypergraph with vertex set V​(H→)𝑉→𝐻V(\\vec{H}) and edge set {R​(Si):i∈[k]}conditional-set𝑅subscript𝑆𝑖𝑖delimited-[]𝑘\\{R(S_{i}):i\\in[k]\\}. Intuitively, ℛ​(H→)ℛ→𝐻\\mathcal{R}(\\vec{H}) measures the complexity of H→→𝐻\\vec{H} in terms of “reachability relationships”. However, to state our classifications correctly, we need to consider a slight modification of ℛ​(H→)ℛ→𝐻\\mathcal{R}(\\vec{H}). The contour of H→→𝐻\\vec{H}, denoted by Γ​(H→)Γ→𝐻\\Gamma(\\vec{H}), is the hypergraph ℛ(H→)∖∪i∈[k]Si\\mathcal{R}(\\vec{H})\\setminus\\cup_{i\\in[k]}S_{i}. For instance, if H→nsubscript→𝐻𝑛\\vec{H}_{n} is obtained by orienting the edges of the 111-subdivision of the complete graph Knsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n} towards the original vertices, then Γ​(H→n)=KnΓsubscript→𝐻𝑛subscript𝐾𝑛\\Gamma(\\vec{H}_{n})=K_{n}. Finally, we introduce our directed graph invariants, the fractional cover number and the source number. Let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a hypergraph. A function γ:E​(ℋ)→[0,∞):𝛾→𝐸ℋ0\\gamma:E(\\mathcal{H})\\!\\rightarrow\\![0,\\infty) is a fractional edge cover of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} if for every v∈V​(ℋ)𝑣𝑉ℋv\\in V(\\mathcal{H}) The weight of γ𝛾\\gamma is ∑e∈E​(ℋ)γ​(e)subscript𝑒𝐸ℋ𝛾𝑒\\sum_{e\\in E(\\mathcal{H})}\\gamma(e). The fractional edge cover number of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, denoted by ρ∗​(ℋ)superscript𝜌ℋ\\rho^{*}(\\mathcal{H}), is the smallest weight of any fractional edge cover of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}.\nThen: The fractional cover number of H→→𝐻\\vec{H} is ρ∗​(H→)=ρ∗​(Γ​(H→))superscript𝜌→𝐻superscript𝜌Γ→𝐻\\rho^{*}(\\vec{H})=\\rho^{*}(\\Gamma(\\vec{H})). The source number of H→→𝐻\\vec{H} is the number of sources in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, denoted by αs​(H→)subscript𝛼𝑠→𝐻\\alpha_{s}(\\vec{H}); in other words, the number of strongly connected components of H→→𝐻\\vec{H} that are not reachable from any other connected component. Intuitively, both ρ∗superscript𝜌\\rho^{*} and αssubscript𝛼𝑠\\alpha_{s} measure the complexity of covering H→→𝐻\\vec{H} through its sources. Our main result, the following dichotomy theorem, says that such a “covering complexity” determines precisely the fixed-parameter tractability of our problems. For any class C→→𝐶\\vec{C} of directed graphs let ρ∗​(C→)=supH→∈C→ρ∗​(H)superscript𝜌→𝐶subscriptsupremum→𝐻→𝐶superscript𝜌𝐻\\rho^{*}(\\vec{C})=\\sup_{\\vec{H}\\in\\vec{C}}\\rho^{*}(H) and αs​(C→)=supH→∈C→αs​(H)subscript𝛼𝑠→𝐶subscriptsupremum→𝐻→𝐶subscript𝛼𝑠𝐻\\alpha_{s}(\\vec{C})=\\sup_{\\vec{H}\\in\\vec{C}}\\alpha_{s}(H). If the Exponential Time Hypothesis holds, then: #​DirSubd​(C→)∈𝖥𝖯𝖳#subscriptDirSubd→𝐶𝖥𝖯𝖳\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C})\\in\\mathsf{FPT} if and only if ρ∗​(C→)<∞superscript𝜌→𝐶\\rho^{*}(\\vec{C})<\\infty #​DirIndSubd​(C→)∈𝖥𝖯𝖳#subscriptDirIndSubd→𝐶𝖥𝖯𝖳\\#\\textsc{DirIndSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C})\\in\\mathsf{FPT} if and only if αs​(C→)<∞subscript𝛼𝑠→𝐶\\alpha_{s}(\\vec{C})<\\infty Note that ETH is used only by the “only if” direction. While the statement of Theorem 4 is simple, its proof is nontrivial — virtually all of this manuscript is devoted to it. To put the theorem into perspective, Table 1 compares it to dichotomies for the other variants of the problem. We also observe that Theorem 4 can be slightly strengthened: we can show the hardness direction even for acyclic host graphs. As a consequence of Theorem 4, we can claim the optimality (in an FPT sense) of the well-known approach to counting the induced copies of a DAG H→→𝐻\\vec{H} in a host G→→𝐺\\vec{G} of bounded outdegree, used in several recent works on counting in hosts of bounded degeneracy [ref]8 0 [ref]9   . This approach consists in guessing the images of the sources of H→→𝐻\\vec{H} in G→→𝐺\\vec{G}, and has running time f​(|H→|,d​(G→))⋅|G→|αs​(H→)+O​(1)⋅𝑓→𝐻𝑑→𝐺superscript→𝐺subscript𝛼𝑠→𝐻𝑂1f(|\\vec{H}|,d(\\vec{G}))\\cdot|\\vec{G}|^{\\alpha_{s}(\\vec{H})+O(1)}. By Theorem 4, unless ETH fails the dependence on αs​(H→)subscript𝛼𝑠→𝐻\\alpha_{s}(\\vec{H}) at the exponent cannot be avoided, hence that approach is optimal in an FPT sense. It shall be noted that, for #​DirIndSubd​(C→)#subscriptDirIndSubd→𝐶\\#\\textsc{DirIndSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}), the non-𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT}case in Theorem 4 also yields #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}-hardness (see Section 4 for a definition of #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}). For #​DirSubd​(C→)#subscriptDirSubd→𝐶\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}) instead we do not prove #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}-hardness; the reason is that our proof uses a reduction from certain families of #​CSP#CSP\\#\\textsc{CSP} instances which by  we know to be not in 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT} if ETH holds, but we do not know if they are #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}-hard too. When the problems in Theorem 4 are in 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT}, we can show simple algorithms that solve them in time f​(|H→|,d​(G→))⋅|G→|p​(H→)+O​(1)⋅𝑓→𝐻𝑑→𝐺superscript→𝐺𝑝→𝐻𝑂1f(|\\vec{H}|,d(\\vec{G}))\\cdot|\\vec{G}|^{p(\\vec{H})+O(1)} where p∈{ρ∗,αs}𝑝superscript𝜌subscript𝛼𝑠p\\in\\{\\rho^{*},\\alpha_{s}\\}. Formally, we prove: For some computable function f𝑓f there is an algorithm solving #​DirSubd​(C→)#subscriptDirSubd→𝐶\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}) in time f​(|H→|,d​(G→))⋅|G→|ρ∗​(H→)+O​(1)⋅𝑓→𝐻𝑑→𝐺superscript→𝐺superscript𝜌→𝐻𝑂1f(|\\vec{H}|,d(\\vec{G}))\\cdot|\\vec{G}|^{\\rho^{*}\\!(\\vec{H})+O(1)}. The same holds for #​DirIndSubd​(C→)#subscriptDirIndSubd→𝐶\\#\\textsc{DirIndSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}) with αssubscript𝛼𝑠\\alpha_{s} in place of ρ∗superscript𝜌\\rho^{*}. We point out that theorems 4 and 5 remain true in the (edge or vertex) weighted setting, too. A simple example shows Theorem 4 and Theorem 5 in action.\nLet Δ1subscriptΔ1\\Delta_{1} and Δ2subscriptΔ2\\Delta_{2} be respectively the cyclic and acyclic orientations of K3subscript𝐾3K_{3}, and for each k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} let Δ1ksuperscriptsubscriptΔ1𝑘\\Delta_{1}^{k} and Δ2ksuperscriptsubscriptΔ2𝑘\\Delta_{2}^{k} consist of k𝑘k disjoint copies of respectively Δ1subscriptΔ1\\Delta_{1} and Δ2subscriptΔ2\\Delta_{2}. Finally, let C→1={Δ1k:k∈ℕ}subscript→𝐶1conditional-setsuperscriptsubscriptΔ1𝑘𝑘ℕ\\vec{C}_{1}=\\{\\Delta_{1}^{k}:k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\} and C→2={Δ2k:k∈ℕ}subscript→𝐶2conditional-setsuperscriptsubscriptΔ2𝑘𝑘ℕ\\vec{C}_{2}=\\{\\Delta_{2}^{k}:k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}. Although the patterns are rather elementary, establishing the tractability of #​DirSubd​(C→1)#subscriptDirSubdsubscript→𝐶1\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}_{1}) and #​DirSubd​(C→2)#subscriptDirSubdsubscript→𝐶2\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}_{2}) “by hand” can be laborious. Theorem 4 and Theorem 5 answer immediately: ρ∗​(Δ1k)=0superscript𝜌superscriptsubscriptΔ1𝑘0\\rho^{*}(\\Delta_{1}^{k})=0, since in Δ1ksuperscriptsubscriptΔ1𝑘\\Delta_{1}^{k} every vertex belongs to some source, hence #​DirSubd​(C→1)#subscriptDirSubdsubscript→𝐶1\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}_{1}) is fixed-parameter tractable and solvable in time f​(|H→|,d​(G→))⋅|G→|O​(1)⋅𝑓→𝐻𝑑→𝐺superscript→𝐺𝑂1f(|\\vec{H}|,d(\\vec{G}))\\cdot|\\vec{G}|^{O(1)}; but ρ∗​(Δ2k)=ksuperscript𝜌superscriptsubscriptΔ2𝑘𝑘\\rho^{*}(\\Delta_{2}^{k})=k, since Γ​(Δ2k)ΓsuperscriptsubscriptΔ2𝑘\\Gamma(\\Delta_{2}^{k}) has k𝑘k disjoint hyperedges, hence #​DirSubd​(C→2)#subscriptDirSubdsubscript→𝐶2\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}_{2}) is not fixed-parameter tractable unless ETH fails. One can also see that αs​(Δ1k)=αs​(Δ2k)=ksubscript𝛼𝑠superscriptsubscriptΔ1𝑘subscript𝛼𝑠superscriptsubscriptΔ2𝑘𝑘\\alpha_{s}(\\Delta_{1}^{k})=\\alpha_{s}(\\Delta_{2}^{k})=k; therefore, by Theorem 4, under ETH both #​DirIndSubd​(C→1)#subscriptDirIndSubdsubscript→𝐶1\\#\\textsc{DirIndSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}_{1}) and #​DirIndSubd​(C→2)#subscriptDirIndSubdsubscript→𝐶2\\#\\textsc{DirIndSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}_{2}) are not fixed-parameter tractable. Another example helps appreciating the different between our parameterization and the standard one, as well as the necessity of ρ∗superscript𝜌\\rho^{*} being fractional. Let Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k} be the graph defined as follows. The vertices of Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k} are Uk∪Dksubscript𝑈𝑘subscript𝐷𝑘U_{k}\\cup D_{k} where Uk={1,…,2​k}subscript𝑈𝑘1…2𝑘U_{k}=\\{1,\\dots,2k\\} and Dk={A⊆Uk||A|=k}subscript𝐷𝑘conditional-set𝐴subscript𝑈𝑘𝐴𝑘D_{k}=\\{A\\subseteq U_{k}~{}|~{}|A|=k\\}; and for each i∈Uk𝑖subscript𝑈𝑘i\\in U_{k}, there is an edge between i𝑖i and D∈Dk𝐷subscript𝐷𝑘D\\in D_{k} if and only if i∈D𝑖𝐷i\\in D.\nLet C𝐶C be the class of all Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k}. It is not hard to show that Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k} contains the subdivision of the k𝑘k-clique as induced subgraph. Thus the vertex-cover number of C𝐶C is unbounded and, assuming ETH, Table 1 yields that #​Sub​(C)#Sub𝐶\\#\\textsc{Sub}(C) and #​DirSub​(C→)#DirSub→𝐶\\#\\textsc{DirSub}(\\vec{C}) are not fixed-parameter tractable for any class C→→𝐶\\vec{C} obtained by orienting the graphs in C𝐶C. However, if we parameterise also by the outdegree of the host, then the situation becomes much more subtle. Let C→→𝐶\\vec{C} be the class of digraphs obtained by orienting the edges in the Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k} from Uksubscript𝑈𝑘U_{k} to Dksubscript𝐷𝑘D_{k}; an argument similar to [33, Example 4.2] shows that ρ∗​(H→k)≤2superscript𝜌∗subscript→𝐻𝑘2\\rho^{\\ast}(\\vec{H}_{k})\\leq 2 for each H→k∈C→subscript→𝐻𝑘→𝐶\\vec{H}_{k}\\in\\vec{C}, thus #​DirSubd​(C→)#subscriptDirSubd→𝐶\\#\\textsc{DirSub}_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\vec{C}) is fixed-parameter tractable by Theorem 5. Moreover, [33, Example 4.2] show that any non-fractional cover of H→ksubscript→𝐻𝑘\\vec{H}_{k} has super-constant weight; this proves that considering the fractional cover number ρ∗superscript𝜌\\rho^{*} is crucial; its integral counterpart cannot work. We conclude this section with a result of independent interest developed in our proofs. Let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a hypergraph. The independence number α​(ℋ)𝛼ℋ\\alpha(\\mathcal{H}) of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is the size of the largest subset of V​(ℋ)𝑉ℋV(\\mathcal{H}) such that no two of its elements are contained in a common edge. The natural relaxation of this definition yields the fractional independence number α∗​(ℋ)superscript𝛼ℋ\\alpha^{*}(\\mathcal{H}). Our result is that the ratio between α∗​(ℋ)superscript𝛼ℋ\\alpha^{*}(\\mathcal{H}) and α​(ℋ)𝛼ℋ\\alpha(\\mathcal{H}), i.e. the integrality gap of α𝛼\\alpha, is bounded by the adaptive width222Note that adaptive width is equivalent to submodular width . of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} .
