      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Contrastive Learning Meets Graph Meta Learning: A Unified Method for Few-shot Node Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Few-shot Learning.\nWhile GNNs for node classification are generally semi-supervised [ref]2, considerable efforts were spent on removing the labeling dependency   . However, they cannot handle unseen classes during the test phase. This inspired research on the few-shot node classification problem. The majority of research employs a meta learning paradigm. Meta-GNN 0 adapts the optimization-based meta learning method MAML 2 to graph data. GFL  enables few-shot classification on unseen graphs with seen node classes. GPN  uses ProtoNet 3, a metric-based meta learning method, and refines prototypes with the weights learned by a GCN [ref]2. G-Meta  leverages subgraph information and achieves good performance on both transductive and inductive FSCC. RALE 1 assigns relative and absolute locations to each node within meta-tasks. TENT  applies node-level, class-level, and task-level adaptations in each task to mitigate task variance impact. Recently, TLP 8, inspired by graph contrastive learning, trains a few-shot classifier using pre-trained node embeddings, thereby significantly enhancing the performance over existing meta learning approaches. Its success prompts us to delve further into the potential of contrastive learning. Graph Contrastive Learning.\nContrastive Learning methods 5 4 6 have been adapted to the graph domain. DGI  learns node representations by maximizing mutual information (MI) between local and global graph features. GRACE  maximizes node-level agreement between two corrupted views. MVGRL  maximizes the MI between node representations of one view and graph representations of another view. GraphCL  applies various data augmentation techniques to the graph and then employs a contrastive loss function to move the representations of augmented views of the same graph closer. MERIT  leverages bootstrapping within a Siamese network and multi-scale graph contrastive learning to enhance node representation learning. SUGRL 9 employs node embeddings from MLP as anchors and takes advantage of structural and neighbor information to obtain two kinds of positive samples. Different from previous methods, SUGRL takes the combination of triplet loss instead of InfoNCE loss . BGRL 0 extends the non-contrastive setting 6 that does not need negative samples to graph problem. TLP integrates various graph contrastive learning methods. SUGRL consistently delivers superior performance on few-shot tasks. Few-shot Learning with Contrastive Learning.\nRecent works in computer vision show that meta learning and contrastive learning can benefit from each other. Some recent few-shot auxiliary learning works 1 2 3 view few-shot learning as the main task and combine the few-shot loss with self-supervised auxiliary tasks.  Liu et al. 4 employs supervised contrastive learning on meta-tasks, where support images and query images are processed with different data augmentations to construct hard samples. CPLAE 5 represents support and query samples using concatenated embeddings of both the original and augmented versions. It then regards prototypes of support samples as the anchor samples in contrastive learning. PsCo 6 uses a momentum network with a queue like MoCo 4 to improve pseudo labeling in the unsupervised meta learning setting. MetaContrastive 7 proposes a meta learning framework to enhance contrastive learning by transforming contrastive learning setup to meta-tasks. However, in the field of graph learning, there is no work that enhances meta learning with the advantages of contrastive learning, and it is challenging to tailor these previous methods from the image domain for the graph.Few-shot Learning with Contrastive Learning.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Graph Few-shot Learning.\nWhile GNNs for node classification are generally semi-supervised [ref]2, considerable efforts were spent on removing the labeling dependency   .
