      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Finite Automaton Emptiness is Undecidable for a Fixed Automaton\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are three different proofs of\nthe basic undecidability\ntheorem\nin the literature.\nThe first proof is due to\nMasakazu Nasu and Namio Honda¬† from 1969.111This proof is commonly\nmisattributed to Paz¬†,\nalthough Paz gave credit\nto Nasu and Honda\n[22, Section IIIB.7, Bibliographical notes, p.¬†193].\nThe second proof, by Volker Claus , is loosely related to\nthis proof.\nAll these proves use a reduction from the undecidability of the\nPost Correspondence Problem (PCP,\nsee Section¬†1.4).\nA completely independent proof, which\nuses a very different approach,\nwas given by\nAnne Condon and Richard J. Lipton¬†[ref]6 in 1989,\nbased on ideas of\nR≈´si≈Ü≈°\nFreivalds¬† from 1981.\nThe somewhat intricate history is described\nin [23, Section¬†3] as part of an extensive survey of the various undecidability proofs. PFA Emptiness remains undecidable under various constraints on the\nnumber of transition matrices (size of the alphabet) and their\nsize (number of states).\nThe first result in this direction is due to\nClaus\n from 1981. Later improvements were made\nby\nBlondel and Canterini\n and Hirvensalo\n4, who were apparently unaware of¬†\nand concentrated on the case of\ntwo matrices (binary input alphabet).\nAn overview of these results is shown in Table¬†1 below the double line. We improve these bounds, concentrating on\nthe minimum number of states without restricting the\nnumber of matrices,\nsee Theorem¬†1.1.\n(Such results are only implicit in the proofs of  and\n4.)\nUndecidability even holds for a PFA where all data except the\nstarting distribution œÄùúã\\pi are fixed. We also get improved bounds for the 2-matrix case.\nFor the variation where the output vector fùëìf is not\nrestricted to a 0-1-vector, we can reduce the number of\nstates to¬†6\n(Theorem¬†1.2). Our results are stated in\nthe following theorems and summarized in\nTable¬†1. The PFA Emptiness Problem is undecidable for PFAs with a\nsingle accepting state and the following restrictions on the number\nof transition matrices (size of the input alphabet)\nand their size (number of states):\n ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} consists of\n4 positive doubly-stochastic transition matrices of size 7√ó7777\\times 7, with\ncutpoint Œª=1/7ùúÜ17\\lambda=1/7. ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} consists of\n6 fixed positive doubly-stochastic transition matrices of size 7√ó7777\\times 7, with\ncutpoint Œª=1/7ùúÜ17\\lambda=1/7.\nThe only variable input is the starting distribution œÄ‚àà 7ùúãsuperscript017\\pi\\in ^{7}. ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} consists of\n2 positive transition matrices of size 18√ó18181818\\times 18, with cutpoint\nŒª=1/18ùúÜ118\\lambda=1/18. ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} consists of\n2 fixed\npositive transition matrices of size 28√ó28282828\\times 28, with cutpoint\nŒª=1/28ùúÜ128\\lambda=1/28. All statements hold also for weak inequality (‚â•Œª)absentùúÜ(\\geq\\lambda) as the acceptance criterion. For any cutpoint ŒªùúÜ\\lambda in the interval 0<Œª<10ùúÜ10<\\lambda<1,\nthe PFA Emptiness Problem with an output vector fùëìf with entries 0‚â§fi‚â§10subscriptùëìùëñ10\\leq f_{i}\\leq 1\nis undecidable for PFAs with\nthe following restrictions on the number\nof transition matrices (size of the input alphabet)\nand their size (number of states): ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} consists of\n4 positive\ntransition matrices of size 6√ó6666\\times 6.\nThere is a fixed deterministic start state. ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} consists of\n5 fixed\npositive\ntransition matrices of size 6√ó6666\\times 6.\nThere is a fixed starting distribution¬†œÄùúã\\pi.\nThe only input of the problem\nis the vector f‚àà 6ùëìsuperscript016f\\in ^{6} of output values. All statements hold also for weak inequality (‚â•Œª)absentùúÜ(\\geq\\lambda) as the acceptance criterion. By combining the different proof techniques, one can extend\nTheorem¬†1.2 to PFAs with two matrices\nand a fixed start state or starting distribution,\nanalogous to\nTheorem¬†1.1c‚Äìd, but\nwe have not worked out these results. Some weaker results with fixed matrices were previously obtained\nin a technical report [23, Theorems¬†2 and¬†4]. For example, PFA Emptiness was shown to be undecidable for 52 fixed 9√ó9999\\times 9\nmatrices,\nin the setting\nof Theorem¬†1.2\nwhere the final vector fùëìf is the only input,\nwith acceptance criterion¬†‚â•1/2absent12\\geq 1/2.\nFor acceptance with strict inequality (>1/4absent14>1/4),\n52 fixed\nmatrices of size 11√ó11111111\\times 11 were needed.\nIn these constructions, the PCP was derived from a universal Turing machine.\nFor the case of 2 fixed matrices with\na single accepting state, where the start distribution œÄùúã\\pi is the only input, a bound of 572\nstates was obtained\n[23, Theorem¬†3].\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the undecidability of the\nPost Correspondence Problem (PCP,\nsee Section¬†1.4).\nA completely independent proof, which\nuses a very different approach,\nwas given by\nAnne Condon and Richard J.
