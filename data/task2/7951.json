      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Video Summarization via Reinforcement Learning and a Trained Evaluator\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we conduct a comparative analysis between the outcomes produced by our approach, referred to as Trained Reward Summarizer (TR-SUM), and the current state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised video summarization (SUM-GAN [ref]13, Cycle-Sum [ref]21, DR-DSN , SUM-GAN-AAE , SUM-GAN-sl , CSNet , RS-SUM , AC-SUM-GAN , CA-SUM ). The results of this comparative analysis are summarized in Table II. In this table, previous works marked by ∗* are methods in which a different regularization factor (δ𝛿\\delta) was used for each dataset. In these cases, multiple models were trained with δ𝛿\\delta values ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 for each fold of both datasets. The highest average F-score achieved by a single δ𝛿\\delta on all folds of a dataset is reported (for example, SumMe peaks at δ𝛿\\delta set to 0.8, while TVSum peaks at 0.7). Instances marked with ∗⁣∗** represent methods that reported the average F-score achieved by different regularization factors for each fold (for example, for the first fold of SumMe, δ𝛿\\delta was set to 0.3, while for the second fold, it was set to 0.6). In contrast, our method employed a constant δ𝛿\\delta value of 0.5 for all folds across both datasets. The results presented in Table II demonstrate that our method achieves the highest F-score on both datasets and ranks second in terms of ρ𝜌\\rho and τ𝜏\\tau, trailing only behind CA-SUM . However, it is important to note that in the case of CA-SUM , initially, for each data fold, five instances of a model with different δ𝛿\\delta values (ranging from 0.5 to 0.9) were trained for 400 epochs. The network weights at each epoch for each δ𝛿\\delta were saved as a checkpoint, resulting in a total of 2000 checkpoints for each of the 5 data folds. Subsequently, an algorithm was employed to select one checkpoint out of 2000 per fold. This selection process aimed to choose weights for each fold that would yield high ρ𝜌\\rho and τ𝜏\\tau values. The previous leading method in unsupervised video summarization, i.e., RS-SUM , utilized a structure similar to our method. This structure was also based on transformer blocks and segmented videos into intervals of 128 frames. The computational complexity difference between TR-SUM and RS-SUM is detailed in Table III, which underscores the differences in terms of inference time and the number of MACs (Multiply-Accumulate Operations) per video sub-sequence (collected using the ptflops  package). This table indicates a significant performance advantage of TR-SUM over RS-SUM. Specifically, TR-SUM is 310 times faster than RS-SUM in analyzing a video sub-sequence. Moreover, TR-SUM has 20 times less computational complexity than RS-SUM. This highlights another advantage of our method over RS-SUM during the inference stage. RS-SUM uses an iterative algorithm to generate frame scores, necessitating multiple passes of each video through their model to achieve stable output frame scores. In contrast, our method requires a single pass of each video through our model to generate the output frame scores.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: analysis between the outcomes produced by our approach, referred to as Trained Reward Summarizer (TR-SUM), and the current state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised video summarization (SUM-GAN [ref]13, Cycle-Sum [ref]21, DR-DSN , SUM-GAN-AAE , SUM-GAN-sl , CSNet , RS-SUM , AC-SUM-GAN , CA-SUM ).
