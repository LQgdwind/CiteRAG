      "content": "Paper Title: Curvature Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInspired by the great success of deep learning in the Euclidean domain, GNNs attempt to generalize neural networks to non-Euclidean domains, e.g., graph. With the ability to automatically extract low-dimensional representations of nodes or graphs, GNNs have been widely used in recommender systems [ref]1 , biochemistry  , social networks . The core idea of GNNs is how to aggregate the features of neighboring nodes to enrich the representations of target nodes. Mainly based on the homophily assumption [ref]6 [ref]7, GNNs strengthen the similarity of node representations belonging to the same class and the difference of node representations between different classes, and smooth the representation of nodes on local structures based on connection. Smoothness is an intrinsic property of GNNs , which makes neighboring node representations similar and is beneficial for neighboring nodes classified into the same class . Smoothing is a double-edged sword for GNNs: proper smoothing can generate high-quality, low-dimensional node representations that are beneficial to downstream tasks, while oversmoothing makes node representations indistinguishable and is harmful to downstream tasks. Oversmoothing is mainly caused by the edges connecting different classes of nodes in real-world datasets, which dilute the useful information of the target nodes by aggregation and cause the different class of node representations too similar . To alleviate oversmoothing, we need to assign more weights to the same class of nodes and less weights to the other nodes. GNNs mainly measure the importance of neighboring nodes in three ways. The simplest way considers the neighboring nodes equally important, such as Neural FPs , GraphSAGE  and GIN . The second way assesses the weight of neighboring nodes by utilizing node degrees. A typical GNN adopting this way is GCN , which assigns the weights of neighboring nodes inversely proportional to the degree of neighboring nodes. The GCN-derived TAGCN  and SGC  also leverage node degrees. Both of the ways explicitly compute the weights of neighboring nodes, while some other models implicitly generate the weights to adapt to datasets in a data-driven manner. For example, GAT  calculates the weights through a self-attention mechanism and CurvGN  transforms Ricci curvature into the weights by the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). However, the above three ways cannot properly characterize the structural importance of neighboring nodes. Many real-world datasets have an aggregating tendency for nodes, forming locally tight-connected groups with relatively sparse inter-group connection  0, named as communities. In general, nodes in the same community have strong similarities, while nodes between different communities have strong differences. Further, we argue that the more the overlap of neighboring nodes of a node pair, the stronger the structural connection between them, and vice versa. The nodes in Figure 1(a) are divided into two classes based on the structure. The key of aggregating the neighboring nodes for node aùëéa is to weaken the influence of node bùëèb. Equal importance treats node bùëèb and blue nodes as equivalents. Since the node degree of node bùëèb is smaller than blue nodes, GCN considers it important. Implicit manners cannot measure the influence of node bùëèb before finishing training. Due to utilizing limited topological information such as node degree or connection, all of these ways cannot directly or explicitly weaken the influence of node b. The above three ways are respectively shown by Figure 1(b), (c), (d). In this paper, we introduce the concept of graph curvature to improve the local structural adaptability of GNNs. Graph curvature well measures how neighbors of a pair of nodes relate to each other 1. In analogy to curvature quantifying the deviation of a curve from a straight line in Euclidean space, discrete graph curvature measures the geometric deviation of the neighboring nodes of two nodes on an edge from a \"flat\" shape, e.g., the shape of a grid graph in which all nodes are structurally equivalent. There are several definitions of graph curvature, among which Ollivier‚Äôs Ricci curvature 2 3 is the most attractive. Ollivier‚Äôs Ricci curvature can quantify the strength of interaction or overlap between neighbors of a pair of nodes. In a (infinite) grid graph, the Ricci curvature of all edges is zero, as shown in Figure 2(b). When the connection of nodes in Figure 2(c) is denser, the Ricci curvature is positive. The edge (a,b)ùëéùëè(a,b) in Figure 2(a) connecting two independent groups which is like a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù has a negative Ricci curvature. Naturally, the Ricci curvature diminishes the effect of node bùëèb on node aùëéa in Figure 1(a). And Figure 1(e) shows that the Ricci curvature of (a,b)ùëéùëè(a,b) is -0.50, which is much smaller than the curvature between the blue node and node aùëéa. We argue that the Ricci curvature characterizes the relationship of the pairwise structure connections and should be exploited by GNNs. Here, we propose Curvature Graph Neural Network (CGNN), which improves the discrimination ability for local structures by leveraging the Ricci curvature. For CurvGN, Li et al. 4 argues that its success is due to the learning ability of MLP, not the Ricci curvature. To illustrate it, the performance of CurvGN does not change significantly even if we replace the Ricci curvature with random values randomly sampling from a uniform distribution of 0 to 1, as shown in Table 1. Unlike CurvGN which implicitly assign weights to different channels of node features by MLP, we explicitly transform the Ricci curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes. And the structural information represented by the Ricci curvature is effectively retained and utilized by CGNN. Since using the Ricci curvature as the weights makes CGNN difficult to train and degrades the performance, we propose the Negative Curvature Transformation Module (NCTM) and the Curvature Normalization Module (CNM), both of which do not destroy the relative magnitude of curvature, i.e., edges with large curvature have relatively large weights. We conduct extensive experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets to illustrate that the Ricci curvature improves the local structural adaptability of GNNs. The experimental results indicate that the Ricci curvature is beneficial for measuring the strength of pairwise structural connections and the performance of CGNN outperforms the baselines. Further, we visually express that CGNN can better weaken the interactions of node features between different classes. Finally, the ablation experiments prove the necessity of NCTM and CNM to guarantee the performance of CGNN. Our contributions are mainly as follows: We propose CGNN, which significantly improves the local structural adaptability and the quality of node representations by transforming the Ricci curvature into the weights of neighbors; We propose NCTM to process negative Ricci curvature and CNM to utilize the structural information of nodes in different order hops, and both of them effectively help the Ricci curvature adapt to various datasets; CGNN outperforms the baselines on 5 dense node classification benchmark datasets The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we briefly review the related work on GNNs and the discrete Ricci curvature. Section 3 describes the network architecture of CGNN and the pipeline of transforming the Ricci curvature. Section 4 evaluates the performance of CGNN on various synthetic and real-world datasets.
