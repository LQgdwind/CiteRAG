      "content": "Paper Title: On the Importance of Environments in Human-Robot Coordination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman-Aware Planning.\nIn the absence of pre-coordination strategies, robots coordinate with human teammates by reasoning over human actions when making decisions.\nWhile many works have studied human-aware planning    0 [ref]6, most relevant to this work are POMDP frameworks, where the robot observes human actions to infer the internal state of a human. POMDP-based models have enabled communication with unknown teammates , inference of human preference 3 and human trust  in human-robot collaboration, and inference of human internal state 6 in autonomous driving applications. Since the exact computation of a POMDP policy is computationally intractable 4, researchers have proposed several approximation methods. One such approximation is the QMDP, where the robot estimates its current actions based on the current belief and the assumption of full observability at the next time step . Though the robot does not take information-gathering actions in this approximation, QMDP has been shown to achieve good performance in domains when the user continuously provides inputs to the system, such as in shared autonomy . Most relevant to our implementation is the CAPIR framework 2, which implements a QMDP agent by decomposing a ghost-hunting game into MDPs that model different sub-tasks (ghosts) that the human may wish to complete. The CAPIR framework was also tested in a Cops and Robbers game . Given the large number of subtasks in the Overcooked environment, we use a QMDP planner to pick the next subtask, e.g, “pick an onion”, while the cost of transitioning from each subtask to the next is derived from pre-computed jointly optimal motion plans. Procedural Content Generation. Procedural content generation (PCG) refers to algorithmic, as opposed to manual, generation of content 1. A growing research area is PCG via machine learning (PCGML) 0, where content is generated with models trained on existing content (e.g., 9 8 ). Our work builds on the recent success of GANs as procedural generators of video game levels 4 . However, generating video game levels is not as simple as training a GAN and then sampling the generator since many generated levels are unplayable. Previous work 4 addressed this by optimizing directly in latent space via Latent Variable Evolution (LVE) . Specifically, the authors optimize with the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)  to find latent codes of levels that maximize playability and contain specific characteristics (e.g., an exact number of player jumps) in the game Super Mario Bros.. However, game designers rarely know exactly which properties they want the generated levels to have. Later work proposed Latent Space Illumination 6 7 by framing the search of latent space as a quality diversity (QD)  problem instead of a single-objective optimization problem. In addition to an objective function, the QD formulation permits several measure functions which form the behavior characteristics (BCs) of the problem. The authors generated levels that maximized playability but varied in measurable properties, i.e., the number of enemies or player jumps. Their work showed CMA-ME  outperformed other QD algorithms 1 3 when directly illuminating latent space. In the case where the objective and measure functions are differentiable, recent work shows that differentiable quality diversity (DQD)  can significantly improve search efficiency. As stated above, GAN-generated environments, including those generated with LSI, are frequently invalid. For instance, in Overcooked, they may have more than one robot or it may be impossible for players to reach the stove. Previous work 6 proposed a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) repair method for the game The Legend of Zelda, which edits the input levels to satisfy formal playability constraints. The authors formulate the repair as a minimum edit distance problem, and the MIP repairs the level with the minimum total cost of edits possible. Our work integrates the GAN+MIP repair method with Latent Space Illumination. This allows us to move the objective of LSI away from simply generating valid environments to generating environments that maximize or minimize team performance. Additionally, while previous work on LSI 7 6 generated levels that were diverse with respect to level mechanics and tile distributions, e.g., number of objects, we focus on the problem of diversity in the agent behaviors that emerge from the generated environments. Overcooked. Our coordination domain is based on the collaborative video game Overcooked  . Several works  5 created custom Overcooked simulators as a domain for evaluating collaborative agents against human models  and evaluating decentralized multi-agent coordination algorithms 5. We use the Overcooked AI simulator , which restricts the game to two agents and a simplified item set. In this version, the goal is to deliver two soup orders in a minimum amount of time. To prepare a soup, an agent needs to pick up three onions (one at a time) from an onion dispenser and place them in the cooking pot. Once the pot is full and 101010 timesteps have passed, the soup is ready. One of the agents then needs to retrieve a dish from the dish dispenser, put the soup on the dish, and deliver it to the serving counter (Fig. 2). \nHuman\n GAN \nGAN+MIP \n \nMIP-random\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the absence of pre-coordination strategies, robots coordinate with human teammates by reasoning over human actions when making decisions.\nWhile many works have studied human-aware planning    0 [ref]6, most relevant to this work are POMDP frameworks, where the robot observes human actions to infer the internal state of a human.
