      "content": "Paper Title: On Practical Robust Reinforcement Learning: Adjacent Uncertainty Set and Double-Agent Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor comparison, we consider the benchmark methods below: Popular RL algorithms such as Q-Learning , DQN , and DDPG [ref]36 as they are used as the underlying methods of the proposed algorithms. Robust Q-Learning (in short, Robust-Q) [ref]31 as the state-of-the-art MF-RRL algorithm for tabular case. To the best of our knowledge, there is no DNN-based algorithm which is constructed using the robust Bellman operator in (15). In [ref]31 , robust Q-Learning algorithm is developed based on a simple linear function approximation. Thus, we implemented Robust-DQN and Robust-DDPG (in short, R-DQN and R-DDPG) by appropriately combining DQN and DDPG with the robust Bellman operator in (15). In comparison with R-DQN and R-DDPG, we can identify the advantage of our uncertainty set compared with the state-of-the-art one in [ref]31. Note that in these algorithms, to solve the maximization in (15) using samples, we stored action values in a separate buffer during training. Then, the maximum value was approximately obtained by taking the highest value from this buffer. In our experiments, agents are trained in a training environment and then they are evaluated in a testing environment. To assess the robustness, the testing environment is constructed by intentionally adding some perturbations to the training environment. Accordingly, they have some mismatches. Among various types of perturbations (or mismatches), we take into account action and parameter perturbations. In the action perturbations, an agent can take a random action with some probability, instead of solely adhering to an optimal policy provided by a learned agent. This type of perturbation can occur in various real-world applications. For example, when an agent’s observation differs from the environment’s original state, the action taken by the agent can be different from an optimal one. Also, it is possible that the agent’s action can be affected by some noise in real-world environments. Regarding the parameter perturbations, some model-parameter settings in the testing environment can be different from those in the training environment. This type of perturbations can well-represent the modeling mismatches between the simulator (i.e., the training environment) and the real-world environment (i.e., the testing environment). For experiments, we considered various environments in OpenAI Gym . Agents are trained with five instances for each algorithm and environment. At evaluation time step, we take the average reward and the standard deviation of 100 tests for each instance. In each figure, the thick line represents the average value and the shaded region shows the ±0.5plus-or-minus0.5\\pm 0.5 standard deviation. For tabular methods, the hyperparameter parameters provided in Table I. Also, for DNN-based MF-RRL methods, we used the hyperparameters provided by RL Baselines3 Zoo .\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: For comparison, we consider the benchmark methods below: Popular RL algorithms such as Q-Learning , DQN , and DDPG [ref]36 as they are used as the underlying methods of the proposed algorithms.
