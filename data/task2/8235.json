      "content": "Paper Title: MeloTrans: A Text to Symbolic Music Generation Model Following Human Composition Habit\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSymbolic music generation have been a subject of extensive research in recent years. Transformer-based models have shown good performance in modeling long sequences, thus been widely employed in symbolic music generation [ref]1[ref]3. However, these models often lack a sense of musicality. For instance, human-composed music frequently features motif repetition and deformation. Such structural elements tend to be absent in output from neural network composition models, primarily due to the difficulty in extracting such complex patterns from training data.\nNumerous studies have attempted to incorporate prior knowledge into the generation process. Considering repetition of motifs as a significant musical pattern, some works strive to emulate this by means of detecting musical phrases and sections [ref]4. However, the integration of repetition mode in these works often results in an unnatural sound, appearing as if it’s repetition for repetition’s sake. Other research have concentrated on learning relationships between bars, achieving structural coherence based on bar similarity . Nonetheless, these relationships do not fully represent the essence of musical structure. Further efforts combine expert systems with neural networks but continue to struggle with producing monotonous music due to prescriptive rules. Despite considering prior knowledge, these works fail to align with human composition habits, resulting in music that lacks diversity and musicality. Figure 1 illustrates the different idea of human and machine composition. In human composition, the process typically initiates with the creation of motifs, subsequently varies and develops into music phrases   . These phrases undergo adjustment and integration, conforming to the composition rules, thereby culminating in a complete music segment. The motif’s development is termed as ’variant’. In contrast, machine composition is essentially a conditional sequential prediction model, which is hard to learn all of the internal rules of music. Such models often come at the cost of poor performance or a large number of model parameters. Therefore, introduce the human composition experience into neural networks is crucial for automatic composition models. Two primary challenges exist in aligning neural networks with the human composition paradigm: 1) generating motifs and 2) developing motifs into musical pieces. In this study, we introduce the POP909_M dataset, which annotates motifs, variants, and textual descriptions of music from the POP909 dataset . Building upon this dataset, we propose MeloTrans, a two-stage text-to-music generative model. The first stage involves text-to-motif generation. This multi-modal generation process usually involves complex alignment challenges. Given the typically short length of motifs in our system, we designed a Valence and Arousal based generation algorithm, which greatly reduces the system complexity while maintaining the generation performance. The second stage encompasses motif-to-melody transformation. We developed a multi-branch model that simulates human composition rules, ensuring the synthesized melody exhibits a clear structure. By introducing a motif-driven composition pipeline, our approach facilitates the generation of more expressive and coherent musical compositions. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: We propose POP909_M dataset, labeling motifs, 5 types of variants and the text descriptions on all the songs. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to label motif and variants. A multi-branch model is adopted to generate different variants, which can guarantee the musical structure of melody. A positional encoding method aligned with multiple variants enables the model to effectively learn various motif-variant development rules. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models trained with massive amounts of data and large language models in terms of structural and semantic matchability. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the related works. Section 3 demonstrate the POP909_M dataset with different aspect. Section 4 is the proposed MeloTrans model with descriptions of modules. Section 5 presents the experiments and settings and the results and discussions. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: have been a subject of extensive research in recent years.
