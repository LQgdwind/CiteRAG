      "content": "Paper Title: Updatable Siamese Tracker with Two-stage One-shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo display the superiority of our SiamTOL tracker, we compared it with the state-of-the-art trackers on six popular datasets. VOT2018 Dataset . We evaluated the SiamTOL tracker on popular Visual Object Tracking challenge 2018 , which consists of 60 sequences covering various challenging cases.\nReferring to the standard evaluation protocol of VOT2018, the performance of all trackers is measured by Accuracy, Robustness and the Expected Average Overlap (EAO), which is overall evaluation of accuracy and robustness. The comparison results with some state-of-the-art trackers are reported on Table 1 and Figure 4. We observe that our updatable Siamese tracker achieve the best performance in term of EAO. Especially, SiamBAN [ref]4 produce the top-ranked EAO score among previous trackers by exploiting more powerful anchor-free model for Siamese network, but our method still can slightly outperform it on overall performance with the advantage of online update. Besides, PG-Net obtains the most satisfactory accuracy, but the failure rate of our tracker decreases by 2.8%percent\\% compared to the algorithm. The proposed approach takes simplified SiamRPN++ as the baseline. Compared to the standard SiamRPN++ , our method receives 4.5%percent\\% improvements on EAO. The increasement mainly sources from the online update ability of our SiamTOL tracker, which provides 7%percent\\% gains on robustness. This proves that the presented two-stage one-shot learning is very effective in updating Siamese network. Quality vs Speed. As displayed in Figure 5, we describe the EAO score with respect to the Frames-Per-Second (FPS) on VOT2018, in which our tracker is measured on TITAN X GPU. According to the figure, our tracker is superior to all comparison methods in tracking quality with a highest speed of 75 FPS. Referred to the baseline, the proposed approach obtains 9.3%percent\\% improvements on EAO score, but the speed is only reduced by 15 FPS. VOT2019 Dataset . The dataset is an updated version of VOT2018 dataset, which replaced 20 %percent\\% original sequences with more representative videos. We presented the results of all trackers on Table 2. Among all previous methods, CLNet  achieves the best accuracy, and DiMP [ref]3 is superior to others on robustness. However, CLNet is powerless in robustness, and our method realizes substantial gains of 10%percent\\% on robustness over it. For DiMP, although its robustness is slight than ours, but our tracker is more outstanding in EAO and accuracy. Compared to the SiamRPN++ , the SiamTOL Tracker outperforms it by 10%percent\\% on robustness and 4.5%percent\\% on EAO. This shows that our updatable tracker can perform better than the other state-of-the-art methods. OTB-2015 Dataset . The dataset is one of the most widely used benchmark for object tracking including 100 video sequences. It covers 11 kinds of challenging factors, such as fast motion, motion blur, occlusion, and so on. In the dataset, the Area Under Curve (AUC) of success plots and the Precision score is used to evaluate tracking performance. The performance of all trackers is displayed in Figure 6. Benefit from online update, the proposed tracker is superior to most of compared methods and achieves similar results with SiamRPN++ and SiamBAN, although a more compact backbone is employed. UAV123 Dataset [ref]26. As a typical aerial tracking benchmark, the dataset contains 123 annotated sequences captured from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. These sequences cover abundant challenging factors with an average length of 915 frames. Following the OTB2015, we adopt Precision score and AUC score to evaluate compared trackers, and the results are demonstrated on Figure 7. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our tracker achieves pretty satisfactory performance. LaSOT Dataset . We also validate the proposed approach on the LaSOT dataset, which is high-quality, large-scale dataset for single object tracking. There are 1400 sequences in total and 280 videos in the testing dataset with an average sequence length of more than 2,500 frames. The dataset is a great challenge to the short-time trackers. we display success and normalized precision plots in Figure 8. The proposed updatable tracker ranks second in terms of both AUC and normalized precision scores, and outperforms SiamRPN++ tracker by 1.8%percent1.81.8\\% on normalized precision. GOT-10k Dataset . This dataset is a large-scale high-diversity benchmark with more than 10k video sequences. Meanwhile, 180 annotated sequences are adopted as testing dataset, which consists of 84 kinds of objects in the wild with diverse motion patterns. We compare the performance of different trackers using the average overlap, and success rates corresponding to two overlap thresholds of 0.5 and 0.75. According to Table 3, we find that our tracker outperforms most of previous methods with the highest speed.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: results with some state-of-the-art trackers are reported on Table 1 and Figure 4.
