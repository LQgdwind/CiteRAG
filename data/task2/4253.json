In neural machine translation experiments ŒΩùúà\\nu varies across language pairs from 0.350.350.35 to 0.480.480.48 (Table 1 in [ref]5). Interestingly, [ref]8 explored a fixed computation budget Cùê∂C and optimized jointly over model size NùëÅN and training set size PùëÉP, revealing that scaling both NùëÅN and PùëÉP commensurately as Cùê∂C increases is compute optimal, and can yield smaller high performing models (trained on more data) than previous work. Nevertheless, for a transformer based language model, a 100√ó100\\times increase in compute, corresponding to 10√ó10\\times increases in both model size and training set size, leads to a drop in cross-entropy loss of only about 0.50.50.5 nats (Fig.¬†2 in [ref]8). Similar slow scaling holds for large vision transformers where adding 222 billion pre-training images reduces ImageNet performance by a few percentage points (Fig.¬†1 in ). While all of these results constitute significant improvements in performance, they do come at a substantial resource cost whose fundamental origin arises from power law scaling with small exponents. Recent theoretical works    have argued that the power law exponent is governed by the dimension of a data manifold from which training examples are uniformly drawn. Here we explore whether we can beat power law scaling through careful data selection.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Recent work  [ref]2   [ref]5   [ref]8 has demonstrated that test loss ‚Ñí‚Ñí\\mathcal{L} often falls off as a power law with different resources like model parameters (NùëÅN), number of training examples (PùëÉP), and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
