      "content": "Paper Title: TASM: A Tile-Based Storage Manager for Video Analytics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proliferation of inexpensive high-quality cameras coupled with recent advances in machine learning and computer vision have enabled new applications on video data such as automatic traffic analysis  , retail store planning , and drone analytics  . This has led to a class of database systems specializing in video data management that facilitate query processing over videos  [ref]7  [ref]9 0 . A query over a video comprises two steps. First, read the video file from disk and decode it. Second, process frames to identify and return pixels of interest or compute an aggregate.\nMost systems, so far, have focused on accelerating and optimizing the second step [ref]9 0  1, often assuming that the video is already\ndecoded and stored in memory  [ref]7 2, which is not feasible in practice. The lack of efficient storage managers in existing video data management systems significantly impacts queries. First, subframe selection queries (e.g.,\n“Show me video snippets cropped to show previously identified hummingbirds feeding on honeysuckles”\n) are common and their execution bottleneck is at the storage layer since these queries are selections, reading and returning pixels without additional operations. Second, object detection queries, which extract new semantic information from a video (e.g., “Find all sightings of hummingbirds in this new video”) require the execution of expensive deep learning models. To avoid applying such models to as many frames as possible, query plans typically include an initial full scan phase that applies a cheap predicate 2 or a specialized model [ref]7 to the entire video to filter uninteresting frames. The overhead of reading and decoding the video file is known to significantly hurt the performance of this phase 3. In this paper, we introduce TASM, a storage manager that greatly improves the performance of subframe selection queries and the full scan phase of object detection queries by providing spatial random access within videos.\nTASM exploits the observation that objects in videos frequently lie in subregions of video frames.\nFor example, a traffic camera may be oriented such that it partially captures the sky, so vehicles only appear in the lower portion of a frame.\n\nAnalysis applications such as running license plate recognition  or extracting image patches for vehicle type recognition  only need to operate on the parts of the frame containing vehicles.\nPrivacy applications such as blurring license plates and faces 4 or performing region of interest-based encryption 5 similarly only need to modify the parts of the frame that contain sensitive objects.\n Using its spatial random access capability, TASM enables reading from disk and decoding only the parts of the frame that are interesting to queries. Providing such a capability is difficult because the video encoding process introduces spatial and temporal dependencies within and between frames. To address this problem, TASM subdivides video frames into smaller pieces called tiles that can be processed independently.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, each tile contains a rectangular subregion of the frame that can be decoded independently because there are no spatial dependencies between tiles. In contrast, current state of the art incurs the cost of decoding entire frames.\nTASM optimizes how a video is divided into tiles and stored on disk to reduce the amount of work spent decoding and preprocessing\nparts of the video not involved in a query.\nThrough its use of tiles, TASM implements a new type of optimization that we call semantic predicate pushdown where predicates are pushed below the decoding step and only tiles of interest are read from disk, decoded, and processed. Building TASM raises three challenges. The first challenge is fundamental, but important: Given a video file with known semantic content (i.e., known object locations within video frames) and a known query workload, TASM must decide on the optimal tile layout, choosing from among layouts with uniform or non-uniform tiles and either fine-grained or coarse-grained tiles. TASM must also decide whether different tile layouts should be used in different parts of a video.\nTo do this effectively, TASM must accurately estimate the cost of executing a query with a given tile layout.\nTASM therefore drives its selection using a cost function that balances the benefits of processing fewer pixels against the overhead of processing more tiles for a given tile layout, video content, and query workload.\nIn this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that non-uniform, fine-grained tiles outperform the other options. Additionally, we find that optimizing the layout for short sections of the video (i.e., every 1 second) maximizes query performance with no storage overhead. Given a video file, TASM thus splits it into 1 second fragments and selects the optimal fine-grained tile layout for each fragment. The second challenge is that the semantic content and the query workload for a video are typically discovered over time as users execute object detection and subframe selection queries.\nTASM therefore lacks the information it needs to design optimal tile layouts.\nTo address this challenge, TASM incrementally updates a video’s tile layout as queries to detect and retrieve objects are executed. TASM uses different tile layouts in different parts of the video, and independently evolves the tile layout in each section. To do this, TASM builds on techniques from database cracking 6 7 and online indexing 8. To decide when to re-tile portions of the video and which layout to use, TASM maintains a limited set of alternative layouts based on past queries. It then uses its cost function to accumulate estimated performance improvements offered by these tile layouts as it observes queries. Once the estimated improvement, also called regret 9, of a new layout offsets the cost of reorganization, TASM re-tiles that portion of the video. By observing multiple queries before making tiling decisions, TASM designs layouts optimized for multiple query types. For the ornithology example, TASM could tile around hummingbirds and flowers that are likely to attract them. The third challenge lies in the initial phase that identifies objects of interest in a new video. This phase is both expensive and requires at least one full scan over the video, generally using a cheap model to filter frames or compute statistics.\nThe models used in the full scan phase are limited by video decoding and preprocessing throughput 3.\nTo address this final challenge, TASM uses semantic predicate pushdown where the semantic predicate is not a specific object type, but rather a general region of interest (ROI).\nTASM bootstraps an initial tile layout using an inexpensive predicate that identifies ROIs within frames.\nThis predicate can use background segmentation to find foreground objects, motion vectors to identify areas with large amounts of motion, or even a specialized neural network designed to identify specific object types. When an object detection query is executed, TASM only decodes the tiles that contain ROIs, hence filtering regions of the frame before the decode step.\nTASM thus alleviates the bottleneck for the full scan phase of object detection queries by reducing the amount of data that must be decoded and preprocessed.\nTASM can be directly incorporated into existing techniques and systems that accelerate the extraction of semantic information from videos (e.g.,   1). In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: We develop TASM111Code is available at https://github.com/uwdb/TASM., a new type of storage manager for video data that splits video frames into independently queryable tiles. TASM optimizes the tile layout of a video file based on its contents and the query workload. By doing so, TASM accelerates queries that retrieve objects in videos while keeping storage overheads low and maintaining good video quality. We develop new algorithms for TASM to dynamically evolve the video layout as information about the video content and query workload becomes available over time. We extend TASM to cheaply profile videos and design an initial layout around ROIs when a video is initially ingested. This initial tiling reduces the preprocessing work required for object detection queries. We evaluate TASM on a variety of videos and workloads and find that the layouts picked by TASM speed up subframe selection queries by an average of 51% and up to 94% while maintaining good quality, and that TASM automatically tunes layouts after just a small number of queries to improve performance even when the workload is unknown. We also find that TASM improves the throughput of the full scan phase of object detection by up to 2×2\\times while maintaining high accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: traffic analysis  , retail store planning , and drone analytics  .
