      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Graph-Level Clustering Using Pseudo-Label-Guided Mutual Information Maximization Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset We use six well-known graph datasets in the experiment, including MUTAG111https://www.chrsmrrs.com/graphkerneldatasets/MUTAG.zip, PTC-MR222https://www.chrsmrrs.com/graphkerneldatasets/PTC-MR.zip, PTC-MM333https://www.chrsmrrs.com/graphkerneldatasets/PTC-MM.zip, BZR444https://www.chrsmrrs.com/graphkerneldatasets/BZR.zip, ENZYMES555http://www.chrsmrrs.com/graphkerneldatasets/ENZYMES.zip, COX2666https://www.chrsmrrs.com/graphkerneldatasets/COX2.zip.\nWe provide detailed information of six graph datasets used in our experiment here: MUTAG is a compound dataset that contains 188 compounds, which are grouped into 2 categories based on the mutagenic effect of them to a bacterium. Note molecules possess natural graph structure, where they are expressed by average 17.93 nodes (for atoms) and 19.79 edges (for chemical bonds). PTC-MR and PTC-MM are the subset of PTC dataset, which is a compound dataset that divided into 2 categories based on the carcinogenicity to rodents. Note that PTC-MR contains 344 compounds with average 14.29 nodes and 14.69 edges, while PTC-MM contains 336 compounds with average 13.97 ndoes and 14.32 edges, respectively. BZR is the ligand dataset for benzodiazepine receptor, which are divided into 2 classes according to the activity and inactivity of compounds. Note that BZR contains 405 graphs in total with average 35.75 nodes and 38.36 edges per graph. ENZYMES contains 600 protein data for 6 classes of enzymes, with 100 proteins per class. Each protein data can be represented as a graph with average 32.63 nodes and 62.14 edges. COX2 consists of 467 inhibitor for cyclooxygenase-2 and are divided into 2 classes based on whether the compounds are active or inactive. Note that each graph in this dataset is with average 41.22 nodes and 43.45 edges. We summarize the information of each dataset in Table II Baseline methods We compare our method with six state-of-the-art graph kernel methods including Random walk kernel (RW) , Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (WL) [ref]36, Optimal assignment based WL kernel (WL-OA) , Shortest path kernel (SP) , Lovasz-theta kernel (LT) , Graphlet kernel (GK) , and four unsupervised graph-level representation learning methods including InfoGraph , Gromov-Wasserstein factorization (GWF) [ref]59, Graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) [ref]51, and Joint augmentation optimization (JOAO) . Evaluation Metrics We introduce three clustering metrics used in this paper, with yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} and y^jsubscript^𝑦𝑗\\hat{y}_{j} denoting the true labels and the predicted labels for graph Gjsubscript𝐺𝑗G_{j} respectively. Clustering accuracy (ACC): ACC is expressed as the comparison of the true labels and predicted labels leveraged on sample size n𝑛n, which is defined as follows: Normalized mutual information (NMI): NMI score scales the mutual information scores by some generalized mean of entropy of true label set ΩΩ\\Omega and cluster label set C𝐶C. It can be formalized as follows: where I​(Ω;C)=H​(Ω)+H​(C)−H​(Ω,C)𝐼Ω𝐶𝐻Ω𝐻𝐶𝐻Ω𝐶I(\\Omega;C)=H(\\Omega)+H(C)-H(\\Omega,C) denotes the mutual information between ΩΩ\\Omega and C𝐶C, and H​(⋅)𝐻⋅H(\\cdot) is the information entropy. Adjusted rand index (ARI): ARI score is an adjusted score of Rand index (RI) for chance. RI is also a similarity measure by considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and true labels. ARI can be formalized as follows: where ai=∑j=1rni​jsubscript𝑎𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑟subscript𝑛𝑖𝑗a_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{r}{n_{ij}}, bi=∑i=1sni​jsubscript𝑏𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑠subscript𝑛𝑖𝑗b_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{n_{ij}}, ni​jsubscript𝑛𝑖𝑗n_{ij} denotes an entry from the contingency table of cluster i𝑖i and class j𝑗j, r𝑟r and s𝑠s are numbers of clusters and classes. Note that ACC and NMI range from   , while ARI ranges from [−1,1]11[-1,1]. The higher values of ACC, NMI and ARI represent the better clustering performance.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: the information of each dataset in Table II Baseline methods We compare our method with six state-of-the-art graph kernel methods including Random walk kernel (RW) , Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (WL) [ref]36, Optimal assignment based WL kernel (WL-OA) , Shortest path kernel (SP) , Lovasz-theta kernel (LT) , Graphlet kernel (GK) , and four unsupervised graph-level representation learning methods\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
