Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Generalization in Meta-Learning via Meta-Gradient Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMeta regularization is specially designed for meta-learning to solve learner and memorization overfitting. For learner overfitting, well-designed task augmentation  [ref]16 remains an effective solution by increasing task diversity. Meta-MaxUp   splits the meta-framework and further explores various data augmentation combinations. In contrast, memorization overfitting occurs in the inner loop with only a few updates, invalidating most conventional regularization strategies  [ref]13 . Although constructing mutually-exclusive tasks   shows promise against memorization overfitting, the task-dependent property makes it difficult to extend either diversity or mutual-exclusivity to regression and reinforcement learning scenarios  [ref]15. MetaPruning   ignores inner loops and improves meta-generalization through data-agnostic network pruning. Instead, we argue that redundant memories in inner loops are the key cause of memorization overfitting   . With the same intuition, MR-MAML  [ref]15 and TAML   develop explicit meta-regularization terms to constrain the parameter scale and the base learner behavior, respectively. Unlike them, we directly break the rote memorization fetter via proposed catfish pruning and alleviate learner overfitting using derived augmented meta-gradients, which can also be considered an enhanced DropGrad  .\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Meta regularization is specially designed for meta-learning to solve learner and memorization overfitting.
