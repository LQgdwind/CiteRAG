They are mainly categorize into two types: (1) PIMs built with die-stacking memories such as High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), where PIM computation is completed within a logic die; (2) PIMs built with Dual-Inline\nMemory Modules (DIMMs) such as UPMEM, where PIM computation is supported by DPUs inner DRAM chips. Both solutions have attracted tremendous interests in recent years   [ref]32     [ref]22 . To alleviate the memory bottleneck of ANNS, previous works have proposed several solutions on PIM platform. For instance, Gcim  implemented specific modules on the logic die of stacked memory and applied data layout optimization to graph construction. Spitfire  proposes a linear-time partitioning algorithm for load balance on distributed PIM system and optimizes ANNS processing through query partitioning, calculation pruning and candidate set refinement. CXL-ANNS [ref]22 deploys ANNS in the CXL memory network and propose a collaborative kNN search design for the system. Though processing in die-stacking memories can also attain huge bandwidth, the capacity is bounded. Although several works have tried to deploy ANNS on PIM-DIMMs with simulators  or operational prototype systems [ref]22, DRIM-ANN is the first ANNS framework deployed on commodity DRAM-PIMs to our best knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: PIMs built with Dual-Inline\nMemory Modules (DIMMs) such as UPMEM, where PIM computation is supported by DPUs inner DRAM chips.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
