Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: ImageCaptioner2: Image Captioner for Image Captioning Bias Amplification Assessment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe classify the fairness metrics into three categories: Source-Agnostic Vs. Source-Identification metrics.\nWomen also Snowboard [ref]16, and GAIC [ref]38 assume access to the bias attribute in the predicted captions while measuring the misclassification rate. Accordingly, such metrics can not identify the bias source, which is crucial in designing a debiasing technique.\nIn contrast, methods that rely on a pre-trained language model to determine whether the model is biased or not, such as , LIC , and , or the methods that rely on calculating the co-occurrences, i.e., BA  and DBA [ref]43, have the capability of determining the source of the bias. Learnable Vs. Non-Learnable metrics.\n studies the racial bias, i.e., lighter and darker, by utilizing a dedicated classifier to predict the race based on the predicted caption. In addition, LIC , and  train additional language classifiers to measure the bias in the data and the model.\nIn contrast, Women also Snowboard [ref]16, GAIC [ref]38, BA , and DBA [ref]43 do not utilize any additional learnable parameters to measure the bias.\nWomen also Snowboard [ref]16 defines the error rate as the number of gender misclassifications, i.e., whether the protected attribute words have been correctly predicted in the generated caption or not.\nConsequently, GAIC [ref]38 formulates the gender bias as the difference in performance between the subgroups of a protected attribute, e.g., GAIC [ref]38 creates three groups for gender: male, female, and not-specified.\nBA  and DBA [ref]43 calculate the co-occurrence between the desired bias attribute, e.g., gender, and the predicted caption. Absolute-Bias Vs. Bias-Amplification.\nAnother comparison criterion is whether the metric measures the magnitude of the bias introduced by the model over the bias already existing in the data.\nThis type of metric can be interpreted as Bias-amplification metrics  [ref]43  , where it answers the following question: \"Does the model introduce extra bias than ground-truth dataset?\"\nTo this end, these models ground the model bias score to the data bias score.\nIn contrast,  [ref]16 [ref]38 do not provide this valuable information; that’s why we call them absolute-bias metrics.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: We classify the fairness metrics into three categories: Source-Agnostic Vs.
