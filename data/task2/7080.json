      "content": "Paper Title: SC-MIL: Sparsely Coded Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaseline. For the classical MIL benchmark datasets, we compared the proposed method to a series of deep learning-based MIL methods, including mi-Net and MI-Net¬†[ref]21, ABMIL and ABMIL-Gated¬†, GNN-MIL¬†, DP-MINN¬†, and three non-local MIL pooling methods (i.e., NLMIL¬†, ANLMIL¬†, and DSMIL¬†[ref]7). In the case of WSI classification, we considered plugging the proposed SC module into four different types of MIL aggregators, i.e., ABMIL with gated attention¬†, DSMIL¬†[ref]7, TransMIL¬†[ref]8 and DTFD-MIL with maximum attention score selection (MaxS)¬†. Experiment setup and evaluation metrics. In this study, distinct experimental procedures were employed for different datasets.\nSpecifically, for the classical MIL datasets, we performed 10-fold cross-validation on each dataset with five repetitions per experiment, using classification accuracy as the primary metric. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we incorporated the proposed SC module into the ABMIL framework using two distinct attention mechanisms, denoted by ABMIL w/ SC and ABMIL-Gated w/ SC. Additionally, 200 bags were used for training, and 50 bags were employed for testing in the MNIST-bags dataset.\nFor the two WSIs datasets, we utilized the aforementioned training and testing partitions.\nWe conducted experiments on features extracted from those above two differently pre-trained ResNet-18. The evaluation metrics used were the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores. Implementation details. The cross-entropy loss was adopted to train all the models in this work. In all results reported in¬†Tables¬†1 and¬†2, the number of atoms in a dictionary was set to m=16ùëö16m=16, and the number of unrolled layers was set to L=6ùêø6L=6. The batch size was set to 1 for all the experiments. The models on classic MIL datasets were trained using an Adam optimizer for 40 epochs with initial learning of 1√ó10‚àí41superscript1041\\times 10^{-4} and ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} weight decay of 5√ó10‚àí35superscript1035\\times 10^{-3}. The initial learning rate was adjusted through a cosine annealing scheduler. In the cases of the MNIST-bags dataset, we used the same settings for training but with a different initial learning rate of 5√ó10‚àí45superscript1045\\times 10^{-4} and a weight decay of 1√ó10‚àí41superscript1041\\times 10^{-4}. In the WSI classification tasks, we trained all four MIL aggregators for 200 epochs by following the default training settings in their official implementations¬† [ref]7 [ref]8 .\nAll experiments were performed on four Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs, each with 32G of memory.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Baseline.
