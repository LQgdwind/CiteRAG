      "content": "Paper Title: First-order Policy Optimization for Robust Markov Decision Process This research was partially supported by NSF DMS-2134037 and AFOSR FA9550-22-1-0447.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the problem of solving the robust Markov decision process (MDP) where the transition kernel is uncertain, and one seeks to learn a policy that behaves robustly against such uncertainties.\nSpecifically,\na robust MDP ℳ𝒰≔{ℳu=(𝒮,𝒜,c,ℙu,γ):u∈𝒰}≔subscriptℳ𝒰conditional-setsubscriptℳ𝑢𝒮𝒜𝑐subscriptℙ𝑢𝛾𝑢𝒰\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{U}}\\coloneqq\\left\\{\\mathcal{M}_{u}=({\\mathcal{S}},\\mathcal{A},c,\\mathbb{P}_{u},\\gamma):u\\in\\mathcal{U}\\right\\} consists of a set of MDPs, where 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} and 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} denote the state and action space, respectively; ℙu:𝒮×𝒜→[ref]0 [ref]1:subscriptℙ𝑢→𝒮𝒜01\\mathbb{P}_{u}:{\\mathcal{S}}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\to[ref]0 [ref]1 denotes the transition kernel, indexed by u∈𝒰𝑢𝒰u\\in\\mathcal{U}; c:𝒮×𝒜→ℝ:𝑐→𝒮𝒜ℝc:{\\mathcal{S}}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\to\\mathbb{R} denotes the cost function, which we assume with loss of generality that 0<c​(s,a)≤10𝑐𝑠𝑎10<c(s,a)\\leq 1 for all (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a); γ𝛾\\gamma denotes the discount factor.\nThe set of MDPs differ from each other only in their respective transition kernels.\nThe standard value function Vuπ:𝒮→ℝ:subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑢→𝒮ℝV^{\\pi}_{u}:{\\mathcal{S}}\\to\\mathbb{R} of a policy π𝜋\\pi with respect to MDP ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u}, is defined as Our end goal is to learn a policy π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} that is the solution of the following problem where ΠΠ\\Pi denotes the set of all stationary and randomized policies.\nThat is, (1.1) aims to learn a policy that minimizes the worst-case value simultaneously for every state.\nClearly, when 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} is a singleton, the problem of finding robust policy (1.1) reduces to solving a standard MDP planning problem. Before any technical discussions, we first construct a simple example motivating our study of finding a robust policy in the sense of (1.1), when facing transition uncertainty.\nSpecifically, we will construct a pair of MDP ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} and ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u}, with the same (𝒮,𝒜,c,γ)𝒮𝒜𝑐𝛾({\\mathcal{S}},\\mathcal{A},c,\\gamma), and the transition kernels of these two MDPs are close to each other, yet the optimal policy for ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} achieves highly suboptimal value in ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u}.\nIn contrast, we show that there exists a policy that achieves close-to-optimal performances in both ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} and ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u}. Consider the nominal MDP ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} illustrated in Figure 1(a).\nStarting at S0subscript𝑆0S_{0}, the agent has two possible actions {L,R}𝐿𝑅\\left\\{L,R\\right\\}, consisting of going either left or right.\nGoing right incurs a cost of −11-1, going left incurs a cost of 00.\nWe assume the cost occurs immediately after the action is made.\nWhenever the agent arrives at Si,Rsubscript𝑆𝑖𝑅S_{i,R} for 1≤i≤k−11𝑖𝑘11\\leq i\\leq k-1 and Sk+1subscript𝑆𝑘1S_{k+1}, the agent stays at the same place going forward. Additionally, if the agent goes left from S0subscript𝑆0S_{0}, then in the ensuing rounds the agent has only one available action, which is to transit to the next state following the arrows.\nNo cost is incurred until the agent transits from Sk−1,Lsubscript𝑆𝑘1𝐿S_{k-1,L} to Sk,Lsubscript𝑆𝑘𝐿S_{k,L}, which incurs a cost of −(1+ϵ)​γ−k+11italic-ϵsuperscript𝛾𝑘1-(1+\\epsilon)\\gamma^{-k+1} for some small positive number ϵ≪1much-less-thanitalic-ϵ1\\epsilon\\ll 1 (e.g., ϵ=0.01italic-ϵ0.01\\epsilon=0.01). Now consider another MDP ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u} that is exact the same as ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, except in the transition kernel, illustrated in Figure 1(b).\nIn particular, for any 1≤m≤k−11𝑚𝑘11\\leq m\\leq k-1, the transition changes to ℙu​(Sm+1,L|Sm,L)=p,ℙu​(Sm,R|Sm,L)=1−pformulae-sequencesubscriptℙ𝑢conditionalsubscript𝑆𝑚1𝐿subscript𝑆𝑚𝐿𝑝subscriptℙ𝑢conditionalsubscript𝑆𝑚𝑅subscript𝑆𝑚𝐿1𝑝\\mathbb{P}_{u}(S_{m+1,L}|S_{m,L})=p,~{}\\mathbb{P}_{u}(S_{m,R}|S_{m,L})=1-p, for some p∈(0,1)𝑝01p\\in(0,1) close to 111 (e.g., p=0.99𝑝0.99p=0.99).\nThus ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u} can be viewed as an approximate copy of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. It should be clear that for MDP ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, going left at S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} incurs a value of −(1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ-(1+\\epsilon), which is close, but still strictly small than the value −11-1 of going right.\nThus the optimal policy π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} for ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} is to always go left. However, when deploying π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} in the slightly changed environment ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u}, one can clearly see that going left at S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} now incurs a value of −(1+ϵ)​pk−11italic-ϵsuperscript𝑝𝑘1-(1+\\epsilon)p^{k-1}, while going right still has the value of −11-1.\nFor k𝑘k large enough, we obverse that the value of going left approaches 00, which is significantly worse than the value of going right. In conclusion, we see that going left at S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} serves as the optimal policy in ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, but its performance degrades significantly despite being deployed at a similar environment ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u}.\nIn fact, such a policy is even worse than the policy of randomly going left or right with equal probability.\nIn contrast, going right at S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} is an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-optimal policy in ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, and also the optimal policy in ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u}, thus being a much more desirable choice in terms of robustness. The tensions between accuracy and robustness have been discussed extensively in the supervised learning literature    . Example 1.1 demonstrates that similar tensions between cost-minimization (planning) and robustness also exists in the control of uncertain Markov decision process.\nIt should be noted that the key ingredient for the lack of robustness in the MDP demonstrated in Figure 1 is the reward (cost) sparseness.\nThis feature has been widely observed for practical MDP applications  , and we believe the same mechanism can be one of the few important factors that lead to brittle robustness observed in existing reinforcement learning applications. To proceed, we will focus on the case of (𝐬,𝐚)𝐬𝐚(\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{a})-rectangular uncertainty set, defined below. We assume the transition kernel ℙusubscriptℙ𝑢\\mathbb{P}_{u} for the MDP ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u} takes the form of where ℙℕ(⋅|s,a)\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathbb{N}}(\\cdot|s,a) denotes the nominal transition kernel, and\nu∈ℝ|𝒮|×|𝒮|×|𝒜|𝑢superscriptℝ𝒮𝒮𝒜u\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\lvert{\\mathcal{S}}\\rvert\\times\\lvert{\\mathcal{S}}\\rvert\\times\\lvert\\mathcal{A}\\rvert} denotes the perturbation to the nominal transition kernel.\nThe uncertainty is said to be rectangular if 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} satisfies We assume 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} is compact.\nIn addition, we let denote the set of possible transition probabilities at (s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜𝑠𝑎𝒮𝒜(s,a)\\in{\\mathcal{S}}\\times\\mathcal{A}, which we refer to as the ambiguity set. While one can also consider uncertain cost function cusubscript𝑐𝑢c_{u} when modeling, our motivation to focus on modeling uncertain transitions is due to the observation that cost function is mostly an endogenous user choice, and thus seems less suitable to be modeled as an uncertainty. From Definition 1.1, it should be also clear that Example 1.1 can be readily modeled into a robust MDP with a rectangular uncertainty set.\nWe will also define the nominal environment of the robust MDP ℳ𝒰subscriptℳ𝒰\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{U}} as follows, a useful notion for our discussions in the stochastic settings. The nominal environment ℳNsubscriptℳN\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{N}} for a robust MDP problem ℳ𝒰subscriptℳ𝒰\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{U}}, is the MDP with transition kernel ℙℕsubscriptℙℕ\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathbb{N}}. Given a policy π𝜋\\pi, we define its robust value function Vrπ:𝒮→ℝ:subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑟→𝒮ℝV^{\\pi}_{r}:{\\mathcal{S}}\\to\\mathbb{R} as Vrπ​(s)=maxu∈𝒰⁡Vuπ​(s)subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑟𝑠subscript𝑢𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑢𝑠V^{\\pi}_{r}(s)=\\max_{u\\in\\mathcal{U}}V^{\\pi}_{u}(s) for all s∈𝒮𝑠𝒮s\\in{\\mathcal{S}}.\nConsequently, solving (1.1) is equivalently to minimizing the robust value function: The existence of an optimal policy π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} solving (1.4) is well known in the literature  ,\nand we denote the set of optimal policies as Π∗⊆ΠsuperscriptΠΠ\\Pi^{*}\\subseteq\\Pi.\nHence, we can succinctly reformulate (1.4) into a single objective optimization problem where ρ𝜌\\rho is a nonnegative measure defined over the state space 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}}. For any u∈𝒰𝑢𝒰u\\in\\mathcal{U}, we also define the state-action value function of policy π𝜋\\pi with respect to ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u} as Accordingly, the robust state-action value function Qrπ:𝒮×𝒜→ℝ:subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑟→𝒮𝒜ℝQ^{\\pi}_{r}:{\\mathcal{S}}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\to\\mathbb{R} as\nQrπ​(s,a)=maxu∈𝒰⁡Quπ​(s,a)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑟𝑠𝑎subscript𝑢𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑢𝑠𝑎Q^{\\pi}_{r}(s,a)=\\max_{u\\in\\mathcal{U}}Q^{\\pi}_{u}(s,a) for all (s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜𝑠𝑎𝒮𝒜(s,a)\\in{\\mathcal{S}}\\times\\mathcal{A}.\nNote that from the definition of Quπsubscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑢Q^{\\pi}_{u} and Vuπsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑢V^{\\pi}_{u}, we have Given a policy π𝜋\\pi,\nand an uncertainty u∈𝒰𝑢𝒰u\\in\\mathcal{U},\nthe discounted state visitation measure jointly induced by (π,u)𝜋𝑢(\\pi,u) is defined as where ℙuπ(st=s′|s0=s)≔ℙ(st=s′|s0=s,at=π(⋅|st),st+1∼ℙu(⋅|st,at))\\mathbb{P}_{u}^{\\pi}(s_{t}=s^{\\prime}|s_{0}=s)\\coloneqq\\mathbb{P}\\left(s_{t}=s^{\\prime}|s_{0}=s,a_{t}=\\pi(\\cdot|s_{t}),s_{t+1}\\sim\\mathbb{P}_{u}(\\cdot|s_{t},a_{t})\\right) denotes the probability of reaching state s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} at timestep t𝑡t, given initial state s𝑠s, and following policy π𝜋\\pi within MDP ℳusubscriptℳ𝑢\\mathcal{M}_{u}.\nGiven any distribution ρ𝜌\\rho over 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}}, we define\ndistribution dρπ,usuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝜌𝜋𝑢d_{\\rho}^{\\pi,u} over 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} as\ndρπ,u​(s′)=𝔼s∼ρ​dsπ,u​(s′)superscriptsubscript𝑑𝜌𝜋𝑢superscript𝑠′subscript𝔼similar-to𝑠𝜌superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑠𝜋𝑢superscript𝑠′d_{\\rho}^{\\pi,u}(s^{\\prime})=\\mathbb{E}_{s\\sim\\rho}d_{s}^{\\pi,u}(s^{\\prime}).\nFor a finite set 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, we will denote Δ𝒳subscriptΔ𝒳\\Delta_{\\mathcal{X}} as the (|𝒳|−1)𝒳1(\\lvert\\mathcal{X}\\rvert-1)-dimensional simplex. Related Literature.\nSolving robust MDP (1.1) with rectangular uncertainty sets has been extensively studied in the dynamic programming literature.\nAmong value-based methods, value iteration (VI) is known to achieve linear convergence to the optimal robust values  .\nWhen the environment is unknown, sample-based value based methods      , including robust Q-learning, have also been developed to directly learn the optimal value function.\nPolicy-based methods, including the (modified) policy iteration (PI), have been studied in     .\nApproximate dynamic programming (ADP) techniques  for both type of methods have also been developed,\nwhich allow approximate computation of policy update and evaluation in PI  [ref]42, or approximate Bellman update of VI [ref]42  .\nThe application of ADP to policy-based methods also enables function approximation to be used to handle the curse of dimensionality [ref]42  while incorporating approximate policy evaluation (e.g., robust TD learning  ).\nIt should be noted there also exists another complementary line of research, on studying robust MDP with uncertainty set beyond (𝐬,𝐚)𝐬𝐚(\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{a})-rectangularity    . In addition to the prior developments in the context of dynamic programming, there has been a rising interests in developing first-order methods for solving the special case of (1.5), where there is no uncertainty in the transition (e.g., 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} being a singleton).\nBy using first-order information of objective (1.5) to update the policy,\nthese policy-based methods are thus termed policy gradient methods (PGM), with their convergence behavior extensively studied in the literature.\nSublinear convergence of the optimality gap for constant stepsize PGMs have been established in [ref]1 1,\nand linearly converging variants have been proposed in 1   ,\nwith local superlinear convergence studied in 5 .\n5 recently further characterizes the policy convergence of a PGM variant.\nMoreover, stochastic PGMs, which utilize sample to estimate the first-order information, have also been proposed in 1  8, and both sample and iteration complexity have been studied therein.\nComplementary to the policy-based first-order methods,  propose an accelerated first-order value-based method, and establish improved dependence on discount factor compared to value iteration. In contrast to the aforementioned developments of PGMs for solving non-robust MDP,\nsolving robust MDP (1.5) with first-order methods has been largely under-explored.\nSpecifically,  propose a first-order value-based method derived based on value iteration,\nwhile  seems to be the only PGM variant to date that directly aims to solve (1.5), which focuses on a subclass of polyhedral uncertainty.\nGiven the abundant empirical observations on the unsatisfactory performance of PGM-trained RL agents when the deployment environment differs from the training environment 9 , there seems to be a practical need to develop first-order policy-based methods that can learn a policy with robustness guarantees. Our contributions mainly exist in the the following aspects.\nFirst, we establish some new structural results for the robust Markov decision process.\nIn particular, we discuss the differentiability of robust values, a robust version of performance difference lemma (c.f., ), and a novel variational inequality perspective on solving robust MDP.\nThese results serve as a crucial component that facilitates our ensuing computational development, and might be of independent interests for other algorithmic studies (e.g., natural robust policy gradient, see Section 3). Second, we develop a first-order policy-based method, named robust policy mirror descent (RPMD), for solving the robust MDP problem (1.5).\nDespite the non-convex and non-smooth structure of the objective (see ), RPMD finds an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-optimal policy in 𝒪​(log⁡(1/ϵ))𝒪1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(\\log(1/\\epsilon)) iterations.\nThe established convergence results hold for any Bregman divergence, as long as the policy space has a bounded distance to the initial policy measured in the same divergence.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no existing PGM can attain the obtained iteration complexity when solving (1.5).\nIn addition, we also establish the sublinear convergence of constant-stepsize RPMD, for both Euclidean Bregman divergence,\nand a more general class of Bregman divergence applied to any relatively strongly convex uncertainty set. Finally, we develop stochastic variants of the RPMD method, named SRPMD, when the first-order information is only available through online interactions with the nominal environment.\nFor general Bregman divergences, we show that SRPMD with linearly increasing stepsizes converges linearly up to the noise level, and consequently determine an 𝒪​(1/ϵ2)𝒪1superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^{2}) sample complexity.\nFor Euclidean Bregman divergence, we show an 𝒪​(1/ϵ3)𝒪1superscriptitalic-ϵ3\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^{3}) sample complexity with a properly chosen constant stepsize.\nTo the best of our knowledge, all the developed sample complexity results of RPMD appear to be new for PGM methods applied to the robust MDP problem. The rest of this manuscript is organized as follows.\nSection 2 makes some structural observations on the robust Markov decision process that will prove useful in the ensuing algorithmic developments.\nSection 3 introduces the deterministic RPMD method and establish its convergence properties.\nSection 4 develops the stochastic variants of RPMD when only stochastic first-order information is available.\nSection 5 then establishes the sample complexity for the proposed stochastic RPMD methods.\nFinally, concluding remarks are made in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: consists of a set of MDPs, where 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} and 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} denote the state and action space, respectively; ℙu:𝒮×𝒜→[ref]0 [ref]1:subscriptℙ𝑢→𝒮𝒜01\\mathbb{P}_{u}:{\\mathcal{S}}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\to[ref]0 [ref]1 denotes the transition kernel, indexed by u∈𝒰𝑢𝒰u\\in\\mathcal{U};\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
