      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Learning of Multivariate Time Series with Temporal Irregularity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are three primary approaches to handling irregular sampling. The first approach involves converting an irregularly sampled time series into one with evenly spaced time intervals before making predictions. The discretization method selects a larger uniformly spaced time interval, with each interval containing several observations, and computes the mean of these observations to represent the interval’s value. However, this method loses local information due to averaging. In contrast, the imputation method interpolates the missing values of the lower-frequency components instead of averaging the higher-frequency components. It keeps the local information of the higher-frequency components intact and uses models such as the Gaussian Process regression model , the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) , and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ref]11 to impute the missing values of the lower-frequency components. The next approach proposes using end-to-end models to avoid the \"interpolate first and predict later\" idea. This approach modifies classical recurrent architectures to encode the information embedded in irregular temporal patterns. For example, Che et al. [ref]12 added an exponential decay mechanism in the hidden state. Neil et al.  extended the Long short-term memory (LSTM) unit by adding a new time gate controlled by a parametrized oscillation with a frequency range. Additionally, Mozer et al. [ref]14 incorporated multiple time scales of the hidden state and made a context-dependent selection of time scales for information storage and retrieval. However, harnessing the uneven spacing property in the data and its asynchronous property is indirect using this approach and is less coherent compared to the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) approach. Chen et al.  introduced the Neural ODE framework by extending discrete neural networks into continuous-time networks, which makes it a natural candidate for handling data with arbitrarily small time intervals. For instance, De Brouwer et al.  embedded the Neural ODEs in the classical Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cell and derived the dynamics of the hidden state; Rubanova et al.  proposed the Latent ODE and were the first to embed Neural ODEs in a Variational Autoencoder to address the problem of irregularly sampled time series. Unlike the classical GRU cell, which keeps the hidden state constant in the absence of observations, the continuous-time GRU cell learns to evolve the hidden state using Neural ODEs. Building upon similar ideas, Lechner et al.  transformed the standard LSTM into a continuous version to address the issues of gradient vanishing and exploding. In section 2.1 and 2.2, we will provide more background on Neural ODEs and how to utilize them to model irregularly sampled data.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: of the higher-frequency components intact and uses models such as the Gaussian Process regression model , the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) , and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ref]11 to impute the missing values of the lower-frequency components. The next approach proposes using end-to-end models to avoid the \"interpolate first and predict later\" idea.
