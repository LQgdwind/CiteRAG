      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Transferable Parameters for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUDA is gaining momentum in the past decade as an effective strategy to cope with the distribution shift cross domains. Previous works have fulfilled in-depth research on theoretical and methodological aspects, which have firmly established the research foundation of this topic. From the view of the distribution shift hypothesis, the existing theoretical works can be broadly categorized into the covariate shift assumption-based works and the target shift assumption-based works. (i) The covariate shift assumption-based works suppose the marginal distributions of features cross domains differ, and all other conditions are consistent. The main idea lies in the distribution distances compared to conventional supervised learning. One of the pioneering distribution distances in this line was proposed by Ben-David et al.  who proposed the first distribution distance termed ℋ​Δ​ℋℋΔℋ\\mathcal{H}\\Delta\\mathcal{H} distance that defeats the difficulties of empirical risk estimation with limited samples. Motivated by ℋ​Δ​ℋℋΔℋ\\mathcal{H}\\Delta\\mathcal{H} distance, Mansour et al. [ref]7 proposed the novel distance, discrepancy distance, that is tailored to generalized loss functions, and derived the data-dependent Rademacher complexity learning bounds. Zhang et al.  proposed the margin disparity discrepancy and derived the rigorous margin-based generalization bounds to multi-classification domain adaptation tasks for the first time. (ii) The target shift assumption-based works assume that the source and target label distributions probably substantially differ. Representative works include: Zhang et al.  investigated this assumption from a causal inference perspective; Germain et al. [ref]19 introduced the first PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis for this assumption; In this context, Courty et al. 0 proposed the joint distribution optimal transportation theory. Note that our method is suitable for both types of assumptions. On par with these theoretical findings, there is rich progress in UDA algorithms. Previous works can be assorted into the importance estimation, the moment matching, the pseudo labeling, and the adversarial training. (i) The philosophy behind the importance estimation is to find distribution intersection cross domains. The KLIEP algorithm proposed by Sugiyama et al. 1 is the representative work. (ii) The core idea behind the moment matching is to minimize the discrepancy of high-dimensional statistics cross domains. Some representative works include maximum mean discrepancy 2, transfer component analysis , and deep adaptation networks  3. (iii) The main idea behind the pseudo labeling is attempting to assign pseudo labels to target domain samples and selecting reliable labels to complete supervised training. Some characteristic works involve transduction with domain shift algorihtm 4, asymmetric tri-training 5, and collaborative and adversarial network 6. (iv) Another route of research studies on the interesting adversarial training and introduces a domain discriminator to distinguish the samples between two domains for learning the domain-invariant representation 7 . One of the pioneering theoretical works in this line was conducted by Ganin et al.  who proposed the first deep adversarial adaptation network. Our study clearly differs from current deep UDA approaches in two aspects. First, this study attempts to learn invariant parameters rather than learning invariant representations so that we reach the essence of the distribution shift problem. Second, our proposal is so general and flexible that it can be integrated into any deep UDA network, i.e., our proposal is compatible with any of these networks with a simple modification. Existing UDA algorithms have significant application values in image classification, semantic segmentation, regression (e.g., 2D keypoint detection), etc. 2D keypoint detection is an innovative task that has become a hot topic in recent years due to its widespread utility in computer vision applications. Representative works include single round message passing networks 8, stacked hourglass networks 9, deconvolutional layers based ResNet , and high-resolution networks . Notably, Jiang et al.  proposed the regressive domain adaptation (RegDA) for unsupervised 2D keypoint detection. Note that our method is not intended to refine the network architecture further but to validate the effectiveness of transferable parameter learning of domain adaptation in 2D keypoint detection. The lottery ticket hypothesis  confirms that overparameterized DNNs contain winning tickets (parameters) that are important for generalization. With this part of winning tickets, one can train the tiny and sparsified networks to generalize well and exceed the test accuracy of the original DNNs. Although the lottery ticket hypothesis inspires this study, this study is essentially different from it. The lottery ticket hypothesis aims to achieve network compression. It focuses on gaining a sparsified subnetwork that has competitive generalization performance compared with the original network. This paper focuses on the UDA problem. We aim to find the transferable and untransferable parameters to reduce the side effect of domain-specific information, which significantly advances the deep UDA network’s generalization performance on target domains. Recent few interesting works have validated the effectiveness of lottery ticket hypothesis on learning with noisy labels  , and out-of-distribution generalizaiton . Different from these extensions, we, for the first time, verify that the learning of transferable parameters is feasible in UDA, propose a novel transferable/untransferable ratio estimation method, and investigate which module parameters are dividable to find winning tickets in UDA networks.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: distance that defeats the difficulties of empirical risk estimation with limited samples.
