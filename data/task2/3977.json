Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Besides, the CLIP R-Precision  exploits the CLIP  showing a better retrieval performance and human judgment correlation. However, false-negative candidates (accidentally correlated) or strong negative candidates (totally unrelated) may interfere with the accurate assessment . To evaluate the quality of individual objects, the SOA  attempts to measure the object detection accuracy using the YOLOv3 \nbased on the object classes that appeared in the text but cannot consider other factors.\nCaption generation  is another approach using the vision-and-language pre-trained model. The motivation is the cyclic consistency that the generated caption from the generated image should match with the text for image generation. However, the model bias including object hallucination  and the accumulated errors from metric are drawbacks.\nDiagnostic datasets.\nPark et al.  provide the curated splits of the CUB   and Flowers  to assess unseen color and shape compositions in the narrow domains.\nDALL-Eval  proposed a diagnostic dataset PaintSkills to evaluate visual reasoning skills to assess models based on this dataset.\nSince the dataset is generated from a 3D simulator using limited configurations, the data distributions deviate from other real-world datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Traditional metrics.\nOne of the widely used metrics is the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [ref]5 that measures the distributional difference between synthetic (fake) and real-world images (real).\nTraining and validation distributions are independent, making a model that fails to match the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
