      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Study on Bugs Inside PyTorch: A Replication Study\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent advances in deep learning research allied to the wide availability of large datasets have pushed deep learning components into our everyday systems.\nDeep learning-powered systems have successfully been deployed in multiple domains, from medicine [ref]1 to self-driving cars [ref]2, to automate highly complex tasks due to their capabilities of learning complex data patterns.\nA major catalyst for this widespread use of deep learning components is the availability of mature and easy to use deep learning libraries.\nLibraries like PyTorch [ref]3 and TensorFlow  abstract much of the complexity of defining, training, and testing deep learning components with a high-level functional API, and are becoming widely popular.\nIn the Stack Overflow survey of 2022, deep learning libraries like PyTorch were reportedly used by 11% of all participants of the survey . While very popular DL libraries help empower (artificially) intelligent behaviour in a myriad of systems, bugs in those libraries may have dire consequences.\nDefects in the underlying DL library could eventually propagate as observable failures in the systems that depend on it.\nIn fact, many authors in prior studies done on bugs in software systems using DL techniques,    suggest that such bugs may be impacted by defects found in the DL libraries used as studied by Tambon et al. . Therefore, understanding and identifying defects in DL libraries are essential for ensuring the quality of the systems that rely on them. Two studies from Jia et al.   pioneered an investigation on bugs inside the TensorFlow library.\nThe authors provided a comprehensive understanding of potential links between symptoms and root causes of bugs inside TensorFlow, in addition to analyzing which repair patterns were used when fixing bugs. To further build and strengthen our empirical knowledge in the area, we define symptoms as the faulty behaviour of a software that indicates a possibility of a bug in the program, such as program crashes or a functionality not providing expected results, with root causes being the reason behind why such a bug has appeared, such as the wrong implementation of an algorithm or a mis-configuration of the software. In addition, we define repair patterns as reoccurring patterns used to fix a bug, such as adding a value checker or throwing an exception when applicable. In this paper, we replicate the study conducted by Jia et al.  on the PyTorch library [ref]3, another popular Python library for developing deep learning systems. PyTorch is used in many critical applications, with Tesla’s Autopilot  and Uber’s Pyro  being notable examples. We argue that this replication study on PyTorch which complements the work done by Jia et al. on TensorFlow, will benefit the machine learning community by having a comprehensive overview of the bug characteristics and its corresponding repair patterns inside the two most popular DL libraries. In addition, by having three similar research questions as Jia et al. , we can have a direct comparison to see the similarities and differences of bugs in terms of the symptoms, causes, components affected, and repair patterns. We find that while some results in PyTorch are similar to those found in TensorFlow , there are also dissimilarities. For example, we find that crash and functional error are most frequent symptoms of bugs, which matches their findings. However, we observe processing as a low occurring root cause, which is the top root cause in the TensorFlow study. Our contributions in this paper are as follows: We study 194 bugs in the popular DL library PyTorch to understand the bug characteristics and how the bugs are fixed. We compare our results with a similar study done on TensorFlow to outline the similarities and differences between these two frameworks. To promote further research in the area, we also share our replication package, containing all bugs analyzed, our coding scheme, and more detailed results ***https://github.com/datasetsharing/pytorchbugdataset. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next Section, we discuss the related works. In Section III we outline our study’s design, explain our research questions and our data collection and curation method. In Sections IV, V, and VI we describe our findings for each of our research questions. In Section VII, we discussed the implications of our study. In Section VIII, we outline the threats to our results’ validity, and finally in Section IX we conclude our paper and propose areas for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: wide availability of large datasets have pushed deep learning components into our everyday systems.\nDeep learning-powered systems have successfully been deployed in multiple domains, from medicine [ref]1 to self-driving cars [ref]2, to automate highly complex tasks due to their capabilities of learning complex data patterns.\nA major catalyst for this widespread use of deep learning components\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
