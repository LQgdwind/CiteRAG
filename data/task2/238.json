      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Inverse Rendering of Faces from Real-world Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSynthetic data: To conduct supervised training for our model, we make use of three synthetic datasets. Among them, one is an existing dataset and the other two are created by us based on other datasets. We first use the synthetic dataset provided by SfSNet , denoted as SfSNet-syn. This dataset contains 12,500 identities. 15 images are rendered for each identity under varying illuminations and poses. The images are rendered by fitting the 3DMM . In total, there are 187,500 images in this dataset. However, this dataset does not take expression variations and global illuminations into consideration.\nTherefore we create two other synthetic datasets Expre-syn and Caric-syn to compensate for this.\nFor Expre-syn, we randomly choose 114 video clips from VoxCeleb [ref]28 and each clip corresponds to one identity.\nWe fit the Basel Face Model  for each frame to approximate realistic poses and expressions under four random viewpoints and five random illuminations using Mitsuba .\nSix different expressions are fitted for each identity.\nIn total we obtain 13,680 images in Expre-syn.\nSince in practice there can be some exaggerated expressions that do not appear in VoxCeleb, we further create Caric-syn to increase expression variations with 100 virtual identities.\nFor each identity, we render four distinct poses with six caricature expressions under five random lighting conditions, resulting in 12,000 synthetic face images.\nOur data generation process inherently considers global illumination.\nFor each face image 𝐈gsubscript𝐈𝑔\\mathbf{I}_{g}, we also obtain the corresponding albedo 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, normal 𝐍𝐍\\mathbf{N}, lighting 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L}, residual map 𝐑𝐑\\mathbf{R}, and face image 𝐈lsubscript𝐈𝑙\\mathbf{I}_{l} with local illumination.\nA summary of the synthetic data is given in Table 1.\nWe use images for one identity from each of Expre-syn and Caric-syn for testing and all the rest together with SfSNet-syn for training. In addition, to train AlignNet, we further aggregate albedo and normal in Expre-syn and Caric-syn. Specifically, we add various textures into synthetic albedos to help A​l​i​g​n​N​e​ta𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑎AlignNet_{a} focus on learning displacements.\nWe create 50 texture styles and randomly transfer them onto face albedos.\nWe also perform shape deformation on synthetic face models to avoid strong face priors in A​l​i​g​n​N​e​tn𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑛AlignNet_{n}.\nWe design 20 different deformations on faces and build a linear combination basis. The deformations are generated using a sketch-based modelling system .\nIn total, we have 540 different albedos under four viewpoints and six expressions for A​l​i​g​n​N​e​ta𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑎AlignNet_{a} training, and 540 identities with four viewpoints and six deformation styles (produced by randomly weighting the linear deformation bases) for A​l​i​g​n​N​e​tn𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑛AlignNet_{n}.\nNote that we only use this dataset to train AlignNet. Real data:\nWe extract 114 real video clips from the 300VW dataset .\nEach clip corresponds to one identity (with four viewpoints and five illuminations).\nThere are 3,462 images in total.\nThis dataset contains rich but non-exaggerated expressions.\nIt is used for weakly supervised training only.\nFor qualitative evaluations, we use face images in CelebA  by picking 500 images with various face attributes(e.g., bread, glasses, and age). For quantitative evaluation on normal recovery, we adopt Photoface [ref]45, which is created under various harsh illumination conditions and captures the ground truth of face normal. Implementation details: Our network architecture is implemented in TensorFlow. The input images are all of size 128×\\times128.\nWe train our model using a batch size of four using the learning rate of 5e-4 with a decay rate of 0.98 and a decay step of five.\nAs a preparation procedure, we pre-train A​l​i​g​n​N​e​ta𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑎AlignNet_{a} and A​l​i​g​n​N​e​tn𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑛AlignNet_{n} with synthetic data, with a learning rate of 5e-4 for 30 epochs using a batch size of eight.\nWe then train our inverse rendering model in three stages: first, we train our IlluRes-SfSNet for 20 epochs on the combined synthetic dataset of SfSNet-syn, Caric-syn , and Expre-syn; second, we train IlluRes-SfSNet on real data by using the pre-trained A​l​i​g​n​N​e​ta𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑎AlignNet_{a} and A​l​i​g​n​N​e​tn𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑛AlignNet_{n} to provide weak supervision for 20 epochs; and third, we jointly fine-tune the entire network that includes IlluRes-SfSNet, A​l​i​g​n​N​e​ta𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑎AlignNet_{a} and A​l​i​g​n​N​e​tn𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑛AlignNet_{n} on both real and synthetic data.\nDuring the first stage of training, for each epoch we randomly sample 30,000\nimages from SfSNet-syn and use all the training data from Caric-syn (13,560 images) and Expre-syn (11,880 images) to avoid the training being biased by SfSNet-syn. During the second stage of training, we use the real videos containing 3,487 images, Caric-syn, and Expre-syn on the fixed A​l​i​g​n​N​e​t{a,n}𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑁𝑒subscript𝑡𝑎𝑛AlignNet_{\\{a,n\\}} to train IlluRes-SfSNet. In each epoch, we randomly sample 30,000 pairs of real images and 16,272 pairs of Expre-syn images.\nAt the last stage, we use synthetic and real data to fine tune the entire network.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: illuminations into consideration.\nTherefore we create two other synthetic datasets Expre-syn and Caric-syn to compensate for this.\nFor Expre-syn, we randomly choose 114 video clips from VoxCeleb [ref]28 and each clip corresponds to one identity.\nWe fit the Basel Face Model  for each frame to approximate realistic poses and expressions under four random viewpoints and five random\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
