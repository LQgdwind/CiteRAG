      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Learning with Nesterov Accelerated Gradient\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning was first proposed in FedAvg [ref]4. It allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global learned model without sharing their raw data. Apart from FedAvg, there are many algorithms/strategies that have been studied in FL (e.g., proximity , quantization [ref]19, differential privacy , Vehicular FL  etc.).\nThe idea of proximity is to apply an additional term on the basis of gradient descent by using the information of the global model to correct the local update. FedProx  employs the proximal term to restrict\nthe local updates to be closer to the global model. SCAFFOLD  employs the control variate to prevent “client-drift” . The idea of the quantization technique is to reduce the size of transmission payload so as to reduce the communication overhead. FedPAQ [ref]19 employs quantization operators on\nthe transmitted massages while ACGD [ref]20 employs gradient compression for communication. For Secure FL, NbAFL  and  apply the Differential Privacy (DP)  in FL environment to protect the information leakage of the original raw data. In , authors proposes an adaptive framework consisting of blockchain  and Reinforcement Learning (RL)  in FL to achieve higher trust and security. For Vehicular FL, FVC  and FVN  extend the traditional vehicular network  to the FL environment, where the vehicular network consists of groups of moving or stationary vehicles connected by a wireless network. However, these sub-topics are not the focus in this paper. We focus on momentum . The mainstream FL sub-topics are summarized in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Federated Learning was first proposed in FedAvg [ref]4. It allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global learned model without sharing their raw data. Apart from FedAvg, there are many algorithms/strategies that have been studied in FL\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
