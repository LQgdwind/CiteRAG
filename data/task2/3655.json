      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Few-Shot Object Detection via Knowledge Inheritance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct extensive comparisons with existing methods\nacross three different benchmarks with hierarchical difficulty, i.e. PASCAL VOC (preliminary), COCO (moderate) and LVIS (difficult).\nConcretely, following [ref]6, three different base/novel class splits are considered for PASCAL VOC, where there are 15 base classes and 5 novel classes each with K=1,2,3,5,10ùêæ123510K=1,2,3,5,10 instance(s) for few-shot transfer. For consistency, we adopt the same few-shot dataset Df‚Äãe‚Äãwsubscriptùê∑ùëìùëíùë§D_{few} with [ref]6 and use VOC 2007 test set for evaluation.\nFor COCO, we treat the 20 classes that are overlapped with PASCAL VOC as novel classes while the rest as base classes.\nWe follow recent works [ref]15 [ref]9 to report the results averaged over 10 random runs on COCO val2017 set with K=10,30ùêæ1030K=10,30.\nFor LVIS, we group the frequent and common classes as base split, and the rare classes as novel split. Following [ref]15, we construct a balanced few-shot dataset by sampling 10 instances for each base class while including all for novel classes. All results are reported with the standard evaluation protocol in each benchmark.\nFinally, we notice that DeFRCN¬† uses a different base detector architecture Faster R-CNN with ResNet101-C4 from the prevailing one, i.e., Faster R-CNN with ResNet101-FPN. For fairness, we build our PTF+KI upon DeFRCN when compared with it. Note that the post-processing PCB module proposed by DeFRCN is not applied in all experiments for the sake of efficiency. Implementation details. We adopt Faster R-CNN¬† as our base detector with ResNet101-FPN¬†  and ResNet101-C4 as backbone. For training details, we follow the default hyperparameters in detectron2¬†, where models are trained with momentum (0.9) SGD optimizer, batch size of 16, and weight decay of 1e-4. An initial learning rate 0.02 is used during base pretraining and 0.02 for PASCAL VOC or 0.01 for COCO and LVIS during few-shot transfer. For 10-shot setting, 500 / 1000 / 3000 iterations are taken during few-shot transfer for PASCAL VOC / COCO / LVIS respectively.\nAll experiments are run on four RTX 2080 Ti GPUs. \n\n\n\nMethod/Shot\nBackbone\n3\n10\n\nbAP\nnAP\nbAP\nnAP\n\nFRCN+ft-full¬†[ref]15\n\n66.1\n29.0\n66.0\n45.5\n\nMeta R-CNN¬†\n\n64.8\n35.0\n67.9\n51.5\n\nFSDetView¬†[ref]9\n\n65.9\n42.2\n69.1\n57.4\n\nMPSR‚Ä†‚Ä†\\dagger¬†\n\n67.6\n48.9\n71.3\n60.7\n\nTFA w/ cos¬†[ref]15\n\n79.1\n44.7\n78.4\n56.0\n\nFSCE‚Ä†‚Ä†\\dagger¬†\n\n74.3\n49.6\n76.7\n61.5\n\nSRR-FSD¬†7\n\n78.2\n51.3\n78.2\n56.8\n\nFSODu‚ÄãpsuperscriptFSODùë¢ùëù\\text{FSOD}^{up}¬†\n\n66.3\n50.3\n69.7\n61.7\n\nTrain base only\n\n81.0\n-\n81.0\n-\n\nPTF (Ours)\n\n78.9\n52.2\n79.3\n61.9\n\nPTF+KI (Ours)\n\n\nFRCN w/\nR-101 FPN\n\n78.3\n54.1\n78.7\n64.1\n\nDeFRCN‚Ä†‚Ä†\\dagger¬†\n\n76.1\n61.9\n77.0\n66.8\n\nTrain base only\n\n80.3\n-\n80.3\n-\n\nPTF+KI (Ours)\n\n\nFRCN w/\nR-101 C4\n\n78.0\n63.3\n78.5\n67.6\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: extensive comparisons with existing methods\nacross three different benchmarks with hierarchical difficulty, i.e. PASCAL VOC (preliminary), COCO (moderate) and LVIS (difficult).\nConcretely, following [ref]6, three different base/novel class splits are considered for PASCAL VOC, where there are 15 base classes and 5 novel classes each with K=1,2,3,5,10ùêæ123510K=1,2,3,5,10 instance(s) for few-shot\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
