      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Computation Using Spatial-Photonic Ising Machines: Utilizing Low-Rank and Circulant Matrix Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe demand for computational power to solve large-scale optimization problems is continually increasing in fields such as synthetic biology [ref]1, drug discovery , machine learning , and materials science  . However, many optimization problems of practical interest are NP-hard, meaning the resources required to solve them grow exponentially with problem size . At the same time, artificial intelligence systems, including large language models with a rapidly increasing number of parameters, are leading to unsustainable growth in power consumption at data centers . This has spurred interest in analog physical devices that can address these computational challenges with far greater power efficiency than classical computers. Various physical platforms are being explored, including exciton-polariton condensates     , lasers   , and degenerate optical parametric oscillators   . Many of these platforms are known as Ising machines, which aim to solve an optimization problem called the Ising problem by minimizing the Ising Hamiltonian: where spins si=±1subscript𝑠𝑖plus-or-minus1s_{i}=\\pm 1. Although this problem originates from a model of ferromagnetism, where the first term is the coupling term with the coupling strengths determined by matrix 𝐉𝐉\\mathbf{J} and the second term represents the external magnetic field of strength 𝐡𝐡\\mathbf{h}, many NP problems have been mapped to it with only polynomial overhead , making it highly significant beyond its original context. Ising machines based on spatial light modulators (SLMs) have shown their effectiveness in finding the ground state of Ising Hamiltonians, mainly due to their scalability 0. However, current experimental implementations of spatial-photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) primarily use Mattis-type coupling matrices 0 1 2. The Mattis-type matrix 𝐉𝐉\\mathbf{J} is defined as the outer product of two identical vectors: This formulation results in a rank-1 matrix with N𝑁N degrees of freedom, where N𝑁N is the dimensionality of the vector 𝝃𝝃\\boldsymbol{\\xi}. Typically, the coupling matrix of an Ising Hamiltonian can be any real symmetric matrix with zeros on its diagonal, encompassing up to N​(N−1)/2𝑁𝑁12N(N-1)/2 degrees of freedom and a rank that does not exceed N𝑁N. This restriction significantly limits the variety of Ising Hamiltonians that SPIMs can effectively realize. Recent advancements have expanded the types of matrices that SPIMs can implement, thanks to innovations like the quadrature method 3, the correlation function method 4, and the linear combination method 5. The quadrature method faces a specific challenge: for a given coupling matrix Ji​jsubscript𝐽𝑖𝑗J_{ij}, it is not always clear whether and how it can be decomposed into quadrature components that, when recombined, accurately reproduce the desired matrix. In contrast, the correlation function method allows for the evaluation of matrices characterized by components of the form where G​(i−j)𝐺𝑖𝑗G(i-j) can be arbitrary function. The Ising Hamiltonian can be effectively evaluated using the correlation function method by calculating the correlation function of measured intensity values from SPIM against a distribution function g𝑔g, derived via the inverse Fourier transform of the function G​(i−j)𝐺𝑖𝑗G(i-j). While this method broadens the range of matrices that can be represented, it introduces a limitation: the dependency of the additional factor G𝐺G solely on the difference between spin indices i−j𝑖𝑗i-j restricts output to circulant matrices. Consequently, this method can only represent Ising problems with periodic geometrical properties. The linear combination method, on the other hand, theoretically allows for the representation of arbitrary matrices. This is achieved by decomposing the required coupling matrix into a linear combination of Mattis-type matrices: Each Mattis-type matrix is then sequentially realized in the SPIM, and all outputs are electronically combined to produce the desired Ising Hamiltonian with the accurate coupling matrix. Theoretically, if rank R=N𝑅𝑁R=N, any arbitrary matrix Ji​jsubscript𝐽𝑖𝑗J_{ij} can be represented, although the number of optical adjustments and readouts required also scales as O​(N)𝑂𝑁O(N). Therefore, it is crucial to investigate whether computationally challenging problems of fixed rank R𝑅R, which does not increase with problem size, can be represented. Given that rank⁡(A+B)≤rank⁡(A)+rank⁡(B)rank𝐴𝐵rank𝐴rank𝐵\\operatorname{rank}(A+B)\\leq\\operatorname{rank}(A)+\\operatorname{rank}(B), and rank⁡(ξi​ξj)=1ranksubscript𝜉𝑖subscript𝜉𝑗1\\operatorname{rank}(\\xi_{i}\\xi_{j})=1, the rank of 𝐉𝐉\\mathbf{J} is bounded by R𝑅R. This highlights the potential of solving challenging optimization problems that can be mapped to an Ising model with a low-rank coupling matrix. This paper identifies computationally significant problems suitable for efficient implementation on SPIM hardware or other hardware with similar coupling matrix limitations. Many NP-complete problems have already been mapped to Ising models 6; however, for effective implementation on SPIMs, these Ising models must have coupling matrices that are either low-rank or circulant. In Section II, we discuss the energy efficiency of SPIMs that can be utilized in unconventional hardware for optimization and machine learning applications. In Section III, we explore problems corresponding to Ising models with inherently low-rank coupling matrices and discuss the practical limitations of such models due to the increasing precision requirements of SPIM hardware. In Section IV, we examine the feasibility of finding approximate solutions to computational challenges by approximating them with low-rank Ising models. Notably, a practical optimization problem in finance is well approximated by this approach, allowing for efficient SPIM implementation. The potential applicability of low-rank matrices implementing a restricted Boltzmann machine on SPIM hardware is also briefly discussed. Section V introduces a new variant of an NP-hard problem, the constrained number partitioning (CNP) problem, highlighting its potential to achieve computational hardness with only a slowly increasing precision requirement, enabling existing SPIM hardware to address moderately sized hard problems even with limited precision. Finally, Section VI addresses translationally invariant problems that can be effectively resolved using the correlation function method with SPIMs 4. The following section discusses SPIMs’ performance metrics and inherent advantages, highlighting their potential across various computational tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The demand for computational power to solve large-scale optimization problems is continually increasing in fields such as synthetic biology [ref]1, drug discovery , machine learning , and materials science  .
