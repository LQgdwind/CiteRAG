      "content": "Paper Title: Iterative Multi-granular Image Editing using Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion models  [ref]9 are a class of probabilistic models that generates a sample from a data distribution,\n𝒙𝟎∼p​(𝒙𝟎)similar-tosubscript𝒙0𝑝subscript𝒙0\\bm{x_{0}}\\sim p(\\bm{x_{0}})\nby gradually denoising a normally distributed random variable 𝒙T∼𝒩​(𝟎,I)similar-tosubscript𝒙𝑇𝒩0I\\bm{x}_{T}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{0},\\textbf{I}), over T𝑇T iterations. The denoising process creates a series of intermediate samples 𝒙T,𝒙T−1,⋯,𝒙0subscript𝒙𝑇subscript𝒙𝑇1⋯subscript𝒙0\\bm{x}_{T},\\bm{x}_{T-1},\\cdots,\\bm{x}_{0}; with decreasing amount of noise. The amount of noise to be removed at each step is predicted by a neural network ϵθ​(𝒙t,t)subscriptitalic-ϵ𝜃subscript𝒙𝑡𝑡\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\bm{x}_{t},t), where t𝑡t is the denoising step. These models has been found to be extremely successful in synthesizing realistic images    when 𝒙i∈ℝW×H×3subscript𝒙𝑖superscriptℝ𝑊𝐻3\\bm{x}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{W\\times H\\times 3}. To reduce the computational requirements for training without degrading quality and flexibility, Rombach et al. proposed Latent Diffusion [ref]22, which does the diffusion process in the latent space of a pretrained VQ-VAE  encoder. Hence, the input image 𝒙0subscript𝒙0\\bm{x}_{0} is first projected into the latent space 𝒛0=ℰ​(𝒙0)subscript𝒛0ℰsubscript𝒙0\\bm{z}_{0}=\\mathcal{E}(\\bm{x}_{0}), where ℰ​(⋅)ℰ⋅\\mathcal{E}(\\cdot) is the VQ-VAE encoder and 𝒛0∈ℝw×h×4subscript𝒛0superscriptℝ𝑤ℎ4\\bm{z}_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{w\\times h\\times 4}, where w=W/24𝑤𝑊superscript24w=W/2^{4} and h=H/24ℎ𝐻superscript24h=H/2^{4} [ref]22.\nThe forward diffusion process uses a Markovian noise process q𝑞q, which gradually adds noise to 𝒛0subscript𝒛0\\bm{z}_{0} through 𝒛Tsubscript𝒛𝑇\\bm{z}_{T} with a Gaussian function following a variance schedule βtsubscript𝛽𝑡\\beta_{t}: Ho et al. [ref]9 showed that sampling 𝒛t∼q​(𝒛t|𝒛0)similar-tosubscript𝒛𝑡𝑞conditionalsubscript𝒛𝑡subscript𝒛0\\bm{z}_{t}\\sim q(\\bm{z}_{t}|\\bm{z}_{0}) need not be iterative, but instead can be as follows: where αt=1−βtsubscript𝛼𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡\\alpha_{t}=1-\\beta_{t} and α¯t=∏r=0tαrsubscript¯𝛼𝑡superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑟0𝑡subscript𝛼𝑟\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}=\\prod_{r=0}^{t}\\alpha_{r}. The reverse diffusion process learns ϵθ​(𝒛t,t)subscriptitalic-ϵ𝜃subscript𝒛𝑡𝑡\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\bm{z}_{t},t) to predict ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon from Eq. 3. The learning objective is as follows: To sample an image from a learned noise prediction function\n(loosely referred to as diffusion model henceforth) from 𝒛T∼𝒩​(𝟎,I)similar-tosubscript𝒛𝑇𝒩0I\\bm{z}_{T}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{0},\\textbf{I}), we iteratively apply the following step: where σt=βtsubscript𝜎𝑡subscript𝛽𝑡\\sigma_{t}=\\sqrt{\\beta_{t}}. We refer the readers to Ho et al. [ref]9 for more details on the sampling process. Finally, 𝒛0subscript𝒛0\\bm{z}_{0} is projected back to the image space by the VQ-VAE decoder 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}: 𝒙0=𝒟​(𝒛0)subscript𝒙0𝒟subscript𝒛0\\bm{x}_{0}=\\mathcal{D}(\\bm{z}_{0}). The diffusion model ϵθ​(⋅,⋅)subscriptitalic-ϵ𝜃⋅⋅\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\cdot,\\cdot) is generally implemented with a time-conditional UNet  architecture. It contains an encoder, middle layer and a decoder. Each of these modules contains multiple blocks with a residual convolutional layer, self-attention layer and cross-attention layer.\nThe diffusion model can be optionally augmented to consume an extra condition 𝒚𝒚\\bm{y} (like text, caption, canny-maps, segmentation masks, skeletal information etc.) as follows: ϵθ​(𝒛𝒕,t,𝒚)subscriptitalic-ϵ𝜃subscript𝒛𝒕𝑡𝒚\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\bm{z_{t}},t,\\bm{y}). The cross-attention layers effectively warps the extra conditioning into the diffusion model. Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have been effectively applied in image editing applications too. The major challenge is to make modifications specified via a textual condition 𝒚𝒚\\bm{y} to an existing image 𝒙0subscript𝒙0\\bm{x}_{0}. Methods like PnP , NTI , Imagic , DiffEdit  first invert 𝒙0subscript𝒙0\\bm{x}_{0} to 𝒛i​n​vsubscript𝒛𝑖𝑛𝑣\\bm{z}_{inv} using techniques similar to DDIM Inversion  , so that when they start the diffusion process (in Eq. 5) from 𝒛i​n​vsubscript𝒛𝑖𝑛𝑣\\bm{z}_{inv}, they will be able to get back 𝒙0subscript𝒙0\\bm{x}_{0}. Alternatively, approaches like InstructPix2Pix [ref]2 and Imagen Editor  learn few extra layers to directly pass 𝒙0subscript𝒙0\\bm{x}_{0} as input to the diffusion model. This approach retains better characteristics of the input image, as it side-steps the inversion process. We build EMILIE by extending InstructPix2Pix [ref]2 to support iterative and multi-granular control, as it has minimal changes from LDM [ref]22 (the input tensor 𝒛tsubscript𝒛𝑡\\bm{z}_{t} is augmented with four more channels to consume 𝒙0subscript𝒙0\\bm{x}_{0}, and the corresponding weights are initialized to zero. No other changes to LDM [ref]22), and that its trained model is publicly available.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Diffusion models  [ref]9 are a class of probabilistic models that generates a sample from a data distribution,\n𝒙𝟎∼p​(𝒙𝟎)similar-tosubscript𝒙0𝑝subscript𝒙0\\bm{x_{0}}\\sim p(\\bm{x_{0}})\nby gradually denoising a normally\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
