The state-of-the-art visual speech recognition (VSR) system relies on about 90K hours of transcribed training data .\nHowever, annotating such large amounts of data for every language is simply infeasible which sparked large interest to learn from unlabeled data.\nAV-HuBERT [ref]3 was the first self-supervised system to jointly learn speech representations from raw audio and video using masked-prediction.\nHowever, the training is not entirely end-to-end since the algorithm alternates between representation learning and creating targets using offline clustering.\nMore recently, RAVen [ref]6 introduced an end-to-end algorithm similar to data2vec  which trains separate encoder models for audio and visual data.\nHowever, separate encoders increase the number of model parameters, and their disjoint model design is also contradictory to the common understanding of the human perception system which is believed to fuse audio and vision early on .\nMorever, they do not push the limit of AVSR which tends to perform better than ASR  . In this paper, we introduce AV-data2vec (Audio-Visual data2vec) to address these issues by extending data2vec  from the unimodal case to learn joint audio-visual representations (Figure 1).\nAV-data2vec encodes masked audio-visual data and performs a masked prediction task of contextualized targets based on the unmasked input data.\nCompared to prior work, training is fully end-to-end and there is a single encoder for both audio and vision that can be used to perform AVSR.\nAnother difference to RAVen [ref]6 is that target representations include features of varying granularity which is achieved by averaging the outputs of multiple layers instead of only predicting high-level features produced by the final layer.\nThis enables a learning task over both low-level and high-level features.\nAV-data2vec unifies ASR, VSR and AVSR within a single framework and achieves state-of-the-art performance under all settings with the same amount of data/model size.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Both human speech production and perception are multimodal, producing acoustic and visual artifacts  [ref]2.\nLearning audio-visual speech representations helps to improve the robustness and accuracy of speech recognition in both noisy and clean settings [ref]3 .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
