      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Approximations for Euclidean 𝑘-means and 𝑘-median, via Nested Quasi-Independent Sets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe k𝑘k-means and k𝑘k-median problems are among the oldest and most fundamental\nclustering problems. Originally motivated by operations research and statistics problems when they\nfirst appeared in the late 50s  [ref]37  they\nare now at the heart of several unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning models and data mining techniques and are thus\na main part of the toolbox of modern data analysis techniques in a variety of fields.\nIn addition to their practical relevance, these two problems exhibit strong ties with some classic\noptimization problems, such as set cover, and understanding their complexity has thus been a\nlong standing problem which has inspired several breakthrough techniques. Given two sets 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} of points in a metric space and an\ninteger k𝑘k, the goal of the k𝑘k-median problem is to find a set S𝑆S of k𝑘k points\nin ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, called centers, minimizing\nthe sum of distances from each point in 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} to the closest point in S𝑆S. The goal\nof the k𝑘k-means problem is to minimize the sum of distances squared.\nThe complexity of the k𝑘k-median or k𝑘k-means problems heavily depends on the underlying metric space.\nIn general metric spaces, namely when the distances only need to obey the triangle inequality, the k𝑘k-median and\nk𝑘k-means problem\nare known to admit a 2.675-approximation  and a 9-approximation , respectively, and cannot be approximated\nbetter than 1+2/e∼1.736similar-to12𝑒1.7361+2/e\\sim 1.736 for k𝑘k-median and 1+8/e∼3.943similar-to18𝑒3.9431+8/e\\sim 3.943 for k𝑘k-means assuming P ≠\\neq NP.\nWe know that the upper and lower bounds are tight when we allow a running time of\nf​(k)​nO​(1)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑂1f(k)n^{O(1)} (i.e.: in the fixed-parameter tractability setting) for arbitrary computable functions f𝑓f 7,\nsuggesting that the lower bounds\ncannot be improved for\nthe general case either.\nWhen we turn to slightly more structured metric spaces such as Euclidean metrics\nthe picture changes drastically. While the problem remains NP-hard when the dimension d=2𝑑2d=2\n(and k𝑘k is large)  or k=2𝑘2k=2 (and d𝑑d is large) , both problems admit\n(1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithms with running times f​(k,ε)​n​d𝑓𝑘𝜀𝑛𝑑f(k,\\varepsilon)nd [ref]33, with an exponential dependency in k𝑘k, and\nf​(d,ε)​n​logO​(1)⁡n𝑓𝑑𝜀𝑛superscript𝑂1𝑛f(d,\\varepsilon)n\\log^{O(1)}n 5 4, with\na doubly exponential dependency in d𝑑d (the latter extends to doubling metrics), a prohibitive running time\nin practice. Arguably, the most practically important setting is when the input points lie in Euclidean space\nof large dimension and the number of clusters is non-constant, namely when both k𝑘k and d𝑑d are\npart of the input 111Note here that d𝑑d can always be assumed to\nbe of O​(log⁡k/ε−2)𝑂𝑘superscript𝜀2O(\\log k/\\varepsilon^{-2}) using dimensionality reduction techniques  (see also  for a slightly worse bound). Unfortunately,\nthe complexity of the problem in this regime is far from being understood. Recent results\nhave proven new inapproximability results:\nrespectively 1.17 and 1.07 for the Euclidean k-means and k-median problems assuming P ≠\\neq NP\nand 1.73 and 1.27 assuming the Johnson Coverage\nhypothesis of 8 9. For the continuous\ncase, the same series of papers show a hardness of 1.06 and 1.015 for Euclidean k𝑘k-means and k𝑘k-median respectively assuming P ≠\\neq NP\nand 1.36 and 1.08 assuming the Johnson-Coverage hypothesis\n(see also  for further related work on continuous k𝑘k-median and k𝑘k-means in other metric spaces).\nInterestingly, the above hardness results\nimplies that there is no algorithmic benefit that could be gained from the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-metric: Assuming the Johnson Coverage hypothesis the hardness bounds for k𝑘k-median and k𝑘k-means are the same in the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-metric that in general metrics 9. However,\nit seems plausible\nto leverage the structure of the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-metric to obtain approximation algorithms bypassing the\nlower bounds for the general metric or ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} case (e.g.: obtaining an approximation ratio better than 1+2/e12𝑒1+2/e for k𝑘k-median). In a breakthrough result, Ahmadian et al.  were the first to exploit the structure\nof high-dimensional Euclidean metrics to obtain better bounds than the current best-known bounds\nfor the general metric case. Concretely, they showed how to obtain a 6.3574-approximation\nfor k𝑘k-means (improving upon the 9-approximation of Kanungo et al. ) and a 1+8/3+ε≈2.633183𝜀2.6331+\\sqrt{8/3}+\\varepsilon\\approx 2.633-approximation\nfor k𝑘k-median (improving upon the 2.675-approximation for general metrics ).\nThe bound for k𝑘k-means was recently improved to a 6.1291-approximation (or more precisely, the unique real root to 4​x3−24​x2−3​x−1=04superscript𝑥324superscript𝑥23𝑥104x^{3}-24x^{2}-3x-1=0) by , by tweaking the analysis of Ahmadian et al. , and no progress has been made for Euclidean k𝑘k-median after . This very active line of research mixes both new hardness of approximation results and approximation algorithms\nand aims at answering a very fundamental question: How much can we leverage the Euclidean geometry\nto obtain better approximation algorithms?\nAnd conversely, what do we learn about Euclidean geometry when studying basic computational problems?\nOur results aim at making progress toward answering the above questions.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: and k𝑘k-median problems are among the oldest and most fundamental\nclustering problems.
