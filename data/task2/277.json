      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Homography Estimation for Dynamic Scenes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA homography models the global geometric transformation\nbetween two images. It not only directly serves as a motion model for many applications like video stabilization  [ref]24 and\nimage stitching  , but also is used to estimate\n3D motion and scene structure in algorithms, such as SLAM  and visual odometry . There are two categories of methods for homography estimation . Direct photometric-based approaches search for an optimal homography that minimizes the alignment error between two input images. Sparse feature-based approaches first estimate sparse feature correspondences between the input images and then compute the homography from them. The direct approaches are robust to images with large textureless regions but are challenged by large motion. In contrast, while sparse feature-based approaches are more robust to large motion, they heavily depend on the quality of feature correspondences, which are often difficult to obtain in textureless regions or blurry images. Recent deep homography estimation methods train a convolutional neural network to compute a homography between two images [ref]8   [ref]26. These deep neural network methods leverage both local and global features and can often perform better than the traditional methods on challenging scenarios, such as images lacking texture, as shown in the first example of Fig. 1. However, how they handle challenging scenarios such as dynamic scenes has not been studied, as existing methods focus on image pairs that can be fully aligned using homographies. In practice, dynamic objects are common. Traditional non-deep learning approaches use a robust estimation algorithm like RANSAC  to exclude them as outliers. We need to empower deep learning methods with the capability of being resistant to dynamic content to make them more practical. This paper investigates the problem of developing a deep learning method for homography estimation that is able to handle dynamic scenes without an iterative process like RANSAC. We first introduce a multi-scale deep convolutional\nneural network to handle image pairs with a large global motion. This network first estimates the homography from\nthe low-resolution version of the input image pair and then\nprogressively refines it at the increasingly higher resolutions.\nThe architecture of the base neural network at each stage follows a VGG-style\nnetwork similar to existing deep homography estimation\nmethods  [ref]26. Our study shows that this multi-scale neural network can handle not only a large global motion, but also dynamic scenes to some extent when properly trained. To address the problem of homography estimation of a dynamic scene in a more principled way, we need to detect dynamic content and eliminate their effect on homography estimation. Actually, homography estimation and dynamic content detection are two tightly coupled tasks. According to the research on multi-task learning, training a neural network to simultaneously perform these two tasks can greatly improve its performance for both tasks. Therefore, we enhance our multi-scale network such that it jointly estimates the dynamics mask and homography for an image pair. To train this network, in addition to the homography loss, we use an auxiliary loss function that compares the dynamics mask from the ground-truth dynamics map that is estimated from the training data. This multi-task learning training strategy empowers our multi-scale homography estimation network to robustly handle dynamic scenes. As there are no publicly available large number of image pairs or videos of scene dynamics that come with known ground-truth homographies, we collected 32,385 static video clips from YouTube with a Creative Commons license. We then applied random homography sequences to these static clips to produce the training examples. These examples contain a wide variety of dynamic scenes. As shown in our experiments, our neural networks trained on this synthetic dataset generalize well to real-world videos. This paper contributes to the research on homography estimation by investigating ways to develop and train deep neural networks that are robust against dynamic scenes.\nFirst, we build a large video dataset with dynamic scenes for training deep homography estimation neural networks. Second, we develop a multi-scale neural network that can handle large motion and show that by carefully training, it can already reasonably accommodate dynamic scenes. Third, we develop a dynamics-aware homography estimation network by integrating a dynamics mask network into our multi-scale network for simultaneous homography and dynamics estimation. Our experiments show that our method can handle various challenges, such as dynamic scenes, blurriness, lack of texture, and poor lighting conditions.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: A homography models the global geometric transformation\nbetween two images.
