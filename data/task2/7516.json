      "content": "Paper Title: Label Informed Contrastive Pretraining for Node Importance Estimation on Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContrastive Learning (CL) is a recent surging research topic. Its main concept involves learning representations or embeddings by contrasting positive samples against negative ones. One classical CL loss is NCE [ref]32, which distinguishes one positive sample against one negative samples; while InfoNCE [ref]32, distinguishing one positive sample against several negative samples, has become the more popular CL loss. CL has achieved great success for representation learning in visual data. DIM [ref]33 learns the representations of images by maximizing mutual information. Afterwards, many contrastive-based methods such as MoCo [ref]34 and SimCLR  are proposed and achieve significant performance gains.\nEncouraged by the success of CL in computer vision, CL has also been generalized to learn representations on graph-structured data. DGI  exploits DIMâ€™s mutual information maximization to learn the node-level representations, while InfoGraph  uses the similar methodology as DGI to learn graph-level representations. Later, many other methods such as GraphCL  and SimGCL  are proposed for graph contrastive learning. Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of CL in various machine learning problems; we thus adopt CL in the NIE problem to pretrain node embeddings by using InfoNCE loss to incorporate the prior knowledge of the preference for top nodes.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Learning (CL) is a recent surging research topic.
