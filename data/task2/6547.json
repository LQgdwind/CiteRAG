      "content": "Paper Title: Performance Scaling via Optimal Transport: Enabling Data Selection from Partially Revealed Sources\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent line of research on Data valuation aims to assess the relative importance of each data source (\"value’\") to machine learning applications [ref]3     [ref]8. While originally designed for data pricing, these values are frequently used to inform data selection  : in more detail, one can rank the data sources based on their values and select the data points with the highest values. While value-based selection shows some promising results, data values are not directly related to model performance and hence cannot inform the prediction of model performance resulting from the selected data. Besides, values for different data sources typically cannot be combined to measure the value of their compositions  [ref]8.\nNotably, distributional distances including Optimal Transport have seen a major presence in data valuation as an implicit proxy for model performance [ref]8 , but no connection has been made to directly relate data distance to model performance. Our work bridges this gap and directly addresses this long-standing problem. On another line, Coreset selection attempts to find a representative subset of data points to speed up learning . Coreset selection methods have been studied for different learning algorithms 0 1. For example, a popular coreset selection approach for neural networks is to cast data selection as a bilevel optimization problem that selects the optimal subset to maximize the performance evaluated on a validation dataset 2. However, coreset selection techniques rely on access to all the data samples to be chosen from, which limits their use in the partially observable setting.\nBesides, Predicting the resulting model performance associated with a dataset without performing actual training on it has attracted a lot of attention in different use cases, such as interpreting the model learning process 3 4–which leverages surrogate functions to model the black-box relationships between model performance and training data,\nor predicting performance under the distributional shift 5.\nOur work resembles the idea of predicting model performance from data but differs in the technique of leveraging the data distance in the performance predictor. Scaling laws, predicting how the model performance changes with the scale of training data, model parameters, and computation budget 6, have seen increasingly successful in a variety of tasks pertaining to vision and text processing 7. The performance of machine-learning models generally adheres to a power law relationship with the scale of these variables, which allows for predicting the model performance on larger scales with high precision 6 and provides a viable approach to predicting the potential usefulness of target data from only a small proportion of the set.  shows that data from different distributions generally scale at different rates. Our work provides a novel approach that materializes this dependency of scaling relationships with data distributions and achieves remarkable empirical results.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The recent line of research on Data valuation aims to assess the relative importance of each data source (\"value’\") to machine learning applications [ref]3     [ref]8.
