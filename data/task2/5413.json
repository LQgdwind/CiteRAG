      "content": "Paper Title: YOLO-based Object Detection in Industry 4.0 Fischertechnik Model Environment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe YOLOv1 design enables end-to-end training by dividing the input image into a set of S×S𝑆𝑆S\\times S grid cells that are convoluted to obtain spatially extracted features passed to fully connected layers to predict the output confidence scores and coordinates of the enclosed bounding boxes to the objects. YOLOv1 computes two confidence scores, namely the object and the class confidence score that we explain as follow. Within each grid cell, B=2𝐵2B=2 number of bounding boxes are found and their confidence scores are formally defined as P​(o)⋅I​O​U⋅𝑃𝑜𝐼𝑂𝑈P\\left(o\\right)\\cdot IOU, with P​(⋅)𝑃⋅P\\left(\\cdot\\right) to be the objectness probability. More precisely, the object confidence score represents the amount of the objectness, namely how likely a found box contains an object o𝑜o, and how accurate is the position of the boundary box. In practice, the box confidence score is calculated [ref]28 based on IOU, to be the intersection over union metric [ref]32, concerning the predicted and ground truth boxes of the object o𝑜o. In addition, a set of s∈ℕ𝑠ℕs\\in\\mathbb{N} number of conditional class probabilities P​(κs∣o)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝜅𝑠𝑜P\\left(\\kappa_{s}\\mid o\\right) concerning each grid cell is computed. Such probabilities matter when the centre of the object o𝑜o locates in a grid cell and reveal the likeliness of the found object in a cell to fall under each of the κssubscript𝜅𝑠\\kappa_{s} classes. This consequently means, if a grid cell has boxes with low object confidence scores P​(o)⋅I​O​U⋅𝑃𝑜𝐼𝑂𝑈P\\left(o\\right)\\cdot IOU, the lower will be the probability of that cell being responsible for any class. The class confidence score reads Here, a small confidence score P​(o)⋅I​O​U⋅𝑃𝑜𝐼𝑂𝑈P\\left(o\\right)\\cdot IOU results in a small class confidence score (1). This holds also true in case IOU is small and near to zero. Let us start investigating the YOLOv1 model architecture (See Fig. 3) from the last layer, comprised of 7×7×3077307\\times 7\\times 30 number of tensor predictors. As YOLOv1 network architecture is inspired by the GoogLeNet model [ref]33, with 242424 convolutional layers, that down samples the input training images of size 448×448×34484483448\\times 448\\times 3 into 7×7×3077307\\times 7\\times 30. A closer look to a slice of size 1×1×3011301\\times 1\\times 30 as a subset of the last YOLOv1 layer, that corresponds to a cell from input image, reveals the value of 303030 to be comprised of 202020 number of conditional probabilities P​(κs∣o)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝜅𝑠𝑜P\\left(\\kappa_{s}\\mid o\\right), as YOLOv1 uses the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge (VOC)  with 202020 labelled classes, along with two predictor subsets of sizes 1×1×51151\\times 1\\times 5 containing the x𝑥x and y𝑦y, as the centroid, hℎh and w𝑤w as the height and width and IOU score [ref]32 corresponding to two found boxes within each grid cell. The width and height of bounding boxes are normalized by their corresponding image width and height [ref]28, so that they fall between 00 and 111. In addition as reported by [ref]28, the bounding box coordinate centres x𝑥x and y𝑦y are also parameterized to be offsets of their corresponding grid cell locations so they are also bounded between 00 and 111. YOLOv1 unifies [ref]28 the separate components of object detection along with classification task based on a composed loss function from three parts, namely the confidence loss, the localisation loss and the classification loss. The localisation loss measures the errors in the predicted boundary box locations and sizes. Within each cell, only the box responsible for detecting the object is considered while the localisation loss is computed. The “responsible box” among all B𝐵B number of predicted boxes is the one with the highest current IOU with the ground truth during the training stage. In addition, the localisation loss concerns about small deviations depending if they occur in small or large boxes. This is to stress that while computing the IOU, small deviation in large boxes matter less than the same deviation in small boxes and is partially addresses by embedding the square roots of the bounding box width and height instead of the width and height as part of the localisation loss. With this, the localisation loss reads with 𝟙i​jo​b​jsubscriptsuperscript1𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑖𝑗\\mathds{1}^{obj}_{ij} to be 111 if the j𝑗j bounding box in i𝑖i cell is responsible for detecting the object, otherwise 00. The coefficient λc​o​o​r​dsubscript𝜆𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑑\\lambda_{coord} used within the localisation loss (2) can be well explained in contrast to the λn​o​o​b​jsubscript𝜆𝑛𝑜𝑜𝑏𝑗\\lambda_{noobj} used in confidence loss (3) as their usage is to avoid model instability during the training stage. In general, many grid cells within each training image represent the background and, as the training proceeds, their “object confidence” score predictors [ref]32 are pushed towards zero though they were falsely considered as box candidates. This alternatively leads to an overpower gradient emerging from the cells containing objects with their “object confidence” score predictors encouraged towards 111. This unbiased gradient results to an early instability during the training phase. Authors of [ref]28 resolved this issue by reducing the loss corresponding to those falsely accepted background bounding boxes by letting λn​o​o​b​jsubscript𝜆𝑛𝑜𝑜𝑏𝑗\\lambda_{noobj} in (3) to have a relatively smaller number 0.50.50.5 compared to a larger value 555 assigned in (2) to λc​o​o​r​dsubscript𝜆𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑑\\lambda_{coord} that still encourages YOLO to find bounding boxes truly representing the objects. The confidence loss reads with 𝟙i​jn​o​o​b​jsubscriptsuperscript1𝑛𝑜𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑖𝑗\\mathds{1}^{noobj}_{ij} to be 111 if the j𝑗j bounding box in i𝑖i cell contains no detected object, otherwise 00. Here, C𝐶C and C^^𝐶\\hat{C} both in  \\left[0,1\\right] are the ground truth and objectness scores. In case an object appears in a ground truth box then C^=1^𝐶1\\hat{C}=1 and otherwise equal to 00. The IOU computed between the predicted box and ground truth box is considered as C^^𝐶\\hat{C}. Next YOLOv1 opts to estimate a classification loss with Pi​(κs)subscript𝑃𝑖subscript𝜅𝑠P_{i}\\left(\\kappa_{s}\\right) obtained from (1) to represent the conditional probabilities of a detected object o𝑜o in a cell to fall under each of the classes κssubscript𝜅𝑠\\kappa_{s}. To this end, the YOLOv1 total loss is deduced in [ref]28 as\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the amount of the objectness, namely how likely a found box contains an object o𝑜o, and how accurate is the position of the boundary box.
