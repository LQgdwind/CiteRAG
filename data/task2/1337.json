Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: KVL-BERT: Knowledge Enhanced Visual-and-Linguistic BERT for Visual Commonsense Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe train and evaluate the models developed from the original BERTBASEsubscriptBERTBASE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{BASE}} and BERTLARGEsubscriptBERTLARGE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{LARGE}}, where the subscripts ‚ÄúBASE‚Äù and ‚ÄúLARGE‚Äù are used to distinguish them. We compare our KVL-BERT with the VL-BERT [ref]16. As shown in Table I, our KVL-BERTBASEsubscriptBERTBASE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{BASE}} outperforms VL-BERTBASEsubscriptBERTBASE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{BASE}} on the validation set, and the KVL-BERTLARGEsubscriptBERTLARGE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{LARGE}} outperforms VL-BERTLARGEsubscriptBERTLARGE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{LARGE}} on the validation and test sets. Compared to other task-specific models such as R2C , CCN [ref]11, HGL [ref]12, and existing pre-trained task-agnostic multimodal BERT models such as VisualBERT , ViLBERT , Unicoder-VL  and B2T2 , our KVL-BERT outperforms these single models (not ensemble ones) by a large margin. In addition to the results listed in Table I, some of the latest models have also achieved competitive results on the VCR task. UNITERLARGEsubscriptUNITERLARGE\\mathrm{UNITER}_{\\mathrm{LARGE}}  outperforms our KVL-BERTLARGEsubscriptBERTLARGE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{LARGE}} because it conducts two-stage pre-training: first pre-trains their model on task-agnostic pre-training datasets, and then pre-trains on the downstream task-specific dataset. VILLA  performs large-scale adversarial training (task-agnostic adversarial pre-training and task-specific adversarial pre-training) based on UNITER . ERNIE-ViL  adds extra scene graph prediction tasks (object prediction, attribute prediction and relationship prediction) in the pre-training phase, where the scene graph is constructed by parsing the text sentence into object nodes, attribute nodes and relationship nodes. These three models outperform us due to the additional pre-training. For the reason that pre-training is computationally expensive and time-consuming, we adopt the same comparison scheme as Unicoder-VL , comparing our KVL-BERTBASEsubscriptBERTBASE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{BASE}} with the UNITER‚Äôs one-stage pre-training model developed from the original BERTBASEsubscriptBERTBASE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{BASE}} model. It is denoted as UNITERBASEsubscriptUNITERBASE\\mathrm{UNITER}_{\\mathrm{BASE}}* in Table I, whose setting is similar to the our work. We directly use the results of UNITERBASEsubscriptUNITERBASE\\mathrm{UNITER}_{\\mathrm{BASE}}* published in the UNITER paper . As shown in Table I, our KVL-BERTBASEsubscriptBERTBASE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{BASE}} outperforms UNITERBASEsubscriptUNITERBASE\\mathrm{UNITER}_{\\mathrm{BASE}}* on the subtasks Q‚ÜíA‚ÜíùëÑùê¥Q\\rightarrow A and Q‚ÜíA‚ÄãR‚ÜíùëÑùê¥ùëÖQ\\rightarrow AR, which strongly confirm the effectiveness of our commonsense knowledge incorporation method. Compared to the baseline VL-BERT model which extends pre-trained BERT to the visual-linguistic tasks, our KVL-BERT model outperforms it due to the incorporation of the commonsense knowledge. And we expect that introducing our proposed mechanism of incorporating commonsense knowledge into other pre-trained multi-modal BERT models will also bring improvement. In our future work, we will adopt more pre-training tasks to further improve our model.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: and BERTLARGEsubscriptBERTLARGE\\mathrm{BERT}_{\\mathrm{LARGE}}, where the subscripts ‚ÄúBASE‚Äù and ‚ÄúLARGE‚Äù are used to distinguish them.
