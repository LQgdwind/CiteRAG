Extensive research to discover metrics and definitions for fairness in centralised machine learning was necessitated by vast deployment in applications that are protected by anti-discrimination legislation[ref]20. FL must go through the same transition in order to pose as a viable alternative with distributed data. Despite the additional complexity with FL, some of the centralised metrics to detect algorithmic bias, are still insightful in the context of individual client’s performance 9. The most prominent metrics under the umbrella of ’group fairness’ are disparate impact and demographic parity, alongside equalised odds and equal opportunity which were designed to overcome the shortcomings of the former two metrics[ref]20. Equalised odds is a metric that measures the difference in the true positive and false positive rates between two groups, one with and one without a binary sensitive attribute. Equal opportunity is the constrained case of equalised odds which only considers the true positive rates and is therefore less robust. For a binary sensitive attribute, a∈A={a0,a1,…,am}𝑎𝐴subscript𝑎0subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑚a\\in A=\\{a_{0},a_{1},...,a_{m}\\} with a classifier’s binary prediction, Y^^𝑌\\hat{Y} and corresponding ground truth, Y𝑌Y, equalised odds is satisfied for attribute the a𝑎a, if Equation 1, holds. These metrics have been used with FL in the AgnosticFair and FCFL approaches. Equalised odds based measures are used in this work to evaluate sensitive group performance at the client level. Uniformity over certain metrics can be indicative of fairness. Average variance is used in the well renowned FL approaches of q-FedAvg and FedFV to evaluate uniformity of performance (usually, performance in FL refers to client accuracy or efficiency3 - client n𝑛n is denoted as achieving performance xn,ksubscript𝑥𝑛𝑘x_{n,k} in round k𝑘k), which they attribute to fairness. A drawback of using variance based measures is the infinite range and lack of normalisation - this makes it difficult to compare approaches with different statistical characteristics. An alternative measure of uniformity is Jain’s Fairness Index (JFI), which is commonly used to evaluate resource allocation for computer networks using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). In the existing adaptations of JFI for FL, the client’s performance, is used as the independent variable, of which the uniformity is to be measured. The UCB-BS approach, uses JFI to measure fairness and can be adapted for personalised models. As defined in Equation 2, JFI is a bounded, non-linear function of the coefficient of variation (the ratio of the population standard deviation to the population mean) where J​(x)∈(0,1]𝐽𝑥01J(x)\\in(0,1] and for |Sk|subscript𝑆𝑘|S_{k}| clients, its maximal value of unity corresponds to all clients performing equally and a worst case of 1/|Sk|1subscript𝑆𝑘1/|S_{k}| occurs when the results are entirely non-uniform with respect to a variable, x𝑥x. JFI is used in a novel way to measure uniformity in this work. A similar metric to JFI is the Gini Coefficient, G𝐺G - which, first proposed in 1912, is a measure of inequality, obtained from the Lorenz curve, where G∈ 𝐺01G\\in . Its linearity and proven track record in measuring income inequality make it an interesting metric to explore in the future, it has in some cases, been applied to machine learning. The Gini coefficient is not used in this work as differences can be drawn between the notions of inequality and fairness. Contribution-aware fairness seeks proportionality not solely parity. As clients classically only transmit their model weights to the server in FL - measuring how much any client has added to the learning process is challenging. A contribution evaluation in FL is broadly described as being a technique to measure how each client contributed to the global model - this data can be used to orchestrate a fairer system in the presence of all four flavours of heterogeneity. A number of techniques, ranging from clients self reporting (vulnerable to clients reporting inaccurate results in the knowledge that there is no mechanism for server validation) to reputation mechanisms and utility-game based schemes can be used to calculate contribution3. Shapley values originated in game theory, and are already established as a technique for XAI. However, they can be used in FL to measure the marginal contribution of a participating client in a given round, k𝑘k to the global model aggregated at the end of the round, θk+1subscript𝜃𝑘1\\theta_{k+1}. The federated Shapley value, FedSV, sn,ksubscript𝑠𝑛𝑘s_{n,k}, for client n𝑛n, round k𝑘k is calculated using Equations 3 to 6 (if the client is not selected to participate, such that n∉Sk𝑛subscript𝑆𝑘n\\notin S_{k}, it is assigned zero for that round). An auxilary dataset, D𝐷D is used and ℓ​(θ;D)ℓ𝜃𝐷\\ell(\\theta;D) denotes the loss for model parameters, θ𝜃\\theta when tested on the auxiliary test-set. The final FedSV for a client, snsubscript𝑠𝑛s_{n} is the sum of its per-round Shapley values, as shown in Equation 6. A major drawback of using Shapley values is that for n𝑛n clients participating in a round and K𝐾K rounds, it has complexity of O​(K​2|Sk|)𝑂𝐾superscript2subscript𝑆𝑘O(K2^{|S_{k}|}), therefore scaling with FedSV is not feasible. However, a wide range of viable, lower-complexity approximations for FedSV and the completed-federated Shapley value that seeks to improve on FedSV. A further concern for FL is that the federated and completed-federated Shapley values require an auxiliary central test-set which is representative of the population in order to calculate the marginal contributions in an unbiased manner. This could be obtained through donations of samples from clients or by mimicking samples using generative machine learning. In many FL scenarios, having such a test-set is infeasible, however - approximations have been proposed which do not require the auxilary test-set for Shapley calculation . As this is a research paper at limited scale, true FedSV values have been used for accuracy. The cited approximations and alternative approaches should be used as required. A fairness metric has also been proposed, combining Shapley values and Pearson’s correlation coefficient, but, it is limited by its sensitivity to outliers3.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: research to discover metrics and definitions for fairness in centralised machine learning was necessitated by vast deployment in applications that are protected by anti-discrimination legislation[ref]20.
