      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling-Based Motion Planning on Sequenced Manifolds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany practical tasks require planning with constraints.\nConstrained SBMP algorithms  [ref]5      extend SBMP to constrained configuration spaces (see Kingston et al.  for a review).\nThese are of smaller dimension than the full configuration space and usually cannot be sampled directly, thus a large focus of these methods is how to generate samples and steer the robot while fulfilling the constraints. One family of approaches are projection-based strategies [ref]5    that first sample a configuration from the ambient configuration space and then project it using an iterative gradient descent strategy to a nearby configuration that satisfies the constraint.\nBerenson et al. [ref]5 proposed CBiRRT (constrained bidirectional RRT) that uses projections to find configurations on the constraints. The constraints are described by task space regions, which are a representation of pose constraints. Their method can also be used for multiple constraints over a single path. However, their approach requires each constraint’s active domain to be defined prior to planning, or configurations are simply projected to the nearest manifold rather than respecting a sequential order. Our approach is perhaps closest to the CBiRRT algorithm.\nA main difference is that our method assumes a different problem formulation where the task is given in terms of a fixed sequence of manifolds where the intersections between manifolds describe subgoals that the robot should reach.\nThis formulation allows us to define a more structured steering strategy that guides the robot towards the next subgoals.\nAnother difference is that CBiRRT does not search for optimal paths, while we employ RRT∗ to minimize path lengths. We compare our method PSM∗ to CBiRRT in Section VI. An alternative is to approximate the constraint surface by a set of local models and use this approximation throughout the planning problem for sampling or steering operations    [ref]46  .\nFor example, AtlasRRT  builds an approximation of the constraint consisting of local charts defined in the tangent space of the manifold. This representation is used to generate samples that are close to the constraint.\nSimilarly, Tangent Bundle RRT  [ref]46 builds a bidirectional RRT by sampling a point on a tangent plane, extending this point to produce a new point, and if it exceeds a certain distance threshold from the center of the plane, projecting it on the manifold to create a new tangent plane. Kingston et al.  presented the implicit manifold configuration space (IMACS) framework that decouples two parts of a geometrically constrained motion planning problem: the motion planning algorithm and the method for constraint adherence. With this approach, IMACS acts as a representative layer between the configuration space and the planner.\nMany of the previously mentioned techniques fit into this framework. They present examples with both projection-based and approximation-based methods for constraint adherence in combination with various motion planning algorithms. Here, we propose a method that builds on these constrained SBMP methods and extends them towards sequential tasks where the active constraints change during the motion.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Many practical tasks require planning with constraints.\nConstrained SBMP algorithms  [ref]5      extend SBMP to constrained configuration spaces (see Kingston et al.  for a review).\nThese are of smaller dimension than the full configuration space and usually cannot be sampled\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
