Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Color Channel Perturbation Attacks for Fooling Convolutional Neural Networks and A Defense Against Such Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe perform the experiments under image classification framework over three benchmark datasets (i.e., CIFAR10 [ref]39, Caltech256  and TinyImageNet [ref]53) to observe the effect of the proposed CCP attack.\nWe consider the most popular CIFAR10 dataset111https://www.cs.toronto.edu/ kriz/cifar.html [ref]39 which is widely being used to test the performance of CNNs for image classification. The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,0006000060,000 images from 101010 object categories with 6,00060006,000 images per category. Out of 60,0006000060,000 images, 10,0001000010,000 images (i.e., 1,00010001,000 images per class) are provided as the test set and remaining images are provided in the training set. Each transformed test set also contains 10,0001000010,000 images with 1,00010001,000 images per class.\nAs the CIFAR10 dataset contains the low resolution images (i.e., 32×32323232\\times 32), we also use the datasets having better resolution images, like the TinyImageNet dataset having 64×64646464\\times 64 resolution images and the Caltech256 dataset having 256×256256256256\\times 256 resolution images.\nThe Caltech256 dataset222http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/  consists of 30,6073060730,607 images from 257257257 object categories. The 80%percent8080\\% of the Caltech256 dataset is used for the training and remaining for the testing purpose. The overall complexity of the Caltech256 dataset is high due to the presence of the larger category sizes, larger category clutter and overall increased difficulty.\nThe benchmark TinyImageNet dataset333https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/ [ref]53 is also included in the experiments. The TinyImageNet dataset is a subset of the original ImageNet large-scale visual recognition challenge . The TinyImageNet dataset contains 1,00,0001000001,00,000 images in the training set, 10,0001000010,000 images in the validation set, and 10,0001000010,000 images in the test set with 200200200 object categories having 500500500 training images, 505050 validation images and 505050 test images in each category.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: We perform the experiments under image classification framework over three benchmark datasets (i.e., CIFAR10 [ref]39, Caltech256  and TinyImageNet [ref]53) to observe the effect of the proposed CCP attack.\nWe consider the most popular CIFAR10 dataset111https://www.cs.toronto.edu/ kriz/cifar.html [ref]39\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
