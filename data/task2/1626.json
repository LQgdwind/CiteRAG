      "content": "Paper Title: Better Call the Plumber: Orchestrating Dynamic Information Extraction Pipelines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAiming to understand why IE pipelines perform with low accuracy, we conduct a more in-depth analysis per IE task. In the first analysis, we evaluated each component independently on the WebNLG dataset. Researchers [ref]12  proposed several criterion for micro-benchmarking tools/components for KG tasks (entity linking, relation linking, etc.) based on the linguistic features of a sentence. We motivate our analysis based on the following: I) Text Triple Extraction: We consider the number of words (wc) in the input sentence (a sentence is termed by “simple” with average word length of 7.41 . Sentences with higher number of words than seven are complex sentences). Furthermore, having a comma in a sentence (sub-clause) to separate clauses is another factor. Atomic sentences (e.g., ”cats have tails”) are a type of sentence that also affects triples extractors’ behavior. Moreover, nominal relation as in ”Durin, son of Thorin” is another impacting factor on the performance. Uppercase and lowercase mentions of the words (i.e., correct capitalization of the first character and not the entire word) in a sentence are standard errors for entity linking components. We consider this as a micro-benchmarking criteria. II) Coreference Resolution: We focus on the length of the coreference chain (i.e., the number of aliases for a single mention). Additionally, the number of clusters is another criterion in the analysis. A cluster refers to the groups of mentions that require disambiguation (e.g., ”mother bought a new phone, she is so happy about it” where the first cluster is mother →→\\rightarrow she and the second is phone →→\\rightarrow it). The presence of proper nouns in the sentence is studied as well as acronyms. Furthermore, the demonstrative nature of the sentence is also observed as a factor. Demonstrative sentences are the ones that contain demonstrative pronouns (this, that, etc.). III) Entity Linking: The number of entities in a sentence (e=1,2) is a crucial observation for the entity linking task. Capitalization of the surface form is another criterion for micro-benchmarking entity linking tools.\nAn entity is termed as an explicit entity when the entity’s surface form in a sentence matches the KG label. An entity is implicit when there is a vocabulary mismatch. For example, in the sentence ”The wife of Obama is Michelle Obama.”, the surface form Obama is expected to be linked to dbr:Barack_Obama and considered as an implicit entity .\nThe last linguistic feature is the number of words (w) in an entity label (e.g., The Storm on the Sea of Galilee has seven words). IV) Relation Linking: Similar to the entity linking criteria, we focus on the number of relations in a sentence (rel=1,2). The type of relation (i.e., explicit, or implicit) is another parameter. Covered relation (sentences without a predicate surface form) is also used as a feature for micro-benchmarking: ”Which companies have launched a rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force station?” where the dbo:manufacturing relation is not mentioned in the sentence. Covered relations highly depend on common sense knowledge (i.e., reasoning) and the structure of the KG . Lastly, the number of words (w<<=N) in a predicate surface form is also considered. Figure 3 illustrates micro-benchmarking of various Plumber components per task. We observe that across IE tasks, the F1 score of the components varies significantly based on the sentence’s linguistic features. In fact, there exist no single component which performs equally well on all the micro-benchmarking criteria. This observation further validates our hypothesis to design Plumber for building dynamic information extraction pipelines based on the strengths and weaknesses of the integrated components. We also note in Figure 3 that all the CR components report limited performance for the demonstrative sentences (demonstratives). When there is more than one coreference cluster in a sentence, all other CR components observe a discernible drop in F1 score. The NeuralCoref  component performs best for proper nouns, whereas PyCobalt  performs best for the acronyms feature (almost being tied by NeuralCoref). In the TE task, Graphene  shows the most stable performance across all categories. However, the performance of all components (except Dependency Parser) drops significantly when the number of words in a sentence exceeds seven (wc>>7). Case sensitivity also affects the performance and all components observe a noticeable drop in F1 score for lowercase entity mentions in the sentence. Similar behavior is observed for entity linking components where case sensitivity is a significant cause of poor performance. When the sentence has one entity and it is implicit (e=1, implicit); all entity linking components face challenges in correctly linking the entities to the underlying KG. Relation linking components also report lower performance for implicit relations.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: why IE pipelines perform with low accuracy, we conduct a more in-depth analysis per IE task.
