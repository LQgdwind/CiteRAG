      "content": "Paper Title: YOLOSA: Object detection based on 2D local feature superimposed self-attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, the application scenarios of real-time object detection   [ref]1      [ref]7  3   are more and more diverse, including safety protection, defect detection, and visual positioning. The application of object detection greatly reduces the labor cost and improves production efficiency, but it will also lead to the reduction of employment opportunities and the unemployment of some people. However, after some practical investigations of some enterprises in the industrial field, the problem faced by many enterprises is not the problem of labor cost, but the problem of difficult recruitment and the high cost of employee induction training. Therefore, the application of object detection in some industries has a very positive effect, which can help enterprises reduce the recruitment risk and reduce the entry threshold of employees. In addition, the object detection algorithm has its own detection limitations. In many practical application scenarios, man-machine collaboration is better than relying entirely on machines and algorithms. Manual re-inspection is very important, which will increase employment opportunities and solve the problem of unemployment. Attention mechanisms 7 4 have been widely used in vision tasks, such as SENet and CBAM7. However, they have seldom been applied for YOLO series   [ref]1      [ref]7 object detection. One such example is the spatial attention mechanism7 being used in YOLOv4[ref]1. Along with ViT, self-attention4 and multi-head self-attention4 are increasingly being adopted in the field of computer vision, and the advantages of the global attention mechanism4 are becoming increasingly obvious. However, one-stage object detection   [ref]1      [ref]7  3   requires a very high inference speed. Owing to a large number of calculations and parameters, the application of the self-attention module substantially affects the speed of one-stage object detection. Therefore, we propose a self-attention module more suitable for one-stage object detection while ensuring that the inference speed of the original algorithm is retained. In object detection, an attention module is mainly applied in two places: in the backbone network and in the head network[ref]1. As the feature information contained in the feature concatenation stage (Fig. 3), before the object detection feature is input into the detection head, is very rich, there will be features from various levels, and adding attention here is very conducive to improving the accuracy of object detection. We tried a variety of attention modules (including CAM and CBAM7), but they did not substantially improve the accuracy. Therefore, we turned our attention to self-attention. However, given the large number of channels and the large size of the feature map, using the multi-head self-attention module directly will lead to extensive network calculation and low network inference speed. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel self-attention module called 2D local feature superposition self-attention. We also add an efficient decoupled head and AB-OTA to the model. These two approaches not only optimize the inference efficiency of the anchor-based model but also substantially reduce the number of calculations and parameters of the model. Contribution. The average precision (AP) of our model showed an improvement of 0.8%–3.1% compared to YOLOv5, where the large-scale model had an AP of 49.0% (+0.8%), the medium-scale model had an AP of 46.1% (+1.5%), and the small-scale model had an AP of 39.1% (+3.1%) (Fig. 1). The contributions of our paper can be summarized as follows: We proposed the 2D local feature superposition self-attention module. This is an efficient module that can directly reflect the global weighted features from the local weighted features superimposed by the weighted feature map of the rows and columns. We added an optimized decoupled head[ref]7, called efficient decoupled head, to the model, which considerably improved the inference efficiency of the model. Based on SIM-OTA[ref]7, we proposed the AB-OTA for the anchor-based model, which is used to select the best ground truth in the same anchor and grid in the training process.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In recent years, the application scenarios of real-time object detection   [ref]1      [ref]7  3   are more and more diverse, including safety protection, defect detection, and visual positioning.
