      "content": "Paper Title: Towards A Measure of General Machine Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning-based methods have achieved a high level of skill in specialized tasks, but\nit is still hard to quantitatively measure the “generalization capability” of an\nintelligence system - or its “ability to handle situations (or tasks) that differ from\npreviously encountered situations” [ref]48. This is due to the\ndifficulty of measuring the variables involved in current definitions of artificial\nintelligence.  informally define intelligence as measuring an\n“agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments”. It further mentions the properties desirable in a measure of\nintelligence, such as a formal mathematical definition, applicability across different\nmethods without bias, and an informative, numerical score to enable comparison across\nagents. However, an agent’s intelligence cannot be computed practically according to this\ndefinition as it relies on finding the Kolmogorov complexity \nof each environment .  bifurcates the measurement of\nintelligence systems into task-oriented and ability-oriented evaluations. Both are\nimportant for evaluating a system, but the former is far more common. Task-oriented\nevaluations include human judgments of AI performance, direct benchmark comparisons, and\nassessment of adversarial situations in games such as playing Chess or Go.\nAbility-oriented evaluations take the form of psychometrics in the case of human\nintelligence, and extend to artificial systems  when\nintelligence is viewed as a form of information processing .\nThis allows the use of algorithmic information theory (AIT) \nto perform ability-oriented evaluations of artificial systems. Building on this,\n[ref]48 provides an outline for the measurement of intelligence via a\nframework that is easily mapped to current methods in machine learning. The intelligence\nof a system here is defined as “the measure of its\nskill-acquisition efficiency over a scope of tasks, with respect to priors, experience,\nand generalization difficulty”, and involves testing via a\nbenchmark dataset called the Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC). However, this framework\ndoes not offer a quantitative measure of generalization difficulty, and all evaluation is\nclose-ended and binary. In this paper, we define the generalization index, abbreviated to\ng-index, a quantitative benchmark to measure the intelligence of an\nartificial system as a computable, numerical value. The naming is inspired from the\ng-factor, which is a measure of general ability in the field of\npsychometrics . It accounts for performance, generalization\ndifficulty and sample efficiency across a wide range of real-world tasks.\nSection 2 describes the experimental setup for the benchmark, and\nshowcases the components that enable calculating numerical values for evaluation.\nSection 3 formally defines the parameters on which the g-index depends,\nconstructs a mathematical formula, and shows how the properties of the g-index follow the\nguidelines in current literature. Section 4 evaluates some well-known\ntransformer models as candidates for a general intelligence system by computing their\ng-index scores, and provides a sample dataset of real-world tasks and their associated\nskill programs that can be used with the g-index 111https://github.com/mayahq/g-index-benchmark.\nSection 5 adapts the g-index for a toy environment with a simpler\nprogram space. Finally, Section 6 notes possible directions for\nimprovement in the current design and of the g-index .\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: still hard to quantitatively measure the “generalization capability” of an\nintelligence system - or its “ability to handle situations (or tasks) that differ from\npreviously encountered situations” [ref]48.
