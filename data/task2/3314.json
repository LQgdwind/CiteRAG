      "content": "Paper Title: Solving Dynamic Graph Problems with Multi-Attention Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUntil recently, the success of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) was mostly limited to prediction tasks . With the advancements in reinforcement learning algorithms combined with DNNs emerged Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, which demonstrated great success in sequential decision making and control problems in many domains including atari games , traffic control  [ref]22, and robot navigation . In recent years, DRL has been applied to many combinatorial optimization problems to learn heuristics that require no human input [ref]12 [ref]14    . These works have achieved near-optimal performance outperforming hand-crafted heuristics in many combinatorial optimization problems. These existing methods formulate the combinatorial graph problems as a successive addition of graph nodes (actions) to the solution. The existing methods can be broadly categorized into two types, based on the reinforcement algorithm adopted in the solutions. (1) Using Value-based methods such as Deep Q-learning . (2) Using Policy-gradient algorithms such as REINFORCE and Actor-Critic algorithms . Value-based method for graph combinatorial optimization was first proposed by Dai et al.. The proposed architecture uses structured2vec to embed the graph information and uses fitted Q-learning  for sequential decision making. They applied the proposed solution to solve static Travelling Salesmen (TSP), Minimum Vertex Cover, and Max-Cut problems. A similar architecture is followed by Barrett et al.[ref]12 using Message Passing Neural Networks. However, in their approach, the solution is further optimized at inference time, which improves over a one-shot solution in Dai et al.. The policy-gradient methods have demonstrated improved results over value-based based counterparts, as evident by the recent research [ref]14  . The main reason is because in graph combinatorial optimization, the number of nodes (the action space) can be variable from a problem instance to instance and when the action space is large, the policy-gradient algorithms tend to perform better . The first policy-gradient algorithm for graph combinatorial optimization was proposed by Bello et al.. The paper uses an LSTM encoder-decoder architecture named pointer network which was first proposed by Vinyals et al. to solve the TSP in a supervised learning setting. However, Bello et al. uses policy-gradient instead of supervised learning to train the pointer network. In addition, Bello et al. improves the decoder by a masking scheme to mask already selected nodes. Nazari et al.  uses a different pointer network architecture employing an attention mechanism and RNN to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Their solution includes a separate dynamic encoder to embed the dynamic features of a given combinatorial optimization problem. Despite being able to handle dynamic changes to the problem over time, this architecture is developed mainly focusing on the internal changes due to the node selection in the decision-making process but not the changes due to external factors which are beyond the control of the decision making process. As our experiments show, GTA-RL achieves superior performance in several combinatorial problems over the architecture of Nazari et al. . The next generation of policy-gradient methods uses pure attention architectures instead of RNNs inspired by the architecture proposed in Vaswani et al.. Deudon et al. uses a Multi-head attention  for encoding the combinatorial optimization problem and a decoder with a pointing mechanism similar to Bello et al. but without recurrent elements. The REINFORCE algorithm  with a critic baseline has been used for training the network. In parallel to Deudon et al., Kool et al.  proposed an improved architecture by introducing a new attention-based decoder instead of the pointing mechanism. The paper also shows that using a rollout baseline instead of the critic baseline improves the results further for combinatorial optimization problems. Kool et al. outperforms existing methods in TSP, VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem), and variants of both TSP, VRP. Peng et al.  extends this architecture to the VRP problem where changes from an agent behaviour are taken into account. However, external changes to the graph problem are not considered. A similar graph attention network approach is followed by Drori et a.l as well. Our proposed architecture GTA-RL uses an architecture akin to Kool et al., and extend it with a novel encoder and decoder, which are capable of embedding temporal features of dynamic combinatorial optimization problems and dynamically focusing on temporal features during the decision making process. Our experimental results show that we outperform the afore-mentioned state-of-the-art approaches for dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. We also extend our architecture to real-time combinatorial optimization. We provide a summary of the existing methods in Table 1.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: emerged Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, which demonstrated great success in sequential decision making and control problems in many domains including atari games , traffic control  [ref]22, and robot navigation .
