      "content": "Paper Title: WaveTransform: Crafting Adversarial Examples via Input Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe experiments are performed using multiple databases and CNN models. This section describes the databases used to generate the adversarial examples, CNN models used to report the results and parameters for adversarial attack and defense algorithms. Databases:\nThe proposed method is evaluated with databases comprising a wide range of target images: Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST) [ref]42, CIFAR-10 , frontal-image set of Multi-PIE [ref]23, Tiny-ImageNet [ref]45, and ImageNet . Fashion-MNIST comprises low-resolution grayscale images of 10 different apparel categories. CIFAR-10 contains low-resolution RGB images of 10 different object categories. Multi-PIE database has high-resolution RGB images of 337 individuals and Tiny-ImageNet [ref]45 contains 10,000 images from over 200 classes from the ILSVRC challenge . To perform the experiments on ImageNet, the validation set comprising 50,000 images are used. These datasets also vary in color space, CIFAR-10 and Tiny-Imagenet contain color images while F-MNIST contains gray-scale images. CNN Models and Implementation Details: Recent CNN architectures with high classification performance are used for the experiments. For Multi-PIE, we use a ResNet-50 model  pretrained on VGG-Face 2  and an InceptionNet-V1  pretrained on CASIA-Webface . For CIFAR-10, pretrained ResNet-50  and DenseNet-121  are used, pretrained on the same. For Fashion-MNIST, a 10-layer custom CNN, as described in Table 1, has been used, and a pretrained ResNet-50 is used with Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet. The standard models are fine-tuned, replacing the last layer of the network to match the number of classes in the target database and then iterating over the training split of the data for 30 epochs using the Adam  optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and batch size of 128. Standard train-validation-test splits are used for CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, and Tiny-ImageNet databases. From the Multi-PIE database [ref]23, 4753 training images, 1690 validation, and 3557 test images are randomly selected. All the models use images in the range   , and the experimental results are summarized on the test split of the data, except for ImageNet and Tiny-ImageNet, where experimental results are reported on the validation split. Attack Parameters: \nIn the experiments, each attack follows the same setting unless mentioned. Cross-entropy is used as the classification loss function ‚Ñí‚Ñí\\mathcal{L}. The SGD  optimizer is used to calculate the gradient of the subbands concerning the final logits vector used for classification. The experiments are performed using multiple different wavelet filters including Haar, Daubechies (db2 and db3), and Bi-orthogonal. Before computing the discrete wavelet transform, input data is extrapolated by zero-padding. Each attack runs for 20 iterations with 20 restarts, where the adversarial image is initialized with added random noise. This is referred to as random restarts by Madry et al. , where the attack algorithm finally returns the first valid adversarial image produced between all restarts. The maximum amount of noise that may be added to (or removed from) a clean image is fixed at œµ=8.0/255.0italic-œµ8.0255.0\\epsilon=8.0/255.0 in terms of L‚àûsubscriptùêøL_{\\infty} norm for all the attacks. The step size of the subband update is fixed at Œ≥=0.05ùõæ0.05\\gamma=0.05.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: the results and parameters for adversarial attack and defense algorithms.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
