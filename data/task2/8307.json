      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Self-Supervised Barlow Twins from Limited Tissue Slide Cohorts for Colonic Pathology Diagnostics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this study, we first study the effects of removing specific data augmentations of the original augmentation strategies. Then, we study the thresholds used for Solarization, Colour Jitter, and Random Crops used in the original strategy before studying the potential of new transformations. Several key observations emerge from these experiments:\n\nGrayscale and Gaussian blur harm the learning of good representations: from Figure 2, we understand that random grayscale and Gaussian blur, because they modify the meaningful colours and borders of the patches, destroy valuable information. Gaussian blur creates out-of-focus patches, which can harm representation learning in pathology.\n\nA weak colour jitter benefits the training: as supported by [ref]2, a strong colour jitter results in unrealistic patches. One objective of the colour jitter is to expose the model to various colours and lighting conditions. It also prevents the model from overfitting to the specific colour characteristics of the training data and, therefore, is very useful when it comes to transfer learning, as the model will learn to generalize better and be able to adapt to diverse environments. In our case, the training dataset and the downstream dataset are the same, and therefore, the colour jittering is not very useful, even though it can provide more robustness to the training data. Applying a random weak colour jitter fosters the learning of meaningful representations by adding a weak and meaningful distortion.\n\nA high solarization benefits the training: removing solarization results in a modest boost in test accuracy. This observation aligns with previous research [ref]48 in which the authors highlight that solarization can harm pathology models because it produces unrealistic and unreliable images. However, as shown in Figure 17, a very high threshold of 250 colours the background or very thin tissue in blue and neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils and macrophages in dark blue, therefore emphasizing specific regions highly relevant to cancer diagnoses and reactive changes. Barlow Twins does not benefit from different sizes of crops: motivated by DINO settings , the possibility of using two different crop sizes for the input (local and global crops) is studied. Leveraging the symmetry of the Barlow Twins setup, the first batch is allocated to the global crop and the second batch to the local crop. We compare random crops using the final size or scale of the original patch. However, from Figure 18, we observe that having asymmetric crops does not benefit the training. Because different crops have different FoV, the model struggles to find useful data representations. Moreover, upsampling needs to be performed with a crop smaller than 224 × 224, and the data could become less realistic. A high posterization can benefit the self-supervised training: from Figure 19, we observe that applying posterization with a limited number of bits does not benefit the training, whereas posterization on more than 5 bits outperforms the baseline (we note that the posterization on 8 bits stays within the range of the standard deviations of the baseline). The image on 7 bits is of slightly lower resolution than on 8 bits, which can contribute to catching high-frequency features, such as borders and contours. Rotations leverage the non-canonical orientations of the pathology images: we apply random rotations under different angles on the input patches. From Figure 20, we find that the best rotation angle is 180, which means the patches are rotated from any angle between 0 and 180. As flipping is already used, some rotations values could be redundant with the flips and lead back to the original orientations of the patch. This observation is supported by a recent paper introducing HistoRotate , a rotation method on the patch level to apply random rotation to one patch or to a crop of that patch and show great results. Affine transformations enhance the self-supervised training: using the same arguments as for the rotation, affine transformations leverage the non-canonical orientation of the patches and benefit the training. Moreover, affine transformation with\nan angle between 0 and 45 and a translation factor of (0.5, 0.5) benefits the training and perform\nbetter than a sole rotation between 0 and 180.\n\nRandStainNA does not benefit the training: RandStainNA, for Random Stain Normalization and Augmentation , augments the images with more realistic stain styles and is a solution to bridge to stain augmentation and stain normalization. We observe that this augmentation does not benefit the training. However, our training and test data come from the same dataset and have the same stain. Therefore, this augmentation is not necessary in our case as we do not need to normalize the stain across multiple datasets and staining as they did in [ref]2, for example. This augmentation could, however, be necessary if we want to transfer knowledge from the KGH dataset to another one (which could be H&E stained, contrary to KGH, which is HPS stained). In this case, the training must be performed on the KGH dataset with RandStainNA augmentation. The results will be suboptimal but more transferrable.\n\nMixUP & CutMix are not appropriate for pathology downstream tasks: Cutmix 0 is an augmentation technique particularly used for image classification tasks. It combines pairs of images and their labels to create new training examples. A crop from one patch is pasted onto another patch, and the labels are mixed according to the cut’s proportions. Similar to CutMix, MixUp operates by blending images, but it does so by taking a linear combination of pairs of images and their labels. Both methods operate on the images and the labels. If used during the pretraining, these methods perturb the learning of good representations. The highest test accuracy obtained was 85.96% or 6 points below the baseline. One possible explanation is that the transformation alters the inherent structure within individual patches. However, in the context of pathology, the spatial arrangement of cells in the original image holds significance due to intercellular communication and potential interactions. Consequently, these augmentations introduce unrealistic data into the model. Despite concerns about realism, the demonstrated performance improvement for classification tasks suggests potential utility. Therefore, we propose exploring the application of these augmentations during the second phase, where patch classification is performed with the benefit of labelled data. Figure 21 presents the test accuracy when these augmentations are applied to the training data during the evaluation phase. We observe that the baseline performs better. We conclude that as our patches can contain critical, subtle features that are key to diagnosis, applying MixUp or CutMix might obscure or distort these features, leading to misleading or uninterpretable images that do not resemble realistic pathological conditions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: patches, destroy valuable information.
