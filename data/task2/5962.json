      "content": "Paper Title: Unified Out-Of-Distribution Detection: A Model-Specific Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection settings. OOD detection is highly related to anomaly detection, novelty detection, open-set recognition, and outlier detection [ref]51. The main differences lie in 1) the scope of OOD examples; 2) whether one has to perform multi-class classification on ID examples. Specifically, novelty detection and open-set recognition mainly consider OOD examples with semantic shift. In conventional OOD detection, the focus is on detecting OOD examples with semantic shift (i.e., S-OOD), assuming the absence of covariate shift (i.e., C-OOD) [ref]51 . Please see Figure 2 (a) for an illustration. Very few works include examples with covariate shift in their studies; most of them treat these examples as ID, aiming to classify them robustly instead of detecting them as OOD   [ref]52 (see Figure 2 (b), the “SEM framework” [ref]52). Some exceptions are   , which aim to detect all examples with covariate shift as OOD (see Figure 2 (c), “G-ODIN framework” ). In anomaly detection and outlier detection, the focus is on differentiating ID and OOD examples without the need to classify ID examples (i.e., they treat ID examples as a single class).\nSeveral works also consider examples with covariate shift [ref]51. Similar to the G-ODIN framework, these works aim to detect all examples with covariate shift as OOD. We argue that whether an example with covariate shift should be detected or not depends on whether the deployed classifier would misclassify it or not. By taking a model-specific perspective, our MS-OOD Detection resolves the dilemma between OOD detection [ref]51 and OOD generalization [ref]37: a robust model should generalizes to examples with covariate shift; a weak model should reject them. OOD generalization.\nCovariate shift is commonly studied in model generalization and robustness  [ref]37. Instead of rejecting examples with covariate shift, the community aims to improve the robustness of a neural network model so that the model could classify them correctly. However, given the notable accuracy gap between classifying ID examples and covariate-shift examples , we argue that it is desirable to also consider covariate shift in OOD detection. We note that a recent work  also proposes to detect and reject covariate-shift examples if the shifts (measured by incompetence scores) are above a threshold. Selective classification. Equipping a model with the option to reject has also been studied in selective classification . Different from OOD detection, selective classification focuses on rejecting uncertain “ID” examples. Recently,  proposed to integrate selective classification with OOD detection (SCOD), aiming to detect both misclassified ID and semantic shift data (see Figure 2 (d)). In this context, our work can be seen as a generalized version, further taking covariate shifts into account (see Figure 2 (e)). Compared to , we provide a more comprehensive study, further emphasizing the role of models in evaluation. OOD detection methods have roughly two categories: post-hoc and training-based .\nThe difference is whether one is allowed to specifically train the model (e.g., the classifier for ID data) to detect OOD examples. While training-based methods like outlier exposure  have shown a much higher detection rate, they need access to ID training data and OOD examples that one would encounter, making them prohibitive for end-users and less effective in uncontrolled settings.\nWe therefore focus on post-hoc methods.\nThe baseline is to use the softmax output as confidence . Other approaches consider scaling the temperature and adding input perturbations ; using logits , energy , or gradients  as the score; combining intermediate features with logits .\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection settings.
