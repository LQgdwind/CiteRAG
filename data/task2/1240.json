      "content": "Paper Title: Doubly Stochastic Subspace Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs discussed above, existing subspace clustering methods such as SSC , LRR , EDSC [ref]19, and deep subspace clustering networks (DSC-Net)  require various ad-hoc postprocessing methods to achieve strong clustering performance on certain datasets.\nFor example, it has recently been shown that if one removes the ad-hoc postprocessing steps from DSC-Net  then the performance drops considerably — performing no better than simple baseline methods and far below state-of-the-art . Common postprocessing steps include keeping only the top l𝑙l entries of each column of 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C}, normalizing columns of 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C}, and/or using SVD-based postprocessing, each of which introduces extra hyperparameters and degrees of freedom for the practitioner.\nLikewise, the practitioner is also required to make a choice on the particular type of Laplacian normalization to use . To better connect the self-expressive step with the subsequent spectral clustering step and to avoid the need for ad-hoc postprocessing methods, we propose a framework for directly learning an affinity 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} that already has desired properties (A1) and (C1)-(C2) for spectral clustering. Restricting 𝐀∈𝛀𝒏𝐀subscript𝛀𝒏\\mathbf{A}\\in\\boldsymbol{\\Omega_{n}} to be in the convex set of doubly stochastic matrices achieves\nthese goals while allowing for highly efficient computation. As noted in the introduction, doubly stochastic matrices are already nonnegative, so we do not need to take absolute values of some computed matrix. Also, each row and column of a doubly stochastic matrix sums to one, so they each have the same scale in l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} norm — removing the need to postprocess by scaling rows or columns. Importantly for (A1), doubly stochastic matrices are invariant to most forms of Laplacian normalization used in spectral clustering. For example, for a symmetric affinity matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} with row sums 𝐃=diag​(𝐀𝟏)𝐃diag𝐀𝟏\\mathbf{D}=\\mathrm{diag}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{1}), widely used Laplacian variants include the unnormalized Laplacian 𝐃−𝐀𝐃𝐀\\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{A}, the normalized Laplacian 𝐈−𝐃−1/2​𝐀𝐃−1/2𝐈superscript𝐃12superscript𝐀𝐃12\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}, and the random walk Laplacian 𝐈−𝐃−1​𝐀𝐈superscript𝐃1𝐀\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{D}^{-1}\\mathbf{A} . When 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is doubly stochastic, the matrix of row sums satisfies 𝐃=𝐈𝐃𝐈\\mathbf{D}=\\mathbf{I}, so all of the normalization variants are equivalent and give the same Laplacian 𝐈−𝐀𝐈𝐀\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}. In addition, many types of regularization and constraints that have been proposed for subspace clustering tend to desire sparsity (C1) and connectivity (C2), in the sense that they want 𝐀i​jsubscript𝐀𝑖𝑗\\mathbf{A}_{ij} to be small in magnitude or zero when 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} and 𝐱jsubscript𝐱𝑗\\mathbf{x}_{j} belong to different subspaces and to be nonzero for sufficiently many pairs (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) where 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} and 𝐱jsubscript𝐱𝑗\\mathbf{x}_{j} belong to the same subspace  . The doubly stochastic matrices learned by our models can be tuned to achieve any desired sparsity level. Also, doubly stochastic affinities are guaranteed a certain level of connectedness, as\neach row must sum to 111. This means that there cannot be any zero rows in the learned affinity, unlike in methods that compute representations one column at a time such as SSC , EnSC , and SSC-OMP , where it is possible that a point is never used in the self-expressive representation of other points.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: As discussed above, existing subspace clustering methods such as SSC , LRR , EDSC [ref]19, and deep subspace clustering networks (DSC-Net)  require various ad-hoc postprocessing methods to achieve strong clustering performance on certain datasets.\nFor example, it has recently been\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
