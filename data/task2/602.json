      "content": "Paper Title: Accuracy Prediction with Non-neural Model for Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsidering that evaluating candidate architectures raises extremely high cost,  proposes to encode a given architecture to continuous representation via RNN and predict its accuracy rather than really training it to speed up the search process. Further, NAO [ref]22 builds the accuracy predictor based on LSTM and fully connected layer to perform gradient based search. However, neural predictors are easy to overfit the architecture-accuracy paired data when applying to different tasks/datasets [ref]22 , which requires delicate designing and tuning, and implicitly brings additional human efforts. Recently, GCN is proposed to model architectures and predict the accuracy  . It points out that NASNet  search space based on Inception 3 backbone for computer vision tasks  [ref]25 9 is a directed acyclic graph that can be better modeled by GCN. However, in many scenarios, chain-like structure is more commonly used where each layer is only connected to the preceding layer (e.g., ResNets/Mobilenets in computer vision tasks     7, encoder-decoder framework in language tasks 5 1 and speech tasks 5 ), and the architectures are commonly represented as sequences of discrete symbols from bottom layer to top layer, which are similar to tabular data. Neural predictors are easy to overfit on such structure data and GCN may fail when applying to such chain structure where the adjacent matrix is too sparse and only the diagonal has values. Such tabular data is preferred by non-neural models (e.g., tree based models) and thus we propose to utilize GBDT as the predictor, which is much simpler and more general to model both graph-like and chain-like structures and can be easily applied to different tasks without much tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: high cost,  proposes to encode a given architecture to continuous representation via RNN and predict its accuracy rather than really training it to speed up the search process.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
