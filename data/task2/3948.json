      "content": "Paper Title: Parallel and Distributed Graph Neural Networks: An In-Depth Concurrency Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) are taking over the world of machine learning (ML) by\nstorm¬† . They have been used in a\nplethora of complex problems such as node classification, graph classification,\nor edge prediction¬†[ref]112 . Example areas of\napplication are social sciences (e.g., studying human interactions),\nbioinformatics (e.g., analyzing protein structures), chemistry (e.g., designing\ncompounds), medicine (e.g., drug discovery), cybersecurity (e.g., identifying\nintruder machines), entertainment services (e.g., predicting movie popularity),\nlinguistics (e.g., modeling relationships between words), transportation (e.g.,\nfinding efficient routes), and others¬†  [ref]258  [ref]102       .\nSome recent celebrated success stories are cost-effective and fast placement of\nhigh-performance chips¬†, simulating complex\nphysics¬† , guiding mathematical\ndiscoveries¬†, or significantly improving the accuracy\nof protein folding prediction¬†. GNNs uniquely generalize both traditional deep learning\n(DL)¬†   and\ngraph processing¬†6  .\nStill, contrarily to the former, they do not operate on regular grids and\nhighly structured data (such as, e.g., image processing); instead, the\ndata in question is highly unstructured, irregular, and the resulting\ncomputations are data-driven and lacking straightforward spatial or temporal\nlocality¬†6.\nMoreover, contrarily to the latter, vertices and/or edges are associated with\ncomplex data and processing. For example, in many GNN models, each vertex¬†iùëñi\nhas an assigned kùëòk-dimensional feature vector, and each such vector is\ncombined with the vectors of iùëñi‚Äôs neighbors; this process is repeated\niteratively. Thus, while the overall style of such GNN computations resembles\nlabel propagation algorithms such as PageRank¬† , it comes with additional complexity due to the high\ndimensionality of the vertex features. Yet, this is only how the simplest GNN models, such as basic Graph\nConvolution Networks (GCN)¬†, work. In many, if not most,\nGNN models, high-dimensional data may also be attached to every edge, and\ncomplex updates to the edge data take place at every iteration. For example, in\nthe Graph Attention Network (GAT) model¬†, to compute\nthe scalar weight of a single edge¬†(i,j)ùëñùëó(i,j), one must first concatenate linear\ntransformations of the feature vectors of both vertices iùëñi and jùëój, and then\nconstruct a dot product of such a resulting vector with a trained parameter\nvector.\nOther models come with even more complexity. For example, in Gated Graph\nConvNet (G-GCN)¬† model, the edge weight may be a\nmultidimensional vector. At the same time, parallel and distributed processing have\nessentially become synonyms for computational efficiency. Virtually each modern\ncomputing architecture is parallel: cores form a socket while sockets form a\nnon-uniform memory access (NUMA) compute node. Nodes may be further clustered\ninto blades, chassis, and racks¬†  . Numerous memory banks enable data\ndistribution. All these parts of the architectural hierarchy run in\nparallel.\nEven a single sequential core offers parallelism in the form of\nvectorization, pipelining, or instruction-level parallelism\n(ILP).\nOn top of that, such architectures are often heterogeneous: Processing\nunits can be CPUs or GPUs, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or others.\nHow to harness all these rich features to\nachieve more performance in GNN workloads? To help answer this question, we systematically analyze different aspects of\nGNNs, focusing on the amount of parallelism and distribution in these\naspects. We use fundamental theoretical parallel computing machinery, for\nexample the Work-Depth model¬†, to reveal\narchitecture independent insights. We put special focus on the\nlinear algebra formulation of computations in GNNs, and we investigate the\nsparsity and density of the associated tensors. This offers further insights\ninto performance-critical features of GNN computations, and facilitates\napplying parallelization mechanisms such as vectorization.\nIn general, our investigation will help to develop more efficient GNN\ncomputations. For a systematic analysis, we propose an in-depth taxonomy of\nparallelism in GNNs. The taxonomy identifies fundamental forms of parallelism\nin GNNs. While some of them have direct equivalents in traditional\ndeep learning, we also illustrate others that are specific to GNNs. To ensure wide applicability of our analysis, we cover a large number\nof different aspects of the GNN landscape. Among others, we consider different\ncategories of GNN models (e.g., spatial, spectral, convolution, attentional,\nmessage passing), a large selection of GNN models (e.g.,\nGCN¬†, SGC¬†,\nGAT¬†, G-GCN¬†), parts of\nGNN computations (e.g., inference, training), building blocks of GNNs (e.g.,\nlayers, operators/kernels), programming paradigms (e.g.,\nSAGA-NN¬†7, GReTA¬†), execution\nschemes behind GNNs (e.g., reduce, activate, different tensor operations), GNN\nframeworks (e.g., NeuGraph¬†7), GNN accelerators (e.g.,\nHyGCN¬†) GNN-driven ML tasks (e.g., node classification, edge\nprediction),\nmini-batching vs.¬†full-batch training, different forms of\nsampling, and asynchronous GNN pipelines. We finalize our work with general insights into parallel\nand distributed GNNs, and a set of research challenges and\nopportunities.\nThus, our work can serve as a guide when developing parallel and distributed\nsolutions for GNNs executing on modern architectures, and for choosing the next\nresearch direction in the GNN landscape. Overall, the central contributions of our work are: We identify and analyze fundamental forms of parallelism in\nGNNs, and we illustrate that they ‚Äì to some degree ‚Äì match those in\ntraditional DL. This will foster designing future GNN\nsystems more effectively, by empowering system designers with a\nclear view of the space of parallelization approaches that they could\nuse, and how these approaches can be combined. Moreover, it will facilitate\nreusing existing large-scale DL frameworks. We analyze a broad spectrum of GNN models formally (covering all\nmajor classes of models, i.e., Convolution, Attention, Message-Passing, and\nLinear/Polynomial/Rational ones), for a total of 23 models, investigating how\nparallelizable they are, and identifying their bottlenecks and the associated\ntradeoffs. This will facilitate scaling these models to much larger sizes than\nwhat is done today. It is an important factor in making them more powerful, as\nindicated by the recent successes of large NLPs. We design a broad theoretical framework for asynchronous GNNs, which\nwill serve as a blueprint for novel GNN models and implementations that will further\npush the scalability and performance of GNNs. We review challenges and opportunities, which\nwill facilitate future research into large-scale GNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [112]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]112: (GNNs) are taking over the world of machine learning (ML) by\nstorm¬† .
