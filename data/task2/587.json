Some canonical examples are wavelets and dictionaries in image and signal processing   , dynamic modes in fluid dynamics analysis  , and dimensionality reduction and invariant representations in machine learning   [ref]8. Understanding the latent structures allows to better model and to simplify the problem at hand, facilitating solutions for broad applications such as denoising, prediction, and classification [ref]9. These structures are formulated differently in different disciplines. For example, in image processing, the structures can be formed via repetitive patches in different scales 0, while in signal processing they can be a sum of audio frequencies, or of nonlinear eigenfunctions 1 2. In fluid dynamics the structures are represented as a sum of modes 3, and in machine learning they might be based on the recurrence of words 4. Despite this diversity, different techniques from different disciplines typically share similar fundamental principles. Gradient descent flow is a central process in control 5\nand in machine learning 6, where it is common to solve optimization problems. Thus, analysing the gradient flow process draws attention in these areas and plays an important role, particularly when the cost function is non-convex 7 8, or when a model for a dynamical system is investigated 9. In this work, we propose a method to analyze latent structures of certain common gradient decent flows by using  Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). DMD is often used today in fluid dynamics for finding the main modes of a dynamical system. DMD is an effective tool for analyzing nonlinear flows 0 1 2. It is an approximation of the linear infinite-dimensional Koopman operator 3 3 4.\nWe focus on a gradient flow of a homogeneous functional R𝑅R, where P𝑃P is a homogeneous operator (typically with order of homogeneity in the range  01 ). When a norm or a semi-norm is minimized, in its standard or quadratic form, we obtain such flows.\nAs shown in 5, the solution of this equation reaches its steady state in finite time (for order strictly less than one). Moreover, the solution is separable (in time and space) if f𝑓f is a (nonlinear) eigenfunction of P𝑃P, i.e. f𝑓f solves the nonlinear eigenvalue problem P​(f)=λ⋅f𝑃𝑓⋅𝜆𝑓P(f)=\\lambda\\cdot f.\nPrecisely, the solution is a multiplication between the initial condition f𝑓f and a time dependant function a​(t)𝑎𝑡a(t): ψ​(t)=a​(t)⋅f𝜓𝑡⋅𝑎𝑡𝑓\\psi(t)=a(t)\\cdot f, where a​(t)𝑎𝑡a(t) has a closed form solution, which depends on the degree of the homogeneity of P𝑃P and on the eigenvalue λ𝜆\\lambda. With the purpose of better understanding DMD of homogeneous flows, we examine the analytic solutions of such flows. We present a closed form solution of DMD in these cases and discover an inherent flaw. Specifically, for general homogeneous flows, DMD can not recover the extinction time of the dynamics, and it induces a significant reconstruction error. Our analysis further shows that DMD is well-suited for flows with one-homogeneous operators. Consequently and inspired by 6, we suggest a new scheme which employs an adaptive time sampling instead of a fixed time step size. We show that our temporal re-scaling is equivalent to evolving a one-homogeneous flow. With this adaptation, DMD is able to recover homogeneous flows of order  01 . In the general case, we additionally obtain a much better mode recovering scheme which captures the dynamics of the flow well. Next, we show that the obtained modes approximate nonlinear eigenfunctions, allowing us to link DMD to nonlinear spectral theory. In summary, our analysis and results yield a new and simple spectral decomposition framework. Our work generalizes previous studies which directly formulated nonlinear spectral representations based on total-variation 7 8 and one-homogeneous functionals\n1 9 by applying (weak) time-derivatives to the solution of a gradient flow. It is also related to previous research in which signals were analyzed by their decay profile, as shown in 0 1. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: It is shown that DMD is not effective for homogeneous flows with homogeneity different than one.\nThis inherent limitation is formulated by what we term the DMD paradox, where as the step-size decreases, the standard DMD-error approaches zero, whereas the reconstruction error has a strictly positive lower bound. We propose a temporal re-parametrization scheme of the data sampling. We study cases with an analytic solution, and we show that our re-parametrization yields a single mode in DMD which can be perfectly reconstructed. Finally, the relation to an analogue one-homogeneous flow is shown. The temporal re-parametrization of the data is generalized to arbitrary step sizes and to any homogeneity. We term this adaptation as the blind homogeneity normalization, where the blind is twofold, neither the operator nor the temporal sampling are known. We adapt the DMD algorithm to real valued spectrum systems, common in smoothing-type (non-oscillatory) flows. We refer to it as  Symmetric DMD (S-DMD). We introduce a new discrete analysis and synthesis framework of signals related to homogeneous flows of homogeneity order in  01 . Our framework is based on orthogonal modes which approximate nonlinear eigenfunctions. We thus refer to it as Orthogonal Nonlinear Spectral decomposition. We numerically compare our decomposition to the method in 5, and we show that our scheme is simpler, more general, and it is 1−2121-2 orders of magnitude faster than 5. The paper is organized as follows. We briefly recall the necessary mathematical definitions and previous results in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3 a closed form solution for DMD in certain cases is given and the paradox for homogeneous flows is stated. Our solution is proposed (in non-blind and blind versions) and analyzed. The OrthoNS representation is formalized.\nIn addition, we introduce the S-DMD method such that DMD is based on a symmetric matrix. In Sec. 4 we demonstrate S-DMD, then show the main modes of two gradient descent flows with respect to the p−limit-from𝑝p-Dirichlet energy (p=1.01𝑝1.01p=1.01 and p=1.5𝑝1.5p=1.5), when initialized with a square peak. Filtering of signals by OrthoNS are presented along with a comparison to 5. We conclude our work and discuss future directions in Sec. 5.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: examples are wavelets and dictionaries in image and signal processing   , dynamic modes in fluid dynamics analysis  , and dimensionality reduction and invariant representations in machine learning   [ref]8.
