      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning in near-continuous time for continuous state-action spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nControlling a dynamical system to drive it to optimal long-term average behaviour is a key challenge in many applications, ranging from mechanical engineering to econometrics. Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to do so when the system is a priori unknown by tackling jointly both the control and the statistical inference of the system. This joint objective is even more important in the online version of the problem, in which one interacts with the system along a single trajectory (no resets or episodes). In the last decades, the insights of Bandit Theory (see e.g. ) have been leveraged to tackle the RL problem, while addressing the inherent exploration-exploitation dilemma that naturally arises in sequential decision-making (see e.g. [35, ¬ß¬†4.2]).\nHowever, most literature considers interactions that occur in discrete time, which is not always applicable when events are triggered by a digital system. Such systems are pervasive in finance and advertising, for instance, and typically have interactions occurring at a very high frequency, with each interaction having only a marginal impact on the state of the system. Near-continuous time, continuous state-space. A natural approach to plan in such systems is to directly model the problem in continuous time. This is the common approach in finance, see for instance   1.\nHowever, the continuous-time approach conflicts with the sample-based nature of statistical learning theory that fundamentally takes place in discrete time.\nAs such, learning requires careful modelling of the data-generating process and its arrival times.\nWe consider interactions governed by a Poisson clock, setting the expected inter-arrival time of the clock to a parameter Œµ‚àà(0,1)ùúÄ01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1). This allows us to model a continuum of situations: from discrete time Œµ=1ùúÄ1\\varepsilon=1, to continuous time Œµ‚Üì0‚ÜìùúÄ0\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0. We are interested in the regime in which Œµ‚â™1much-less-thanùúÄ1\\varepsilon\\ll 1. Concurrently, a prerequisite for real-world applicability is the ability to model complex dynamics and rich reward signals for continuous state variables. With this in mind, we focus on the model-based approach where the transition and the reward function belong to a parameterised class of functions operating on a continuous state-action space. This level of generality poses challenges regarding all three key sub-tasks of RL: which are planning, learning, and the explore-exploit trade-off. Discrete and continuous control. For discrete-time dynamics on finite state-action spaces, the planning problem falls under the umbrella of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which have been extensively reviewed in . The finite nature of MDPs is at the heart of their theoretical and computational success. Their extension to countable or even continuous state spaces is, however, non-trivial; see e.g. [11, ¬ß¬†4.6,¬†p.245] for a review of the challenges. Perhaps the only exception which retains those nice theoretical and computational properties is the celebrated Linear Quadratic (LQ) framework . However, both frameworks are limited in their expressive power.\nIn contrast, the continuous-time theory of Stochastic Control has demonstrated how to effectively solve the control problem for arbitrary regular dynamics on continuous state-spaces. It enjoys a rich and mature literature   , both on the theoretical aspects as well as numerical solvers based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), another storied field   .\nThe near-continuous time framework lies between the two theories, and recent results of  show how to navigate between them and approximately solve the planning problem in the high-frequency interactions regime by solving its diffusive counterpart. Learning non-linear systems.\nSimilar to the planning problem, the natural way to move beyond finite Markov chain models and towards continuous state dynamics is through linear models. The least-squares estimator enjoys strong theoretical guarantees including adaptive confidence sets that can be efficiently maintained online, see e.g. [ref]2.\nExtensions   showed how to extend this approach to richer model classes through the use of Non-Linear Least Squares (NLLS). This framework subsumes standard least squares and has been successful in many dynamics by retaining its key properties regarding confidence sets. While providing a protocol for learning with NLLS, Russo and Van¬†Roy characterised, in , the trade-off between the richness of the model and the hardness of its learning through two quantities of the model class: the log-covering number, and the eluder dimension which summarises the difficulty of turning the information from data into predictive power. Optimistic exploration. Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty (OFU) has proven highly successful in sequential decision-making from bandits to RL.\nThe works of    showed how to extend the celebrated UCB  algorithm from bandits to finite MDPs; later, extensions were made to continuous state in the LQ setting, see e.g.   6 and references therein.\nExtension from bandit to MDP and then to LQ raised new challenges that persist in our setting. First, the agent should not revise its behaviour too often to prevent dithering, which requires the design of a lazy update scheme. Second, generic continuous states-spaces models come with inherent unboundedness, and one must carefully address stability issues. In this work, we consider the near-continuous time system interaction model and propose an optimistic algorithm for online reinforcement learning in the average reward setting111Also known as, average cost per stage, long-run average, or ergodic setting.. Our approach builds on the work of  and the connection to the diffusive regime to address the planning sub-task, yielding Œµ1/2superscriptùúÄ12\\varepsilon^{1/2}-optimal policies. Furthermore, we perform the learning with NLLS extending the work of  to our near-continuous time and unbounded state setting. Underlying the extension of both these two approaches is a careful treatment of the state boundedness which we do with Lyapunov stability arguments. Overall, our algorithm enjoys near-optimal performance as its regret scales with ùí™~‚Äã(Œµ1/2‚ÄãT+T)~ùí™superscriptùúÄ12ùëáùëá\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{1/2}T+\\sqrt{T}). As the frequency of interactions increases (Œµ‚Üì0‚ÜìùúÄ0\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0) the approximation error vanishes, showing that ùí™~‚Äã(T)~ùí™ùëá\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}) is attainable in near-continuous time.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: state dynamics is through linear models.
