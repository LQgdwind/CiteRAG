      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Certified Individually Fair Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been a long line of work on learning fair representations.\nZemel et al. [ref]8 introduced a method to learn fair representations that\nensure group fairness and protect sensitive attributes.\nSuch representations, invariant to sensitive attributes, can also be learned\nusing variational autoencoders , adversarial\nlearning [ref]9 , or\ndisentanglement .\nZemel et al. [ref]8 and Madras et al. [ref]9 also consider the\nproblem of fair transfer learning, which we investigate in our work.\nSong et al.  used duality to unify some of the mentioned work\nunder the same framework.\nMcNamara et al. [ref]26 derived theoretical guarantees for learning fair\nrepresentations.\nTheir guarantees require statistics of the data distribution and consist of\nprobabilistic bounds for individual and group fairness: for a new data point from\nthe same distribution, the constraint will hold with a certain probability.\nIn contrast, we obtain a certificate for a fixed data point, which ensures that\nthe fairness constraints holds (independent of the other data points). Most work so far focuses on learning representations that satisfy statistical\nnotions of fairness, but there has also been some recent work on learning\nindividually fair representations.\nThese works learn fair representations with alternative definitions of\nindividual fairness based on Wasserstein distance  , fairness graphs , or\ndistance measures .\nA different line of work has investigated leaning the fairness metric from\ndata    .\nIn contrast, we define individual fairness via interpretable logical constraints.\nFinally, recent works   \nstudied the task of learning representations that are robust to (adversarial)\nperturbations, i.e., all similar individuals in our case, however not in the\ncontext of fairness.\nMany of the above methods for learning (individually) fair representations\nemploy nonlinear components [ref]8 ,\ngraphs , or sampling   and can thus not be efficiently certified, unlike the\nneural networks that we consider in our work. While we focus on learning fair representations, other lines of work have\ninvestigated individual fairness in the context of clustering  , causal inference    , composition of\nindividually fair classifiers  , and\ndifferential privacy (DP)   .\nThe close relationship between individual fairness and DP has been discussed in\nprevious work (see, e.g., ).\nHowever, DP crucially differs from our work in that it obtains a probabilistic\nfairness guarantee, similar to McNamara et al. [ref]26 mentioned above, whereas\nwe compute absolute fairness guarantees for every data point.\nThe most natural way to employ DP for a representation learning approach, like\nLCIFR, would be to make the data producer model fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} differentially\nprivate for a neighborhood that encodes Sϕsubscript𝑆italic-ϕS_{\\phi}, by adding noise inside the\ncomputation of fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta}.\nIf one can achieve DP for the neighborhood Sϕsubscript𝑆italic-ϕS_{\\phi} (a non-trivial challenge),\nthe data consumer model can then be seen as a post-processing step, which with\nthe right robustness certificate yields a probabilistic guarantee of\nEquation 2.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: There has been a long line of work on learning fair representations.\nZemel et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
