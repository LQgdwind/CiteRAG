      "content": "Paper Title: Playtesting: What is Beyond Personas\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we presented an advancement for procedural persona, goal-based persona and introduced a method to let RL agents discover different paths, APF. We experimented with these methods in GVG-AI and Doom environments. Procedural personas and developing personas are two methods used by game designers to automate the playtesting process. One drawback of the procedural personas originates from the utility function. A utility function realizes the decision model of a persona. For example, a Treasure Collector receives positive feedback from finishing the level and collecting a Treasure. However, if the starting position of the agent is close to the Door, the agent may neglect the Treasures. Conversely, if the Door is positioned after the Treasures, the agent is likely to interact with most of the Treasures. We saw this dilemma in Experiment I. Without any exploration technique, the procedural personas Monster Killer, Treasure Collector, and Completionist executed the same set of actions. When we integrated exploration into the agents that realize these personas, the set of actions executed by these personas became different. Furthermore, these new sets of actions were more fitting to their decision model. This problem is also seen in the MCTS agent playtesting the MiniDungeons 2 game . The problem with the utility function is that the utility function is an amalgamation of multiple goals. Hence, depending on the level composition and RL agent’s hyperparameters, the procedural persona represents one of those playstyles. In Experiment I, we believe that the Developing Completionist fits better with the idea of a “Completionist” persona than the procedural Completionist. Developing persona addresses this problem by introducing a sequence of goals. Consequently, a game designer may use the developing persona to choose which playstyle she wants to playtest carefully. Another advantage of developing personas over procedural personas is that developing personas support playstyles that involve alteration. For example, in Experiment I, the Developing Raider killed the Monsters and then collected the Treasures. The Developing Raider starts the game as a Monster Killer and becomes a different persona —a Treasure Collector— after fulfilling a criterion. These development sequences were mentioned by Bartle , but development sequences were impractical while using a single utility function. Consequently, this behavior performed by Developing Raider was missing in procedural personas. On the other hand, another important aspect of playtesting is the ability to generate playtraces as if a human would. In this paper, we used handcrafted utility functions, however, these utility functions could have been extracted from human playtest data by Inverse Reinforcement Learning . This alteration might help the RL agent to generate a playtest that is more human-like . In addition to the GVG-AI environment, we conducted experiments on the Doom environment. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study to playtest personas in a 3D environment. In 2D environments, the researchers  employed MCTS RL agent to realize personas. Nevertheless, MCTS would be an ineffective choice for 3D environments, and MCTS would underrepresent the persona. Consequently, we used the PPO agent in Experiments III and IV, as PPO is a competent agent used by OpenAI . In Experiment III, we see that the PPO agent realized the decision models of personas properly. From the results in Table IX, we interpret that a player has to kill a Monster to finish this level. The level is hardest for Treasure Collector and Developing Collector as they have to kill a Monster to collect the Treasures. We see an interesting fact about the game when we compare the Developing Casual Completionist and the Developing Completionist personas. The former never dies but collects only a single Treasure, whereas the latter seldom dies but collects both of the Treasures. From this data, we understand that collecting the second Treasure causes the death of the player. As the Developing Casual Completionist fears losing her health more, this persona finds collecting the second Treasure risky. Furthermore, comparing the Killer and the Developing Killer personas shows that the latter die more than the former. This comparison unravels another fact about this level. If a player engages in combat to kill Monsters, then this player should kill as much as possible. Otherwise, this player is likely to die, such as the Developing Killer. On the other hand, the Developing Casual Completionist also kills as much Monsters as a Monster Killer. This indifference indicates that the game may not be challenging enough for a hardcore player. In Experiment II, we prepared a game that consists of five Doors. We found that —without APF— the Exit persona would take either the first or the fifth path shown in Figure 9. The lengths of these paths are the same and shorter than every possible path that ends with a Door. Consequently, in the first row of Table LABEL:table:r:e_2_results, we see that the first and the fifth path share the highest score. Furthermore, in Experiment IV, we saw that —without APF— the Exit persona would take the first path (see Figure 10). Since this path is the closest towards the Door, and therefore, playing this path yields a higher score compared to the other path, shown in Table LABEL:table:r:e_4_results. We proposed APF to let RL agents discover these additional paths shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10. A human playtester would have played these paths, but without APF, the Exit persona would overlook them as these paths yield a lower score. Hence, the game designer would not have any playtest data for other endings. Table LABEL:table:r:e_2_results and Table LABEL:table:r:e_4_results show insight on how APF achieves this feat. APF modulates the reward signal of the environment. When the agent tries to learn a similar path, the agent is penalized, and when the agent tries to learn a distinct path, the agent is rewarded. This reward modulation is the reason how APF promotes finding distinct paths. The game designer can exercise the APF to get a distinct path and then study this path to improve her game. Afterward, she can exercise the APF to generate as many paths as she needs. However, the game designer might be interested in examining the play traces that could have come from human playtesters. We could employ an auxiliary NN trained to select the best human-like action given an observation [ref]2. Nevertheless, carefully combining this NN with APF is a topic of another study. On the other hand, an alternative path is a subjective concept. Every human playtester may think of another way to represent the Exit persona. In Table LABEL:table:r:e_2_results, we see that when we train the APFCTS with the second path, the score of the first path decreases, and the score of the sixth path increases. According to APFCTS, the first and second paths are more similar than the second and sixth paths (see Figure 9). However, one might argue that the first and second paths are distinct as they reach different Doors, and the second and sixth paths are similar as they reach the same Door. Though APFCTS is objective in finding alternative paths, these alternative paths are “subjectively” different for the game designers. The objectivity of APFCTS and APFICM comes from the recoding probability of a frame and the dynamics prediction error, respectively. Additionally, we found that APFICM is more robust compared to APFCTS. We also experimented with APFCTS in Doom. However, CTS calculated the recoding probability of some frames as 00. Furthermore, we observed that for our experimentation setup the plus-shaped filter in Figure 3(b) yielded better results than the original CTS filter in Figure 3(a). Lastly, researchers employed curiosity to increase the playtesting coverage of an RL agent . Though we promoted APF to find distinct paths, APF may help game tester agents . Coverage is crucial for testing, and APF increases coverage by finding distinct paths. Limitations & Challenges: The performance of developing and procedural persona is dependent on the RL algorithms. If the RL algorithm cannot play a game, the game designer could not benefit from these automated playtesters. Furthermore, our APF proposals are based on exploration algorithms. The performance of APF in an environment is linked to how well the exploration algorithm would perform in this environment.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: might be interested in examining the play traces that could have come from human playtesters.
