      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Sample Named Entity Recognition for Security Vulnerability Reports by Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of named entity recognition dates back to Message Understanding Conference-6 (MUC-6) held in 1995, where researchers first identified the problem of recognizing named entities such as names, organizations, locations using rule-based or probabilistic approaches 9.\nBut the adoption of neural approaches and the notion of few-sample NER only happened in recent years. Lample et al. first propose to utilize neural networks in named entity recognition task and outperforms traditional CRF-based sequence labeling models .\nDriven by their success, neural network has become the de facto choice for named entity recognition task since then.\nHowever, at the same time, the tension between cost of obtaining named entity annotations and data hunger nature of neural model training has gained attention.\nFor example, Buys et al. notice that a graphical model like HMM could outperform its neural counterparts by more than 10% of accuracy in sequence tagging task given the access to same amount of training data [ref]4.\nSmaller number of parameters in HMM makes the training easier to converge than a RNN. In order to tackle this challenge, the notion of few-shot learning, originally proposed by computer vision community [ref]37 , gets noticed by NLP practitioners.\nThese methods focus on inferring incoming samples’ class membership based on prototypes obtained through metric learning.\nTheir success in image classification propels the same methods to be adapted and tested in the NER task.\nFritzler et al. are among the first to apply prototypical networks to NER task.\nHowever, their model treats each token independently by inferring one entity type at a time, disregarding the context of sentence .\nHou et al. extend this work and propose to merge specific named entity types into abstract classes (referred to as ”collapsed transitions”) to enable domain transfer .\nYang and Katiyar borrow the idea of collapsed transitions but simplify the overall architecture .\nRather than using dedicated architecture for few-shot learning, they first try to measure distance between tokens based on tokens’ contextualized embeddings returned by PLM and then infer token’s entity type based solely on nearest neighbor’s types.\nAfter this step, an optional CRF decoding module is used to account for context of tokens.\nTheir simple model architecture gain state-of-the-art performance compared with previous attempts.\nMore importantly, besides the significant boost in performance metrics, their work shows the potential of pretrained language models (PLM) in reducing annotations by leveraging universal representations of language. Another line of works consider the alternatives to the prototype-based approaches.\nHuang et al. show that self-training and active learning could help reduce data annotations .\nFries et al. provide empirical evidence of using data programming paradigm to convert rules given by the experts to named entity tags .\nLi et al. propose a novel training protocol to make model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) framework, previously only available for sentence-level classification , applicable to sequence labeling (token-level classification) problem  . Our work is consistent with previous works in the goal of reducing the number of training labels required.\nHowever, different from , we discard the tag assignment scheme based on prototypes and propose the direct application of PLMs through fine-tuning and transfer learning.\nThe empirical evidence shows that this design choice attains better and stable performance metrics. A distinct application scenario of few-sample learning is to test the system by inferring classes not seen in training time.\nWe note that, despite both striving to generalize well to unseen samples during testing,\nour setting of reducing the required training examples is orthogonal to this goal following the taxonomy provided in  .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Buys et al. notice that a graphical model like HMM could outperform its neural counterparts by more than 10% of accuracy in sequence tagging task given the access to same amount of training data [ref]4.\nSmaller number of parameters in HMM makes the training easier to converge than a RNN.
