      "content": "Paper Title: Lost in Compression: the Impact of Lossy Image Compression on Variable Size Object Detection within Infrared Imagery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe use of infrared-band (thermal) camera imagery (Figure 1) within the task of visual surveillance is well established with applications within target detection, visual tracking, behaviour analytics, home monitoring, and automotive environment perception      6 .\nThe synergistic nature of combining both visible-band and thermal-band imagery is advantageous when\napplied to a range of computer vision applications 0 4. Valuable visual\ncues can be provided in the infrared domain by thermal\nsensors which visible-band sensors will fail to capture5 .\nA major advantage of thermal imagery is that it is rarely influenced by surrounding\nlighting changes and shadows, meaning that objects-of-interest can be readily distinguished in the dark, fog and other complex environments as opposed\nto the scene illumination requirements of visible-band imagery. The recent rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  have revolutionised visual tasks significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in many applications.\nWithin object detection specifically,\nmost efforts have focused on detecting objects-of-interest in standard colour imagery by using multi-stage   , singe-stage 1 1  and transformer-based   detectors.\nThese aforementioned object detection based CNN methods rely heavily on architectures that have been trained on large-scale colour imagery datasets such as ImageNet [ref]11\nPASCAL Visual Object Classes (PASCAL-VOC)  or Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) 2.\nIntroducing CNN to object detection within thermal imagery is significantly hindered by the absence of such annotated datasets of the same scale and variety. In order to combat this challenge, methods such as transfer learning , generation of pseudo-RGB equivalents [ref]12, and domain adaptation 6 are used to benefit an existing CNN model and raise an equivalent level of CNN success for thermal band imagery. The work of  focuses on thermal object detection by employing a transfer learning approach. In this approach, the knowledge obtained from the visible spectrum is transferred to the thermal domain for object detection in the thermal domain. The work of [ref]12 implements image-to-image translation frameworks to generate pseudo-RGB equivalents of a given thermal image and then use a CNN architecture for object detection in the thermal image. Recent work of 6 proposes a self-supervised domain adaptation via an encoder-decoder transformer network to develop a robust thermal image object detector in autonomous driving. Most of the solutions stated above have made a step towards real-time processing which is vital to the application of autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles and other such agents can utilise thermal-band sensors to provide a necessary solution to accurately perceive the environment even in differing light conditions, or night time. However, the real-time transmission of high-resolution visible-band and thermal-band data collected by the agent during inference can require substantial transmission overhead to process in real-time, and large storage requirements for storing such data. Every fraction of a second of reaction time counts for autonomous vehicles dealing with unexpected obstructions in the path of motion, so reducing the transmission overhead is vital for improved safety. The use of commonplace lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG 9 and MPEG  tackles such transmission and storage overheads by compressing the data to a reduced form; a downside of which is potential image quality degradation (Figure 1, B) which can affect the performance of computer vision models. Work by  evaluates the affect of five types of quality distortions and compression (blur, noise, contrast, JPEG and JPEG2000) using CNN architectures when classifying a subset of the ImageNet dataset [ref]11. More recent work by 8 thoroughly evaluates the impact of JPEG and H.264 lossy compression on CNN architectures. They evaluate Faster R-CNN  upon the Pascal VOC dataset  and find similarly to  that performance degrades rapidly at high lossy compression levels. The prior work on image compression stated above largely focuses on the use of compression applied to visible-domain imagery. Relatively few studies investigate the impact upon CNN task performance with respect to differing levels of compression applied to infrared-band (thermal) at inference (deployment) time. In this work we make the following contributions: we investigate three diverse end-to-end CNN object detection architectures, which differ in operation, i.e., multi-stage (Cascade R-CNN ), single-stage (FSAF ) and transformer-based (Deformable DETR ) over thermal imagery. as thermal imagery exhibits inherently different properties from standard visible-band imagery, we examine the impact that lossy image compression at differing levels has upon CNN-based thermal object detection. furthermore, we thoroughly examine the impact of lossy image compression with respect to in-image object size definition, (tiny, small, medium, large) and determine within which domains compression is most impactful upon performance and hence where image quality is most pertinent to deployed object detection model performance.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: transformer-based   detectors.\nThese aforementioned object detection based CNN methods rely heavily on architectures that have been trained on large-scale colour imagery datasets such as ImageNet [ref]11\nPASCAL Visual Object Classes (PASCAL-VOC)  or Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) 2.\nIntroducing CNN to object detection within thermal imagery is significantly hindered by the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
