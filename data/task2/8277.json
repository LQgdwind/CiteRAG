A tree sequent is defined to be an expression of the form 𝒯,Γ⊢Δproves𝒯ΓΔ\\mathcal{T},\\Gamma\\vdash\\Delta such that (1) 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} is a tree, (2) if 𝒯≠∅𝒯\\mathcal{T}\\neq\\emptyset, then Lab​(Γ,Δ)⊆Lab​(𝒯)LabΓΔLab𝒯\\mathrm{Lab}(\\Gamma,\\Delta)\\subseteq\\mathrm{Lab}(\\mathcal{T}), and (3) if 𝒯=∅𝒯\\mathcal{T}=\\emptyset, then |Lab​(Γ,Δ)|=1LabΓΔ1|\\mathrm{Lab}(\\Gamma,\\Delta)|=1, i.e. all labeled formulae in Γ,ΔΓΔ\\Gamma,\\Delta share the same label. We note that conditions (1)–(3) ensure that each tree sequent forms a connected graph that is indeed of a tree shape. We use T𝑇T and annotated versions thereof to denote tree sequents. We define a flat sequent to be a tree sequent of the form Γ⊢ΔprovesΓΔ\\Gamma\\vdash\\Delta, that is, a flat sequent is a sequent Γ⊢ΔprovesΓΔ\\Gamma\\vdash\\Delta without relational atoms and where every labeled formula in Γ,ΔΓΔ\\Gamma,\\Delta shares the same label. The root of a tree sequent 𝒯,Γ⊢Δproves𝒯ΓΔ\\mathcal{T},\\Gamma\\vdash\\Delta is the label x𝑥x such that there exists a unique directed path of relational atoms in 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} from x𝑥x to every other label y∈Lab​(𝒯,Γ,Δ)𝑦Lab𝒯ΓΔy\\in\\mathrm{Lab}(\\mathcal{T},\\Gamma,\\Delta); if 𝒯=∅𝒯\\mathcal{T}=\\emptyset, then the root is the single label x𝑥x shared by all formulae in Γ,ΔΓΔ\\Gamma,\\Delta. Every tree sequent encodes a tree whose vertices are flat sequents. In other words, each tree sequent T=𝒯,x​R​y1,…,x​R​yn,Γ⊢Δproves𝑇𝒯𝑥𝑅subscript𝑦1…𝑥𝑅subscript𝑦𝑛ΓΔT=\\mathcal{T},xRy_{1},\\ldots,xRy_{n},\\Gamma\\vdash\\Delta such that x𝑥x is the root and y1,…,ynsubscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑛y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n} are all children of x𝑥x can be graphically depicted as a tree t​rx​(T)𝑡subscript𝑟𝑥𝑇tr_{x}(T) of the form shown below: We define 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫:=(𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫∖{𝗂𝗋,𝗍𝗋})∪{𝟦​𝖫}assign𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝗂𝗋𝗍𝗋4𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}:=(\\mathsf{G3GL}\\setminus\\{\\mathsf{ir},\\mathsf{tr}\\})\\cup\\{\\mathsf{4L}\\}, where the 𝟦​𝖫4𝖫\\mathsf{4L} is shown below and the rules of the calculus only operate over tree sequents. \n\n  𝒯,x​R​y,Γ,x:□​φ,y:□​φ⊢Δ:𝒯𝑥𝑅𝑦Γ𝑥□𝜑𝑦:□𝜑provesΔ\\mathcal{T},xRy,\\Gamma,x:\\Box\\varphi,y:\\Box\\varphi\\vdash\\Delta\n   𝟦​𝖫4𝖫\\mathsf{4L}\n       𝒯,x​R​y,Γ,x:□​φ⊢Δ:𝒯𝑥𝑅𝑦Γ𝑥□𝜑provesΔ\\mathcal{T},xRy,\\Gamma,x:\\Box\\varphi\\vdash\\Delta\n The system 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} is a notational variant of Poggiolesi’s eponymous tree-hypersequent system , and thus, we identify the two systems with one another. The only difference between the two systems is purely notational: the system defined above uses tree sequents, which are tree-hypersequents ‘dressed’ as labeled sequents . Derivations, proofs, the height of a proof, (hp-)admissibility, the i𝑖i-inverse of a rule, and (hp-)invertibility are defined for 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} analogous to how such notions are defined for 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL}. We will apply these terms and concepts in the expected way to other sequent systems as well to avoid repeating similar definitions. The system 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} differs from 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} in that 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} only allows for tree sequents in proofs, lacks the structural rules 𝗂𝗋𝗂𝗋\\mathsf{ir} and 𝗍𝗋𝗍𝗋\\mathsf{tr}, and includes the 𝟦​𝖫4𝖫\\mathsf{4L} rule. We refer to 𝟦​𝖫4𝖫\\mathsf{4L} and □​𝖫□𝖫\\Box\\mathsf{L} as propagation rules (cf.  [ref]7) since the rules bottom-up propagate data forward along relational atoms, and we refer to ¬𝖫𝖫\\neg\\mathsf{L}, ¬𝖱𝖱\\neg\\mathsf{R}, ∨𝖫𝖫\\lor\\mathsf{L}, and ∨𝖱𝖱{\\lor}\\mathsf{R} as local rules since they only affect formulae locally at a single label. For any rule, we call the label x𝑥x labeling the principal formula in the conclusion the principal label, for the 𝟦​𝖫4𝖫\\mathsf{4L}, □​𝖫□𝖫\\Box\\mathsf{L}, and □​𝖱□𝖱\\Box\\mathsf{R} rules, we refer to the label y𝑦y labeling the auxiliary formula(e) in the premise(s) as the auxiliary label, and for local rules, the auxiliary label is taken to be the same as the principal label since they are identical. Note that we define a label x𝑥x in a tree sequent 𝒯,Γ⊢Δproves𝒯ΓΔ\\mathcal{T},\\Gamma\\vdash\\Delta to be a leaf iff x𝑥x is a leaf in 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, and we define a label x𝑥x to be a pre-leaf iff for all y∈Lab​(𝒯)𝑦Lab𝒯y\\in\\mathrm{Lab}(\\mathcal{T}), if x​R​y∈𝒯𝑥𝑅𝑦𝒯xRy\\in\\mathcal{T}, then y𝑦y is a leaf. Since the tree sequent calculus 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} is isomorphic to Poggiolesi’s tree-hypersequent system, the two systems share the same properties. We note that in the setting of tree sequents the (x/y)𝑥𝑦(x/y) and 𝗐𝗐\\mathsf{w} rules are less general than for labeled sequents. In particular, such rules are assumed to preserve the ‘tree shape’ of tree sequents when applied. Nevertheless, the restricted forms of these rules are still hp-admissible in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}. The tree sequent calculus 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} satisfies the following: Each tree sequent of the form 𝒯,Γ,x:φ⊢x:φ,Δ:𝒯Γ𝑥𝜑proves𝑥:𝜑Δ\\mathcal{T},\\Gamma,x:\\varphi\\vdash x:\\varphi,\\Delta is provable in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}; All non-initial rules are hp-invertible in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}; The (x/y)𝑥𝑦(x/y), 𝗐𝗐\\mathsf{w}, 𝖼𝖫𝖼𝖫\\mathsf{cL}, and 𝖼𝖱𝖼𝖱\\mathsf{cR} rules are hp-admissible in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}; The 𝖼𝗎𝗍𝖼𝗎𝗍\\mathsf{cut} rule is admissible in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}; φ𝜑\\varphi is valid iff ⊢x:φ\\vdash x:\\varphi is provable in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}. Proofs in 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} and 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} are inter-translatable with one another. This correspondence was established by Goré and Ramanayake  and is based on a couple observations. First, the 𝗂𝗋𝗂𝗋\\mathsf{ir} rule does not occur in 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} proofs where the end sequent is a tree sequent. It is not difficult to see why this is the case: if one takes a proof of a tree sequent, then bottom-up applications of rules from 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} will not allow for directed cycles to enter a sequent in a proof. This follows from the fact that the conclusion of the proof is a tree sequent, which is free of directed cycles, and each rule of 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} either preserves relational atoms bottom-up, adds a single relational atom from a label x𝑥x to a fresh label y𝑦y in the case of the □​𝖱□𝖱\\Box\\mathsf{R} rule, or adds an undirected cycle in the case of 𝗍𝗋𝗍𝗋\\mathsf{tr}. Since the conclusion of 𝗂𝗋𝗂𝗋\\mathsf{ir} contains a directed cycle x​R​x𝑥𝑅𝑥xRx, such a sequent will never occur in such a proof. The 𝗂𝗋𝗂𝗋\\mathsf{ir} rule does not occur in any 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} proof of a tree sequent. Second, Goré and Ramanayake show that the structural rule 𝗍𝗋𝗍𝗋\\mathsf{tr} is admissible in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} and the 𝟦​𝖫4𝖫\\mathsf{4L} is admissible in 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} . These admissibility results are proven syntactically, showing that proof transformations exist between 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} and 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} for proofs of tree sequents as summarized in the theorem below. We refer to the reader to  for the details. A tree sequent T𝑇T is provable in 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} iff it is provable in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: in proofs, lacks the structural rules 𝗂𝗋𝗂𝗋\\mathsf{ir} and 𝗍𝗋𝗍𝗋\\mathsf{tr}, and includes the 𝟦​𝖫4𝖫\\mathsf{4L} rule.
