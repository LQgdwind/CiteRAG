      "content": "Paper Title: Applied Category Theory in the Wolfram Language using Categorica I: Diagrams, Functors and Fibrations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHaving considered above the case of homomorphisms/structure-preserving maps between categories, in the form of functors, it is now possible to consider the case of homomorphisms/structure-preserving maps between functors, in the form of natural transformations. More precisely, if F:𝒞→𝒟:𝐹→𝒞𝒟{F:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} and G:𝒞→𝒟:𝐺→𝒞𝒟{G:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} are both functors mapping between the same pair of domain/codomain categories 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}} and 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}}, then the map η:F⇒G:𝜂⇒𝐹𝐺{\\eta:F\\Rightarrow G} is a natural transformation if and only if it associates every object X𝑋X in category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}} to a corresponding morphism ηX:F​(X)→G​(X):subscript𝜂𝑋→𝐹𝑋𝐺𝑋{\\eta_{X}:F\\left(X\\right)\\to G\\left(X\\right)} in category 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}}: known as the component of the natural transformation η𝜂{\\eta} at X𝑋X, in such a way that, for every morphism f:X→Y:𝑓→𝑋𝑌{f:X\\to Y} in category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}, one has that the composition ηY∘F​(f)subscript𝜂𝑌𝐹𝑓{\\eta_{Y}\\circ F\\left(f\\right)} yields the same morphism as the composition G​(f)∘ηX𝐺𝑓subscript𝜂𝑋{G\\left(f\\right)\\circ\\eta_{X}} in category 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}}, i.e: which can be illustrated simply by means of the following commutative diagram (which therefore commutes in category 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}}): Natural transformations abstract and generalize many powerful results and constructions in mathematics, especially in algebraic topology, perhaps most notably the Hurewicz theorem/Hurewicz homomorphism relating homotopy groups and homology groups of spaces: both the construction of homotopy groups and the construction of homology groups over a (pointed) topological space may be formalized as functors from the category 𝐓𝐨𝐩∗subscript𝐓𝐨𝐩{\\mathbf{Top_{*}}} of pointed topological spaces and continuous functions between them, to the category 𝐆𝐫𝐩𝐆𝐫𝐩{\\mathbf{Grp}} of groups and group homomorphisms, with the Hurewicz homomorphism being elegantly represented as a natural transformation between these two functors (and the Hurewicz theorem corresponding to the statement that such a natural transformation necessarily exists). In linear algebra and functional analysis, the relationship between the double-dual V∗∗superscript𝑉absent{V^{**}} of a vector space V𝑉V and the original space constitutes another familiar example of a commonplace natural transformation in mathematics; the double-dual operation may be formalized as an endofunctor on the category 𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭{\\mathbf{Vect}} of vector spaces and linear maps (i.e. a functor from 𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭{\\mathbf{Vect}} to itself), and there necessarily exists a natural transformation between this double-dual functor and the identity functor on 𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭{\\mathbf{Vect}}. For the case of finite-dimensional vector spaces, this natural transformation becomes a natural isomorphism (a stronger case, to be defined momentarily). Categorica is able to represent arbitrary natural transformations between AbstractFunctor objects using the AbstractNaturalTransformation function. In particular, it is able to compute the minimum set of algebraic equivalences between component morphisms that is necessary in order for a particular transformation between AbstractFunctor objects to be natural, and to represent these equivalences in both equational and (commutative) diagrammatic form, as illustrated in Figure 28 for the minimal case presented above, in which one considers a natural transformation between a pair of functors F:𝒞→𝒟:𝐹→𝒞𝒟{F:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} and G:𝒞→𝒟:𝐺→𝒞𝒟{G:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} acting on a common domain category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}} consisting of a pair of objects X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y and a single morphism f:X→Y:𝑓→𝑋𝑌{f:X\\to Y}, i.e. one has: and: respectively, in which the minimum algebraic condition for naturality is precisely the one given above: plus a couple of corollary conditions on the identity morphisms. However, although this particular example is especially simple, one does not need to increase the size or complexity of the underlying categories and functors involved very much before the resulting naturality conditions become rather unwieldy to manipulate by hand. For instance, let us consider the next most obvious example, in which the common domain category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}} of the functors F:𝒞→𝒟:𝐹→𝒞𝒟{F:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} and G:𝒞→𝒟:𝐺→𝒞𝒟{G:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} consists instead of three objects X𝑋X, Y𝑌Y and Z𝑍Z, along with a pair of composable morphisms f:X→Y:𝑓→𝑋𝑌{f:X\\to Y} and g:Y→Z:𝑔→𝑌𝑍{g:Y\\to Z}, i.e. one now has: and: respectively. In this case, the relevant commutative diagram characterizing the natural transformation η:F⇒G:𝜂⇒𝐹𝐺{\\eta:F\\Rightarrow G} becomes instead the commutative oblong: wherein the two interior squares must both commute: i.e: in addition to the outer rectangle: i.e: plus all corresponding conditions on the identity morphisms. As shown in Figure 29, Categorica is nevertheless easily able to represent, and to perform automatic computations involving, these more complex cases of natural transformations too. Figures 28 and 29 also demonstrate Categorica’s ability to detect natural isomorphisms: components ηX:F​(X)→G​(X):subscript𝜂𝑋→𝐹𝑋𝐺𝑋{\\eta_{X}:F\\left(X\\right)\\to G\\left(X\\right)} of the natural transformation η:F⇒G:𝜂⇒𝐹𝐺{\\eta:F\\Rightarrow G} that are also isomorphisms, i.e. where the inverse morphism ηX−1:G​(X)→F​(X):superscriptsubscript𝜂𝑋1→𝐺𝑋𝐹𝑋{\\eta_{X}^{-1}:G\\left(X\\right)\\to F\\left(X\\right)} also exists in the codomain category 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}}, such that ηX−1∘ηX:F​(X)→F​(X):superscriptsubscript𝜂𝑋1subscript𝜂𝑋→𝐹𝑋𝐹𝑋{\\eta_{X}^{-1}\\circ\\eta_{X}:F\\left(X\\right)\\to F\\left(X\\right)} is the identity morphism on F​(X)𝐹𝑋{F\\left(X\\right)} and ηX∘ηX−1:G​(X)→G​(X):subscript𝜂𝑋superscriptsubscript𝜂𝑋1→𝐺𝑋𝐺𝑋{\\eta_{X}\\circ\\eta_{X}^{-1}:G\\left(X\\right)\\to G\\left(X\\right)} is the identity morphism on G​(X)𝐺𝑋{G\\left(X\\right)}: i.e: In addition to individual objects in the codomain category 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}} being naturally isomorphic, one can also speak of a pair of functors F:𝒞→𝒟:𝐹→𝒞𝒟{F:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} and G:𝒞→𝒟:𝐺→𝒞𝒟{G:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} themselves as being naturally isomorphic: if all components ηX:F​(X)→G​(X):subscript𝜂𝑋→𝐹𝑋𝐺𝑋{\\eta_{X}:F\\left(X\\right)\\to G\\left(X\\right)} are natural isomorphisms (for every object X𝑋X in the domain category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}), then the natural transformation η:F⇒G:𝜂⇒𝐹𝐺{\\eta:F\\Rightarrow G} itself is known as a natural isomorphism between functors: The intuition underlying the concept of natural isomorphisms between functors can be precisely formalized by considering the functor category 𝒟𝒞superscript𝒟𝒞{\\mathcal{D}^{\\mathcal{C}}} (assuming that 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}} and 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}} are arbitrary small categories), whose objects are given by the functors F:𝒞→𝒟:𝐹→𝒞𝒟{F:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}} and whose morphisms are given by the natural transformations η:F⇒G:𝜂⇒𝐹𝐺{\\eta:F\\Rightarrow G} between such functors, wherein all isomorphisms between objects represent natural isomorphisms between functors. To determine whether a given AbstractNaturalTransformation object in Categorica represents a natural isomorphism between functors, one can use the “NaturalIsomorphismQ” property. Categorica is also able to determine whether the codomain categories 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}} between the two functors actually match (via the “MatchingCodomainsQ” property), and therefore whether the AbstractNaturalTransformation object does indeed represent a valid natural transformation (via the “ValidNaturalTransformationQ” property), meaning both that the two codomain categories match and that the defining algebraic conditions of a natural transformation hold within those codomain categories. Finally, it is worth noting that all of Categorica’s core algebraic and diagrammatic reasoning algorithms are represented internally in terms of (hyper)graph rewriting systems over labeled graph representations of quivers and categories, whereby one formalizes (hyper)graph rewriting rules as spans of monomorphisms: i.e. pairs of monomorphisms which share a common domain object K𝐾K. Here, the ambient category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}} in which these monomorphisms exist is the category whose objects are (hyper)graphs and whose morphisms are (hyper)graph inclusion relations. In the above, object L𝐿L represents the (hyper)graph pattern appearing on the left-hand/input side of the rule, object R𝑅R represents the (hyper)graph pattern appearing on the right-hand/output side of the rule (i.e. the pattern intended to replace pattern L𝐿L wherever it appears), and object K𝐾K represents the “residual” sub(hyper)graph pattern shared by both patterns L𝐿L and R𝑅R that remains invariant after the left-hand-side L𝐿L pattern has been “extracted”, but before the right-hand-side pattern R𝑅R has been “injected”. Such a rewriting rule may then be said to match a given (hyper)graph object G𝐺G if there exists a morphism m:L→G:𝑚→𝐿𝐺{m:L\\to G} in the category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}. The resulting (hyper)graph H𝐻H obtained via application of the rewriting rule at this particular match may consequently be computed explicitly by completing the following double-pushout diagram[ref]33: i.e. one must proceed to find objects D𝐷D and H𝐻H, and morphisms n𝑛n, p𝑝p, g𝑔g and hℎh, in the category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}, such that the diagram above commutes: Furthermore, these objects and morphisms (and therefore, in particular, the object H𝐻H representing the resulting (hyper)graph) are guaranteed to be unique, up to natural isomorphism, by virtue of the following universal property of the double-pushout diagram: which then collapses down to: i.e. for any other objects G∗superscript𝐺{G^{*}} and H∗superscript𝐻{H^{*}}, and morphisms m∗superscript𝑚{m^{*}}, g∗superscript𝑔{g^{*}}, p∗superscript𝑝{p^{*}} and h∗superscriptℎ{h^{*}}, in the category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}, such that the resulting squares commute: there necessarily exists a pair of unique morphisms u1:G→G∗:subscript𝑢1→𝐺superscript𝐺{u_{1}:G\\to G^{*}} and u2:H→H∗:subscript𝑢2→𝐻superscript𝐻{u_{2}:H\\to H^{*}} such that the diagram above commutes, i.e: and: Categorica is able to exploit the formalism of double-pushout (hyper)graph rewriting in order to convert automatically between potentially slow, tedious algebraic computations and fast, explicit diagrammatic ones. To this end, the core of Categorica’s hypergraph rewriting system has been built on top of the Gravitas computational general relativity framework (which has previously been applied to the study of black hole physics[ref]55 and algebraic quantum field theory[ref]56), which employs a bespoke suite of highly optimized, and massively parallelized, algorithms for rewriting large hypergraphs subject to generic algebraic constraints. We note also that such rewriting systems, especially in the multiway/non-deterministic case, admit an elegant mathematical description in terms of higher categories and (higher) homotopy types.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: The resulting (hyper)graph H𝐻H obtained via application of the rewriting rule at this particular match may consequently be computed explicitly by completing the following double-pushout diagram[ref]33: i.e. one must proceed to find objects D𝐷D and H𝐻H, and morphisms n𝑛n, p𝑝p, g𝑔g and hℎh, in the category 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}, such that the diagram above commutes: Furthermore, these objects and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
