      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Policy Iteration for Robust Markov Decision Processes via Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn most practical cases, the system dynamics (transition kernel P𝑃P and reward function R𝑅R) are not known precisely. Instead, we have an access to a nominal reward function R0subscript𝑅0R_{0} and a nominal transition kernel P0subscript𝑃0P_{0} that may have some uncertainty. To capture this, the uncertainty (or ambiguity) set is defined as 𝒰:=(R0+ℛ)×(P0+𝒫)assign𝒰subscript𝑅0ℛsubscript𝑃0𝒫\\mathcal{U}:=(R_{0}+\\mathcal{R})\\times(P_{0}+\\mathcal{P}), where ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}, 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} are the respective uncertainties in the reward function and transition kernel .The robust performance of a policy π𝜋\\pi is defined to be its worst performance on the entire uncertainty set 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U}. And our objective is to maximize the robust performance, that is Solving the above robust objective is NP-hard in general .\nHence, the uncertainty set 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} is commonly assumed to be 𝚜𝚜\\mathtt{s}-rectangular, that is ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} and 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} can be decomposed state wise as ℛ=×s∈𝒮ℛs\\mathcal{R}=\\times_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\mathcal{R}_{s} and 𝒫=×s∈𝒮𝒫s\\mathcal{P}=\\times_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\mathcal{P}_{s}. Sometimes, the uncertainty set 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} is assumed to decompose state-action wise as ℛ=×s∈𝒮,a∈𝒜ℛs,a\\mathcal{R}=\\times_{s\\in\\mathcal{S},a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\mathcal{R}_{s,a} and 𝒫=×s∈𝒮,a∈𝒜𝒫s,a\\mathcal{P}=\\times_{s\\in\\mathcal{S},a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\mathcal{P}_{s,a}, known as (𝚜𝚊)𝚜𝚊(\\mathtt{sa})-rectangular uncertainty set. Observe that it is a special case of 𝚜𝚜\\mathtt{s}-rectangular uncertainty set. Under the 𝚜𝚜\\mathtt{s}-rectangularity assumption, many structural properties of MDPs stay intact, and the problem becomes tractable   [ref]22.Throughout the paper, we assume that the uncertainty set 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} is 𝚜𝚜\\mathtt{s}-rectangular (or (𝚜𝚊)𝚜𝚊(\\mathtt{sa})-rectangular) unless stated otherwise. Under 𝚜𝚜\\mathtt{s}-rectangularity, the robust value function is well defined [ref]22   as Using the robust value function, robust policy performance can be rewritten as The robust value function v𝒰πsubscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋𝒰v^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}} is the fixed point of the robust Bellmen operator 𝒯𝒰πsubscriptsuperscript𝒯𝜋𝒰\\mathcal{T}^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}}  , defined as Moreover, the optimal robust value function v𝒰∗:=maxπ⁡v𝒰πassignsubscriptsuperscript𝑣𝒰subscript𝜋subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋𝒰v^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}:=\\max_{\\pi}v^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}} is well defined and is the fixed point of the optimal robust Bellman operator 𝒯𝒰∗subscriptsuperscript𝒯𝒰\\mathcal{T}^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}  , defined as The optimal robust Bellman operator 𝒯𝒰∗subscriptsuperscript𝒯𝒰\\mathcal{T}^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}} and robust Bellman operators 𝒯𝒰πsubscriptsuperscript𝒯𝜋𝒰\\mathcal{T}^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}} are γ𝛾\\gamma contraction maps for all policy π𝜋\\pi (see theorem 3.2 of ), that is So for all initial values v0π,v0∗subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋0subscriptsuperscript𝑣0v^{\\pi}_{0},v^{*}_{0}, sequences defined as converges linearly to their respective fixed points, that is vnπ→v𝒰π→subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋𝒰v^{\\pi}_{n}\\to v^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}} and vn∗→v𝒰∗→subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝒰v^{*}_{n}\\to v^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}. This makes the robust value iteration an attractive method for solving robust MDPs.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: is a special case of 𝚜𝚜\\mathtt{s}-rectangular uncertainty set.
