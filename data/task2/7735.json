      "content": "Paper Title: Almost Optimal Time Lower Bound for Approximating Parameterized Clique, CSP, and More, under ETH\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the goals of complexity theory is to pinpoint the asymptotically optimal time (or other resource) needed to solve basic computational problems or classes of problems. The theory of NP-completeness attacks this at a coarse level, but modern complexity theory also has tools to give more fine-grained information on computational complexity. A common setting for fine-grained understanding of computational hardness is considering parameterized problems. Under this setting, each instance is attached with an additional parameter k𝑘k indicating some specific quantities (e.g., the optimum or the treewidth). We treat k𝑘k as some super constant that is much smaller than the instance size n𝑛n and consider the existence or absence of algorithms with running time depends both on n𝑛n and k𝑘k (e.g., with running time 22k​nO​(1)superscript2superscript2𝑘superscript𝑛𝑂12^{2^{k}}n^{O(1)}, or nksuperscript𝑛𝑘n^{\\sqrt{k}}). The hardness of parameterized problems is studied under the realm of parameterized complexity theory . It is a central challenge to figure out the minimal time (depending on both n𝑛n and k𝑘k) to solve prototypical parameterized problems. A representative example is the k𝑘k-Clique problem parameterized by the optimum k𝑘k, which is one of the most fundamental problems in parameterized complexity theory: given an n𝑛n-vertex graph as input, determine if it has a clique of size k𝑘k. The naive brute force algorithm takes roughly nksuperscript𝑛𝑘n^{k} time.\nUsing fast matrix multiplication, there are better algorithms that take nω​k/3superscript𝑛𝜔𝑘3n^{\\omega k/3} time, where ω𝜔\\omega is the matrix multiplication exponent.\nOn the hardness side, it is known that no algorithm can decide k𝑘k-Clique within running time f​(k)​no​(k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘f(k)n^{o(k)}, for any computable function f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k), under the widely-considered Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) , which states that algorithms cannot solve 3SAT formulas on n𝑛n variables within running time 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)}. The optimal running time for k𝑘k-clique is therefore pinpointed to be nΩ​(k)superscript𝑛Ω𝑘n^{\\Omega(k)}, assuming ETH. Can one design a faster algorithm if one settles for approximating k𝑘k-Clique?\nFor example, what if we only want to find a clique of size k/2𝑘2k/2 in a graph that is promised to have a k𝑘k-clique.111This can also be formulated as a “gap” decision problem of distinguishing graphs with a k𝑘k-clique from those which do not even have a (k/2)𝑘2(k/2)-clique. It was shown that such an approximation to k𝑘k-Clique still requires the tightest f​(k)​nΩ​(k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛Ω𝑘f(k)n^{\\Omega(k)} time , under the very strong assumption Gap-ETH.\nThe Gap-ETH postulates an exponential time lower bound of approximating Max 3-SAT within a constant ratio.\nThe constant gap baked into the assumption is then transformed into a constant gap for approximating k𝑘k-Clique.\nThough Gap-ETH has been proved under particular strengthening of ETH (smooth version of ETH) ,\na theoretically more satisfactory result is to obtain the hardness of approximating k𝑘k-Clique under the original ETH. Under ETH, weaker time lower bounds were known for constant-factor approximations of k𝑘k-Clique: f​(k)​nΩ​(log⁡k6)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛Ω6𝑘f(k)n^{\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{\\log k}\\right)} in [ref]30, which was later improved to f​(k)​nΩ​(log⁡k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛Ω𝑘f(k)n^{\\Omega(\\log k)} in [ref]31  and f​(k)​nkΩ​(1/log⁡log⁡k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛superscript𝑘Ω1𝑘f(k)n^{k^{\\Omega(1/\\log\\log k)}} in .222There is another line of work on improving the inapproximability factor of k𝑘k-Clique under the minimal hypothesis W≠\\neqFPT: constant factor in [ref]30, and the improved ko​(1)superscript𝑘𝑜1k^{o(1)} in  .\nHowever, all these approaches cannot obtain lower bounds better than f​(k)​nΩ​(k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛Ω𝑘f(k)n^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{k})} due to the coding theoretic barriers . However, this paper significantly improves this lower bound, assuming only the original ETH. Assume ETH. For any constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and any computable function f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k), any algorithm that approximates k𝑘k-Clique within an ε𝜀\\varepsilon ratio must take runtime f​(k)​nk1−o​(1)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛superscript𝑘1𝑜1f(k)n^{k^{1-o(1)}}. To prove the theorem above, we follow a similar idea of proving the NP-hardness of approximating cliques, which relies on the NP-hardness of constant approximating CSP (a.k.a., the PCP theorem) and a subsequent FGLSS reduction 7.\nIn the parameterized setting, we can apply an analogous reduction. We first establish a near-optimal lower bound for approximating (sparse) “parameterized CSPs” with k𝑘k variables, O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k) constraints, an alphabet of size n𝑛n, and some constant inapproximability factor. Then Theorem 1.1 follows immediately by the FGLSS reduction 7. The first step is equivalent to establishing a quantitative version of the Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis (PIH) , which plays the role of the PCP theorem in the parameterized complexity theory.\nThe first quantitative version of PIH was established under Gap-ETH , with the lower bound f​(k)​nΩ​(log⁡k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛Ω𝑘f(k)n^{\\Omega(\\log k)}. A recent improvement proved PIH under ETH 0, with a weaker lower bound f​(k)​nΩ​(log⁡log⁡k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛Ω𝑘f(k)n^{\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{\\log\\log k}\\right)}. However, both results are too weak to establish Theorem 1.1. In this paper, we make a significant quantitative improvement to the reduction in 0, obtaining our main theorem stated below. Assume ETH. For any computable function f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k) and constant ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1), every algorithm that takes as input a satisfiable parameterized 2CSP instance with k𝑘k variables, O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k) constraints and size-n𝑛n alphabet finds an assignment satisfying 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon fraction of the constraints, must take f​(k)​nk1−o​(1)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛superscript𝑘1𝑜1f(k)n^{k^{1-o(1)}} time. By the discussion above, Theorem 1.1 follows immediately by combining Theorem 1.2 and the FGLSS reduction. Moreover, using Theorem 1.2 as the foundation, we can obtain, via reductions, strong inapproximability results for other fundamental parameterized problems. Below, we list two application highlights and refer interested readers to 0 for more detailed discussions. k𝑘k-ExactCover (a.k.a., k𝑘k-UniqueSetCover) is one of the canonical problems in the parameterized world. It is a weaker version of the k𝑘k-SetCover problem.\nFor the ρ𝜌\\rho-approximation version of k𝑘k-ExactCover with ρ≥1𝜌1\\rho\\geq 1, denoted by (k,ρ⋅k)𝑘⋅𝜌𝑘(k,\\rho\\cdot k)-ExactCover, the instance consists of a universe U𝑈U and a collection 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} of subsets of U𝑈U, with a goal to distinguish the following two cases. There exists k𝑘k disjoint subsets from 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} whose union equals the whole universe U𝑈U. The union of any ρ⋅k⋅𝜌𝑘\\rho\\cdot k subsets of 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is a proper subset of U𝑈U. Here, the parameter is the optimum k𝑘k. We remark that the additional disjointness requirement in the completeness part makes (k,ρ⋅k)𝑘⋅𝜌𝑘(k,\\rho\\cdot k)-ExactCover an excellent intermediate problem for proving the hardness of other problems  . On the algorithmic side, the (k,ρ⋅k)𝑘⋅𝜌𝑘(k,\\rho\\cdot k)-ExactCover has a brute-force |𝒮|Ω​(k)superscript𝒮Ω𝑘|\\mathcal{S}|^{\\Omega(k)}-time algorithm. However, no |𝒮|o​(k)superscript𝒮𝑜𝑘|\\mathcal{S}|^{o(k)}-time algorithms are known.\nThus, it is natural to consider whether we can establish a matching |𝒮|Ω​(k)superscript𝒮Ω𝑘|\\mathcal{S}|^{\\Omega(k)} lower bound.\nOur work almost establishes such a lower bound for (k,ρ⋅k)𝑘⋅𝜌𝑘(k,\\rho\\cdot k)-ExactCover, under ETH. (Previously, this was only known under the Gap-ETH assumption . Assume ETH. For any constant ρ≥1𝜌1\\rho\\geq 1 and computable function f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k), any algorithm deciding (k,ρ⋅k)𝑘⋅𝜌𝑘(k,\\rho\\cdot k)-ExactCover must take runtime f​(k)​|𝒮|k1−o​(1)𝑓𝑘superscript𝒮superscript𝑘1𝑜1f(k)|\\mathcal{S}|^{k^{1-o(1)}}. To prove the theorem above, We note that the previous work 1 achieves a parameter-preserving reduction from PIH to (k,ρ⋅k)𝑘⋅𝜌𝑘(k,\\rho\\cdot k)-ExactCover for any constant ρ𝜌\\rho, by imitating the beautiful reduction of Feige 5.333In fact, a weaker variant of PIH, named Average Baby PIH over rectangular constraints, suffices. Therefore, Theorem 1.3 follows by combining the reduction of 1 with our Theorem 1.2. The Max k𝑘k-Coverage is the maximization variant of the k𝑘k-SetCover problem. For the ρ𝜌\\rho-approximation version of Max k𝑘k-Coverage with ρ<1𝜌1\\rho<1, denoted by Max (ρ,k)𝜌𝑘(\\rho,k)-Coverage, the instances are the same as k𝑘k-ExactCover above, but the goal changes to distinguish the following two case: There exists k𝑘k subsets from 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} whose union equals 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U}. Any k𝑘k subsets from 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} has the union size at most ρ⋅|𝒰|⋅𝜌𝒰\\rho\\cdot|\\mathcal{U}|. Max (ρ,k)𝜌𝑘(\\rho,k)-Coverage has been widely studied in previous literature. There exists a simple greedy algorithm solving Max (1−1e,k)11𝑒𝑘(1-\\frac{1}{e},k)-Coverage within polynomial runtime 2. On the hardness side, a celebrated result of Feige 5 showed the NP-hardness of Max (1−1e+ε,k)11𝑒𝜀𝑘(1-\\frac{1}{e}+\\varepsilon,k)-Coverage for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, thus proving a tight inapproximability result. In the parameterized world, one can solve Max k𝑘k-Coverage in |𝒮|ksuperscript𝒮𝑘|\\mathcal{S}|^{k} time by brute force enumeration. On the other hand, Cohen-Addad, Gupta, Kumar, Lee, and Li  showed that assuming Gap-ETH, Max (1−1e+ε,k)11𝑒𝜀𝑘(1-\\frac{1}{e}+\\varepsilon,k)-Coverage requires f​(k)​|𝒮|kpoly​(1/ε)𝑓𝑘superscript𝒮superscript𝑘poly1𝜀f(k)|\\mathcal{S}|^{k^{{\\rm poly}(1/\\varepsilon)}} runtime.\nManurangsi  further improved this lower bound to the tightest f​(k)​|𝒮|Ω​(k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝒮Ω𝑘f(k)|\\mathcal{S}|^{\\Omega(k)} under Gap-ETH. Our work implies an almost-optimal time lower bound for Max (1−1e+ε,k)11𝑒𝜀𝑘(1-\\frac{1}{e}+\\varepsilon,k)-Coverage under ETH. Assume ETH. For any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and computable function f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k), any algorithm deciding Max (1−1e+ε,k)11𝑒𝜀𝑘(1-\\frac{1}{e}+\\varepsilon,k)-Coverage must take runtime f​(k)​|𝒮|k1−o​(1)𝑓𝑘superscript𝒮superscript𝑘1𝑜1f(k)|\\mathcal{S}|^{k^{1-o(1)}}. Theorem 1.4 follows from our Theorem 1.2 and the analysis in [34, Sections 9.1 and 9.2] that accomplishes a gap-preserving reduction from k𝑘k-CSP to Max k𝑘k-Coverage. An interesting byproduct of Theorem 1.2 is a new PCP theorem for 3SAT as follows. For any parameter k≪nmuch-less-than𝑘𝑛k\\ll n,\n3SAT has a constant-query PCP verifier with alphabet size |Σ|=2n/k1−o​(1)Σsuperscript2𝑛superscript𝑘1𝑜1|\\Sigma|=2^{n/k^{1-o(1)}}, runtime poly​(|Σ|,n)polyΣ𝑛{\\rm poly}(|\\Sigma|,n), and log⁡k+O​(log⁡k​log⁡log⁡k)𝑘𝑂𝑘𝑘\\log k+O\\left(\\sqrt{\\log k}\\log\\log k\\right) random coins, which has perfect completeness and soundness 1212\\frac{1}{2}. Theorem 1.5 generalizes the classic PCP theorem and gives a smooth trade-off between the proof length and the alphabet size, connecting parameterized complexity and the classical complexity theory. In Section 2, we provide an overview for our proof of Theorem 1.2 and discuss future works.\nIn Section 3, we formalize necessary notation and concepts.\nThe formal structure for proving Theorem 1.2 is presented in Section 4, with most technical statements deferred to other sections: the reduction from ETH-hard problems to special vector-valued CSPs is provided in Section 5, and the PCPP verifier for a helper language is constructed in Section 6.\nIn Appendix A, we give details of derandomized parallel low degree tests which is a key component for the PCPP construction.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: under the original ETH.
