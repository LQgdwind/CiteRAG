      "content": "Paper Title: HYPER: Learned Hybrid Trajectory Prediction via Factored Inference and Adaptive Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our full model with a number of representative baselines, including i) DESIRE¬† that utilizes a conditional VAE model to generate trajectory prediction samples from a latent space; ii) DiversityGAN¬†[ref]3 that predicts diverse samples by learning a latent space in a GAN model such that the prediction samples with different semantic meanings are far away in that latent space. This baseline is similar to other diverse sampling works that improve coverage through a learned latent space¬† [ref]52; iii) MultiPath¬† that learns the trajectory modalities as a set of anchors and predicts trajectories through anchor classification and offset regression; iv) TNT¬†[ref]6 that first infers discrete target locations and second predicts target-conditioned trajectories to support multi-modality.\nIn addition, we introduce a few variants of our models to validate our hypothesis, including v) SingleMode that assumes a single mode and only samples from the continuous distribution; vi) HYPER-Linear that uses only linear layers in the decoder to simulate a linear dynamic system as in existing factored inference literature that assumes linear dynamics; vii) HYPER-Coverage that is trained with only the task-specific coverage loss, defined in Eq.¬†(2) ‚Äì it shares the same spirit as¬† that optimizes for the minimum loss; viii) HYPER-Perturb that is trained on a dataset in which we randomly perturb 5% of discrete labels. We use the metrics reported in¬†[ref]6, and present the comparison in Table¬†III. HYPER outperforms all baselines that assume a fixed intent over time (i-iv), ignore discrete structure in the model (v), or presume linear dynamics (vi). In order to demonstrate its robustness with noisy discrete labels, we randomly perturbed 5% of discrete labels and observe that our model trained on the perturbed data achieves similar results (viii).\nWe further improve the minADE metric with a variant, HYPER-Coverage, that is solely trained towards optimizing this metric, but sacrifices accuracy measured by the negative log-likelihood metric (NLL)¬†. Our method, on the other hand, allows for the trade-off between accuracy and coverage. (a) (b) (c) (d) (a) (b) The work that is closest to ours in spirit is ManeuverLSTM¬†. It models driving modes explicitly as maneuvers labeled from trajectory data, and assumes the maneuver is fixed over time. For a fair comparison, we use the same model, training process, and definition of maneuvers as used in our model, except forcing each sample to have a fixed mode over the prediction horizons for ManeuverLSTM. We use five samples for comparison given the number of maneuvers defined for ManeuverLSTM. In addition to the standard metrics, we introduce min-of-KùêæK discrete error rate (minDER) that measures the percentage of wrong predictions in discrete states for the best predicted sample, to quantify the discrete prediction accuracy and coverage. Table¬†IV demonstrates that our model outperforms this baseline by a large margin, in both continuous and discrete metrics, by supporting evolving maneuver intent and utilizing a proposal function to explore the intent space.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: our full model with a number of representative baselines, including i) DESIRE¬† that utilizes a conditional VAE model to generate trajectory prediction samples from a latent space; ii) DiversityGAN¬†[ref]3 that predicts diverse samples by learning a latent space in a GAN model such that the prediction samples with different semantic meanings are far away in that latent space.
