      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum communication complexity of linear regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCommunication complexity has been studied extensively in the field of classical and quantum computing     . It usually deals with the following type of problem. Suppose there are two separated parties: Alice and Bob. Alice receives some input x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X and Bob receives some input y∈Y𝑦𝑌y\\in Y. Their goal is to compute f​(x,y)𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x,y) together using as little communication as possible. We usually assume that Alice and Bob have unlimited computational power so that they can perform any computation as efficiently as they want. The measure of complexity used is the amount of communication required to solve the problem. All other non-communication operations are treated as free.\nA protocol is an algorithm where first Alice does some individual computation, and then sends a quantum/classical message to Bob, then Bob does some individual computation and sends a quantum/classical message to Alice, etc. In the end, one of the parties outputs some value that should be f​(x,y)𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x,y).\nA quantum message usually refers to a quantum state. The cost of sending a quantum state is described by the number of qubits the quantum state occupies. In contrast, the cost of sending a classical message is the number of bits the message uses. The cost of a protocol is the total number of bits/qubits communicated on the worst-case input. We are more concerned about the minimal amount of communication they need. A deterministic protocol for f𝑓f always has\nto output the right value f​(x,y)𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x,y) for all (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y). In a bounded-error protocol, the protocol has to output the right value f​(x,y)𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x,y) with probability at least 2/3232/3 for all (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y).  In the randomised model, Alice and Bob share an unlimited supply of uniformly random bits, which they can use in deciding what messages to send. Also, an error is allowed in randomised protocols, which means the output of the protocol is correct with probability at least 2/3. In this work, in the classical case, we will focus on randomised communication complexity. In the quantum case, we focus on bounded error communication complexity. If only one party (say Alice) can send information to another party, then this is known as 1-way communication model. Otherwise, it is a 2-way communication model. More generally, there can be multiple parties. In this case, there are many ways to define the models. For example, in the simultaneous message passing (SMP) model, there is a referee so that each party can only communicate with the referee. If the communication is 2-way, then it is also known as coordinator model classically . Regarding communication complexity, two fundamental problems are the index problem and the disjointness problem. These problems are well-studied classically and quantumly. They also play significant roles in this paper for the lower bounds estimation.\nIn the index problem, Alice has a bit string (x1,…,xn)∈{0,1}nsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛superscript01𝑛(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} and Bob has an index j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n]. The goal is to determine xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. This problem is trivial if Bob can send information to Alice. Namely, Bob just sends the index j𝑗j to Alice, and Alice outputs xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. The index problem is hard if the communication is 1-way from Alice to Bob. In the disjointness problem, Alice has a bit string (x1,…,xn)∈{0,1}nsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛superscript01𝑛(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} and Bob has another bit string (y1,…,yn)∈{0,1}nsubscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑛superscript01𝑛(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n})\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}. The goal is to determine if there is an index j𝑗j such that xj=yj=1subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝑦𝑗1x_{j}=y_{j}=1. We summarize the known results for these two problems into the following proposition. We have the following. The classical 1-way communication complexity of the index problem is Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) . The quantum 1-way communication complexity of the index problem is Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) [ref]7. The classical 2-way communication complexity of the disjointness problem is Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n)  . The quantum 2-way communication complexity of the disjointness problem is Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})  . Another known result we will use is called Distributed Fourier Sampling . In this problem, Alice is given a function f:{0,1}n→{±1}:𝑓→superscript01𝑛plus-or-minus1f:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{\\pm 1\\}, Bob is given a function g:{0,1}n→{±1}:𝑔→superscript01𝑛plus-or-minus1g:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{\\pm 1\\}, their task is for one party (say Bob) to approximately sample from the distribution Pf​gsubscript𝑃𝑓𝑔P_{fg} on n𝑛n-bit strings s𝑠s where and s⋅x=∑isi​xi⋅𝑠𝑥subscript𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖s\\cdot x=\\sum_{i}s_{i}x_{i}. That is, Bob must output a sample from any distribution P~f​gsubscript~𝑃𝑓𝑔\\widetilde{P}_{fg} such that ‖P~f​g−Pf​g‖1≤εsubscriptnormsubscript~𝑃𝑓𝑔subscript𝑃𝑓𝑔1𝜀\\|\\widetilde{P}_{fg}-P_{fg}\\|_{1}\\leq\\varepsilon for some constant inaccuracy ε𝜀\\varepsilon. There exist universal constants ε,γ>0𝜀𝛾0\\varepsilon,\\gamma>0 such that, for sufficiently large n𝑛n, any 2-way classical communication protocol for Distributed Fourier Sampling with shared randomness and inaccuracy ε𝜀\\varepsilon must communicate at least γ​2n𝛾superscript2𝑛\\gamma 2^{n} bits. The last result will be used in this work is the multi-player set-disjointness problem . In this problem, player Pjsubscript𝑃𝑗P_{j} holds a subset Tj∈[n]subscript𝑇𝑗delimited-[]𝑛T_{j}\\in[n], where j∈{1,…,k}𝑗1…𝑘j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}, and their goal is to determine if there is a j∈{2,…,k}𝑗2…𝑘j\\in\\{2,\\ldots,k\\} such that T1∩Tj≠∅subscript𝑇1subscript𝑇𝑗T_{1}\\cap T_{j}\\neq\\emptyset. This problem was studied in the coordinator model. Assume that n≥3200​k𝑛3200𝑘n\\geq 3200k, then the communication complexity of the multi-player set-disjointness problem is lower bounded by Ω​(k​n)Ω𝑘𝑛\\Omega(kn) in the coordinator model.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: We have the following.
