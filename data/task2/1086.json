      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Optimise General TSP Instances\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe performance of our technique compared with a variety of baselines, including: Solvers, an efficient exact solver specialized for TSP; heuristics, well-known heuristic solvers that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various routing problems; open source software for combinatorial optimisation (OR-Tools), a mature and widely used solver for routing problems based on meta-heuristics; learning models using supervised techniques(SL); and learning methods using reinforcement learning (RL). We report optimal results by Concorde specialized for TSP . We compare against 2-opt and Christofied local search, MST, Cheapest, Nearest, Random and Farthest Insertion, as well as Nearest Neighbor in Table 1 and 2. We also focus our comparison to the recently proposed deep learning methods [ref]6, 6, ,, ,  and [ref]9 using their publicly released implementations in Table 2. We also compared our results with Google Or-Tools  in both the tables 1 and 2. The description of baselines, experimental procedures are as follows: Concorde: Concorde also denoted as (OPT) in Table 1 is a computer code for the symmetric TSP and some related network optimisation problems. Concorde’s TSP solver has been used to obtain the optimal solutions for all random instances and TSPLIB instances; We implemented Concorde  that use algorithms   . In Table 1 and Fig. 8 denoted the results as OPT. In Fig. 9 denoted the result as optimal. Nearest Insertion: Nearest Insertion  inserts the node to the nearest set of nodes (neighbours), for such insertion operation causes the least cost in the overall tour length. Farthest Insertion: Furthest Insertion  needs to select two cities and connect them to get the least cost tour, then find another farthest city of this tour. Repeat the step until every city associates to complete the tour Random Insertion: Random Insertion  needs to select two cities. A Random insertion adds a random node where the added node order is also random similar to the nearest neighbour. Nearest neighbour: The Nearest Neighbour  heuristic represents the partial solution as a path with a start and end node. First, start in some city and the select to visit the city to the starting city. Continue the process, and at the end, all cities visited, and the end city is connected with the start city. We follow the implementation of [ref]9. 2-Opt: Croes  first introduced the 2-optimisation method, which is a simple and very common operator. The idea of 2-opt is to exchange the links between two pairs of subsequent nodes. Minimum Spanning Tree: A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)  aims to minimise the weights (tour lengths) of the edges of the tree. Christofides: Christofides algorithm  is a heuristic algorithm which aims to find a near-optimal solution to the problem. It follows steps, first find an MST (minimum spanning tree ), second find a minimum-weight perfect matching M among vertices with odd degree. Create a minimum spanning tree T of G, to Make a multigraph G; it combines the edges of M and T. Then find an Euler cycle in G by skipping vertices already visited. Cheapest: The Cheapest-Link Algorithm select the edge with the smallest weight and mark it and continue that following rules, do not pick an edge that will close a circuit –Do not pick an edge that will create three edges coming out from a single vertex Connect the last two vertices to close the circuit. OR-Tools: Google Optimisation Tools (OR-Tools) is an open-source solver for combinatorial optimisation problems. OR-Tools contains one of the best available vehicle routing problem (VRP), which is a generalisation of the TSP and implemented many heuristics for finding an initial solution and metaheuristics, we use it as our baseline. We have used the local-search meta-heuristics used in OR-Tools as Guided Local Search. Pointer Network(PN): We implemented the pointer network with supervised learning [ref]6 Bello et al.: Across all experiments, used mini-batches of 128 sequences, LSTM cells with 128 hidden units, and train models with the Adam optimiser . The learning rate used 10−3superscript10310^{-3} for TSP20 and TSP50. Larger problems TSP100 learning rate used 10−4superscript10410^{-4}. After implementing the code, we reported the result. EAN: For experiment Policy gradient across all tasks, we follow the configuration provided in (), and we report results. [R​L+G​r𝑅𝐿𝐺𝑟RL+Gr and R​L+B​s𝑅𝐿𝐵𝑠RL+Bs]: For experiment, Nazari et al. () implemented following the GitHub code 777https://github.com/OptMLGroup/VRP-RL. A​M+G​r𝐴𝑀𝐺𝑟AM+Gr: For experiment, ([ref]9), initiating parameter uniform (−1d,1d)1𝑑1𝑑(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}},\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}), with d𝑑d the input dimension. Every epoch we process 2500 batches of 512 instances. Used a constant learning rate 0.0001 Training with a higher learning rate 0.001 is possible and speeds up initial learning, but requires decay (0:96 per epoch) to converge. Implemented following the the GitHub code 888https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: local search, MST, Cheapest, Nearest, Random and Farthest Insertion, as well as Nearest Neighbor in Table 1 and 2.
