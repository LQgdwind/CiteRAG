      "content": "Paper Title: Improving the Search by Encoding Multiple Solutions in a Chromosome\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvolutionary Algorithms (EAs)   are powerful tools used for solving difficult real-world problems. This paper describes a new paradigm called Multi Solution Programming (MSP) that may be used for improving the search performed by the Evolutionary Algorithms. The main idea is to encode multiple solutions (more than one) in a single chromosome. The best solution encoded in a chromosome will represent (will provide the fitness of) that individual. This special kind of encoding is useful when the complexity of the decoding process is similar to the complexity of the decoding process of chromosomes encoding a single solution of the problem being solved. Note that the Multi Solution Programming is not a particular technique, but a paradigm intended to be used in conjunction with an Evolutionary Algorithm. MSP refers to a new way of encoding solutions in a chromosome. GP techniques are very suitable for the MSP paradigm because the trees offer an implicit multiple solutions representation: each sub-tree may be considered as a potential solution of the problem. Three Genetic Programming (GP)   variants are tested with the proposed model: Multi Expression Programming (MEP)  , Linear Genetic Programming (LGP)    [ref]16 and Infix Form Genetic Programming (IFGP) . Multi Expression Programming uses a chromosome encoding similar to the way in which C or Pascal compilers translate mathematical expressions in machine code. Note that MEP was originally designed  to encode multiple solutions in a chromosome. A MEP variant that encodes a single solution in a chromosome is proposed and tested in this paper. A Linear Genetic Programming chromosome is a sequence of C language instructions. Each instruction has a destination variable and several source variables. One of the variables is usually chosen to provide the output of the program. A LGP variant encoding multiple solutions in a chromosome is proposed in this paper. Infix Form Genetic Programming chromosomes are strings of integer encoding mathematical expressions in infix form. Each IFGP chromosome encodes multiple solutions of the problem being solved . A IFGP variant encoding a single solution in a chromosome is proposed and tested in this paper. All the solutions represented in a MSP individual should be decoded by traversing the chromosome only once. Partial\nresults are stored by using Dynamic Programming. Several numerical experiments with the considered GP techniques are performed by using 4\nsymbolic regression problems. For each test problem the relationships between the success\nrate and the population size and the code length are analyzed. Results show that Multi Solutions Programming significantly improves the evolutionary search. For all considered test\nproblems the evolutionary techniques encoding multiple solutions in a chromosome are significantly better than the similar techniques encoding a single solution in a chromosome. The paper is organized as follows. Motivation for this research is presented in section 2. Test problems used to asses the performance of the considered algorithms are given in section 3. Multi Expression Programming and its counterpart Single Expression Programming are described in section 4. Linear Genetic Programming and Multi-Solution Linear Genetic Programming are described in section 5. Infix Form Genetic Programming and Single-Solution Infix Form Genetic Programming are described in section 6. Conclusions and further work directions are given in section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: as a potential solution of the problem.
