      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Attentive Belief Propagation: Integrating Reasoning and Learning for Solving Constraint Optimization Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough COP is NP-hard in general , many algorithms have been proposed to solve it in the last several decades, such as BP, local search , branch and bound , and bucket elimination . Among them, Min-sum BP is an effective approximate algorithm for solving COPs and has been successfully applied to many real-world scenarios [ref]15  . However, vanilla BP offers no convergence guarantee and usually returns low-quality solutions on problems with cyclic factor graphs. Rogers et al. proposed to ensure convergence and have a lower bound on solution quality by relaxing the problem, i.e., removing edges to have acyclic factor graphs  through minimization marginalization. Further, Rollon et al. improved the bounding scheme by considering both minimization and maximization marginalization  and decomposing high-arity factors into unary functions . On the other hand, Zivan et al. proposed to avoid loopy message propagation by strictly controlling the message-passing direction . They also introduced the Value Propagation (VP) scheme to enforce exploitation. To balance exploration and exploitation, a set of non-consecutive VP strategies are proposed  as well. Recently, Damped BP (DBP)  has been proposed to enhance convergence as well as solution quality in loopy BP by mixing the new messages composed in each iteration with the old messages in previous iterations with a suitable damping factor. However, selecting a good damping factor often requires expertise and laborious case-by-case tuning , and DBP uses a static damping factor and treats each node’s neighbors equally when composing a new message, which limits its exploration. Our DABP overcomes the aforementioned issues by learning to attend neighbors with dynamic damping factors and neighbor weights when composing new BP messages. Obviously, DABP generalizes DBP since DBP can be considered as a static version of DABP. Moreover, equipped with a self-supervised learning algorithm, our DABP is able to infer the optimal damping factors and weights to enhance the performance of DBP. On the other hand, LP-based methods solve a COP by leveraging message-passing to solve a Linear Program (LP) relaxation of the combinatorial problem. MPLP  is a simple BP variant that solves the convex-dual of the LP relaxation via block gradient descent. Unfortunately, the global convergence is not always guaranteed since coordinate descent may get stuck in suboptimal points. Tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRBP)  and Fractional Belief Propagation  consider respectively a linear combination of free energies defined on spanning trees of the factor graph and a fractional free energy that generalizes the well-known Bethe free energy. Finally, Norm-Product  provides a uniform framework that generalizes Max-product, Sum-product and their TRBP counterpart. Unlike these methods, our DABP directly solve the problem by learning optimal hyperparameters for DBP, and does not require any form of LP relaxation which may either induce intractable number of constraints or only offer a lower bound . Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying DNNs to boost the performance of BP. The most relevant works including: NEBP  learns to refine BP messages with some black-box DNN components in each iteration and is applied to solve the error correction decoding task; In the same vein, BPNN  uses damping layers to modify factor-to-variable messages and is applied to estimate the partition function of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs); FGNN  generalizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent Max-Product BP and is applied to find approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of a PGM. However, all these methods require supervised learning and cannot be directly applied to solve COPs when training labels are not available; They also destroy the semantic of a BP message being the weighted sum of cost functions’ marginalizations. Contrarily, we only learn optimal dynamic factors and neighbor weights with DNNs to generalize DBP, which preserves the semantic of the BP messages and also enables us using a self-supervised manner to train our model. Therefore, our model does not require expensive training labels which are often not available in practice due to the heavy computation of exact solvers; and also avoids out-of-distribution issue and enjoys a nice anytime property  through efficient online learning. Our method is also closely related to using DNNs to solve combinatorial problems     . In the context of COP solving, Neural RM-RRS  uses Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to parameterize high-dimensional regret tables produced by context-based regret-matching. Similarly, Deep Bucket Elimination (DBE)  uses MLPs to approximate the large bucket functions . Recently, Deng et al.  proposed a pretrained cost model which predicts the optimal cost of a given partially instantiated COP. The predicted cost is then used to construct heuristics for various COP algorithms such as Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)  and backtracking search. These methods either replace some heavy computation components of COP algorithms by a fast DNN approximation, or learn effective heuristics (or hyperparameters) to boost the performance of COP algorithms, and our method falls into the second category.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: search , branch and bound , and bucket elimination .
