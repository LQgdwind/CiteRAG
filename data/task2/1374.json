      "content": "Paper Title: On the eigenvector bias of Fourier feature networks: From regression to solving multi-scale PDEs with physics-informed neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLeveraging advances in automatic differentiation ,\ndeep learning tools are introducing a new trend\nin tackling forward and inverse problems in computational mechanics. Under this emerging paradigm, unknown quantities of interest are typically parametrized by deep neural networks, and a multi-task learning problem is posed with the dual goal of fitting observational data and approximately satisfying a given physical law, mathematically expressed via systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Since the early studies of Psichogios et al.  and Lagaris et al. , and their modern re-incarnation via the framework of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [ref]4, the use of neural networks to represent PDE solutions has undergone rapid growth, both in terms of theory  [ref]6   and diverse applications in computational science and engineering  0 1. PINNs in particular, have demonstrated remarkable power in applications including fluid dynamics 2 3 4, biomedical engineering 5 6 7, meta-material design 8 9, free boundary problems 0, Bayesian networks and uncertainty quantification 1 2, high dimensional PDEs 3 4 5, stochastic differential equations 6, and beyond 7 8. However, despite this early empirical success, we are still lacking a concrete mathematical understanding of the mechanisms that render such constrained neural network models effective, and, more importantly, the reasons why these models can oftentimes fail. In fact, more often than not, PINNs are notoriously hard to train, especially for forward problems exhibiting high-frequency or multi-scale behavior. Recent work by Wang et al. 9 [ref]6 has identified two fundamental weaknesses in conventional PINN formulations. The first is related to a remarkable discrepancy of convergence rate between the different terms that define a PINN loss function. As demonstrated by Wang et al. 9, the gradient flow of PINN models becomes increasingly stiff for PDE solutions exhibiting high-frequency or multi-scale behavior, often leading to unbalanced gradients during back-propagation. A subsequent analysis using the recently developed neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory [ref]6, has revealed how different terms in a PINNs loss may dominate one another, leading to models that cannot simultaneously fit the observed data and minimize the PDE residual. These findings have motivated the development of novel optimization schemes and adaptive learning rate annealing strategies that are demonstrated to be very effective in minimizing multi-task loss functions, such as the ones routinely encountered in PINNs 9 [ref]6. The second fundamental weakness of PINNs is related to spectral bias 0 1 2; a commonly observed pathology of deep fully-connected networks that prevents them from learning high-frequency functions. As analyzed in [ref]6 using NTK theory 3 4 5, spectral bias indeed exists in PINN models and is the leading reason that prevents them from accurately approximating high-frequency or multi-scale functions. To this end, recent work in 6 7 8, attempts to empirically address this pathology by introducing appropriate input scaling factors to convert the problem of approximating high frequency components of the target function to one of approximating lower frequencies. In another line of work, Tancik et al. 9 introduced Fourier feature networks which use a simple Fourier feature mapping to enhance the ability of fully-connected networks to learn high-frequency functions.\nAlthough these techniques can be effective in some cases, in general, they still lack a concrete mathematical justification in relation to how they potentially address spectral bias. Building on the these recent findings, this work attempts to analyze and address the aforementioned shortcomings of PINNs, with a particular focus on designing effective models for multi-scale PDEs.\nTo this end, we rigorously study fully-connected neural networks and PINNs through the lens of their limiting NTK, and produce novel insights into how these models fall short in presence of target functions with high-frequencies of multi-scale features. Using this analysis, we propose a family of novel architectures that can effectively mitigate spectral bias and enable the solution of problems for which current PINN approaches fail. Specifically, our\nmain contributions can be summarized into the following points: We argue that spectral bias in deep neural networks in fact corresponds to “NTK eigenvector bias”, and show that Fourier feature mappings can modulate the frequency of the NTK eigenvectors. By analyzing how the NTK eigenspace determines the type of functions a neural net can learn, we engineer new effective architectures for multi-scale problems. We propose a series of benchmarks for which conventional PINN models fail, and use them to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present a brief overview of PINNs and emphasize their weakness in solving multi-scale problems. Next, we introduce the neural tangent kernel (NTK) as a theoretical tool to detect and analyze spectral bias in section 3.1. Furthermore, we study the NTK eigensystem of Fourier feature networks and propose two novel network architectures that are efficient in handling multi-scale problems, see section 3.2, 3.3.\nWe present a detailed evaluation of our proposed neural network architectures across a range of representative benchmark examples, see section 4.\nFinally, in section 5, we summarize our findings and provide a discussion on lingering limitations and promising future directions.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: differential equations (PDEs).
