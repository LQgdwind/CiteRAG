      "content": "Paper Title: Non-linear Motion Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation using Space-time Convolutions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideo frame interpolation (VFI) (also known as Video temporal super-resolution) is a significant video enhancement problem which aims to synthesize one or more visually coherent frames between two consecutive frames in a video, i.e., to up-scale the number of video frames. Such an up-scaling method finds its usage in numerous video-based applications such as slow-motion video generation (e.g., in sports and TV commercials), video compression-decompression framework , generating short videos from GIF images , novel view synthesis [ref]12 and medical imaging  . Earlier methods  [ref]24  [ref]15  in this domain rely on estimating optical flow between interpolated frame to source frames (i.e., neighboring frames). Once the optical flow is estimated, the interpolated frame can be synthesized by a simple warp operation from source images. However, estimating an accurate optical flow between video frames is a hard problem in itself. Thus, some methods    relied on estimating per-pixel interpolation kernels to smoothly blend source frames to produce the interpolated frame. Further, some hybrid methods   were also proposed to integrate optical flow and interpolation kernel based approaches, exhibiting better performance than earlier class of methods. Most state-of-the-art interpolation algorithms take two neighboring frames as input to produce the intermediate frame. As a result, only a linear motion can be modeled between the frames either explicitly or implicitly. However, objects often follow complex, non-linear trajectories. To this end, researchers recently focused on leveraging information from more than two neighboring frames 0 3   . 3D convolutional neural networks have gained success in many important computer vision tasks such as action recognition   7 , object recognition , video object segmentation  and biomedical volumetric image segmentation . However, the application of 3D CNNs in VFI task is largely unexplored. Recently, Kalluri et al.  use a 3D UNet to directly synthesize interpolated frames. However, hallucinating pixel values from scratch can lead to blurry results and simply copying pixels from nearby frames can produce better results . In this work, we propose a novel frame interpolation method. First, we compute bi-directional flow and occlusion maps from four neighboring frames and predict a non-linear flow model with the help of a 3D CNN. In this regard, we formulate a novel 3D CNN architecture namely “GridNet-3D” inspired from 2 for efficient multi-scale feature aggregation.\nFurther, the predicted non-linear flow model is used as coefficients in a quadratic formulation of inter-frame motion. The idea is that such an approach can adaptively select between linear and quadratic models by estimating suitable values for the coefficients.\nIntermediate backward flows are produced through flow reversal and motion refinement. Finally, two neighboring frames are warped and combined using a blending mask to synthesize the interpolated frame. Our algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches on multiple datasets. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We introduce a novel frame interpolation algorithm that utilizes both flow and occlusion maps between four input frames to estimate an automatically adaptable pixel-wise non-linear motion model to interpolate the frames. We propose a parameter and runtime-efficient 3D CNN named “GridNet-3D” to aggregate multi-scale features efficiently. Through a set of comprehensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (Vimeo, DAVIS, HD and GoPro), we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some significant prior works in Video Frame Interpolation, Section 3 describes our algorithm, Section 4 contains experiments along with some ablation studies and finally Section 5 summarizes limitations of our approach and discusses possible future directions.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: applications such as slow-motion video generation (e.g., in sports and TV commercials), video compression-decompression framework , generating short videos from GIF images , novel view synthesis [ref]12 and medical imaging  .
