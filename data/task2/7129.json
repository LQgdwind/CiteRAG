      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for LEO Constellations Integrated with HAPs Using Hybrid NOMA-OFDM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLEO Satellite Constellation.\nWe examine a Walker-delta constellation 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}  consisting of 60 LEO satellites in six orbits, with ten satellites in each orbit (see Figs. 7 and 7). The six orbits are located on three different shells at altitudes of 500 km, 1000 km, and 1500 km above the Earth’s surface. Each shell contains two orbits and each orbit has an inclination angle of 70∘. We examine a variety of 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} scenarios, including GS, single HAP, two HAPs, and three HAPs. For both the GS and single-HAP scenarios, they are located at Rolla, Missouri, USA (but can be anywhere of/above the Earth). The scenarios with two/three HAPs involve one HAP positioned above the city of Chinook, MT, USA, and another HAP positioned above the city of Primorsky Krai, Russia, in addition to the HAP above the city of Rolla, USA. All 𝒫​𝒮​s𝒫𝒮𝑠\\mathcal{PS}s are situated at an altitude of 25 km above the Earth’s surface and maintain a minimum elevation angle of 10∘. To compute the visiting pattern of LEO satellites to each 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS}, we use a simulator called Simulator Tool Kits (STK) developed by AGI. All 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS}-Satellite connections are monitored over a period of three days to obtain a comprehensive set of results. Communication links. The parameters pertaining to the communication channel of the NOMA system, as discussed in Section III-B, are assigned as follows: Pssubscript𝑃𝑠P_{s} varies from -40 to 40 dBm, the antenna gain for Gk​(θ)subscript𝐺𝑘𝜃G_{k}(\\theta) and G𝒫​𝒮subscript𝐺𝒫𝒮G_{\\mathcal{PS}} is set to 6.98 dBi, the carrier frequency f𝑓f is 20 GHz, T𝑇T is 354.81 K, and B𝐵B is set to 50 MHz. The power allocation coefficients allocate 75% and 25% power to the FS and NS, respectively. The path loss exponent is 4, and the fading severity parameter m𝑚m is 2. The average power of the multi-path component ι𝜄\\iota and the LoS component ΩΩ\\Omega are set to 0.279 and 0.251, respectively. Finally, we select the communication channel type as shadowed Rician, with QPSK as the modulation type. Baselines. To the best of our knowledge, the NOMA scheme has not been introduced to FL with LEO satellites as clients before. Therefore, we first investigate the performance of NomaFedHAP with a single HAP as 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} in comparison with traditional OMA schemes. Second, we compare NomaFedHAP against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL-LEO approaches proposed recently and reviewed in Section II, including: Synchronous FL approaches: FedAvg [ref]4, FedHAP , FedISL , and DSFL . Asynchronous FL approaches: FedSatSchedule [ref]14, FedSpace , FedSat , AsyncFLEO , and FedAsync . Datasets and ML models. To evaluate the performance of NomaFedHAP against baseline approaches, we focus on image classification. We employ commonly used model training datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, which are frequently utilized in various FL-SatCom studies  [ref]14  . In addition, despite the lack of space application datasets, we utilize a real dataset of high-resolution satellite images called DeepGlobe for road extraction to provide a realistic evaluation of NomaFedHAP as well as demonstrate its applicability to real-world scenarios. The specifics of each dataset are as follows: MNIST : is a dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten numbers of size 28×\\times28 pixels. To train our satellites, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) with three convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and one fully connected layer with 437,840 trainable parameters. CIFAR-10 [ref]39: is a dataset consisting of 60,000 colored images of ten classes, each with 6000 images. Each image has a size of 32×\\times32 pixels (images of animals and vehicles). To train our satellites, we also use the CNN model with 798,653 training parameters. CIFAR-100 [ref]39: is a dataset similar to CIFAR-10, but contains 100 classes with 600 images each, which makes the training task more challenging. As a result, the CNN model is constructed using six convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, with 7,759,521 training parameters. DeepGlobe for Road Extraction : is a dataset consisting of 6,226 colored satellite images of size 1024×\\times1024 with a high-resolution of 50 cm/pixel. For more effective training, we apply various data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, and contrast adjusting, resulting in a dataset size of 12,452. To train our satellites, We use the U-Net model with 3,048,576 training parameters. Our analysis considers both IID and non-IID data distributions (except for DeepGlobe where the images are already non-IID). In the IID setup, each satellite on each shell trains over the same classes of images, but these images are shuffled randomly and distributed equally across satellites. In the non-IID setup, satellites on each of two shells train on a distinct set of 30% of the classes, while satellites on the other shell train on 40% of the classes. The training hyperparameters are set as follows: the number of local training epochs is 100, the learning rate ranges from 0.1 to 0.0001, and the mini-batch size is 32.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: traditional OMA schemes.
