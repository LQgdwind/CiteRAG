      "content": "Paper Title: Mask Guided Matting via Progressive Refinement Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage matting is a fundamental computer vision problem which aims to predict an alpha matte to precisely cut out an image region. It has many applications in image and video editing [ref]39 [ref]41 .\nMost previous matting methods require a well-annotated trimap as an auxiliary guidance input [ref]39, which explicitly defines the regions of foreground and background as well as the unknown part for the matting methods to solve. Although such annotation makes the problem more tractable, it can be quite burdensome for users and limits the usefulness of these methods in many non-interactive applications. Recently, researchers start to study the matting problem in a trimap-free setting. One direction is to get rid of any external guidance, and hope that the matting model can capture both semantics and details by end-to-end training on large-scale datasets  . Nevertheless, these methods are faced with the generalization challenge due to the lack of semantic guidance when tested on complex real-world images.\nAnother line of works investigate alternatives to the trimap guidance, easing the requirement for human input    [ref]13. For example,  [ref]13 proposed techniques for automatic trimap generation, while  takes background images instead as extra inputs. However, these methods often require a very specific type of guidance they are trained with and thus become less appealing when the guidance inputs may have varied characteristics or forms. In this work, we introduce a Mask Guided (MG) Matting method which takes a general coarse mask as guidance. MG Matting is very robust to the guidance input and can obtain high-quality matting results using various types of mask guidance such as a trimap, a rough binary segmentation mask or a low-quality soft alpha matte.\nTo achieve such robustness to guidance input, we propose a Progressive Refinement Network (PRN) module, which learns to provide self-guidance to progressively refine the uncertain matting regions through the decoding process.\nTo further enhance the robustness of our method to external guidance, we also develop a series of guidance mask perturbation operations including\nrandom binarization, random morphological operations, and also a stronger perturbation CutMask to simulate diverse guidance inputs during training. In addition to alpha matting prediction, we also revisit the foreground color prediction problem for matting. Without accurately recovering the foreground color in the transparent region, the composited image will suffer from the fringing issue. We note that the foreground color labels in the widely-used dataset [ref]41 are suboptimal for model training due to the labeling noise and limited diversity. As a simple yet effective solution, we propose Random Alpha Blending (RAB) to generate synthetic training data from random alpha mattes and images. We show that such simple method can improve the foreground color prediction accuracy without requiring additional manual annotations. As a result, combining with the proposed PRN, MG Matting is able to generate more visual plausible composition results. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose Mask Guided Matting, a general matting framework working with guidance masks in various qualities and even forms, and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We introduce Progressive Refinement Network (PRN) along with a guidance perturbation training pipeline as a solution to learning a robust matting model. We study the problem of foreground color prediction for matting and propose a simple improvement using random alpha blending. In addition, we collect and release a high-quality matting benchmark dataset of real images to evaluate the real-world performance of matting models.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Image matting is a fundamental computer vision problem which aims to predict an alpha matte to precisely cut out an image region.
