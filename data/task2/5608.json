      "content": "Paper Title: Transformed Low-Rank Parameterization Can Help Robust Generalization for Tensor Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough Theorem 6 shows exactly transformed low-rank parameterization leads to lower bounds, the well trained t-NNs on real data rarely have exactly transformed low-rank weights. In this section, we prove that the highly over-parameterized t-NNs, trained by adversarial training with gradient flow (GF), are approximately of transformed low-rank parameterization under certain conditions. First, the proposed t-NN f​(x¯;W¯)𝑓¯x¯Wf(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}) is said to be (positively) homogeneous as the condition\nf​(x¯;a​W¯)=aL+1​f​(x¯;W¯)𝑓¯x𝑎¯Wsuperscript𝑎𝐿1𝑓¯x¯Wf(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};a{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})=a^{L+1}f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})\nholds for any positive constant a𝑎a.\nMotivated by Ref. [ref]29, we focus on the scale invariant adversarial perturbations defined as follows. An adversarial perturbation δ¯i​(W¯)subscript¯𝛿𝑖¯W\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}) is said to be scale invariant for f​(x¯;W¯)𝑓¯x¯Wf(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}) at any given example x¯isubscript¯x𝑖\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i} if it satisfies\nδ¯i​(a​W¯)=δ¯i​(W¯)subscript¯𝛿𝑖𝑎¯Wsubscript¯𝛿𝑖¯W\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i}(a{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})=\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}) for any positive constant a𝑎a. The l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-FGM , FGSM , l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-PGD and l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty}-PGD  perturbations for the t-NNs are all scale invariant. Then, we consider adversarial training of t-NNs with scale invariant adversarial perturbations by GF,\nwhich can be seen as gradient descent with infinitesimal step size.\nWhen using GF for the ReLU t-NNs, W¯¯W{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}} changes continuously with time, and the trajectory of parameter W¯¯W{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}} during training is an arc W¯:[0,∞)→ℝ​(W¯),t↦W¯​(t):¯Wformulae-sequence→0superscriptℝ¯Wmaps-to𝑡¯W𝑡{{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}:[0,\\infty)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{{\\leavevmode\\lstinline{{\\lst@@@set@language\\lst@@@set@numbers\\lst@@@set@frame\\lst@@@set@rulecolor\\lst@@@set@language\\footnotesize\\small{\\@listingGroup{}{}}}}}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})}},t\\mapsto{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}(t) that satisfies the differential inclusion [ref]7 [ref]30 for t≥0𝑡0t\\geq 0 a.e.,\nwhere ∂∘ℒ^advsuperscriptsuperscript^ℒadv\\partial^{\\circ}\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\textnormal{adv}} denotes the Clarke’s subdifferential [ref]7 with respect to W¯​(t)¯W𝑡{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}(t).\nIf ℒ^adv​(W¯)superscript^ℒadv¯W\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\textnormal{adv}}({{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}}) is actually a C1superscript𝐶1C^{1}-smooth function, the\nabove differential inclusion reduces to for any t≥0𝑡0t\\geq 0, which corresponds to the\nGF with differential in the usual sense.\nHowever, for simplicity, we follow Refs.   and still use Eq. (13) to denote Eq. (12) with a slight abuse of notation, even if ℒ^advsuperscript^ℒadv\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\textnormal{adv}} does not satisfy differentiability but only local Lipschitzness 555Note that the ReLU function is not differentiable at 00.\nPractical implementations of gradient methods define the derivative σ′​(0)superscript𝜎′0\\sigma^{\\prime}(0) to be a constant\nin   . In this work we assume for convenience that σ′​(0)=0superscript𝜎′00\\sigma^{\\prime}(0)=0.. We also make an assumption on the training data as follows. There exists a time t0subscript𝑡0t_{0} such that ℒ^adv​(t0)≤N−1​ℓ​(b𝔣)superscript^ℒadvsubscript𝑡0superscript𝑁1ℓsubscript𝑏𝔣\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\textnormal{adv}}(t_{0})\\leq N^{-1}\\ell(b_{{\\mathfrak{f}}}). This assumption is a generalization of the separability condition in Refs. [ref]30 [ref]29.\nAdversarial training can typically achieve this\nseparability in practice, i.e., the model can fit adversarial examples of the training dataset,\nmaking the above assumption reasonable. Then, we obtain the following lemma. Consider the hypothesis class 𝔉𝔉\\mathfrak{F} in Eq. (6).\nUnder Assumptions 2 and 8, the limit point of normalized weights {W¯​(t)/‖W¯​(t)‖F:t≥0}:¯W𝑡subscriptnorm¯W𝑡F𝑡0\\{{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}(t)/\\left\\|{{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}(t)}\\right\\|_{\\textnormal{F}}:t\\geq 0\\} of the GF for Eq. (13), i.e., the empirical adversarial risk with scale invariant adversarial perturbations δ¯i​(W¯)subscript¯𝛿𝑖¯W\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}), is aligned with the direction of a KKT point of the minimization problem: Building upon Lemma 9, we can establish that highly over-parameterized t-NNs undergoing adversarial training with GF will exhibit an implicit bias towards transformed low-rank weights. Suppose there is an example x¯isubscript¯x𝑖\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i} satisfying ‖x¯i‖F≤1subscriptnormsubscript¯x𝑖F1\\left\\|{\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i}}\\right\\|_{\\textnormal{F}}\\leq 1 in the training set\nS={(x¯i,yi)}i=1N𝑆superscriptsubscriptsubscript¯x𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑁S=\\{(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}.\nSuppose there is a (J+1)𝐽1(J+1)-layer (J≥2𝐽2J\\geq 2) ReLU t-NN, denoted by g​(x¯;V¯)𝑔¯x¯Vg(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}) with parameters V¯=(V¯(1),⋯,V¯(J),v)¯Vsuperscript¯V1⋯superscript¯V𝐽v{\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}=({\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}^{(1)},\\cdots,{\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}^{(J)},\\textnormal{{v}}), satisfying the conditions: the dimensionality of the weight tensor V¯(j)∈ℝmj×mj−1×𝖼superscript¯V𝑗superscriptℝsubscript𝑚𝑗subscript𝑚𝑗1𝖼{\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}^{(j)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m_{j}\\times m_{j-1}\\times{\\sf c}} of the j𝑗j-th t-product layer satisfies mj≥2subscript𝑚𝑗2m_{j}\\geq 2, j=1,⋯,J𝑗1⋯𝐽j=1,\\cdots,J; there is a constant Bv>0subscript𝐵𝑣0B_{v}>0, such that the Euclidean norm of the weights V¯=(V¯(1),⋯,V¯(L),v)¯Vsuperscript¯V1⋯superscript¯V𝐿v{\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}=({\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}^{(1)},\\cdots,{\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}^{(L)},\\textnormal{{v}}) satisfy ‖V¯(j)‖F≤Bvsubscriptnormsuperscript¯V𝑗Fsubscript𝐵𝑣\\|{\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}}^{(j)}\\|_{\\textnormal{F}}\\leq B_{v} for any j=1,⋯,J𝑗1⋯𝐽j=1,\\cdots,J and ‖v‖2≤Bvsubscriptnormv2subscript𝐵𝑣\\left\\|{\\textnormal{{v}}}\\right\\|_{2}\\leq B_{v}; for all i∈{1,⋯,N}𝑖1⋯𝑁i\\in\\{1,\\cdots,N\\}, we have yi​g​(x¯i+δ¯i​(V¯);V¯)≥1subscript𝑦𝑖𝑔subscript¯x𝑖subscript¯𝛿𝑖¯V¯V1y_{i}g(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}}_{i}+\\underline{\\mathbf{\\delta}}_{i}({\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}});{\\underline{\\textnormal{{V}}}})\\geq 1. Then, we consider the class of over-parameterized t-NNs 𝔉={f​(x¯;W¯)}𝔉𝑓¯x¯W\\mathfrak{F}=\\{f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}})\\} defined in Eq. (5) satisfying the number L𝐿L of t-product layers is much greater than J𝐽J; the dimensionality of weight W¯(l)∈ℝdl×dl−1×𝖼superscript¯W𝑙superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑙subscript𝑑𝑙1𝖼{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{l}\\times d_{l-1}\\times{\\sf c}} satisfies dl≫maxj≤J⁡{mj}much-greater-thansubscript𝑑𝑙subscript𝑗𝐽subscript𝑚𝑗d_{l}\\gg\\max_{j\\leq J}\\{m_{j}\\} for any l≤L𝑙𝐿l\\leq L. Let W¯∗=(W¯∗(1),⋯,W¯∗(L),w∗)superscript¯Wsuperscript¯Wabsent1⋯superscript¯Wabsent𝐿superscriptw{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{*}=({\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{*(1)},\\cdots,{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{*(L)},\\textnormal{{w}}^{*}) be a global optimum of Problem (14). Namely, W¯∗superscript¯W{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{*} parameterizes a minimum-norm t-NN f​(x¯;W¯∗)∈𝔉𝑓¯xsuperscript¯W𝔉f(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{*})\\in\\mathfrak{F} that labels the perturbed training set correctly with margin 1 under scale invariant adversarial perturbations. Then, we have where W~M∗(l)superscriptsubscript~W𝑀absent𝑙\\widetilde{\\textnormal{{W}}}_{M}^{*(l)} denotes the M𝑀M-block-diagonal matrix of weight tensor W¯∗(l)superscript¯Wabsent𝑙{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{*(l)} for any l=1,⋯,L𝑙1⋯𝐿l=1,\\cdots,L. By the above theorem, when L𝐿L is sufficiently large, the harmonic mean of the square root of the stable rank of W~M∗(l)superscriptsubscript~W𝑀absent𝑙\\widetilde{\\textnormal{{W}}}_{M}^{*(l)}, i.e., the M𝑀M-block-diagonal matrix of weight tensor W¯∗(l)superscript¯Wabsent𝑙{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{*(l)},\nis approximately bounded by 𝖼​mJ𝖼subscript𝑚𝐽\\sqrt{{\\sf c}m_{J}}, which is significantly smaller than the square root of the dimensionality min⁡{𝖼​dl,𝖼​dl−1}𝖼subscript𝑑𝑙𝖼subscript𝑑𝑙1\\sqrt{\\min\\{{\\sf c}d_{l},{\\sf c}d_{l-1}\\}} according to condition (C.5) in Theorem 10. Thus, f​(x¯;W¯∗)𝑓¯xsuperscript¯Wf(\\underline{\\textnormal{{x}}};{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}^{*}) has a nearly low-rank parameterization in the transformed domain.\nIn our case, the weights W¯​(t)¯W𝑡{\\underline{\\textnormal{{W}}}}(t) generated by GF tend to have an infinite norm and to converge in direction to a transformed low-rank solution. Moreover, note that the ratio between the spectral norm and the F-norm is invariant to scaling, and hence it suggests that after a sufficiently long time, GF tends to reach a t-NN with transformed low-rank weight tensors.
