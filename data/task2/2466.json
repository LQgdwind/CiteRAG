      "content": "Paper Title: CFLOW-AD: Real-Time Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Localization via Conditional Normalizing Flows\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe review models222For comprehensive review of the existing AD methods we refer readers to Ruff et al.  and Pang et al.  surveys. that employ the data setup from Figure 1 and provide experimental results for popular MVTec dataset [ref]4 with factory defects or Shanghai Tech Campus (STC) dataset  with surveillance camera videos. We highlight the research related to a more challenging task of pixel-level anomaly localization (segmentation) rather than a more simple image-level anomaly detection. Napoletano et al. 5 propose to use CNN feature extractors followed by a principal component analysis and k𝑘k-mean clustering for AD. Their feature extractor is a ResNet-18  pretrained on a large-scale ImageNet dataset . Similarly, SPADE  employs a Wide-ResNet-50  with multi-scale pyramid pooling that is followed by a k𝑘k-nearest-neighbor clustering. Unfortunately, clustering is slow at test-time with high-dimensional data. Thus, parallel convolutional methods are preferred in real-time systems. Numerous methods are based on a natural idea of generative modeling. Unlike models with the discriminatively-pretrained feature extractors 5 , generative models learn distribution of anomaly-free data and, therefore, are able to estimate a proxy metrics for anomaly scores even for the unseen images with anomalies. Recent models employ generative adversarial networks (GANs)   and variational autoencoders (VAEs)  8. A fully-generative models    8 are directly applied to images in order to estimate pixel-level probability density and compute per-pixel reconstruction errors as anomaly scores proxies. These fully-generative models are unable to estimate the exact data likelihoods   and do not perform better than the traditional methods 5  according to MVTec survey in [ref]4. Recent works 4  show that these models tend to capture only low-level correlations instead of relevant semantic information. To overcome the latter drawback, a hybrid DFR model 7 uses a pretrained feature extractor with multi-scale pyramid pooling followed by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). However, DFR model is unable to estimate the exact likelihoods. Another line of research proposes to employ a student-teacher type of framework  3 . Teacher is a pretrained feature extractor and student is trained to estimate a scoring function for AD. Unfortunately, such frameworks underperform compared to state-of-the-art models. Patch SVDD [ref]42 and CutPaste  introduce a self-supervised pretraining scheme for AD. Moreover, Patch SVDD proposes a novel method to combine multi-scale scoring masks to a final anomaly map. Unlike the nearest-neighbor search in [ref]42, CutPaste estimates anomaly scores using an efficient Gaussian density estimator. While the self-supervised pretraining can be helpful in uncommon data domains, Schirrmeister et al. 4 argue that large natural-image datasets such as ImageNet can be a more representative for pretraining compared to a small application-specific datasets e.g. industrial MVTec [ref]4. The state-of-the-art PaDiM  proposes surprisingly simple yet effective approach for anomaly localization. Similarly to 7  [ref]42, this approach relies on ImageNet-pretrained feature extractor with multi-scale pyramid pooling. However, instead of slow test-time clustering in  or nearest-neighbor search in [ref]42, PaDiM uses a well-known Mahalanobis distance metric  as an anomaly score. The metric parameters are estimated for each feature vector from the pooled feature maps. PaDiM has been inspired by Rippel et al.  who firstly advocated to use this measure for anomaly detection without localization. DifferNet 0 uses a promising class of generative models called normalizing flows (NFLOWs)  for image-level AD. The main advantage of NFLOW models is ability to estimate the exact likelihoods for OOD compared to other generative models    8 7. In this paper, we extend DifferNet approach to pixel-level anomaly localization task using our CFLOW-AD model. In contrast to RealNVP  architecture with global average pooling in 0, we propose to use conditional normalizing flows  to make CFLOW-AD suitable for low-complexity processing of multi-scale feature maps for localization task. We develop our CFLOW-AD with the following contributions: Our theoretical analysis shows why multivariate Gaussian assumption is a justified prior in previous models and why a more general NFLOW framework objective converges to similar results with the less compute. We propose to use conditional normalizing flows for unsupervised anomaly detection with localization using computational and memory-efficient architecture. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the art in both detection and localization due to the unique properties of the proposed CFLOW-AD model.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: review of the existing AD methods we refer readers to Ruff et al.  and Pang et al.  surveys. that employ the data setup from Figure 1 and provide experimental results for popular MVTec dataset [ref]4 with factory defects or Shanghai Tech Campus (STC) dataset  with surveillance camera videos.
