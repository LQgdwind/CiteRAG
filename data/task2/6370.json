      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Learning of Multivariate Time Series with Temporal Irregularity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiscussions in 1.1 and 1.2 unveil dislocations and disparities among ideas of handling temporal irregularities in the data and ideas to model its joint distribution.\nThis paper bridges this gap by introducing a deep learning solution called the Recurrent Flow Network (RFN). It can seamlessly integrate the treatment of temporal irregularities with the learning of joint data distribution. Its novelties are as follows. (i) The proposed RFN framework formulates a two-layer representation that distinguishes marginal learning of component dynamics from multivariate learning of joint data distribution. It is a versatile methodology that can be trained end-to-end and accommodate synchronous and asynchronous data structures. It also broadly applies to underlying recurrent architectures, including RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs. Once the joint data distribution is learned, it is ready for sampling despite the distribution being non-parametrically represented via neural networks. (ii) The marginal learning block addresses the component-level heterogeneity in the presence of unevenly spaced intervals. It achieves this by assigning unique sets of hidden states to individual variables, overcoming the drawback of disregarding statistical heterogeneities when hidden states are shared (e.g., in models like GRU-D [ref]12, ODERNN [ref]17, GRU-ODE-Bayes , and ODELSTM [ref]18), and by allowing the arrival times of component observations to determine how hidden states are updated, effectively avoiding data imputation. (iii) The multivariate learning block then resolves the struggle faced by existing distribution models    in achieving a non-parametric representation of non-Gaussian data distribution, simultaneously with a flexible choice of information to generate time variation. The conditional CNF (Continuous Normalizing Flow) representation we develop enables one to choose what information to use to drive the time variation of the base distribution and the flow map without compromising any non-parametric capacity to represent the non-Gaussian data distribution. (iv) Building upon (ii) and (iii), we strategically condition the log-likelihood objective on the observation times and along the component direction. This conditioning structure enables the optimizer o fully acknowledge and account for both the uneven spacing aspect and the asynchrony aspect of temporal irregularity in the MTS data. By conditioning on the observation times, the RFN ensures that the model incorporates the specific time points at which the data is observed. Additionally, conditioning along the component direction acknowledges the asynchrony between different variables, which arises exclusively in the multivariate context. We validate the novelties mentioned above through three ablation studies using simulations and demonstrate the overall performance of the RFNs on three real-world datasets. The ablation studies simulate sample paths of a multivariate correlated Geometric Brownian Motion process to investigate the effects of sharing hidden states, imputing unobserved variables, and making different choices of conditional information. Meanwhile, the experimental datasets include the physical activities of the human body from the MuJoCo module [ref]17, the climate records of weather from the USHCN dataset , and a three-year-long transaction record from HKEX comprising minute-level transactions for the stock with the largest market capitalization and its options. We compare four baseline models between their performance in vanilla forms and the performances utilizing the RFN specification. The vanilla versions of these four baselines are GRU-D, ODERNN, GRU-ODE-Bayes, and ODELSTM. They are all designed to target multivariate irregularly sampled time series. The results show that the RFN framework has broad applicability and outperforms existing approaches significantly. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background knowledge that the RFNs build upon. Section 3 presents the data structure and necessary notations. Section 4 introduces model specifications for the marginal learning block. Sections 5 and 6 present methodologies of the multivariate learning block for the synchronous case and the asynchronous case. Section 7 discusses the ablation studies and the experiments. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper. Additional formulations, proofs, extended numerics, and algorithms are provided in the Appendix A, B, C, and D respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: this by assigning unique sets of hidden states to individual variables, overcoming the drawback of disregarding statistical heterogeneities when hidden states are shared (e.g., in models like GRU-D [ref]12, ODERNN [ref]17, GRU-ODE-Bayes , and ODELSTM [ref]18), and by allowing the arrival times of component observations to determine how hidden states are updated, effectively avoiding data\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
