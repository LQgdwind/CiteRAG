      "content": "Paper Title: Align before Fuse: Vision and Language Representation Learning with Momentum Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) aims to learn multimodal representations from large-scale image-text pairs that can improve downstream Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks.\nMost existing VLP methods (e.g. LXMERT [ref]1, UNITER [ref]2, OSCAR ) rely on pre-trained object detectors to extract region-based image features,\nand employ a multimodal encoder to fuse the image features with word tokens.\nThe multimodal encoder is trained to solve tasks that require joint understanding of image and text, such as masked language modeling (MLM) and image-text matching (ITM). While effective, this VLP framework suffers from several key limitations: (1) The image features and the word token embeddings reside in their own spaces, which makes it challenging for the multimodal encoder to learn to model their interactions; (2) The object detector is both annotation-expensive and compute-expensive, because it requires bounding box annotations during pre-training, and high-resolution (e.g. 600×\\times1000) images during inference; (3) The widely used image-text datasets  [ref]5 are collected from the web and are inherently noisy,\nand existing pre-training objectives such as MLM may overfit to the noisy text and degrade the model’s generalization performance. We propose ALign BEfore Fuse (ALBEF), a new VLP framework to address these limitations.\nWe first encode the image and text independently with a detector-free image encoder and a text encoder.\nThen we use a multimodal encoder to fuse the image features with the text features through cross-modal attention.\nWe introduce an intermediate image-text contrastive (ITC) loss on representations from the unimodal encoders,\nwhich serves three purposes:\n(1) it aligns the image features and the text features, making it easier for the multimodal encoder to perform cross-modal learning;\n(2) it improves the unimodal encoders to better understand the semantic meaning of images and texts;\n(3) it learns a common low-dimensional space to embed images and texts, which enables the image-text matching objective to find more informative samples through our contrastive hard negative mining. To improve learning under noisy supervision,\nwe propose Momentum Distillation (MoD), a simple method which enables the model to leverage a larger uncurated web dataset.\nDuring training,\nwe keep a momentum version of the model by taking the moving-average of its parameters, and use the momentum model to generate pseudo-targets as additional supervision.\nWith MoD, the model is not penalized for producing other reasonable outputs that are different from the web annotation.\nWe show that MoD not only improves pre-training,\nbut also downstream tasks with clean annotations.\n We provide theoretical justifications on ALBEF from the perspective of mutual information maximization.\nSpecifically,\nwe show that ITC and MLM maximize a lower bound on the mutual information between different views of an image-text pair,\nwhere the views are generated by taking partial information from each pair.\nFrom this perspective,\nour momentum distillation can be interpreted as generating new views with semantically similar samples.\nTherefore,\nALBEF learns vision-language representations that are invariant to semantic-preserving transformations.\n We demonstrate the effectiveness of ALBEF on various downstream V+L tasks including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, visual reasoning, visual entailment, and weakly-supervised visual grounding.\nALBEF achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.\nOn image-text retrieval, it outperforms methods that are pre-trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets (CLIP  and ALIGN ).\nOn VQA and NLVR2, it achieves absolute improvements of 2.37%percent2.372.37\\% and 3.84%percent3.843.84\\% compared to the state-of-the-art method VILLA , while enjoying much faster inference speed.\nWe also provide quantitative and qualitative analysis on ALBEF using Grad-CAM , which reveals its ability to perform accurate object, attribute and relationship grounding implicitly.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Pre-training (VLP) aims to learn multimodal representations from large-scale image-text pairs that can improve downstream Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks.\nMost existing VLP methods (e.g. LXMERT [ref]1, UNITER [ref]2, OSCAR ) rely on pre-trained object detectors to extract region-based image features,\nand employ a multimodal encoder to fuse the image features with word tokens.\nThe multimodal\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
