      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Polychromatic Neural Representation for CT Metal Artifact Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We conduct experiments on three datasets, including two simulation datasets and two real collected datasets. The first dataset is DeepLesion , the most commonly used dataset for the CT MAR evaluation. For this dataset, we extract 200 2D slices of 256√ó\\times256 size from the original 3D CT volumes as ground truth (GT). Then, we follow the pipeline described in 0 [ref]7  to synthesize metal-corrupted sinograms as input data. The second dataset is the XCOM dataset , for which we employ two cases provided by Zhang et al. [ref]7. The third is a real-world dataset. As shown in Fig. 3 (Left), we insert a metal paper clip into a walnut sample and scan it with a commercial Bruker SKYSCAN 1276 micro-CT scanner. The fourth is also a real-world dataset. We use the same micro-CT scanner to scan a mouse tight containing a metal intramedullary needle. Note that all data solely are utilized for testing purposes since our method is fully unsupervised. Baselines & Metrics. We employ nine representative CT MAR approaches from three categories as baselines: (1) four model-based algorithms (FBP , LI , NMAR , and ART ); (2) three supervised CNN-based DL methods (CNN-MAR [ref]7, DICDNet , and ACDNet ); and (3) two unsupervised DL method (ADN 0 and Score-MAR ). To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluate the five DL models using the checkpoints provided by the authors. Among them, CNN-MAR [ref]7 and Score-MAR  are respectively trained on the XCOM  and LIDC [ref]46 datasets, while the other three methods are trained on the DeepLesion dataset . We use peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) to quantitatively evaluate the MAR performance. Implementation Details. For our Polyner, we leverage hash encoding  in combination with two fully connected (FC) layers of width 128 to implement the MLP network. A ReLU activation function is then applied after the first FC layer. For the hash encoding , we configure its hyper-parameters as follow: L=16ùêø16L=16, T=219ùëásuperscript219T=2^{19}, F=8ùêπ8F=8, Nmin=2subscriptùëÅmin2N_{\\text{min}}=2, and b=2ùëè2b=2. To optimize the network, we randomly sample 80 X-rays, i.e., |‚Ñõ|=80‚Ñõ80|\\mathcal{R}|=80 in Eqs. (7) & (8), at each training iteration. We set the hyper-parameter ŒªùúÜ\\lambda to 0.2 in Eq. (8). We employ the Adam optimizer  with default hyper-parameters and set the initial learning rate to 1e-3, which decays by a factor of 0.5 per 1000 epochs. The total number of training epochs is 4000. It is worth noting that all hyper-parameters are tuned on 10 samples from the DeepLesion dataset , and are then held constant across all other samples.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: dataset for the CT MAR evaluation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
