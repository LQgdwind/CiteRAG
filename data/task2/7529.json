Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple benchmarks with various kinds of video contents, including Bunny [ref]15 (720√ó\\times1280 with 132 frames), UVG [ref]25 (7 videos at 1080√ó\\times1920 with length of 600 or 300), and DAVIS validation  (20 videos at 1080√ó\\times1920). Evaluation Metrics. Two popular image quality assessment metrics, namely, PSNR and MS-SSIM, are used to evaluate the distortion between the reconstructed and original frames. We use bits per pixel (bpp) to measure the bitrate of video compression. Implementation Details.\nWe select three typical INR methods (i.e., NeRV , E-NeRV , and HNeRV [ref]7) as our baselines. Then we enhance them with our proposed framework. To fit 720p and 1080p videos, we set the stride list as (5,2,2,2,2) and (5,3,2,2,2), respectively. We use b=1.25ùëè1.25b=1.25 and l=80ùëô80l=80 as our default setting in the position encoding. For the distortion loss in Equation¬†4, ŒªùúÜ\\lambda and Œ±ùõº\\alpha are set as 60 and 0.7, receptively. During overfitting, we set the batch size as 1 and adopt Adan  as the optimizer with cosine learning rate decay [ref]7, in which the number of warm-up epochs is 10% of total fitting epochs. The learning rates for the boosted E-NeRV and NeRV/HNeRV are 1.5‚Äãe‚àí31.5superscriptùëí31.5e^{-3} and 3‚Äãe‚àí33superscriptùëí33e^{-3}, respectively. Baseline models are implemented using open-source codes, and experiments are conducted on one NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU using PyTorch, with 3M model size and 300 epochs unless otherwise denoted.
