      "content": "Paper Title: Role of Apache Software Foundation in Big Data Projects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are variety of tools developed around Big Data projects to facilitate in processing and management of large amounts of data. The Apache Ambari initially started as sub-project of Hadoop to provide system administrators facilities of provision, monitoring and management of Hadoop clusters. Apache Ambari  is now a top-level project managed by its own community to facilitate integration of Hadoop with prevailing enterprise infrastructure. The Apache Flume  and Apache Sqoop  are two reliable, distributed and available systems to efficiently collect, move, and aggregate and huge chunks of log data from number of various sources to a centralized data store. The Apache Fluo YARN  is a sub-project of Apache Fluo in the form of a tool to run Apache Fluo applications in Apache Hadoop YARN. The Apache Kibble  is a tools suite similar to Apache Flume to collect, visualise, and aggregate software projects activities, Apache Zeppelin  is a web-based tool for data scientists with similar features. To have Hadoop clusters a REST interactions Apache Knox  provide a REST API Gateway that provides important features helping to control, monitor, integrate and automate enterprise’s critical analytical and administrative requirements. Apache Lens  integrates traditional data warehouses and Hadoop to provide a single data view across optimal execution environment and multi-tiered data stores. To schedule Apache Hadoop jobs like Java Map-reduce, Hive, and Pig along with system specific jobs like shell scripts and Java programs, Apache Oozie  is integrated with Hadoop stack. Apache PredictionIO [ref]37 and Apache VXQuery  are two very useful tools with one providing machine learning services and other being XML Query processor, respectively. PredictionIO let developers to deploy and manage production-ready predictive services for machine learning jobs. VXQuery uses cluster to evaluate queries on huge sets of comparatively small XML documents.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Apache Hadoop jobs like Java Map-reduce, Hive, and Pig along with system specific jobs like shell scripts and Java programs, Apache Oozie  is integrated with Hadoop stack.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
