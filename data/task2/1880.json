Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: BERT2Code: Can Pretrained Language Models be Leveraged for Code Search?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur results indicate that better code embeddings are needed to be readily usable in semantic code search. Recently, Kang et al. [ref]24 has also found that the Code2Vec [ref]2 embeddings fail to generalize in the tasks of code comments generation, code authorship identification, and code clones detection. Briem et al.  used distributed representations by Code2Vec [ref]2 in the task of bug detection.\nArumugam  trained a Code2Vec bag-of-paths embedding model for the CodeSearchNet Challenge [ref]21. Gu et al.  introduced CODEnn, which jointly embeds descriptions and source codes into a single high-dimensional vector space.\nSachdev et al.  proposed Neural Code Search (NCS), a method to extract a sequence of natural language tokens from a code snippet that forms a code document.\nEmbedding Unification (UNIF)  is a supervised extension of the NCS. The idea of both these methods is to extract natural language components from the method and identifier names, and use them to match with the natural language query. The CodeSearchNet Challenge [ref]21 initiated an open challenge for code search, and publicly released a dataset collected from GitHub. Additionally, they released several baseline code search methods. Feng et al.  proposed CodeBERT, a BERT  model trained with both natural language and source code from the CodeSearchNet dataset [ref]21, and has shown to significantly outperform the baseline models of the challenge.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Our results indicate that better code embeddings are needed to be readily usable in semantic code search.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
