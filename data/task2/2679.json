      "content": "Paper Title: Formalizing and Estimating Distribution Inference Risks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInference attacks aim to infer sensitive information about inputs to a process from its revealed outputs. In machine learning, such attacks usually focus on learning sensitive information about training data from a released model. For example, in a membership inference attack , the adversary aims to infer whether a particular record was part of the training data.\nIn a distribution inference attack, an adversary aims to infer some statistical property of the training dataset, such as the proportion of women in a dataset used to train a smile-detection model . In the research literature, such attacks have previously been called property inference and attribute inference (confusingly, since this is also used to refer to a type of dataset inference where the adversary infers an unknown sensitive feature of records in the training dataset [ref]3), and various other terms. The privacy threat posed by membership inference attacks is well recognized—if an adversary can infer the presence of a particular user record in a training dataset of diabetes patients, it would violate privacy laws limiting medical disclosure. Distribution inference attacks pose a less obvious threat but can also be dangerous. As one example, consider a financial organization that trains a loan scoring model on some of its historical data. An adversary may use a distribution inference attack to infer the proportion of the training data having a specific value for some protected attribute (e.g., race), which might be a sensitive property of the training dataset. Distribution inference attacks can also pose a threat to distributed training: curious users wanting to learn sensitive information about training distributions of fellow participants, which are competitors in settings like cross-silo federated learning [ref]4, thus leaking sensitive information. Other examples include inferring the sentiment of emails in a company from a spam classifier, or inferring the volume of transactions from fraud detection systems [ref]5. We also demonstrate examples where adversaries learn properties of graphs used in training, such as accurately estimating their average clustering coefficient.\nInferring statistical properties of a training distribution can also be used to enhance membership inference attacks or to reveal that a model was trained on a biased dataset . Previous works have used several different informal notions of property inference attacks (e.g.,   ), but there is no established general formal definition of distribution inference. In this work, we formalize distribution inference attacks based on a critical insight: the key difference between these attacks and other inference attacks is that the adversary’s goal in the former is to learn about the training distribution, not about the specific training dataset. Dataset inference attacks, such as membership inference , attribute inference [ref]3, and ownership-resolution 0 operate on the level of training records. Attacks like membership inference are directly connected to differential privacy which bounds the ability to distinguish neighboring datasets. By contrast, distribution inference attacks attempt to learn statistical properties of the underlying distribution from which the training dataset is sampled. Having a formal definition and a clear threat model can be useful in several ways—quantifying information leakage, assessing and comparing the practicality of different threat models, and drawing possible links between distribution inference risk and other distribution-level properties such as robustness and fairness. Contributions.\nWe provide a general and straightforward formalization of distribution inference attacks as a cryptographic game (Section 3), inspired by Yeom et al.’s membership inference definition 1. Our definition is generic enough to capture a variety of statistical properties of the underlying distribution including, but not limited to, the attribute ratios that have been the focus of previous property inference attacks.\nUsing our definition, we define an intuitive metric for measuring the amount of leakage observed in a simulated attack, along with theorems that compute this metric for the case of ratios of binary functions, regressions that estimate the proportion of training data having a given attribute, and degree distributions (for graphs) as properties (Section 4). We report on experiments evaluating distribution inference as a risk across several datasets and properties, providing the first systematic evaluation of how inference risks vary as the distributions diverge. Studying patterns in distribution inference risk and how they correlate with underlying properties helps compare trends across experiments and properties, helping identify datasets and models that are highly sensitive to such inference attacks.\nTo conduct our experiments we introduce two simple black-box distribution inference attacks, and extend the white-box permutation-invariant network 2 architecture, the current state-of-the-art property inference method, to add support for convolutional layers (Section 5). This enables us to conduct distribution inference attacks on deep neural networks, even when target models are trained from scratch.\nSection 6 reports results from our experiments with these attacks on a variety of datasets, tasks, and inference goals, revealing that simple black-box attacks often perform surprisingly well, and in some settings white-box meta-classifier attacks can reveal information comparable to sampling dozens of records from the training distribution.\nWe analyze the information gleaned up by meta-classifiers across layers, finding that most information can be find in just one or a few layers, enabling less expensive meta-classifier attacks (Appendix A.6).\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: and attribute inference (confusingly, since this is also used to refer to a type of dataset inference where the adversary infers an unknown sensitive feature of records in the training dataset [ref]3), and various other terms.
