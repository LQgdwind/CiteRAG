      "content": "Paper Title: Image-Text Out-Of-Context Detection Using Synthetic Multimodal Misinformation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGathering large-scale labeled multimodal misinformation datasets is difficult due to their scarcity and the substantial manual effort required. Some examples of datasets that have been created for detecting multimodal misinformation include the MultimodAI Information Manipulation (MAIM) dataset [ref]13 and the Multimodal Entity Image Repurposing (MEIR) dataset [ref]14. The MAIM dataset includes over 239K image-caption pairs with randomly mismatched falsified media. The MEIR dataset introduces swaps over named entities for people, organizations, and locations. It is based on the assumption that, for each image caption (package), there is an unmanipulated related package (geographically near and semantically similar) in the reference set. This enables the integrity of a query package to be verified by retrieving a related package and comparing the two. Another such dataset is the TamperedNews dataset  in which named entities specific to people, locations, and events are randomly swapped with other named entities within the article body. These text manipulations can lead to strong linguistic biases. Zellers et al.  replaced image captions with synthetic ones that matched the images, which remained relevant to the article’s content. The usefulness of image analysis on this task is rather limited, whereas analyzing the captions and the article body results in the best detection performance. The recently developed COSMOS dataset  contains 200K images and 450K captions, where each image is associated with two captions from two sources. The randomly chosen text is used to generate mismatched image-caption pairs. Most of the data in COSMOS is not labeled, although a small subset has been manually annotated as in- or out-of-context. Another recently developed dataset is the Visual News dataset , which contains more than one million publicly available news images paired with both captions and news article text collected on a diverse set of topics from news sources in English (The Guardian, the BBC, USA TODAY, and the Washington Post). It was leveraged to create the Visual News Captioner, which generates captions by attending to individual word tokens, named entities in the input news article text, and localized visual features. It was used to create the NewsCLIPpings [ref]12 dataset, a large-scale dataset designed for automatic retrieval of image-text pairs . It contains 988K image-caption pairs for news media mismatch detection. Several strategies can be used to automatically retrieve suitable images for the given captions, including caption-image similarity, caption-caption similarity, person match, and scene match, to identify cases in which there are inconsistent entities or inconsistent semantic context. Finally, the Twitter-COMMs  dataset consists of multimodal tweets covering such topics as COVID-19, climate change, and military vehicles. It was created using the Twitter API v2 111https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/gettingstarted/about-twitter-api. Hard negatives are created by retrieving the image of the sample tweet with the most textual similarity with a given caption (using the “Semantics / CLIP Text-Text split” method of Luo et al. [ref]12), and random negatives are created by selecting an image for a given caption at random to resolve the class imbalance of data collected from Twitter. Several studies have focused on human-made fake news detection, resulting in the development of such datasets as FakeNewsNet  and Fakeddit . Another study focused on creating a videos and captions dataset, i.e., a video-based dataset , that contains 4,000 real-world Facebook news posts with captions randomly taken from other posts to generate mismatched samples. It was developed for detecting semantic inconsistency between videos and captions in social media posts.\nThe datasets relevant to the work reported here are summarized in Table I. The key differences, such as the image-text mismatch procedure used in each dataset, are highlighted.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: and the substantial manual effort required. Some examples of datasets that have been created for detecting multimodal misinformation include the MultimodAI Information Manipulation (MAIM) dataset [ref]13 and the Multimodal Entity Image Repurposing (MEIR) dataset [ref]14. The MAIM dataset includes over 239K image-caption pairs with randomly mismatched falsified media. The MEIR dataset\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
