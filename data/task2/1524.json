Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Open-Domain Conversational Search Assistant with Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Table 2, we show the BLEU-4 scores obtained in CANARD’s test set and in TREC CAsT’s 2019 manually rewritten queries. The rows “Human” and “Raw” are from [ref]10, the row “T5-BASE” is from [ref]17. The last row corresponds to our implementation. Our results are on par with [ref]17, being lower in the CANARD dataset but higher in TREC CAsT.\nWe believe the minor differences in performance between our T5-Base model and the T5-BASE from [ref]17 are due to the use of different input sequences, as the exact method of constructing the input is not specified in [ref]17. From the analysis of the BLEU-4 scores and outputs, we can conclude that the model is performing both coreference and context resolution, approximating the queries in a conversational format to context-independent queries.\nExamples of the inputs, targets, and predicted queries, are presented in Table 3.\nIn TREC CAsT, the historical utterances do not depend on the responses of the system, so the answer is not provided as input. As we can see, T5 is capable of resolving ambiguous queries by co-reference resolution, as in example 1, but sometimes mistakes similar co-references when multiple are involved, as evidenced in example 2 and in [ref]17, where the model predicts “throat cancer” instead of “lung cancer”. We can also note that this model is more robust than just coreference resolution, as seen in example 3, where it includes the words “Bronze Age Collapse”, even though there is no explicit mention (implicit coreference).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: In Table 2, we show the BLEU-4 scores obtained in CANARD’s test set and in TREC CAsT’s 2019 manually rewritten queries.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
