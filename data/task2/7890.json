      "content": "Paper Title: SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model for Audio-Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the development and establishment of the Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) datasets,, the AVQA field has become an important branch of multi-modal research in recent years[ref]3,[ref]4,. AVQA combines the features of Visual Question Answering (VQA),,, and Audio Question Answering (AQA)0,1, focusing on understanding and analyzing audio-visual signals to answer relevant questions. The AVQA task focus on utilizing audio and visual information, to understand complex audio-visual scenes more comprehensively and generate accurate answers to specific questions. This capability shows great potential in various applications, such as automated video content analysis, human-computer interaction, and so on. Especially in human-computer interaction, AVQA helps machines understand multi-modal commands and automatically recognize and respond to complex speech, facial expressions, and gestures, making interactions more natural and efficient. By further analyzing audio-visual content, AVQA systems provide detailed interpretations of scenes, characters, actions, and emotions, promoting intelligent media management and content creation with higher levels of automation and personalization. The goal of AVQA is to understand and answer complex questions about content that integrates audio and visual elements. Although significant research achievements have been made[ref]4,, many challenges still exist. 1) Representation Learning of Audio-Visual Data: Audio-visual data contain complex hierarchical structures that are closely integrated into continuous video and audio streams. This indicates that effective information extraction requires going beyond surface-level audio and visual features. When processing these multi-level pieces of information, previous AVQA models[ref]3,[ref]4, focus on data representation and processing in non-curved Euclidean spaces. However, Euclidean space faces challenges when dealing with datasets that have complex structures, such as hierarchical or tree-like data2,3,4. Embedding such data in Euclidean space can lead to significant distortions2. As shown in Fig. 1(a), where the distance dEsubscriptùëëùê∏d_{E} between nodes x1subscriptùë•1x_{1} and x2subscriptùë•2x_{2} in Euclidean space is 333, but their actual distance dGsubscriptùëëùê∫d_{G} in the graph‚Äôs structure is 2‚Äãln‚Å°3232\\ln{3}, the Euclidean distance fails to accurately reflect their true relationship. In this case, hyperbolic geometry demonstrates its advantages. As demonstrated in the Poincar√© ball model5 in Fig. 1(b), hyperbolic space more naturally accommodates such hierarchical data. In hyperbolic space, the way distances are calculated better preserves the inherent structure of the data, reducing distortion and more accurately representing the actual relationships between data points. 2) Computational Complexity: The AVQA task involves audio and visual comprehension in long videos, indicating a large amount of information and computational cost in processing this data. Current research primarily utilizes transformer-based models, which capture complex interactions and dependencies within sequences through their self-attention mechanisms. Although many works6,7,8 have demonstrated the superiority of transformer models in capturing fine-grained features, they still face potential weaknesses when dealing with long sequence data. The self-attention mechanism in transformers struggles to effectively focus on content beyond a fixed window size. Additionally, its computational complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. These factors result in inefficiency when dealing with long video sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model. SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent the hierarchical structures and complex relationships between audio-visual data, while the State Space Model (SSM) captures the dynamic changes in the temporal dimensions of the video. By combining the advantages of hyperbolic and SSM, SHMamba significantly improves the processing of complex audio-visual structures in long video sequences. Specifically, our model uses three linear layers to extract semantic information from audio, visual, and question inputs. Due to its exponentially growing volume, hyperbolic space helps distribute embeddings in a tree-like structure. We project the extracted audio-visual embeddings into hyperbolic space to capture the internal hierarchical structure of the data and learn more discriminative embeddings. To reduce the computational cost of long sequence data, we adopt the structured state space model proposed by mamba9, which effectively addresses the computational inefficiency of transformer models on long sequence data while remaining global video information (See Fig. 2). Finally, we utilize the cross fusion block to enhance the interaction of cross-modal features. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose SHMamba to enhance performance in the AVQA task. By integrating hyperbolic geometry with a structured SSM, our approach focuses on the complicated structure of audio-visual content while modelling global information. To our knowledge, this is the first work to combine hyperbolic geometry and SSM. We introduce the hyperbolic alignment module (HAM) with adaptive curvature and the cross fusion block (CFB). HAM utilizes adaptive curvature parameters to flexibly explore the inherent hierarchical structure of data for different data characteristics and organization. Simultaneously, CFB integrates multi-modal information by utilizing the dynamic information interaction. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous methods while reducing the number of learnable parameters. Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of the proposed model and its components. In Section II, we discuss the related work. We introduce the background in audio-visual question answering, hyperbolic geometry, and state-space models. Section III introduces our proposed SHMamba model and related algorithms. Section IV shows the model‚Äôs effectiveness with experimental results and visualizations. Finally, in Section V we summarise the research results, emphasising the main findings and contributions.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: With the development and establishment of the Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) datasets,, the AVQA field has become an important branch of multi-modal research in recent years[ref]3,[ref]4,.
