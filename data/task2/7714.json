      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing the Deployment of Tiny Transformers on Low-Power MCUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last few years, there has been a significant trend towards moving computing workload from centralized facilities towards the extreme edge of the Internet of Things (IoT), improving privacy, efficiency, and ensuring a predictable and constant latency, independent from the network coverage and congestion [ref]1. As a consequence, modern IoT endpoints have been changing from simple Micro-Controller Units (MCUs) equipped with the sensor infrastructure for data collection and transmission towards more complex heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) characterized by dedicated accelerators and enhanced Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) to optimize efficient on-board computations – while still meeting to tight power, performance, and cost constraints.\nFor this reason, extensive research has been conducted on how to squeeze complex Machine Learning (ML) models into such constrained devices with a strong emphasis on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) due to their success in solving many challenging tasks.\nStandard hardware-agnostic optimization techniques include topological changes , data quantization [ref]3 , and pruning . These efforts are often collectively labeled as TinyML and are applied to State of the Art (SotA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as ResNets  or MobileNets , that dominates most of the tasks of the IoT domain, including image recognition, object detection, or time-series analysis. At the same time, increasing efforts have been dedicated to finding a successor architecture to CNNs for IoT processing to increase tasks’ accuracy further.\nA strong candidate is the Transformer architecture , which first emerged as SotA model in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is now also SotA in other domains such as Computer Vision (CV) and Audio processing.\nThe Transformers architecture relies on the attention mechanism that, thanks to its generality and flexibility, has enabled significant advancements in language understanding, text generation, and translation tasks .\nTransformer models have been initially developed targeting ”at scale” deployment in the cloud. Industry and academia are now increasing efforts toward Transformer models tuned for edge deployment.\nRecent advancements have focused on the minimization of Transformer model size [ref]10 while still maintaining leading-edge accuracy when compared with CNN models of similar size, thus introducing a novel class of Tiny Transformers.\nThe success of these early reduced-scale Transformer models confirms that Tiny Transformers are relevant and applicable in Edge computing scenarios. However, the introduction of Transformers comes with novel computational primitives not commonly found in CNNs and has not been optimized so far. Precisely, the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) operation comes with many challenges, such as the high memory footprint of intermediate results and frequent data marshaling.\nDespite our early work demonstrating encoder-only Tiny Transformer deployment [ref]10, the approach was highly model and platform-specific and not easily generalizable to multiple models and platforms. Moreover, early work did not tackle the critical problem of optimized data tiling and computation scheduling, which is essential for most practical Tiny Transformers. To facilitate the deployment and the optimization of a wide range of encoder-only Transformer models for TinyML platforms on multiple MCU platforms, we significantly extend an existing deployment framework (DORY ) and quantization library (Quantlib).\nThus, we present a comprehensive end-to-end and open-source 111https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-transformer encoder-only Transformer deployment flow to SotA MCUs.\nFurther, we explore optimizations at various levels of the stack, from pure algorithmic techniques, to low-level code optimization, novel scheduling and tiling schemes. Together, these optimizations significantly enhance the performance of Transformers deployment on low-power MCUs. In detail, we present three main contributions: We designed a library of highly efficient kernels for both MHSA and Fused-Weight Self-Attention (FWSA). The library is tailored to minimize the overhead associated with data marshaling operations and maximize data reuse through carefully optimized data layout and loop reordering for each Attention layer. By reducing unnecessary data movements and optimizing memory access patterns, the proposed library significantly boosts the overall performance of Attention in an ISA-agnostic fashion, with comparable improvements for RISC-V and ARM with respect to SotA DNN libraries PULP-NN and CMSIS-NN. We introduce two novel optimizations: a fusion-based tiling scheme for MHSA operations and an offline weight fusion schedule for the MHSA operation. By combining fusion-based tiling and pipelining-related computations, the memory footprint and frequency of memory transfers during MHSA computation are substantially diminished, reducing the memory peak to 6.19 ×\\times. Furthermore, the weight fusion schedule reduces the latency by a factor of 1.53×\\times while reducing the number of parameters by 25 %. We extensively benchmark our library and optimizations using published transformers targeting three tasks, i.e., seizure detection from EEG signals, arrhythmia classification from ECG signals, and hand-gesture recognition from high-frequency short-range pulsed RADAR. Experimental evaluations on the above-mentioned MCUs demonstrate an energy consumption reduction compared to SoA libraries of up to 5.1 ×\\times on GAP9 and 2.9 ×\\times on ARM-based platforms when executing the attention-building block of the three transformers.\nWhen considering end-to-end execution of the networks on GAP9, we obtain the best latency of 9.42 mstimes9.42millisecond9.42\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{ms}, 2.85 mstimes2.85millisecond2.85\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{ms}, and 5.49 mstimes5.49millisecond5.49\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{ms} for the three different tasks at the maximum frequency of 370 MHz. In the most energy-efficient configuration, we achieved 310 µ​Jtimes310microjoule310\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro J}, 90 µ​Jtimes90microjoule90\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro J}, 207 µ​Jtimes207microjoule207\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro J} energy consumption, respectively, still respecting the real-time constraint of the applications. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sec. 2 provides the necessary background while Sec. 3 summarizes related works on MHSA optimization and TinyML platforms. In Sec. 4, we provide implementation details of the library, tiling scheme, and Weight-Fusion schedule. Finally, Sec. 5 presents experimental results, and Sec. 6 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: towards the extreme edge of the Internet of Things (IoT), improving privacy, efficiency, and ensuring a predictable and constant latency, independent from the network coverage and congestion [ref]1.
