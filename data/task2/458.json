      "content": "Paper Title: Asymmetric Leaky Private Information Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe study the PIR problem illustrated in Figure 1. We consider N𝑁N databases DB1, DB2,……\\ldots, DBN and K𝐾K independent messages W1,W2,…,WKsubscript𝑊1subscript𝑊2…subscript𝑊𝐾W_{1},W_{2},\\ldots,W_{K}, each of size L𝐿L bits, such that A user interested in privately retrieving Wksubscript𝑊𝑘W_{k}, k∈[1:K]k\\in[1:K]222Notation: Through this work, we use the notation [1:X]delimited-[]:1𝑋[1:X] to represent the set of integers from 111 to X𝑋X.\nsends N𝑁N separate queries Q1(k),⋯,QN(k)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑘1⋯subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑘𝑁Q^{(k)}_{1},\\cdots,Q^{(k)}_{N} to each of the N𝑁N DBs, where Qn(k)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑘𝑛Q^{(k)}_{n} denotes the query sent to the n𝑛nth database (DBn), n∈[1:N]n\\in[1:N], when retrieving message Wksubscript𝑊𝑘W_{k}.\nThe N𝑁N DBs are assumed to be replicated and non-colluding, i.e., they store all the K𝐾K messages and they do not share the queries received from the user.\nWe also assume the DBs are interested in achieving privacy, i.e., the user must only decode the requested message subject to a leakage constraint.\nTo achieve DB privacy, the N𝑁N DBs are allowed to share common randomness denoted by a random variable S𝑆S of size α​L𝛼𝐿\\alpha L bits, i.e., H​(S)=α​L𝐻𝑆𝛼𝐿H(S)=\\alpha L. Moreover, S𝑆S is not known to the user. Upon receiving Qn(k)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑘𝑛Q^{(k)}_{n}, the n𝑛nth database generates the corresponding answer An(k)subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑘𝑛A^{(k)}_{n} as a deterministic function of the query Qn(k)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑘𝑛Q^{(k)}_{n}, the K𝐾K messages, and the shared common randomness S𝑆S, i.e., The user must be able to decode the desired message Wksubscript𝑊𝑘W_{k} upon receiving the answers from the N𝑁N databases.\nFormally, the AL-PIR scheme must satisfy the following correctness, user privacy, and DB privacy constraints. Correctness: Given queries Q[1:N](k)≜{Q1(k),⋯,QN(k)}≜subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑘delimited-[]:1𝑁subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑘1⋯subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑘𝑁Q^{(k)}_{[1:N]}\\triangleq\\{Q^{(k)}_{1},\\cdots,Q^{(k)}_{N}\\}, the user must be able to decode the desired message Wksubscript𝑊𝑘W_{k}, with probability of error Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e}, by collecting the corresponding answers A[1:N](k)≜{A1(k),⋯,AN(k)}≜subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑘delimited-[]:1𝑁subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑘1⋯subscriptsuperscript𝐴𝑘𝑁A^{(k)}_{[1:N]}\\triangleq\\{A^{(k)}_{1},\\cdots,A^{(k)}_{N}\\} from the N𝑁N DBs, i.e., where o​(L)𝑜𝐿o(L) is any function that approaches zero as L→∞→𝐿L\\rightarrow\\infty. o​(L)𝑜𝐿o(L) is set to zero if Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} is required to be exactly zero. δ−limit-from𝛿\\delta-DB privacy:\nIn the original SPIR formulation [ref]9, the authors assume no leakage to the user about the undesired messages. For a desired message Wksubscript𝑊𝑘W_{k}, perfect DB privacy is satisfied if where 𝐖[1:K]⁣∖k≜(W1,…,Wk−1,Wk+1,…,WK)≜subscript𝐖delimited-[]:1𝐾𝑘subscript𝑊1…subscript𝑊𝑘1subscript𝑊𝑘1…subscript𝑊𝐾{\\mathbf{W}}_{[1:K]\\setminus k}\\triangleq(W_{1},\\dots,W_{k-1},W_{k+1},\\dots,W_{K}) is the set of all messages except Wksubscript𝑊𝑘W_{k}.\nIn this work, we relax this condition by assuming a general leaky DB privacy constraint.\nThe leaked information about the undesired messages must be bounded as, where δ≥0𝛿0\\delta\\geq 0 is a non-negative constant. ϵ−limit-fromitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-user privacy:\nUnder perfect user privacy, the privacy constraints are expressed as, This guarantees that the submitted queries are always independent of the message index. The previous constraint can be alternatively expressed as, where 𝐖Ωsubscript𝐖Ω{\\mathbf{W}}_{\\Omega} is any subset of the K𝐾K messages, i.e., 𝐖Ω⊆{W1,…,WK}subscript𝐖Ωsubscript𝑊1…subscript𝑊𝐾{\\mathbf{W}}_{\\Omega}\\subseteq\\{W_{1},\\ldots,W_{K}\\}.\nIn this work, the privacy constraint is relaxed such that given any subset 𝐖Ωsubscript𝐖Ω\\mathbf{W}_{\\Omega} of the K𝐾K messages, the following likelihood ratio is bounded as follows: where π𝜋\\pi and γ𝛾\\gamma represent any possible realizations for the queries and answers, respectively and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is a non-negative constant. Unlike perfect user privacy constraint which ensures that queries and answers are independent of the message index, the leaky privacy definition allows some queries and answers to be used more frequently when certain messages are retrieved. By setting ϵ=0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon=0, the ϵ−limit-fromitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-user privacy definition in (9) becomes equivalent to the perfect privacy constraint in (8). Other leaky user privacy definitions:\nTo relax DB privacy, we adopt the mutual information metric in .\nOn the other hand, we use the probability metric we introduced in  to bound the leakage of user privacy. The latter metric strictly satisfies the privacy constraint for all possible query/message index combinations.\nWe note that there are other weaker metrics one can use for relaxing user privacy. In , Lin et al. proposed a metric η𝜂\\eta that gives a bound on the average privacy leakage over all databases for a desired message index given by a random variable θ∈[1:K]\\theta\\in[1:K] such that, Jia et al. introduced the following privacy constraint [ref]48, where parameter ρ𝜌\\rho controls the leakage budget, with 0≤ρ≤1N0𝜌1𝑁0\\leq\\rho\\leq\\frac{1}{N}.\nIn contrast to our ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-user privacy definition in (9), both of the metrics provide average privacy guarantees, i.e., they bound the average privacy leakage over all possible retrieval schemes. This means that the privacy leakage is allowed to exceed the required bound in the case of individual message retrievals. In this work, we extend the definition in (7) to investigate the scenario when the distribution of the sent queries and the corresponding answers is allowed to depend on the requested message index within predefined limits. Also, the AL-PIR model satisfies the ϵ−limit-fromitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-user privacy definition strictly over all possible realizations of answers and queries. This ensures that leakage is always within the allowed budget ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon for all individual message retrievals. Communication Cost: To evaluate the performance of the AL-PIR scheme,\nwe adopt the Shannon theoretic formulation where the message size is assumed to be arbitrarily long and therefore, the upload cost is negligible compared to the download cost . In this case, the AL-PIR rate is the reciprocal of the download cost D​(ϵ,δ)𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿D(\\epsilon,\\delta), which characterizes the total information bits the user has to download to retrieve one desired message bit.\nLet Dϵ,δsubscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿D_{\\epsilon,\\delta} be the total number of downloaded bits to retrieve message Wksubscript𝑊𝑘W_{k}, for some ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and δ𝛿\\delta, and L𝐿L be the size of the desired message. The normalized download cost is given by, We say that the pair (L,Dϵ,δ)𝐿subscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿(L,D_{\\epsilon,\\delta}) is achievable if there exists an AL-PIR scheme that satisfies the correctness, DB privacy, and user privacy conditions in (4), (6), and (9), respectively, and can retrieve a message of size L𝐿L bits by downloading a total of Dϵ,δsubscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿D_{\\epsilon,\\delta} bits.\nOur goal is to find the optimal download cost D∗​(ϵ,δ)superscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta) such that The capacity of the AL-PIR C∗​(ϵ,δ)superscript𝐶italic-ϵ𝛿C^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta) is the reciprocal of D∗​(ϵ,δ)superscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta), Optimal common randomness size: We are also interested in characterizing the fundamental limits of common randomness S𝑆S needed to be stored at the databases. In general, the common randomness size α𝛼\\alpha is a function of the privacy budget parameters (ϵ,δ)italic-ϵ𝛿(\\epsilon,\\delta). Therefore, in the following discussion, we use the notation H​(S)=α​(ϵ,δ)​L𝐻𝑆𝛼italic-ϵ𝛿𝐿H(S)=\\alpha(\\epsilon,\\delta)L. We define α∗​(ϵ,δ)superscript𝛼italic-ϵ𝛿\\alpha^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta) as the minimum common randomness size that satisfies the correctness, DB privacy, and user privacy conditions in (4), (6), and (9), respectively, i.e.,\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: that approaches zero as L→∞→𝐿L\\rightarrow\\infty. o​(L)𝑜𝐿o(L) is set to zero if Pesubscript𝑃𝑒P_{e} is required to be exactly zero. δ−limit-from𝛿\\delta-DB privacy:\nIn the original SPIR formulation [ref]9, the authors assume no leakage to the user about the undesired messages. For a desired message Wksubscript𝑊𝑘W_{k}, perfect DB privacy is satisfied if where\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
