      "content": "Paper Title: Analysis of Loss and Crosstalk Noise in MZI-based Coherent Silicon Photonic Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rising demand for larger neural networks to address complex and computationally expensive problems, artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators need to consistently deliver better performance and improved accuracy while being energy-efficient. In this context, deep neural networks have attracted substantial interest for various applications ranging from image recognition to network anomaly detection, decision-making problems, self-driving cars, pandemic rate prediction, and early-stage cancer detection . Given the significant growth in the demand for data-driven and computationally expensive applications, the energy efficiency of electronic-based deep-learning inference accelerators has been relatively low, and they have been unable to keep up with the performance requirements of emerging deep-learning applications  . Silicon photonics (SiPh) enables the deployment of integrated photonics across a wide range of applications, from realizing ultra-fast communication for Datacom applications    [ref]7 to energy-efficient optical computation in emerging hardware accelerators for deep learning   0. To alleviate the limitations of conventional CMOS-based electronic accelerators in terms of energy consumption and latency, new SiPh-based hardware accelerators optimized for deep learning applications are on the rise. By leveraging optical interconnects for communication and photonic devices for computation, silicon-photonic-based neural network (SP-NN) accelerators offer the promise of up to 1000 times higher energy efficiency for performing computationally expensive multiply-and-accumulate operations , which are the most power-hungry and common operations in deep learning applications . Among different SP-NN implementations, coherent SP-NNs, which operate on a single wavelength, have an inherent advantage over noncoherent SP-NNs that require power-hungry wavelength-conversion steps and multiple wavelength sources 1. Fig.¬†1 presents an overview of a multi-layer coherent SP-NN with N1subscriptùëÅ1N_{1} inputs, N2subscriptùëÅ2N_{2} outputs, and MùëÄM layers. Each layer comprises an optical-interference unit (OIU) implemented using an array of Mach‚ÄìZehnder interferometers (MZIs) with a specific architecture, connected to a nonlinear-activation unit (NAU) using an optical gain (amplification) unit (OGU). Within an OIU, MZIs can be used to realize matrix-vector multiplication as shown by 2 . Accordingly, several coherent SP-NN architectures have been proposed by cascading arrays of MZIs to perform large-scale linear multiplication in the optical domain 3 4 5. While SP-NNs are promising alternatives to electronic-based deep learning hardware accelerators, several factors limit their performance and scalability. The underlying devices in SP-NNs (e.g., MZIs in coherent SP-NNs) suffer from optical loss and crosstalk noise due to device fabrication imperfections (e.g., sidewall roughness) and undesired mode couplings  6. For example, prior work has shown up to 1.5¬†dB insertion loss and ‚àí-18¬†dB crosstalk in a 2√ó\\times2 MZI 7. While optical loss and crosstalk noise are small and seem to be negligible at the device level, they accumulate as the network scales up, hence leading to severe performance degradation at the network and system level (e.g., drop in inferencing accuracy). Moreover, crosstalk cannot be filtered in coherent SP-NNs‚Äîour focus in this paper‚Äîdue to the coherence between the noise and victim signals. Therefore, there is a critical need for careful analysis of optical loss and crosstalk noise in coherent SP-NNs and exploring their impact on SP-NN performance. The novel contribution of this paper is to comprehensively analyze optical loss and crosstalk noise and their impact on coherent SP-NN performance from the device level to the system level. We develop a realistic device-level MZI compact model to analyze the optical loss from different sources (i.e., propagation loss, directional coupler loss, and metal absorption loss) and the coherent crosstalk noise in the MZI. This model is also able to capture the impact of optical phase settings, which represent weight parameters in coherent SP-NNs, on the MZI‚Äôs optical loss and crosstalk noise. Leveraging our accurate device-level models, we present layer- and network-level optical loss and coherent crosstalk models that scale with the number of inputs and layers in coherent SP-NNs. In addition, we propose a detailed analysis of the effect of optical loss and crosstalk in SP-NNs when the optoelectronic NAU units are used. The proposed framework enables an accurate exploration of the laser power penalty and inferencing accuracy drop in SP-NNs with different mesh configurations under the effect of optical loss and crosstalk noise. Leveraging our proposed framework, we also quantify the maximum optical loss acceptable in the underlying devices when specific inferencing accuracy goals must be met within an SP-NN. The proposed analytical framework can be applied to any coherent SP-NN architecture of any size to analyze the average and worst-case optical loss and crosstalk noise in the network. In this paper, we consider three well-known MZI-based coherent SP-NN architectures, namely Clements 4, Reck 5, and Diamond 3. For example, for the case study of the Clements SP-NN with 16 inputs and 2 hidden layers, we show that the optical loss, optical crosstalk power, and laser power penalty (i.e., to compensate for optical loss and crosstalk) can be as high as 6¬†dB, 31.6¬†dBm, and 20¬†dBm, respectively. Considering the MNIST classification task as an example, we show that the network inferencing accuracy can drop by about 84.6% due to optical loss and crosstalk noise. We also show that by increasing the number of inputs from 16 to 64 in the same network, the resulting optical power penalty increases significantly to as high as 140¬†dBm. The proposed analyses in this paper extend our prior work in 2 by performing the loss and crosstalk analysis for two more SP-NN configurations, analyzing the effect of optical loss and crosstalk in SP-NNs when optoelectronic nonlinear activation units are used, presenting an optical power penalty model for SP-NNs, and analysing the scalability constraints due to the optical loss and crosstalk in the MZI-based SP-NNs when being used as a photonic processing unit for high-performance computation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents an overview of the building blocks in SP-NNs, SP-NN design and working mechanism, and prior related work. Section III presents analytical models to analyze the impact of optical loss and crosstalk from the device level to the system level in SP-NNs. The impact of the optical loss and crosstalk in optoelectronic NAU units is modeled in this section. Section IV presents the simulation results to show the impact of loss and crosstalk on the performance of SP-NNs with the three MZI mesh configurations of Clements, Reck, and Diamond. Section V presents the discussion on the effect of optical loss and crosstalk noise on SP-NN power consumption (i.e., laser power penalty) as well as scalability constraints in SP-NNs. Finally, Section VI concludes this work.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: applications  .
