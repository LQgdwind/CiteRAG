      "content": "Paper Title: Sample-Level Weighting for Multi-Task Learning with Auxiliary Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nJoint optimization with auxiliary tasks can lead to a better generalizable solution for the main task of interest while requiring less data. Recently, multi-task learning (MTL) has seen various successful applications in Deep Learning (DL), e.g., in computer vision  [ref]48, reinforcement learning [ref]31, and recommender systems . \nNonetheless, the optimization of MTL networks remains challenging in practice. During training, negative interference between tasks can prevent the network from reaching a good optimum. Negative inter-task interference mainly occurs for two reasons: (i) task updates providing harmful gradient directions or (ii) gradient norms being imbalanced  [ref]17  . Existing approaches prevent negative gradient interference at the task level by finding appropriate task weights in the multi-task loss function   or by aligning the different task gradients  . At the same time, it is widely recognized in machine learning literature that some samples are more useful than others, with some even harming training, e.g., noisy data    .\nIn this paper, we abandon the widespread assertion of MTL literature of a task as an atomic unit. We disentangle the composite task signal into the sum of its parts on a sample-level. Instead of focusing on task-level weighting, this paper adopts a novel unified perspective that jointly optimizes task- and sample-level weights. \nTo fill the corresponding research gap, we propose SLGrad, a sample-level dynamic task-weighting algorithm for learning with auxiliary tasks. Different from existing task weighting algorithms, SLGrad evaluates the usefulness of samples from each task distribution with respect to the generalization performance of the main task. As such, the proposed algorithm is able to systematically avoid negative interference between different task distributions while providing meaningful sample weighting. SLGrad thus joins the benefits of an auxiliary learning approach with those of sample weighting. A pictorial representation of SLGrad is provided in Figure 1. Experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real data show that SLGrad is flexible to adjust to the variability in task and sample signals, providing state-of-the-art performance. The contributions of this paper are summarized below: We bridge the existing gap between sample weighting in single-task literature and dynamic task weighting in multi-task learning. We propose a new dynamic task weighting algorithm for MTL with auxiliary tasks: SLGrad. SLGrad’s sample and task weight distributions are exhaustively studied. Extensive benchmark experiments on (semi)-synthetic and real-world datasets are performed.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: solution for the main task of interest while requiring less data.
