This limitation is more serious in vision than NLP:\nTo process an image with at least thousands of pixels,\npatch-wise tokenization is a must for Transformers to control the computational cost.\nGiven higher resolution images, the patch size also needs to be enlarged proportionally sacrificing the spatial resolution.\nThis limits the capability of Transformers, e.g., learning fine-grained feature representation as required in many visual recognition tasks. Recently, there have been a number of linear/efficient variants [ref]5 [ref]35      of Transformers in NLP.\nFor example, [ref]35 learns to shrink the length of Key and Value based on a low-rank assumption.\n adopts a hashing strategy to selective the most similar pairs\nand only compute attention among them.\n[ref]5  utilize different kernel functions for approximating softmax-based self-attention matrix.\n applies random feature mapping on the sequences to approach the original softmax function.  decreases the time and memory consumption of the attention matrix by replacing the softmax function with its linear-complexity recurrent alternative.\nWhen applied to visual recognition tasks, however,\nwe show that these models\nhave considerable performance degradation\ncompared to the standard Transformers [ref]34 (see Sec. 4.2). The most related work to SOFT is 0 which\nuses the Nyström matrix decomposition to avoid computing the full attention matrix.\nHowever, this method suffers from several theoretical defects: (1)\nAs the standard self-attention needs to apply row-wise softmax normalization on the full attention matrix, a direct application\nof matrix decomposition is infeasible.\nAs a workaround, softmax is simply applied\nto all the ingredient matrices in 0. Such an approximation\nis not guaranteed theoretically.\n(2) With a polynomial iteration\nmethod, it is not guaranteed that the generalized attention matrix inverse\ncan be computed when the matrix\nis a nearly singular one in practice.\nIn contrast to all the above methods, in this paper we propose a softmax-free self-attention mechanism that facilitates matrix decomposition for\ncomplexity minimization with theoretical guarantees.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: There is a surge of research interests recently in\nexploiting Transformers for visual recognition tasks\n    ,\ninspired by their remarkable success in NLP\n[ref]34  .\nCore to these NLP and vision transformers is the same self-attention mechanism [ref]34\nthat computes a self-attention matrix by exhaustively comparing token pairs.\nThis means a quadratic\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
