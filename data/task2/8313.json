To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result for a complex dynamics.

FPTASes for the partition functions ZHly​(𝝀)subscriptsuperscript𝑍ly𝐻𝝀Z^{\\mathrm{ly}}_{H}(\\bm{\\lambda}) and ZHfs​(𝜷)subscriptsuperscript𝑍fs𝐻𝜷Z^{\\mathrm{fs}}_{H}(\\bm{\\beta}) can be derived from the above zero-freeness results by applying Barvionk’s interpolation method   .\nThe cumulants, such as the average size and variance of a random independent set, can also be approximated through a similar interpolation .\nWe note that in the regime of Theorem 1.1 specifically at the point 𝝀=1𝝀1\\bm{\\lambda}=1\n(or in the regime of Theorem 1.3 at the point 𝜷=0𝜷0\\bm{\\beta}=0),\nan FPTAS for the partition function that counts the number of independent sets in the hypergraph H𝐻H has already been found in [ref]23,\nutilizing a different approach based on derandomization.\nHowever, as showcased by the following examples, zero-freeness have much broader applications beyond deterministic approximation of partition functions. Through the well-known connection between central limit theorems and the zero-freeness of univariate polynomials   ,\nwe derive central limit theorems for hypergraph independent sets.\nWe consider the Gibbs measure μH,𝝀subscript𝜇𝐻𝝀\\mu_{H,\\bm{\\lambda}} associated with ZHly​(𝝀)subscriptsuperscript𝑍ly𝐻𝝀Z^{\\mathrm{ly}}_{H}(\\bm{\\lambda}), defined as follows: The measure μH,𝝀subscript𝜇𝐻𝝀\\mu_{H,\\bm{\\lambda}} can be analytically continued to the complex plane through a connected zero-free region, that is, regions where ZHly​(𝝀)≠0subscriptsuperscript𝑍ly𝐻𝝀0Z^{\\mathrm{ly}}_{H}(\\bm{\\lambda})\\neq 0.\nOur multivariate zero-freeness for the hypergraph independence polynomial is especially powerful. In principle, one can derive a central limit theorem for any univariate projection of the polynomial.\nWe demonstrate a natural example by giving a quantitative central limit theorem (also known as Berry-Esseen inequality) for the size of a random independent set, drawn from the Gibbs measure of hypergraph independent sets.\nOur new zero-free region and central limit theorem (CLT) can be lifted to a local CLT as in .\nWe defer the proof to Appendix A. Fix k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 and Δ≥3Δ3\\Delta\\geq 3.\nLet H=(V,ℰ)𝐻𝑉ℰH=(V,\\mathcal{E}) be a k𝑘k-uniform hypergraph with maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta. Let n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=\\left|V\\right|.\nFix any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, ε∈(0,19​k5​Δ2)𝜀019superscript𝑘5superscriptΔ2\\varepsilon\\in\\left(0,\\frac{1}{9k^{5}\\Delta^{2}}\\right). Let λc,εsubscript𝜆𝑐𝜀\\lambda_{c,\\varepsilon} be defined as in Theorem 1.1.\nFor any λ∈(δ,λc,ε]𝜆𝛿subscript𝜆𝑐𝜀\\lambda\\in(\\delta,\\lambda_{c,\\varepsilon}], let I∼μH,λsimilar-to𝐼subscript𝜇𝐻𝜆I\\sim\\mu_{H,\\lambda}, and define X=|I|𝑋𝐼X=\\left|I\\right|, μ¯=𝔼​[X]¯𝜇𝔼delimited-[]𝑋\\bar{\\mu}=\\mathbb{E}[X] and σ2=Var​[X]superscript𝜎2Vardelimited-[]𝑋\\sigma^{2}=\\mathrm{Var}[X]. Then we have σ2=Θk,Δ,ε​(λ​n)superscript𝜎2subscriptΘ𝑘Δ𝜀𝜆𝑛\\sigma^{2}=\\Theta_{k,\\Delta,\\varepsilon}(\\lambda n) and where 𝒵∼N​(0,1)similar-to𝒵𝑁01\\mathcal{Z}\\sim N(0,1) is a standard Gaussian random variable. Furthermore, let 𝒩​(x)=e−x2/2/2​π𝒩𝑥superscriptesuperscript𝑥222𝜋\\mathcal{N}(x)=\\mathrm{e}^{-x^{2}/2}/\\sqrt{2\\pi} denote the density of the standard normal distribution, we have As a side note, while there is rich literature on Markov chain central limit theorems (CLT), these do not seem to apply to our context. Specifically, our CLT crucially captures the unimodality of the stationary distribution itself, while Markov chain CLT concerns the sum of samples generated by a Markov chain, and does not seem to distinguish between unimodal and multimodal distributions.\nLog-Sobolev type inequalities (LSI), if available, would also give concentration tail estimates. But the recent spectral independence framework for establishing LSI for Markov chains requires arbitrary pinnings, which breaks the uniformity of hyperedges. Inspired by , we give an FPTAS based on zero-freeness and local CLT, to approximate the number of hypergraph independent sets of size t𝑡t. The proofs are deferred to Appendix B. Fix k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2, Δ≥3Δ3\\Delta\\geq 3. Let H=(V,ℰ)𝐻𝑉ℰH=(V,\\mathcal{E}) be a k𝑘k-uniform hypergraph with maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta and n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=\\left|V\\right|. Let ε𝜀\\varepsilon, λc,εsubscript𝜆𝑐𝜀\\lambda_{c,\\varepsilon} be defined as in Theorem 1.1.\nThere exists a deterministic algorithm which, on input H𝐻H, an integer 1≤t≤n​(1−11+λc,ε⋅(1+14​e​Δ​k3))1𝑡𝑛1⋅11subscript𝜆𝑐𝜀114eΔsuperscript𝑘31\\leq t\\leq n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{1+\\lambda_{c,\\varepsilon}}\\cdot\\left(1+\\frac{1}{4\\mathrm{e}\\Delta k^{3}}\\right)\\right), and an error parameter η∈(0,1)𝜂01\\eta\\in(0,1), outputs an η𝜂\\eta-relative approximation to the number of hypergraph independent sets of size t𝑡t in time (n/η)Ok,Δ,ε​(1)superscript𝑛𝜂subscript𝑂𝑘Δ𝜀1(n/\\eta)^{O_{k,\\Delta,\\varepsilon}(1)}. A consequence of the Perron-Frobenius theorem for nonnegative matrices is that any ergodic Markov chain converges to a unique stationary distribution. However, the convergence behavior for complex transition matrices is much less understood.\nCentral to our analysis is the systematic scan Glauber dynamics with complex transition weights\n(see Definition 3.2 for a formal definition). We show that it converges to the stationary measure in the same regime of Theorem 1.1. Under the condition of Theorem 1.1, the systematic scan Glauber dynamics for the complex measure associated with the independence polynomial\nZHly​(𝛌)subscriptsuperscript𝑍ly𝐻𝛌Z^{\\mathrm{ly}}_{H}(\\bm{\\lambda}) converges.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: 0.
