The above pipeline is time-consuming due to multiple forward passes of point-cloud networks.\nDriven by large scale grasping datasets , ,\nrecent approaches turn their attention to end-to-end grasp detection - with both grasp pose parameter and confidence estimated by a single model.\nThe key difference lies in the grasp representation choice.\nS4G [ref]27 chooses the SE(3) representation, and directly regresses the rotational and translational parameters anchored on point with high confidence.\nTo enable multiple detection per point, GDN  extends the idea with a coarse-to-fine representation idea, where they first perform classificaiton on a set of discrete angular grids, and then regress translation and rotation refinement values for high-confidence candidates.\nAnother line of approach argues in favor of explicit contact physics reasoning.\nThey adopt the representation of two contact points plus pitching angle  [ref]30, where the assumption is at least one contact point should be visible from partial point cloud. Point-cloud methods share some common drawbacks, which are studied by recent literature.\nDue to the high processing time to extract geometric information from the coordinates enumeration, truncating input point volume, by either downsampling [ref]27 or target segmentation , is necessary.\nL2G [ref]30 alternatively designs an learnable sampler, which can be jointly tuned in the end-to-end training process.\nIt assumes properly designed sampling procedure can retain critical information for grasp synthesis, which is not always the case especially for high-resolution input.\nAnother limitation for point-cloud methods is their bias towards larger objects due to dominating point number.\nMa et al.  allieviate the issue by balanced sampling based on instance segmentation mask, which relies on external segmentation module that increases computational cost.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: With the emergent deep point set encoders such as PointNets [ref]8,  and DeCo ,\nthe majority of literature explores detecting 6-DoF grasp poses from point cloud input .\nEarly effort employs a generate-then-evaluate process, where a discriminative model to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
