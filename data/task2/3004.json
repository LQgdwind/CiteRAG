      "content": "Paper Title: Generation of microbial colonies dataset with deep learning style transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject counting problems, such as estimating the number of cells in a microscopic image or the number of humans or cars in a video frame, have become one of the major tasks in computer vision these days.\nGeneration of synthetic microbiological images using simple geometrical transformations that emulate microscopic views of bacterial colonies was used for validation of various algorithms for automated image analysis, or to train a high-resolution convolutional neural network to build density-map-based cell counters. In the latter, authors use methods similar to ours, where the model was trained using synthetic data and tested on real images. However, in our approach we train a much more complicated but thus more flexible (and prone to generalize) object detector. Therefore, we need to use a much bigger and more diverse dataset containing objects of different sizes and with different lighting conditions. We also verified that further enlarging the dataset by adding another 10k patches practically did not improve the detection fidelity.\nDeep CNNs were also trained to count cells and microbial colonies , but in these approaches the network training was done entirely in a supervised manner using real datasets. Simple augmentation techniques were applied successfully to extend microbial datasets  in bacteria classification tasks. We also flipped or rotated the images, or added salt and pepper noise or speckle noise, but with no significant effect on the training process. According to our experiments, only advanced augmentation by using style transfer significantly affects the training of the detector. It is also worth mentioning that adding more styles did not help much; during the generation we now choose from 20 style images, but when we increased this number to 50, it did not give further improvement. On the other hand, the degree of styling was more important, but if it was too high, i.e λ>0.05𝜆0.05\\lambda>0.05, the fidelity of microbe classification would decrease.\nOther groups involved in the generation of synthetic microbial images also reported the usefulness of style transfer methods.\nThey use the style transfer algorithm in the microbial colony segmentation task to improve the realism of synthetic images of Petri dishes generated using GANs. However, we additionally show that style transfer allows us not only to improve realism, but also to introduce different color or lighting domains, and thus enhance the trained detector’s ability to generalize.\nWe saw in Fig. 7 that by using different style images during training, the detector can learn to count in slightly different lighting conditions (domains) at the same time. Therefore, our approach can be used to quickly change domains, e.g., we can collect styles and empty dishes in different lighting, and then generate synthetic images in that domain. It is also worth emphasizing that standard GANs are not applicable in our case because to train the detector in a supervised manner we need to know exactly where each colony will appear. We need to control precisely where they are located—their placement and number on a dish, which is not possible with generic, unconstrained GAN. On the other hand, there are variations of GANs such as cycle GAN or conditional GAN (e.g. pix2pix translation [ref]24) that would allow colonies to be generated at desired locations. However, our preliminary experiments have shown that while we are able to generate realistic looking images in a single style with pix2pix, training of this type of networks is difficult and it is much harder to achieve sufficient diversity of domains using this approach. As a result, the detector trained on such data performs worse. On the other hand, one-shot style transfer is simply faster (especially for high resolution images), easier to train (without mode collapse or converge failure), and able to transfer with high resolution to different domains. Moreover, data leakage, which is more problematic for medical investigation due to privacy issues, can be controlled with proposed generation strategy. Therefore, to generate the data we used a hybrid of traditional computer vision and image style transfer rather than individual generative models.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: placement and number on a dish, which is not possible with generic, unconstrained GAN.
