Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Several existing methods make use of symbolic reasoning for providing explanations . The explanations resulting from these methods (e.g. abduction-based explanations , prime implicants , sufficient reasons , and majority reasons ) faithfully capture the input-output behaviour of the explained models rather than their mechanics. Other methods extract logical rules as explanations for machine learning models, including NNs  , but again focus on explanations that are only input-output faithful.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: decreasing the\nrisk for overfitting, memory and\nruntime complexity and the associated power consumption.\nExisting approaches include regularization to encourage neurons with weight 00 to be deleted  [ref]33,\npruning of edges  [ref]50, compression  \nand low rank approximation  [ref]48.\nInterval NNs  \nsummarize neurons in clusters based on\ntheir parameters and\nconsider interval outputs for the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
