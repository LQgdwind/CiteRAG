      "content": "Paper Title: A Tutorial on Adversarial Learning Attacks and Countermeasures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhilst adversarial attacks can be powerful, there are a number of countermeasures which help to defend against or even mitigate them. These approaches can either be proactive or reactive. The goal of proactive approaches is to strengthen the model itself against adversarial attacks; in essence making it more robust. Alternatively, reactive approaches aim to detect adversarial attacks and react appropriately, completely regardless of the model [ref]4  . Common proactive approaches include adversarial training and defensive distillation. Adversarial training involves retraining the model on a dataset including adversarial examples , while defensive distillation trains a new model using the outputted class probabilities of the original model as training labels . Denoising is another class of proactive approaches which, as the name suggests, look to reduce noise of the input to highlight and clean the effect of adversarial tampering. Feature squeezing is the primary example of this and works by reducing the dimensions of the input, thereby reducing the search-space available for an adversary to tamper. Adversarial examples can be identified by comparing the output of the model given both the original and squeezed input . Singular Value Decomposition can also be used similarly to denoise input data [ref]24. Reactive approaches include adversarial detection or input reconstruction. Adversarial detection generally works by utilising a separate mechanism for determining the legitimacy of input data. There have been a number of detection methods proposed with some success. It should be noted that while some approaches naturally lead to a suitable fix , some do not and thus would probably deal with the attack in an appropriate manner such as to ignore the adversarial data completely [ref]26. Input reconstruction works to transform adversarial examples back to their original form, while normal, clean examples are left completely or minimally changed.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: itself against adversarial attacks; in essence making it more robust.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
