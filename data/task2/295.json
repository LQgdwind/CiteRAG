      "content": "Paper Title: Bounding the Mim-Width of Hereditary Graph Classes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne trade-off of a more powerful width parameter is the difficulty in obtaining a branch decomposition of bounded width.\nIn general, computing mim-width is NP-hard; deciding if the mim-width is at most k𝑘k is Wdelimited-[]1-hard when parameterized by k𝑘k; and there is no polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the mim-width of a graph to within a constant factor of the optimal, unless 𝖭𝖯=𝖹𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯𝖹𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{NP}=\\mathsf{ZPP} .\nHence, in contrast to algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth or clique-width, algorithms for graphs of bounded mim-width require a branch decomposition of constant mim-width as part of the input.\nOn the other hand, there are many interesting graph classes for which mim-width is bounded and quickly computable, that is, the class admits a polynomial-time algorithm for obtaining a branch decomposition of constant mim-width. We give examples of such graph classes known in the literature in Section 1.2 before discussing the new graph classes we found in Section 1.4. Below we briefly discuss known algorithms for problems on graph classes of bounded mim-width. Belmonte and Vatshelle  and Bui-Xuan, Telle and Vatshelle 6 proved that a large set of problems, known as Locally Checkable Vertex Subset and Vertex Partitioning (LC-VSVP) problems , can be solved in polynomial time\nfor graph classes where mim-width is bounded and quickly computable.\nWell-known examples of such problems include (Total) Dominating Set, Independent Set and k𝑘k-Colouring for every fixed positive\ninteger k𝑘k.111In contrast to clique-width , Colouring (where k𝑘k is part of the input) is NP-complete for graphs of bounded mim-width, as it is NP-complete for circular-arc graphs , which have mim-width at most 222 .\nLater, Fomin, Golovach and Raymond [ref]27 proved that the XP algorithms for Independent Set and Dominating Set are in a sense best possible, showing that these two problems are Wdelimited-[]1-hard when parameterized by mim-width. On the positive side, XP algorithms parameterized by mim-width are now also known for problems outside the LC-VSVP framework. In particular, Jaffke, Kwon, Strømme and Telle  proved that the distance versions of LC-VSVP problems can be solved in polynomial time\nfor graph classes where mim-width is bounded and quickly computable.\nJaffke, Kwon and Telle   proved similar results for Longest Induced Path, Induced Disjoint Paths, H𝐻H-Induced Topological Minor and Feedback Vertex Set.\nThe latter result has recently been generalized to Subset Feedback Vertex Set and Node Multiway Cut, by Bergougnoux, Papadopoulos and Telle . Bergougnoux and Kanté [ref]2 gave a meta-algorithm for problems with a global constraint, providing unifying XP algorithms in mim-width for several of the aforementioned problems, as well as Connected Dominating Set, Node Weighted Steiner Tree, and Maximum Induced Tree.\nGalby, Munaro and Ries  proved that Semitotal Dominating Set is polynomial-time solvable for graph classes where mim-width is bounded and quickly computable.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: (where k𝑘k is part of the input) is NP-complete for graphs of bounded mim-width, as it is NP-complete for circular-arc graphs , which have mim-width at most 222 .\nLater, Fomin, Golovach and Raymond [ref]27 proved that the XP algorithms for Independent Set and Dominating Set are in a sense best possible, showing that these two problems are Wdelimited-[]1-hard when parameterized by mim-width.
