      "content": "Paper Title: Path Regularization: A Convexity and Sparsity Inducing Regularization for Parallel ReLU Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough DNNs are highly complex architectures due to the composition of multiple nonlinear functions, their parameters are often trained via simple first order gradient based algorithms, e.g., Gradient Descent (GD) and variants. However, since such algorithms only rely on local gradient of the objective function, they may fail to globally optimize the objective in certain cases  [ref]8. Similarly,   showed that these pathological cases also apply to stochastic algorithms such as Stochastic GD (SGD). They further show that some of these issues can be avoided by increasing the number of trainable parameters, i.e., operating in an overparameterized regime. However,  reported the existence of more complicated cases, where SGD/GD usually fails. Therefore, training DNNs to global optimality remains a challenging optimization problem   . To circumvent difficulties in training, recent studies focused on models that benefit from overparameterization    . As an example,  [ref]20   [ref]23 considered a new architecture by combining multiple standard NNs, termed as sub-networks, in parallel. Evidences in [ref]20   [ref]23   showed that this way of combining NNs yields an optimization landscape that has fewer local minima and/or saddle points so that SGD/GD generally converges to a global minimum. Therefore, many recently proposed NN-based architectures that achieve state-of-the-art performance in practice, e.g., SqueezeNet , Inception , Xception , and ResNext , are in this form. Notation and preliminaries:\nThroughout the paper, we denote matrices and vectors as uppercase and lowercase bold letters, respectively. For vectors and matrices, we use subscripts to denote a certain column/element. As an example, wl​k​jl−1​jlsubscript𝑤𝑙𝑘subscript𝑗𝑙1subscript𝑗𝑙w_{lkj_{l-1}j_{l}} denotes the jl−1​jlt​hsubscript𝑗𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝑗𝑙𝑡ℎj_{l-1}j_{l}^{th} entry of the matrix 𝐖l​ksubscript𝐖𝑙𝑘\\mathbf{W}_{lk}. We use 𝐈ksubscript𝐈𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{k} and 𝟎0\\mathbf{0} (or 𝟏1\\mathbf{1}) to denote the identity matrix of size k×k𝑘𝑘k\\times k and a vector/matrix of zeros (or ones) with appropriate sizes. We use [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] for the set of integers from 111 to n𝑛n. We use ∥⋅∥2\\|\\cdot\\|_{2} and ∥⋅∥F\\|\\cdot\\|_{F} to represent the Euclidean and Frobenius norms, respectively. Additionally, we denote the unit ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p} ball as ℬp:={𝐮∈ℝd:‖𝐮‖p≤1}assignsubscriptℬ𝑝conditional-set𝐮superscriptℝ𝑑subscriptnorm𝐮𝑝1\\mathcal{B}_{p}:=\\{\\mathbf{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\,:\\,\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_{p}\\leq 1\\}. We also use 𝟙​[x≥0]1delimited-[]𝑥0\\mathbbm{1}[x\\geq 0] and (x)+=max⁡{x,0}subscript𝑥𝑥0\\left(x\\right)_{+}=\\max\\{x,0\\} to denote the 0-1 valued indicator and ReLU, respectively. In this paper, we particularly consider a parallel ReLU network with K𝐾K sub-networks and each sub-network is an L𝐿L-layer ReLU network (see Figure 2) with layer weights 𝐖l​k∈ℝml−1×mlsubscript𝐖𝑙𝑘superscriptℝsubscript𝑚𝑙1subscript𝑚𝑙\\mathbf{W}_{lk}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m_{l-1}\\times m_{l}}, ∀l∈[L−1]for-all𝑙delimited-[]𝐿1\\forall l\\in[L-1] and 𝐰L​k∈ℝmL−1subscript𝐰𝐿𝑘superscriptℝsubscript𝑚𝐿1\\mathbf{w}_{Lk}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m_{L-1}}, where m0=dsubscript𝑚0𝑑m_{0}=d, mL=1subscript𝑚𝐿1m_{L}=1111We analyze scalar outputs, however, our derivations extend to vector outputs as shown in Appendix A.11., and mlsubscript𝑚𝑙m_{l} denotes the number of neurons in the lt​hsuperscript𝑙𝑡ℎl^{th} hidden layer. Then, given a data matrix 𝐗∈ℝn×d𝐗superscriptℝ𝑛𝑑{\\bf X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}, the output of the network is as follows where we compactly denote the parameters as θ:=⋃k{𝐖l​k}l=1Lassign𝜃subscript𝑘superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐖𝑙𝑘𝑙1𝐿\\theta:=\\bigcup_{k}\\{\\mathbf{W}_{lk}\\}_{l=1}^{L} with the parameter space as ΘΘ\\Theta and each sub-network represents a standard deep ReLU network. Most commonly used neural networks in practice can be classified as special cases of parallel networks, e.g., standard NNs and ResNets  see Appendix A.2 for details.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: e.g., Gradient Descent (GD) and variants.
