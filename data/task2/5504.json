      "content": "Paper Title: Boosted ab initio Cryo-EM 3D Reconstruction with ACE-EM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSingle-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is one of the most important\nstructural biology techniques  .\nThis technique can be divided into four stages: biological sample preparation,\nelectron microscopy image collection,\n3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction,\nand atomic structural model building.\n3D reconstruction of molecular volumes from 2-dimensional (2D)\nelectron microscopy images is the most challenging and time-consuming step in cryo-EM data analysis.\nThere are two major challenges in cryo-EM 3D reconstruction:\nunknown projection poses (orientations and positions)\nand low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nDuring electron microscopy imaging, the 3D poses of the\nbiological molecules in the sample can not be directly measured.\nThe SNR of a typical cryo-EM image is very low, which\ncan vary from -10 dB to -20 dB (average around -10 dB)\n [ref]2, making it extremely challenging to accurately estimate poses and perform the 3D reconstruction. Currently,\nmany machine-learning (ML)-based methods have been proposed for solving cryo-EM 3D reconstruction  , utilizing architectures like GAN   and auto-encoders  .\nNevertheless, ML-based methods of cryo-EM 3D reconstruction\nare still at an early stage.\nThe highest possible cryo-EM reconstruction resolution (2 pixels)\nat FSC threshold 0.5 has not been achieved by ML-based methods,\neven in simulated datasets without noise.\nFor experimental datasets like the 80S,\nsome methods with amortized inference methods\nfailed to reconstruct the object of certain size,\nor found the highest possible resolution (2 pixels)\nof half-map FSC  [ref]6 at 0.143 not reachable  [ref]7.\nFor widely utilized architecture auto-encoders,\nan image-to-pose encoder extracts the image-projection poses from 2D input cryo-EM images, while a pose-to-image decoder generates the images to match the inputs.\nHowever, as the poses are intermediate latent variables without supervised loss, the estimated poses can be inaccurate and easily trapped in local minima of the orientation space. These pose estimation errors lead to an inferior resolution in the 3D reconstruction output. To improve the pose estimation and 3D reconstruction quality, here we propose a new framework called ACE-EM (ACE for Asymmetric Complementary autoEncoder).\nIn particular, ACE-EM consists of two training tasks:\n(1) Image-pose-image (IPI). The task is the same as previous work, which takes projection images as inputs, and outputs predicted images, by an image-to-pose encoder followed by a pose-to-image decoder.\n(2) Pose-image-pose (PIP). The task explicitly learns the pose estimation in a self-supervised fashion, which takes randomly sampled poses as inputs, and outputs predicted poses, using the same encoder and decoder as in IPI but reversing their order.\nThe two tasks complement each other and achieve a more balanced training of the autoencoder parameters. Our main contributions are listed below. As far as we know, ACE-EM is the first deep-learning model in cryo-EM reconstruction that enhances the pose estimation by the self-supervised PIP task. With better pose estimation, ACE-EM can converge much faster than previous methods, efficiently cover more pose spaces, and achieve better cryo-EM 3D reconstruction quality. ACE-EM can boost performance regardless of decoder types.\nFor example, some decoders, that failed in previous autoencoder architectures, can be successfully used in ACE-EM. Experimental results demonstrate that ACE-EM can perform well in both simulated and real-world experimental datasets. In particular, ACE-EM outperformed all the baseline methods and reached 2 pixels, the Nyquist resolution (the highest possible resolution) at FSC threshold 0.5,\nthe Nyquist resolution of half-map FSC at 0.143\nin the 80S experimental dataset,\nwhich is the only architecture that reached the Nyquist resolution with amortized inference methods.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the 3D poses of the\nbiological molecules in the sample can not be directly measured.\nThe SNR of a typical cryo-EM image is very low, which\ncan vary from -10 dB to -20 dB (average around -10 dB)\n [ref]2, making it extremely challenging to accurately estimate poses and perform the 3D reconstruction.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
