      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-orthogonal Embedding for Efficient Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith growing attention to anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, comprehensive reviews on this topic, including recent deep learning approaches, are available 2  .\nNotice that we focus on unsupervised anomaly segmentation, locating any anomaly region in a test image where only anomaly-free images are available while training.\nTherefore, in this section, we would like to highlight the following related works cohesively. Reconstruction errors. Generative models such as autoencoders and GANs are employed for the task  [ref]1 . These methods are based on an optimistic view on reconstruction errors that anomalies cause higher reconstruction errors than the others. Notice that a model can generate even anomalies for its robust reconstruction capability. A perceptual loss function [ref]1 proposed to overcome this limitation; however, it requires domain knowledge to design the function and has shown a little improvement compared with the other recent approaches 5 [ref]4. Embedding feature similarity. One of the breakthroughs comes from the utilization of pre-trained CNNs. An early work 6 uses the VGG networks 7 for anomaly image detection tasks.\nEspecially, a work 5 explicitly shows that learned discriminative embeddings are better than generative models.\nOne of successful approaches [ref]4  is to use the knowledge distillation 8.\nThis method utilizes the knowledge distillation loss instead of reconstruction errors assuming that the knowledge distillation loss would increase when anomalies appear.\nHowever, with a sufficient network capacity, the loss would vanish when the student networks behavior similarly with the teacher networks. They made pre-designed small CNNs for the teacher networks, distilled from the pre-trained ResNet-18 networks. Mahalanobis distance.\nMahalanobis distance is a metric that measures the distance between two points discounted by a covariance.\nNotably, PaDiM , the current state-of-the-art anomaly segmentation method for the MVTec AD dataset , utilizes 1) the discriminative features from pre-trained CNNs, 2) multi-resolution features, similarly to SPADE , for robust detection, and 3) uses separate statistics per feature location for the unimodal Gaussian assumption of Mahalanobis distance.\nSince the separate statistics require the inverse of multi-dimensional covariance tensor, the key problem in this approach was the approximation of the inverse of covariance tensor.\nThey proposed the random selection of features, while we argue the shortcoming of rank collapse and propose a better solution to use a uniformly generated semi-orthogonal matrix. Orthogonal embedding.\nThe Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma 9 examines the embeddings from high-dimensional into low-dimensional Euclidean space, in a way that the distances among the samples are virtually preserved, e.g., orthogonal projection. A line of works uses random orthogonal matrices to approximate a Gram matrix in the kernel methods 0 or proposes the orthogonal low-rank embedding loss to reduce intra-class variance and enforce inter-class margin simultaneously for classification tasks 1. Related to anomaly detection, the LRaSMD 2 is proposed to solve a hyperspectral anomaly detection problem using a low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition of data. However, it does not consider a large multi-dimensional covariance matrix, which needs to approximate the Mahalanobis distance for anomaly segmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: in this section, we would like to highlight the following related works cohesively.
