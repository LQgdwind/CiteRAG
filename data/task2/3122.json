      "content": "Paper Title: SegDiff: Image Segmentation with Diffusion Probabilistic Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage segmentation  is a problem of assigning each pixel a label that identifies whether it belongs to a specific class or not. This problem is widely investigated using different architectures. These include fully convolutional networks [ref]31, encoder-decoder architectures with skip-connections, such as U-Net , transformer-based architectures, such as the segformer , and even architectures that combine hypernetworks, such as . Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPM) [ref]43  are a class of generative models based on a Markov chain, which can transform a simple distribution (e.g. Gaussian) to data that is sampled in a complex distribution. Diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality images that can compete with and even outperform the latest GAN methods [ref]43  [ref]35 . A variational framework for the likelihood estimation of diffusion models was introduced by Huang et al. . Subsequently, Kingma et al.  proposed a Variational Diffusion Model that produces state-of-the-art results in likelihood estimation for image density. Diffusion models were also applied to language modeling  , where a novel diffusion model for categorical data was used. Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Models  In our work, we use diffusion models to solve the image segmentation problem as conditional generation, given the image. Conditional generation with diffusion models includes methods for class-conditioned generation, which is obtained by adding a class embedding to the timestamp embedding [ref]35. In  a method for guiding the generative process in DDPM is present. This method allows the generation of images based on a given reference image without any additional learning. In the domain of super resolution, the lower-resolution image is upsampled and then concatenated, channelwise, to the generated image at each iteration  . A similar approach passes the low-resolution images through a convolutional block 7 prior to the concatenation. Concurrently with our work, diffusion models were applied to image-to-image translation tasks . These tasks include uncropping, inpainting, and colorization. The results obtained outperform strong GAN baselines. Conditional diffusion models have also been used for voice generation. The mel-spectrogram is processed with a convolutional network, and is used as an additional input to the DPM denoising network ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon  4 . Furthermore, in  a text-to-speech diffusion model is introduced, which uses text as a condition to the diffusion model. In our work, we take a different approach to conditioning, adding (not concatenating) the input image, after it passes through an convolutional encoder, to the current estimation of the segmentation image. In other words, we learn the DPM of a residual model.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: each pixel a label that identifies whether it belongs to a specific class or not.
