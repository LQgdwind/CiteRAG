      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Representation Disentanglement for Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage clustering has been widely used in many computer vision, such as image segmentation [ref]1 and visual features learning [ref]2 . Since images are usually high-semantic and high-dimensional, it is difficult to achieve better performance when clustering on large-scale datasets. Earlier clustering studies [ref]4   [ref]1 focus on end-to-end training solutions. For example, Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training (IMSAT)  and Invariant Information Clustering (IIC) [ref]1 develop clustering methods from a mutual information maximization perspective, and Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) [ref]4 and Deep Clustering Network (DCN)  perform clustering on initial features obtained from autoencoders. Since these methods rely on network initialization and are likely to focus on low-level non-semantic features , such as color and texture, they are prone to cluster degeneracy solutions. The recently developed clustering methods usually consist of two key steps: representation learning and cluster assignment. Representation learning aims to learn semantically meaningful features, i.e., samples from the same category are projected to similar features so that all samples are linearly separable.\nOne popular representation learning is self-supervised contrastive learning     that greatly improves the learned representation. To obtain categorical information without labels, an additional step such as K-means clustering [ref]4  [ref]2 or training of a classifier  is required for cluster assignment. K-means clustering [ref]4  [ref]2 is widely used for clustering on learned features. It requires the proper selection of distance measures, thus suffering from the uneven assignment of clusters and leading to a degenerate solution . Semantic Clustering by Adopting Nearest Neighbors (SCAN)  proposes a novel objective function to train a classifier instead of using K-means. Its performance relies heavily on the feature quality such that nearest neighbors of each sample in the feature space belong to the same category. Due to the presence of noisy nearest neighbors, there is still room for improvement in clustering performance on large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose Contrastive representation Disentanglement based Clustering (CDC), a novel clustering method that directly disentangles the categorical information from the feature representation via contrastive learning. Specifically, we formulate contrastive learning as a proxy task to disentangle the feature representation, which enables us to take advantage of the powerful contrastive learning frameworks. Figure 1 shows an illustration of CDC. First, each representation is decomposed into two parts: 𝐳csuperscript𝐳𝑐\\mathbf{z}^{c} and 𝐳nsuperscript𝐳𝑛\\mathbf{z}^{n}, where 𝐳csuperscript𝐳𝑐\\mathbf{z}^{c} represents categorical information (logits) and 𝐳nsuperscript𝐳𝑛\\mathbf{z}^{n} is used for capturing instance-wise factors. Then, 𝐳csuperscript𝐳𝑐\\mathbf{z}^{c} and 𝐳nsuperscript𝐳𝑛\\mathbf{z}^{n} are concatenated together for the training of typical contrastive learning. To avoid the collapse of 𝐳csuperscript𝐳𝑐\\mathbf{z}^{c}, we apply the equipartition constraint on it to ensure that the clusters are evenly assigned. We demonstrate that this constraint plays a crucial role in disentangling the representation into two distinct parts and ensuring that 𝐳csuperscript𝐳𝑐\\mathbf{z}^{c} effectively encodes categorical information. By considering 𝐳csuperscript𝐳𝑐\\mathbf{z}^{c} as part of the representation, which can handle well a large number of clusters, we achieve the efficient disentanglement for cluster assignment through contrastive learning. Our method can be interpreted as instance-wise contrastive learning with self-adjusting weights, which learns to set different weights to distinguish different negative samples. Typical contrastive learning methods aim to force positive pairs to achieve high similarity (dot product) and negative pairs to achieve low similarity on 𝐳nsuperscript𝐳𝑛\\mathbf{z}^{n}. Our method adjusts the order of magnitude corresponding to each dimension of 𝐳csuperscript𝐳𝑐\\mathbf{z}^{c} to distinguish between intra-class and inter-class samples. For example, positive pairs yield high similarity scores because they are from the same instance, and negative pairs from different categories yield low similarity scores due to different semantics. Note that negative pairs from the same category yield moderate similarity scores during the instance-wise setting. We demonstrate that the similarity of 𝐳csuperscript𝐳𝑐\\mathbf{z}^{c} provides a mechanism to adjust different weights for negative samples and improves the uniformity property of negative samples in the representation space, therefore beneficial for representation learning. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose CDC, a contrastive representation disentanglement-based clustering method that separates categorical information from the feature representation. It considers contrastive learning as a proxy task to efficiently learn disentangled representation. We apply the equipartition constraint on part of the representation to enforce representation disentanglement. The proposed objective function plays a key role in disentangling the representation into two parts: categorical and instance-wise information. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that CDC adjusts different weights for negative samples through learning cluster assignments. With a gradient analysis, we show that the larger weights tend to concentrate more on hard negative samples. The clustering experiments show that CDC outperforms existing methods in multiple benchmarks, and in particular, achieves significant improvements on ImageNet. CDC also contributes to better representation learning results.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Image clustering has been widely used in many computer vision, such as image segmentation [ref]1 and visual features learning [ref]2 .
