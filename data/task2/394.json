      "content": "Paper Title: Guessing Cost: Bounds and Applications to Data Repair in Distributed Storage\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are numerous applications involving guesswork and its various uses, with many of them being related to cryptography and data correction. For instance, in the field of security known as the (public) keyword guessing  around the cryptographic notion called searchable encryption . On the other hand, guessing is recognized to be a useful analysis tool for data detection and error correction coding as well. For instance, it is shown that the cut-off rate of sequential decoding can easily be characterized if guessing theory is applied to the general idea of decoding of a tree code . The application of guessing to coding theory dates back to Ulam’s problem  where one is allowed to lie in their responses . More recently, capacity-achieving maximum likelihood decoding algorithms are developed in a data communication context based on guessing . Later, these studies evolved to develop universal decoders especially for low-latency communication scenarios [ref]20. Moreover, thanks to the optimal strategy that lists most likely noise sequences and low implementation complexity, guessing framework is demonstrated to be a viable decoding option for the control channel of 5G networks . Therefore, we believe that extending the idea of guessing by associating a cost with each choice would be quite powerful and will find plenty of interesting applications in communications engineering of future generation standards. Distributed systems constitute yet another application area in which cost of data communication depends on the link loads, node availabilities and current traffic at the time of data communication etc. Moreover base stations (BS) could also be used to help with the network data reconstruction processes at the expense of increased costs . BS can help reduce the time needed to reconstruct data, as well as reduce the average cost of the process. Such costs can be expressed in terms of latency, bandwidth used to transfer information or computation complexity depending on the context. Recently, there have been a multitude of diverse research efforts undertaken to investigate the general concept of guessing across various domains. For instance, in , security attacks on distributed storage systems in which an attacker can use one hint on the sensitive data is analyzed. In another study , bounds for a specific setting in which simultaneous guesses can be made is investigated. Furthermore, the study presented in [ref]37 delves into the subject of restricted-memory guessing, wherein the individual making the guesses is limited by their ability to recall their previous attempts. In a more recent study,  focuses on developing general framework on well-known problems related to guesswork such as, source coding, task partitioning, etc. Among these studies, both  and [ref]37 can be extended with the assignment of “costs\" for guessing random variables. As for the case in [ref]37, the representation size of each variable can be associated with a form of cost value since guessing a particular value can incur different usage patterns in memory, whereas the number of simultaneous guesses, i.e. the number of attacking computers, can cause additional cost in the system. The study in  can be further extended by taking into account the same specific parameter.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: decoding algorithms are developed in a data communication context based on guessing .
