      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Structure-Guided Diffusion Model for 2D Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task, which requires localizing the keypoints coordinates from the human body in an image and has many applications in action recognition¬†, human reconstruction¬†, and human neural radiance fields¬†, etc. The modern approaches for 2D human pose estimation can be categorized as top-down¬†8  [ref]50, bottom-up¬†0  , and one-stage methods¬†  .\nUsually, the top-down methods show better performances than other paradigms due to the unified scale of persons and higher resolutions of people. And we focus on top-down manner in this paper. Learning heatmaps is widely adopted in top-down¬†8  [ref]50 and bottom-up methods¬†0  because it can reserve the spatial information and make the model easy to converge.\nTo obtain better heatmap representation, existing methods typically design customized architectures to extract better features, such as high-resolution representation¬†  and vision Transformers¬†  [ref]50.\nFor example, HRNet¬† maintains high-resolution features during each downsampling stage of the neural network. ViTPose¬†[ref]50 utilizes a full vision Transformer network to extract stronger feature representation.\nAs shown in Figure¬†1 (a), these methods all follow a discriminative scheme of detecting each pixel of an image.\nBesides, some refinement-based methods¬†   improve the accuracy of coordinates outputted from heatmaps by a two-stage refining model¬†, post-process\nbased on heatmap distribution¬†, and learning keypoints offsets\nrelative to heatmap peaks¬†.\nHowever, the performances of these post-process refinements\nare inevitably impacted by the quality of the original heatmaps.\nOur motivation is to explore a novel scheme for generating high-quality heatmaps. Recently, diffusion models¬†  have shown superior performance in multi-modal content generation tasks, such as text-guided image/video generation¬† , image super-resolution¬† , 3D shapes and textures synthesis¬†, and so on.\nThese successes are from the strong ability of the diffusion model that recovers the signals from noised inputs in a progressive way. Inspired by that, researchers successfully apply the diffusion denoising framework to object detection¬† and segmentation¬†  , which brings a promising prospect of tackling visual perception tasks via diffusion models. However, few explorations have been studied on applying diffusion models to 2D human pose estimation. To generate high-quality heatmaps for 2D human pose estimation, we propose DiffusionPose, which formulates the 2D human pose estimation as a generative process of heatmaps from noised heatmaps via diffusion model.\nThe novel diffusion-generation scheme for 2D human pose estimation is shown in Figure¬†1 (b), which includes a forward diffusion process q‚Äã(yt|y0)ùëûconditionalsubscriptùë¶ùë°subscriptùë¶0q(y_{t}|y_{0}) and a reverse process pŒ∏‚Äã(yt‚àí1|yt)subscriptùëùùúÉconditionalsubscriptùë¶ùë°1subscriptùë¶ùë°p_{\\theta}(y_{t-1}|y_{t}).\nDuring training, the keypoints are diffused to random distribution by adding Gaussian noises and the diffusion model learns to recover ground-truth heatmaps from noised heatmaps with respect to conditions constructed by image feature.\nDuring inference, the diffusion model generates high-quality heatmaps from initialized heatmaps in a progressive denoising way, with the guidance of conditions.\nFurthermore, we explore improving the performance of DiffusionPose by incorporating various human structural information as conditions and studying the influences of different heatmaps resolutions on DiffusionPose.\nThese components lead DiffusionPose to achieve favorable results on three 2D pose estimation datasets. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose DiffusionPose, which formulates the 2D human pose estimation as a denoising process from noised heatmaps via diffusion model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of the diffusion model in 2D human pose estimation. We further propose the structure-guided diffusion decoder (SGDD) and high-resolution SGDD to reform the diffusion model for human pose estimation, which leads DiffusionPose to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments on COCO, CrowdPose, and AI Challenge datasets show that DiffusionPose achieves favorable results against the previous schemes.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: and has many applications in action recognition¬†, human reconstruction¬†, and human neural radiance fields¬†, etc. The modern approaches for 2D human pose estimation can be categorized as top-down¬†8  [ref]50, bottom-up¬†0  , and one-stage methods¬†  .\nUsually, the top-down methods show better performances than other paradigms due to the unified scale of persons and higher resolutions of people.
