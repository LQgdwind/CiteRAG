      "content": "Paper Title: Matryoshka: Non-Exclusive Memory Tiering via Transactional Page Migration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs new memory devices, such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) [ref]4 , DRAM, persistent memory  , Compute Express Link (CXL)-based memory   [ref]34, and storage-class memory   continue to emerge, future computer systems are anticipated to feature multiple tiers of memory with distinct characteristics, such as speed, size, power and cost. Tiered memory management aims to leverage the strength of each memory tier to optimize the overall data access latency and bandwidth. Central to tiered memory management is page management within operating systems (OS), including page allocation, placement, and migration. Efficient page management in the OS is crucial for optimizing memory utilization and performance while maintaining transparency for user applications. Traditionally, the memory hierarchy consists of storage media with at least one order of magnitude difference in performance. For example, in the two-level memory hierarchy assumed by commercial operating systems for decades, DRAM and disks differ in latency, bandwidth, and capacity by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Therefore, the sole goal of page management is to keep hot pages in, and maximize the hit rate of the “performance” tier (DRAM) and migrate (evict) cold pages to the “capacity” tier (disk) when needed. As new memory devices emerge, the performance gap in the memory hierarchy narrows. Evaluations on Intel’s Optane persistent memory   and CXL memory  reveal that these new memory technologies are able to achieve comparable performance to DRAM in both latency and bandwidth, within a range of 2-3x. As a result, the assumption on the performance gap, which has guided the design of OS page management for decades, may not hold. It is no longer beneficial to promote a hot page to the performance tier if the migration cost is too high. Furthermore, unlike disks which must be accessed through the file system as a block device, new memory devices are byte-addressable and can be directly accessed by the processor via ordinary load and store instructions. Therefore, for a warm page on the capacity tier, accessing the page directly and avoiding migration could be a better choice. Most importantly, while the performance of tiered memory remains hierarchical, the hardware is no longer hierarchical. Both the Optane persistent memory and CXL memory appear to the processor as CPUless memory nodes, enabling the OS to manage them as ordinary DRAM nodes. These unique challenges facing emerging tiered memory systems have inspired research on improving page management in the OS. Much focus has been on expediting page migrations between memory tiers. Nimble [ref]51 improves page migration by utilizing transparent huge pages (THP), multi-threaded migration of a page, and concurrent migration of multiple pages. Transparent page placement (TPP)  extends the existing NUMA balancing scheme in Linux to support asynchronous page demotion and synchronous page promotion between fast and slow memory. Memtis [ref]34 and TMTS  use hardware performance counters to mitigate the overhead of page access tracking and use background threads to periodically and asynchronously promote pages. However, these approaches have two fundamental limitations. First, the existing page management for tiered memory assumes that memory tiers are exclusive to each other – hot pages are allocated or migrated to the performance tier while cold pages are demoted to the capacity tier. Therefore, each page is only present in one tier. As memory tiering seeks to explore the tradeoff between performance and capacity, the working set size of workloads that benefit most from tiered memory systems likely exceeds the capacity of the performance tier. Exclusive memory tiering inevitably leads to excessive hot-cold page swapping or memory thrashing when the performance tier is not large enough to hold hot data. Second, there is a lack of an efficient page migration mechanism to support tiered memory management. As future memory tiers are expected to be addressable by the CPU, page migrations are similar to serving minor page faults and involve three steps: 1) ummap a page from the page table; 2) copy page content to a different tier; 3) remap the page on the page table, pointing to the new memory address. Regardless whether page migration is done synchronously upon accessing a hot page in the slower capacity tier or asynchronously in the background, the 3-step migration process is expensive. During the migration, an unmapped page cannot be accessed by user programs. If page migration is done frequently, e.g., due to memory thrashing, user-perceived bandwidth, including accesses to the migrating pages, is significantly lower (up to 95% lower) than the peak memory bandwidth [ref]51. This paper advocates non-exclusive memory tiering that allows a subset of pages on the performance tier to have shadow copies on the capacity tier 111We assume that page migrations only occur between two adjacent tiers if there are more than two memory tiers.. Note that non-exclusive tiering is different from inclusive tiering which strictly uses the performance tier as a cache of the capacity tier. The most important benefit is that under memory pressure, page demotion is made less expensive by simply remapping a page if it is not dirty and its shadow copy exists on the capacity tier. This allows for smooth performance transition when memory demand exceeds the capacity of the performance tier. To reduce the cost of page migration, especially for promotion, this paper proposes transactional page migration (TPM), a novel mechanism to enable page access during migration. Unlike current page migrations, TPM starts page content copy without unmapping the page from the capacity tier so that the migrating page is still accessible by user programs. After page content is copied to a new page on the performance tier, TPM checks whether the page has been dirtied during the migration. If so, the page migration (i.e., the transaction) is invalidated and the copied page is discarded. Failed page migrations will be retried at a later time. If successful, the copied new page is mapped in the page table and the old page is unmapped, becoming a shadow copy of the new page. We have developed Matryoshka, a new page management mechanism for tired memory that integrates non-exclusive memory tiering and transactional page migration. Matryoshka safeguards page allocation to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors due to page shadowing. When the capacity tier is under memory pressure, Matryoshka prioritizes the reclamation of shadow pages before evicting ordinary pages. We have implemented a prototype of Matryoshka in Linux and performed a thorough evaluation. Experimental results show that, compared to two representative page management schemes: TPP and Memtis, Matryoshka achieves up to 6x performance improvement over TPP during memory thrashing and consistently outperforms Memtis by as much as 130% when the working set size fits into fast memory. However, we also discover a potential problem that prevents applications from expanding memory allocations beyond fast memory. This finding motivates more research on the memory allocator in the OS to truly embrace tiered memory.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: As new memory devices, such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) [ref]4 , DRAM, persistent memory  , Compute Express Link (CXL)-based memory   [ref]34, and storage-class memory   continue to emerge, future computer systems are anticipated to feature multiple tiers\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
