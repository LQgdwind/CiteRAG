      "content": "Paper Title: Not All Fabrics Are Created Equal: Exploring eFPGA Parameters For IP Redaction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs technology advances,  integrated circuit (IC) complexity has grown significantly and led to increased outsourcing of the steps of the design flow to third-party entities in the supply-chain, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Outsourcing and globalization introduce many players in the supply-chain and this presents challenges of  intellectual property block (IP) theft, reverse-engineering, and malicious manipulation [ref]1.\nConsider IC layout design files which are sent to the foundry for fabrication, malicious (or compromised) employees can access these files and reverse-engineer the function to steal the IP of critical design portions or to insert hardware Trojans. Malicious end-users can obtain working ICs to analyze the I/O relationships and reverse-engineer the correct function (in collusion with a malicious foundry) to make unauthorized clones. In response,\nresearchers have proposed a myriad of solutions that aim to protect the confidentiality of the hardware IP, including design obfuscation and logic locking (e.g.,  [ref]2     [ref]7    ).\nAll these techniques obscure a design’s function by adding modules whose correct functionality depends on an external key  or by withholding information such as algorithm constants that only a legitimate user can later restore [ref]2.\nIncorrect keys corrupt the IC’s functionality, rendering the design useless to the malicious party.\nTo date, attacks have overcome the protections. The most notable class of attacks is based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT)   . These SAT-based attacks assume an adversary with access to an unlocked implementation (the Oracle).\nRecently, redacting parts of an IP by using embedded field programmable gate arrays, as depicted in Fig. 1(b), has emerged as a promising, SAT-attack resilient defense  [ref]7.\nThe intuition is that even small eFPGAs fabrics are insurmountable for SAT solvers because of their complexity and their size when converted into a representation for SAT solving .\nPrior work has begun to characterize the feasibility of this defense by studying the overhead associated with this technique assuming a fixed eFPGA architecture . However, are all eFPGAs the same from a security perspective?\nTo the best of our knowledge, the literature does not yet offer insights on how different eFPGA parameters, such as look-up table size, affect the security offered by eFPGA-based redaction.\nIn logic locking approaches, security is distilled into a single parameter: the key size  – a designer can choose a key size, as a measure of security, and incur follow-on impacts on power, performance, and hardware area (PPA) metrics. In eFPGAs, the counterpart is the configuration bitstream size, which is determined by the conflation of multitudinous design choices, from logic element configuration through to routing channel width (see Section III) – in other words, the eFPGA design space is vast .\nFrom a practical standpoint, it is crucial for designers to understand the relationships between security and other design factors. Thus, we address this gap in literature by performing an empirical study of eFPGA architecture configurations and resistance to bitstream recovery through SAT-attack as the security metric. For insights into eFPGA-based IP redaction, we adapt an open-source FPGA design flow  to produce different eFPGAs fabrics, with different configurations, and explore how eFPGA parameters affect security. Our contributions are threefold: An analysis of eFPGA architectures that can be used for redaction. We analyze PPA and security effects and explore how the parameter choices of an eFPGA fabric “contribute” to the security provided by it. A formulation of SAT-based attack for bitstream recovery of eFPGAs used for redaction and an experimental evaluation of eFPGA-based defense. Insights into the practical considerations for adopting eFPGA-based redaction and a perspective on the future outlook of this IP protection technique. In Section II, we present the hardware IP protection problem alongside prior work to tackle this issue. This is followed by an introduction to eFPGA and their architectural parameters in Section III, and architecture settings that we explore.\nSection IV details our initial attempts at eFPGA bitstream recovery, including threat model and assumptions. Section V revises our approach for eFPGA bitstream recovery, with more insights into the security of eFPGA fabrics.\nWe discuss the insights from our study in Section VI and then conclude in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Outsourcing and globalization introduce many players in the supply-chain and this presents challenges of  intellectual property block (IP) theft, reverse-engineering, and malicious manipulation [ref]1.\nConsider IC layout design files which are sent to the foundry for fabrication, malicious (or compromised) employees can access these files and reverse-engineer the function to steal the IP of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
