      "content": "Paper Title: AlphaBlock: Embodied Finetuning for Vision-Language Reasoning in Robot Manipulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning high-level cognitive capabilities in robot manipulation tasks is a critical area of research in robotics [ref]1 . These tasks pose grand challenges that require robots to understand and execute complex language instructions involving perception, reasoning and manipulation. For example, consider the task of “making a smiley face with building blocks”. To accomplish this goal, robots need to perceive and identify various building blocks, understand and infer the spatial arrangement necessary to form a smiley face, and precisely manipulate blocks to achieve the desired outcome. This task demands a combination of visual perception  , spatial reasoning , and fine-grained motor control . Moreover, the challenge lies not only in executing the physical actions but also in comprehending and interpreting the high-level language instructions provided by humans. The success of designing such cognitive robots holds tremendous potential for a wide range of applications in household robots , manufacturing , and healthcare . To address the above challenges, recent approaches have turned to using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT  or PALM  in either open or closed loops. In particular, open-loop approaches   (as shown in Figure 1(a)) utilize LLMs as offline planners to decompose high-level instructions, such as “making smiley face”, into sub-task plans like “push one block to a specific position”. They then employ off-the-shelf robot control models  7 or APIs [ref]38 for executing the actions. More recent works 4 [ref]38 close the loop to update the plan based on language-based feedback as in Figure 1(b). Compared with language-based observation which uses symbolic description (e.g., “on [red, table]” in Text2Motion 4 means a red cube is on the table), visual observation can depict more comprehensive and fine-grained spatial arrangement of different objects, and thus help to generate more accurate control signals for complex manipulation tasks. As neglecting multi-modal interaction between text-based task description and visual-based observation, existing methods miss out on opportunities to improve overall performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-modal robot control framework, to fulfill high-level cognitive tasks. This framework comprises a newly-collected robot cognitive dataset and a multi-modal plan generation model. Specifically, we name the framework CogLoop, as we aim to bridge the cognitive loop between task planning and control in manipulation tasks. To enable end-to-end training, we require high-quality data triplets consisting of 1) high-level tasks, 2) sub-task plans, and 3) action-observation pairs in robot tasks. However, the collecting process for such data is time-consuming and expensive. To address this problem, we employ a two-step approach. First, we utilize LLMs, specifically GPT-4  in our paper, with multi-round prompts to automatically generate a sequence of sub-task plans. This step significantly reduces the reliance on human involvement.\nSecond, we adopt a state-of-the-art execution model 7 to generate robot-executable actions based on sub-task plans. Such design further minimizes the need for human intervention, as it automates the generation of actions. Only minimal human efforts are required to select the correct final block layouts. The resulting dataset AlphaBlock encompasses 262626 letters and 999 fundamental layouts such as lines, triangles and smiley faces formed by building blocks. More details can be found in Section 3.2. During training, we build upon recent advancements in multimodal learning that integrate text and image modalities  1. Our proposed unified approach incorporates high-level text instructions and image observations to generate sub-task plans. To ensure accurate perception for block characters, such as color and spatial position, we design a vision adapter that extracts and merges multi-stage visual features from the ViT  model in MiniGPT-4 4. To ensure consistent embedding in LLMs, we further employ a visual Q-former 1 with a language-specific projector, to effectively align image observations with LLMs. The sub-task plans generated are then fed into an off-the-shelf execution model 7 to predict executable actions, such as offsets along x𝑥x or y𝑦y coordinates.\nBy leveraging the auto-regressive nature of the holistic framework, encompassing both plan and action generation models, we facilitate mutual reinforcement between task planning and robot behavior. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: 1) we introduce a novel robot dataset that tackles challenging high-level perception and reasoning tasks using language instructions in robotics; 2) we propose a multi-modal robot control model based on advanced multi-modal foundation models, incorporating a vision adapter specifically designed for robotics tasks; 3) we conduct extensive evaluations and demonstrate our superior performance over existing competitive robot planning methods. In summary, through seamlessly enabling robots to understand and execute high-level instructions, our framework CogLoop holds significant promise for enhancing cognitive capabilities and facilitating more intelligent interaction with the physical world.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Learning high-level cognitive capabilities in robot manipulation tasks is a critical area of research in robotics [ref]1 .
