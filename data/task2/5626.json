In this work, we are interested in feature interactions that make use of the Shapley value (SV) and its extension to Shapley interactions.\nThe SV is a concept from cooperative game theory that has been used, apart from feature attributions , as a basis for many Shapley-based explanations 1  .\nIt distinguishes itself through uniqueness given a set of intuitive axioms.\nA number of approaches extend Shapley-based explanations to feature interactions   9 [ref]40.\nYet, in contrast to the SV, a “natural” extension of the intuitive set of axioms for a unique Shapley interaction index is less clear.\nMoreover, its efficient computation is challenging and, so far, approximation approaches are specifically tailored to the particular definition. In this paper, we consider a more general class of interaction indices, known as cardinal interaction indices (CII) , which covers all currently proposed definitions and all other that satisfy the (generalized) linearity, symmetry and dummy axiom.\nWe present SHAPley Interaction Quantification (SHAP-IQ), a sampling-based unified approximation method.\nIt is substantiated by mathematical guarantees and can be applied to any CII to approximate any-order interaction scores efficiently. Our main contributions include: We consider a general form of interaction indices, known as CII (Definition 3.3) and establish a novel representation (Theorem 4.1), which we utilize to construct SHAP-IQ (Definition 4.2), an efficient sampling-based estimator.111The shapiq package extends on the well-known shap library and can be found at https://pypi.org/project/shapiq/. We show that SHAP-IQ is unbiased, consistent and provide a general approximation bound (Theorem 4.3).\nWe further prove that SHAP-IQ maintains the efficiency condition for n-Shapley Values  and the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index 9 (Theorem 4.7). For the SV, we find a novel representation (Theorem 4.4).\nWe further prove that SHAP-IQ is linked to Unbiased KernelSHAP  (Theorem 4.5) and greatly simplifies its representation. We use SHAP-IQ to compute any-order n-Shapley Values on different ML models and demonstrate that it outperforms existing baseline methods.\nWe further contrast different existing CIIs and compare SHAP-IQ to the corresponding baseline approximation method.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: 6.\nHowever, in many real-world applications, such as understanding drug-drug interactions, mutational events or complex language models, quantifying interactions between features is essential, too [ref]48 3 .\nFeature interactions provide a more comprehensive explanation, which can be seen as an enrichment of feature attributions  9 [ref]40.\nWhile feature attributions quantify the contribution\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
