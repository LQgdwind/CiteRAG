      "content": "Paper Title: 6GAN: IPv6 Multi-Pattern Target Generation via Generative Adversarial Nets with Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile in this paper we have described the effectiveness of each component in the 6GAN architecture in detail, as a target generation approach, we still want to know the superiority of 6GAN compared to other work. Since a variety of concrete instantiation has been successful on IPv6 target generation, previously measuring only on the target quantity under a limited candidate set could not provide a comprehensive evaluation of these works. We incorporate the quality of the candidate set into the perspective of judgment and present multiple metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated addresses, which could indicate the excellent performance of 6GAN compared to prior studies. 1) Baselines. The baselines in our experiments for comparison mainly contain traditional design algorithms and deep learning approaches. Traditional Design Algorithms. Entropy/IP , 6Gen , and 6Tree [ref]15 are the prior paradigms of the traditional design algorithm that have shown significant gains in target generation. Entropy/IP and 6Tree employ entropy information to construct address segments or space trees used to explore active targets, while 6Gen uses algorithmic analysis to uncover active clusters. In this paper, we use Entropy/IP and 6Tree‚Äôs open-source code and reconstruct 6Gen according to the author‚Äôs algorithm description to achieve the baselines of these works. Deep Learning Approaches. 6GCVAE [ref]16 and 6VecLM  are the recent explorations of the target generation through deep learning. 6GCVAE is the generative model using gated convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [ref]28 architecture, while 6VecLM leverages Transformer  and softmax temperature  to build the IPv6 language model for predicting address sequences. Since 6GAN is the same deep learning architecture, we use 6GCVAE and 6VecLM implemented through open-source code as the baselines for comparison to highlight the superiority of 6GAN‚Äôs neural network architecture. 2) Candidates Quality. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of target generation algorithms, we adopt four metrics to measure the quality of the candidate sets generated by all approaches. Table VII shows the evaluation results of all target generation algorithms on the IPv6 Hitlist dataset. As traditional design algorithms, 6Gen and 6Tree achieve a lower novelty and diversity quality because they enumerate the addresses in the active regions, thus less changing the nybble set. Entropy/IP and 6GCVAE keep well exploiting the new addresses while they are rarely active targets. As deep learning architecture with generative adversarial nets, 6GAN could generate creative addresses with high novelty quality. However, 6GAN forces generators to learn the addressing patterns, the generated addresses keep similar sequences in each pattern type, thus obtaining a not high diversity quality score. We think the problem could be improved by setting more pattern types kùëòk in seed classification for generator learning. Through a deep analysis in each addressing pattern, 6GAN outperforms all the baseline on the hit rate and generation rate in our experiments. To explore the robustness of 6GAN to perform target generation under different datasets, we measure target quantity and generation rate under the different sizes of the budget with 50k total seeds in the IPv6 Hitlist and CERN IPv6 2018 datasets in Figure 3. Experimental results show that 6GAN could achieve a stable performance on both the two datasets. While comparing with the state-of-the-art target generation algorithm 6Tree, 6GAN could discover 1.03-1.33 times more active addresses than 6Tree in the limited budget. In addition, 6GAN‚Äôs candidates keep different types of addressing patterns. The generators are controllable for researchers to generate specific pattern type addresses as long as training with the corresponding pattern seed data. We believe that this architecture implements a meaningful target generation work and could help more researchers chasing IPv6 addressing patterns.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: 1) Baselines.
