Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

For baselines, we utilize Gurobi  and the recent Google solver CP-SAT  for the ILP in (1), ReduMIS , iSCO111https://github.com/google-research/discs 4, and four learning-based methods: DIMES 1, DIFUSCO , LwD , and the GCN method in  (commonly referred to as ‘Intel’). We note that, following the analysis in [ref]12, GCN’s code cloning to ReduMIS is disabled, which was also done in . Aligned with recent SOTA methods (DIMES, DIFUSCO, and iSCO), we employ the Erdos-Renyi (ER)  graphs from 1 and the SATLIB graphs  as benchmarks. The ER dataset222https://github.com/DIMESTeam/DIMES consists of 128128128 graphs with 700700700 to 800800800 nodes and p=0.15𝑝0.15p=0.15, where p𝑝p is the probability of edge creation. The SATLIB dataset consists of 500500500 graphs (with at most 1,34713471,347 nodes and 5,97859785,978 edges). Additionally, the GNM random graph generator function of NetworkX is utilized for our scalability experiment. For 𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍\\mathsf{Quant}-𝖭𝖾𝗍𝖭𝖾𝗍\\mathsf{Net}, the edges-penalty parameter γ𝛾\\gamma is selected as 775775775. The initial learning rate is 0.60.60.6 for ER, 0.9 for SATLIB, and 0.5 for GNM. The number of iterations per initialization, T𝑇T, is set to 150150150 for ER, 505050 for SATLIB, and 350 for GNM. The exploration parameter for SDP-based and Degree-based initialization is set to η=2.25𝜂2.25\\eta=2.25. Our code333https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Quant-Net/README.md uses PyTorch  to construct the objective function in 𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍\\mathsf{Quant}-𝖭𝖾𝗍𝖭𝖾𝗍\\mathsf{Net} , and PyTorch’s implementation of Adam to optimize.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
