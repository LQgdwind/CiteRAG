      "content": "Paper Title: Incomplete Knowledge Graph Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset. We use 4 popular benchmarking datasets from [ref]2, including four datasets of two cross-lingual versions: English-French and English-German which were crawled from DBpedia (2016-2020) . The datasets have a total of 240K entities, 2438 relations, and 964543 relational triples. Each dataset consists of two versions; (v1) is the sparse version while (v2) is the dense one. Version V1 was directly obtained using the IDS algorithm [ref]43, while version V2 was created by filtering out low-degree entities and thus being denser than V1. The details of the datasets using in our experiments are shown in Table II. Baselines. We compare the performance of our techniques with 8 SOTA alignment techniques as follows: MTransE  is a transitivity-based entity alignment model which employs the translation constraint to learn the representation for each entity and relation in the input KGs using a shallow embedding model. JAPE  is a shallow embedding-based technique that generates structure embedding (using a TransE model) and attribute embedding (using a skip-gram model). The learnt embeddings are then used simultaneously to align the entities. KDcoE  leverages co-training of a KG embedding and a literal description embedding to enhance the semi-supervised learning of multilingual KG embeddings. The KG embedding model jointly trains a translation model with a linear-transformation-based alignment, while the description embedding model employs an attentive GRU encoder (AGRU) to characterize multilingual entity descriptions. GCNAlign [ref]11 is a deep embedding-based technique that employs two GCNs to produce structural and attribute embeddings, which capture the relational and attribute information of the entities. Both embeddings are then used to discover corresponding entities via an alignment seed set [ref]11. BootEA  is a shallow embedding-based technique that generates entity and relation embeddings using translation constraint like MTransE. The model then reconciles the learnt embeddings using alignment seeds, followed by an alignment editing step to reduce the accumulated errors . MultiKE  is an embedding-based framework that unifies multiple views of entities to learn embeddings for entity alignment. The model implements three representative views corresponding to name, relation and attribute features, respectively; then entity\nalignment are retrieved by combining the learnt embeddings in three different strategies. RDGCN  is a deep embedding-based technique that employs a two-layers GCN with highway gates to capture the attentive interaction between each KG and its dual relation. The embeddings are then compared directly to obtain the alignment result . Alinet  is a deep embedding-based technique that leverages entities’ distant neighbours to preprocess the input KGs and expand their neighbour overlapping. The technique then forwards the processed inputs through an attention-based GNN which controls the aggregation of both direct and distant neighborhood information using a gating mechanism. Evaluation metrics.\nIn our experiments, we consider alignment direction from left to right following the setting defined in [ref]2. We use Hit@m𝑚m (m=1,10𝑚110m=1,10) to measure the prediction ability of the techniques based on how accurately true positive alignments are observed in the top-k candidates . Suppose 𝕃​(p)∈𝒱t𝕃𝑝subscript𝒱𝑡\\mathbb{L}(p)\\in\\mathcal{V}_{t} is the counterpart of entity p∈𝒱s𝑝subscript𝒱𝑠p\\in\\mathcal{V}_{s}: where 𝟙h​y​p​o=1subscript1ℎ𝑦𝑝𝑜1\\mathds{1}_{hypo}=1 if h​y​p​oℎ𝑦𝑝𝑜hypo is true, and 𝟙h​y​p​o=0subscript1ℎ𝑦𝑝𝑜0\\mathds{1}_{hypo}=0 if h​y​p​oℎ𝑦𝑝𝑜hypo is false. We also use Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Mean Rank (MR) under pair-wise setting to measure how high the true anchored links are ranked in the list of alignment candidates: where t​r𝑡𝑟tr is the rank of the matched score of the true target. MR and MRR metrics measure how the models perform at soft alignment scenarios where most of the true target entities have high similarity with the source entities. Hyper-parameter setting.\nOur multi-channel model requires in total of 16 hyperparameters, which is reported in Table III for reproducibility. Computational environment.\nThe experiments were averaged over 50 runs for each dataset to mitigate the effect of randomness. We used an AMD Ryzen ThreadRipper 3.8 GHz system with 64 GB RAM and four GTX Titan X graphic cards. We implemented our model in Python with Pytorch library.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Dataset.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
