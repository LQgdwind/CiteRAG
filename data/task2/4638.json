      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Statistical Model Checking for Multi-agent Systems using HyperPCTL*\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFormal verification of software systems that interact with physical environments as in cyber-physical systems, has gained significant importance in recent years owing to the safety-criticality of these systems.\nProbabilistic and stochastic models have been proven to be useful tools in modeling the uncertainty inherent in the interactions with the environment.\nIn particular, discrete-time Markov chains are a simple, yet widely applicable, class of probabilistic systems that capture uncertainties using transition probabilities.\nCorrectness specifications of these systems need to incorporate the probabilistic aspects and are often captured using probabilistic logics.\nFor example, uncertain behaviour of a car driver has been modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) , and several behavioral properties of the driver are encoded using the Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). Further, a robot performing random walk on a grid has been modeled using DTMC [ref]2, and properties like probabilistic goal reaching have been encoded using Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL). Traditional logics focus on properties about single execution traces of a system.\nWhile several interesting properties can be captured using single-trace logics, they fall short in capturing interactive behaviors between multiple agents.\nHyperproperties are a new class of properties [ref]3 [ref]4 that capture multi-trace behaviors.\nFor example, consider two robots walking on an n√ónùëõùëõn\\times n grid. The property that the two robots never collide, can only be expressed by a formula that refers to the paths of both the robots simultaneously .\nIn addition, several security properties can be easily captured using hyper-logics such as information flow  , non-interference  [ref]4 and observational determinism  . In this paper, we focus on the problem of verifying discrete-time Markov chains with respect to probabilistic hyperproperties that allow us to specify constraints on joint probability of satisfaction of real-time behaviors by independent executions of a multi-agent system.\nWe focus on discrete-time systems and properties, however, the ideas in the paper will be foundational toward verification of these systems and properties in continuous time.\nWe consider robot navigation problems as our case studies.\nFor example, consider a two robot navigation scenario on a grid, wherein we desire to ensure an upper bound on the collision probability.\nSuch properties can be easily specified using probabilistic hyperproperty logics such as HyperPCTL*, which is an\nexpressive hyperproperty logic that allows nesting of both temporal and probabilistic operators (see 0).\nThus, it has found its use in formal specification of probabilistic hyperproperties of cyber-physical and robotic systems 0.\nSeveral quantitative extensions of information security properties have been captured using HyperPCTL* such as\nqualitative information flow 1, probabilistic non-interference 2 and differential privacy 3. Probabilistic model-checkers such as PRISM 4 and STORM 5 verify probabilistic systems with respect to probabilistic properties.\nWhile probabilistic model-checking performs reasonably well for single trace properties, even in the non-probabilistic setting, model-checking hyperproperties is a challenging task 6.\nHence, light-weight verification methods based on sampling, such as statistical model-checking 7 0 have been explored. Statistical Model-Checking (SMC) 8 9          is an alternative sampling based method to verify satisfiability of the specification.\nMore precisely, SMC algorithms collect a sample of execution paths from the system and determine the satisfiability of the property based on a statistic computed using the satisfiability of these sample execution paths.\nSMC scales extremely well for complex systems, however, it does not provide exact inference, rather, incurs Type-I and Type-II errors which correspond to the probability that, the test concludes that the system violates the property when indeed it is satisfied, and the probability that, the test concludes that the system satisfies the property when actually it is violated, respectively.\nSMC for probabilistic hyperproperties has been discussed in 7 0, where sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) has been used.\nThese algorithms fall into the frequentist regime where the parameter is assumed to be fixed but unknown.\nIn this paper, we explore an alternative approach based on Bayesian hypothesis testing which incorporates prior information about the parameters in the form of their distributions.\nWe present a Bayesian SMC algorithm based on Bayes‚Äô test that takes as input Type-I and Type-II error bounds and provides corresponding guarantees on the inference of the satisfiability. SMC of probabilistic hyperproperties specified in HyperPCTL* is challenging due to two reasons: HyperPCTL* in interpreted over multiple traces and the probabilistic operators are nested.\nTo address the multi-trace setting, we present a multi-dimensional hypothesis testing and incorporate that within a recursive algorithm to tackle the nesting in probabilistic operators.\nOur broad approach to verifying a HyperPCTL* formula œÜùúë\\varphi is a bottom up algorithm similar to classical CTL model-checking  , wherein we verify the bottom level probabilistic operators and work our way upwards using the results from the verification of the subformulae.\nSince, SMC only returns the correct answers with certain confidence, this error needs to be factored into the SMC procedures for top level formulae.\nWe tackle this by designing a modified Bayes‚Äô test that uses a statistic computed from these approximately correct answers.\nWhile such a framework has been developed in the single trace setting¬†[ref]2, the main contribution of the paper is the careful incorporation of multi-dimensional Bayesian hypothesis testing into the recursive framework by establishing appropriate bounds on the confidence of lower level multi-dimensional SMC calls. We have implemented our algorithm in a Python toolbox HyProVer and tested it on a series of robot navigation scenarios in the grid world setting (see Section V).\nThough the algorithm is written in a bottom-up fashion, we have implemented an efficient top-down approach, wherein lower level SMC calls are made only on a need-by basis, thereby avoiding an exhaustive computation of lower level SMC calls.\nWe also implemented the SPRT approach for comparison.\nWe observed that, for the same level of confidence, our approach takes fewer number of samples and less time to verify both non-nested and nested HyperPCTL* formulae compared to SPRT 0 (none of the case studies discussed in 0 involved a nested probabilistic formula). Also, our approach does not need the assumption that the true probability lies outside the indifference region (for non-nested formula) and thus, is more general than SPRT. Thus, our approach is more practical for verification of general HyperPCTL* formulae.\nBayesian approaches are often criticized for their need for prior information.\nWe considered different choices for prior by considering various parameters for the Beta distribution and observed that priors effect the verification time in a minor manner.\nHowever, since SPRT does not use prior information, we used uniform prior while comparing Bayesian approach to SPRT, so that any parameter value is equally probable. To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are: A first Bayesian statistical model-checking algorithm for HyperPCTL* that combines multi-dimensional Bayesian hypothesis testing and a recursive framework for error propagation of nested probabilistic operators. A novel top-down implementation that makes lower level SMC calls on-need and consists of additional bookkeeping to avoid redundant and unnecessary computation. Experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing approaches that demonstrate the scalability and benefits of our approach. Organization: The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss related work in Section II. Some basic definitions and notations are covered in Section III. We define the model checking problem formally in Section IV. The robot navigation system grid world and two properties of it are described in Section V. In Section VI, we discuss general and multi-dimensional hypotheses testing, as well as, Bayes‚Äô test, approximate Bayes‚Äô test and sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Section VII explains the recursive Bayesian SMC algorithm and compares its approach with that of SPRT based SMC 0. In Section VIII, we evaluate our algorithm on the case study discussed in Section V. Finally, we conclude in Section IX.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: , and several behavioral properties of the driver are encoded using the Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL).
