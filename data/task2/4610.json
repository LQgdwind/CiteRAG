      "content": "Paper Title: A Subquadratic 𝑛^𝜀-approximation for the Continuous Fréchet Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMeasuring similarity is a fundamental data analysis task which is used, for example, to cluster data, search in databases, or construct phylogenetic trees. The similarity of two geometric shapes is generally defined via distance measures. Common distance measures are the Hausdorff distance, the area of symmetric difference, and the Fréchet distance. While the Hausdorff distance is defined for any two compact subsets of a space, the area of symmetric difference applies only to simple polygons in the plane. The Fréchet distance is most easily defined for curves, although generalizations to surfaces exist. Since the Fréchet distance respects the order along the two input curves, it is generally the measure of choice to determine the similarity of two curves. Godau 5 presented the first polynomial time algorithm for computing the continuous Fréchet distance.\nThe algorithm runs in O​((m​n2+m2​n)​log⁡m​n)𝑂𝑚superscript𝑛2superscript𝑚2𝑛𝑚𝑛O((mn^{2}+m^{2}n)\\log mn) time, and was later improved by Alt and Godau  into an algorithm with running time O​(m​n​log⁡m​n)𝑂𝑚𝑛𝑚𝑛O(mn\\log mn).\nBoth algorithms rely on an efficient solution for the decision variant of the problem, and then using parametric search  to solve the optimization problem.\nAround the same time, the discrete version of the problem was studied by Eiter and Mannila , who give an O​(m​n)𝑂𝑚𝑛O(mn) time algorithm. Under the word RAM model of computation, these results have since been improved.\nAgarwal et al.  gave an O​(m​n​log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n)𝑂𝑚𝑛𝑛𝑛O(mn\\log\\log n/\\log n) time algorithm for the discrete problem, and Buchin et al. [ref]7 improved the complexity bound for the continuous problem to O​(m​n​(log⁡log⁡n)2)𝑂𝑚𝑛superscript𝑛2O(mn(\\log\\log n)^{2}).\nUnfortunately, there is little hope of improving these results further, at least significantly, as Bringmann  showed that a strongly subquadratic (i.e., (m​n)1−Ω​(1)superscript𝑚𝑛1Ω1(mn)^{1-\\Omega(1)}) time algorithm would refute the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). The main focus has hence been on efficient approximation algorithms and on specific classes of curves.\nAronov et al. [ref]3 studied the discrete Fréchet distance between κ𝜅\\kappa-bounded curves and backbone curves, which model some “realistic” families of curves.\nThey give a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm running in strongly subquadratic time.\nLater on, Driemel et al. 2 gave efficient (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithms for computing the continuous Fréchet distance between various realistic curves.\nThese families of curves again include κ𝜅\\kappa-bounded curves, but also c𝑐c-packed curves.\nAn improved algorithm for c𝑐c-packed curves, which matches conditional lower bounds, was later given by Bringmann and Künnemann .\nGudmundsson et al. 6 give a d𝑑\\sqrt{d}-approximate algorithm for the case where the curves have sufficiently long edges (relative to their Fréchet distance) that runs in linear time.\nThey give a near-linear time exact algorithm for this case as well. When dealing with arbitrary curves, SETH again gives conditional lower bounds.\nBringmann  not only gave a conditional lower bound for the exact problems, but also showed that a 1.0011.0011.001-approximation algorithm running in strongly subquadratic time would refute the SETH.\nThis lower bound was later improved by Buchin et al. , who prove that assuming SETH, an approximation factor of 333 is the best we can hope for, even for curves in one dimension. For computing the discrete Fréchet distance between arbitrary curves, Bringmann and Mulzer  gave an O​(α)𝑂𝛼O(\\alpha)-approximate algorithm with a running time of O​(n2/α)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝛼O(n^{2}/\\alpha), for any α∈[1,n/log⁡n]𝛼1𝑛𝑛\\alpha\\in[1,n/\\log n].\nChan and Rahmati  later gave an improved algorithm that returns an O​(α)𝑂𝛼O(\\alpha)-approximation in O​(n2/α2)𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript𝛼2O(n^{2}/\\alpha^{2}) time, for any α∈[1,n/log⁡n]𝛼1𝑛𝑛\\alpha\\in[1,\\sqrt{n/\\log n}]. Bringmann and Mulzer  also gave an approximation algorithm for the continuous problem.\nThe running time of this algorithm is linear, but the approximation ratio is exponential (i.e., 2Θ​(n)superscript2Θ𝑛2^{\\Theta(n)}).\nThis bound was improved only recently, by Colombe and Fox 0.\nThey give the best result of prior work: an O​(α)𝑂𝛼O(\\alpha)-approximate algorithm that runs in O​((n3/α2)​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛3superscript𝛼2𝑛O((n^{3}/\\alpha^{2})\\log n) time, for any α∈[n,n]𝛼𝑛𝑛\\alpha\\in[\\sqrt{n},n]. Results. We improve upon the result of Colombe and Fox 0.\nWe give an O​(α)𝑂𝛼O(\\alpha)-approximate algorithm that runs in O​((n+m​n/α)​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑚𝑛𝛼superscript3𝑛O((n+mn/\\alpha)\\log^{3}n) time, for any α∈[1,n]𝛼1𝑛\\alpha\\in[1,n], if the dimension d𝑑d of the input curves is constant. After introducing the necessary preliminaries in Section 1.1, we present an outline of both our algorithm and the paper in Section 1.2. Section 2 then presents our algorithm in detail; the technical Sections 3 and 4 contain further details for the two major subroutines used by our algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: model of computation, these results have since been improved.\nAgarwal et al.  gave an O​(m​n​log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n)𝑂𝑚𝑛𝑛𝑛O(mn\\log\\log n/\\log n) time algorithm for the discrete problem, and Buchin et al. [ref]7 improved the complexity bound for the continuous problem to O​(m​n​(log⁡log⁡n)2)𝑂𝑚𝑛superscript𝑛2O(mn(\\log\\log n)^{2}).\nUnfortunately, there is little hope of improving these results further,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
