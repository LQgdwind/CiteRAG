      "content": "Paper Title: A Distributed Model-Free Ride-Sharing Approach for Joint Matching, Pricing, and Dispatching using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDynamic Matching and Route-Planning:\nThe assignment problem in urban transportation has been widely studied in literature. However, the majority of articles focus on static and deterministic Dial-A-Ride Problems (DARP)s with a homogeneous fleet of vehicles without pooling (e.g., ); or on quantifying the system efficiency with a model-based approach . But as concluded in , Dynamic and Stochastic DARPs appear to be the most challenging, which is the focus of our paper. In , the authors provide a review of optimization approaches in dynamic ride-sharing; whereas, the notion of shareability network is introduced in . However, many of the approaches in literature limit their attention to variants of static ride-sharing, where it is assumed that all driver and rider requests are known prior to the execution of a matching process  . However, these approaches are based on one-to-one matching and don‚Äôt address dynamic route-planning where new ride requests can be served by a vehicle that might be already assigned a trip as long as it still has vacant seats.\nIn recent years, dynamic ride-sharing started to gain attention (e.g, ). Some articles deal with this planning uncertainty by using a rolling horizon solution approach  . These approaches are not always applicable in real-time due to the need for frequent re-optimizations. To minimize this frequncy, the authors in  commit the arrangement as late as possible given the time considerations. However, neither drivers‚Äô nor customers‚Äô preferences are accommodated in the decision-making process. In , the authors model the allocation problem as bipartite matching and address the drivers‚Äô scheduling problem by proposing a heuristic nearest neighbor algorithm. The algorithm in  generates optimal routes using constrained optimization. However, both are still one-to-one approaches that do not take into consideration which rides to group together. Some approaches consider Tabu search and heuristic algorithms for a robust optimization . However, RL is proven to reach near-optimal solutions that outperform metaheuristic algorithms , especially on large scale problems like ours. To further improve the matching,  proposes mT-share that fully exploits both real-time and historical mobility information of taxis and ride requests. \nAn essential issue in realizing shared mobility in online ride-sharing settings is route planning, which has been proven to be an NP-hard problem 0 1. Route planning - given a set of vehicles VùëâV, and requests RùëÖR - designs a route that consists of a sequence of pickup and drop-off locations of requests assigned to each vehicle. In ride-sharing environments, vehicles and requests arrive dynamically and are arranged such that they meet different objectives (e.g., maximizing the fleet‚Äôs profits 2 ). Utilizing an operation called insertion to solve such a highly dynamic problem has been proven, in literature, to be both effective and efficient 3 4 5 6  . The insertion operation aims to accommodate the newly arriving request by inserting its pickup (origin) and its drop-off (destination) locations into a vehicle‚Äôs route. Most of the approximation algorithms that provide solutions to the route planning problem are limited to only two requests per vehicle 0 1. In 1, the authors improve the effectiveness of route planning for shared mobility by considering the near-future demand, thus overcoming the short-sightedness problem of the insertion operator. However, their approach is still limited to only two rides per vehicle. Most approaches in literature don‚Äôt enforce constraints on which rides can be grouped together, which may result in grouping rides whose destinations are in opposite directions; thus resulting in large detours (boosting the travel distance as well as fuel and energy consumption per vehicle). Therefore, a robust framework is essential to achieve a dynamic and demand-aware matching framework that optimizes for the overall fleet‚Äôs objectives. Finally, the overall problem for ride-sharing requires interconnected decisions of matching, pricing, and dispatching, and is the focus of this paper. \nIn this paper, we present a dynamic, demand-aware, and pricing-based vehicle-passenger matching and route-planning framework that scales up to accommodate more than two rides per vehicle (up to the maximum capacity of the vehicle) in the initial assignment phase followed by an optimization phase. Thus, our matching satisfies the platform-related set of constraints (described in Section III). By incorporating a pricing strategy into our framework, we enforce grouping together rides with significant path-intersections. Joint Pricing and Matching:\nRegarding the pricing problem, there are various ways to divide the trip costs among the rideshare partners  7 . However, none of the works in literature combine pricing with matching, they study them as two separate problems. However, grouping requests together greatly affects the pricing decisions and vice-versa. Ascertaining grouping together requests that are not going in opposite directions has not been addressed in literature. Most works in literature assume that vehicles are told which passengers go together, by taking near-by pickup locations together (e.g., 8 9) and thus are at the risk of grouping rides going in opposite directions. In this paper, we approach the pricing-based ride-sharing problem through a model-free technique for ride-sharing with ride-pooling. In contrast to the model-based approaches in literature  [ref]31  0, our proposed approach can adapt to dynamic distributions of customer and driver preferences. At the same time, we incorporate the pricing aspect to our matching algorithm which would prioritize rides with significant path-intersections to be grouped together. This provides an efficient dynamic pricing-aware matching algorithm for the ridesharing environment by managing the prices for passengers based on the distance traveled due to serving this passenger (i.e., inserting this request in the vehicle‚Äôs current route). The intuition is that the insertion cost of a request leading to an opposite direction to any of the previously inserted requests will be very high, and thus will be highly unlikely to be inserted into this specific route. If it were the only option, this high cost will cause the driver to propose a high increase in price, which will be highly likely rejected by the passenger. The only case where the passenger may accept this ride is if they are willing to tolerate both the extra cost and time delay,\nwhich would mean the customer will end up satisfied with the service whereas the driver will be compensated for the extra fuel cost incurred by the extra pay. In this manner, the matching, route planning, and pricing components work in tandem with each other to reach a common ground solution that is favorable by and profitable to both parties. In 9, the authors provided the first model-free approach for ride-sharing with pooling, DeepPool, using deep RL. However, DeepPool neither incorporates dynamic demand-aware matching with a pricing strategy, nor accommodates customers‚Äô and drivers‚Äô conveniences. It primarily focuses on dispatching idle vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that introduces a model-free approach for a distributed joint matching, pricing, and dispatching where customers and drivers can weigh in their ride preferences, influencing the decision making of ride-sharing platforms.\nRidesharing Dispatch:\nWe note that the vehicle dispatching problem  9  has also been referred to as repositioning   or rebalancing , of vehicles, in literature.\nMany of the studies on optimal taxi dispatching address the problem as either a variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP)  or the bipartite graph matching problem   . Under the VRP formulation, each taxi is assigned to sequentially pick up a number of passengers and under the bipartite graph formulation, each taxi is matched with the closest passenger in its vicinity. However, neither of these approaches consider which ride requests to group together, they can potentially end up assigning requests with opposite-direction-destinations to the same vehicle. To handle dynamic traffic conditions,  utilizes the observed average speed and updates every 10 seconds, while  builds on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) concept. In , authors provide a network-based solution to determine the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve all the trips. However, they do not account for any other drivers‚Äô or passengers‚Äô preferences. In this paper, we devise a DQN reward function that accounts for passenger-specific as well as driver-specific objectives. We utilize the dispatch of idle vehicles using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework as in 9. The goal of our approach is to influence the customer and vehicle utility functions, utilizing an optimal dispatching framework, to (i) achieve convenient pricing and matching decisions, (ii) optimize vehicles‚Äô route planning (iii) re-position idle vehicles to areas of predicted high demand. Depending on the DQN, the pricing decisions are made where drivers can propose an additional price if the passenger‚Äôs destination location is that of a predicted low demand (i.e., future reward) as explained in Section IV-B. Further, the DQN takes into account the profits of the vehicles (as part of its objective function) and thus is affected by both the pricing and matching decisions. Therefore, the three components of pricing, matching, and dispatching influence each other, and are tightly coupled.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: In this paper, we approach the pricing-based ride-sharing problem through a model-free technique for ride-sharing with ride-pooling.
