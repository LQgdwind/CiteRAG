      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Learning in Grey Spatiotemporal Systems: A Prophet to Non-consecutive Spatiotemporal Dynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the explosion of intelligent sensing devices in cities, spatiotemporal learning, which aims at supporting various smart city applications including intelligent transportation  , smart grid [ref]3  as well as weather forecasting  [ref]6, has become a pivotal technique for modern cities. Generally, traditional spatiotemporal forecasting tasks mostly assume that the information of urban systems is fully obtained, and data integrity has become an essential condition of the success of those traditional methods. However, in real-scenarios, nature to us is not black or white, which means precise information of urban systems is totally missed or obtained. Instead of being black or white, urban systems are usually grey, i.e., with incomplete information, and this may be an inevitable obstacle of achieving various smart city applications. Specifically, there are two possible scenarios: i) The pre-scheduling of individual urban trips for vital personal events and pre-control of citywide traffics for important urban activities take the possible urban perceptions of some day or even weeks in the future as a prerequisite; ii) With the ever-expanding deployment of urban sensors, the probability of sensing failures increases correspondingly, and this will definitely brings more gaps to urban sensing datasets in temporal perspective. These two scenarios both point to a new unresolved issue, spatiotemporal forecasting with fragments of unobserved sequential information, i.e., non-consecutive spatiotemporal prediction, towards a more robust urban learning system. To this end, as illustrated in Figure 1, we define that urban spatiotemporal systems with fragment of observation missing as Grey Spatiotemporal System (G2S). Considering that an inherent property of grey spatiotemporal systems is the incompleteness of data, a key issue is how to advance traditional next-step prediction to non-consecutive prediction by discovering urban regularities and disentangling potential urban structures under limited data. Challenges. Given the conflict between the requirement of traditional spatiotemporal learning methods on data integrity and the existence of continuous data gaps, the main challenges of non-consecutive spatiotemporal prediction can be summarized from the following two aspects. (1) Unavailability of nearest historical observations. Due to the closeness property of spatiotemporal observations, existing prediction methods in white urban systems directly involve the observations of nearest steps as features for training, hence accurately capturing the status evolutions towards the near future  [ref]8  . Generally, regarding traditional prediction methods, the length of time interval determines the width of the gap between two consecutive statuses, and eventually the final prediction accuracy. Therefore, the nearest statuses play a significant role in forecasting as they can provide key informative knowledge for status estimations on following consecutive steps. Even for those sparse spatiotemporal learning efforts where sensors are sparsely deployed in spatial domain, researchers can still take the status of spatially neighboring sensors as proxy 0 or generate real-time data with well-designed discriminators 1. Unfortunately, based on above analysis, these solutions are actually an interpolation strategy that takes great advantage of nearest observations in both temporal and spatial perspectives, and are incapable of dealing with the serial observation missing issue in our task. (2) Uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Considering scenarios of non-consecutive predictions, i.e., pre-arrangements of both crucial urban activities and vital individual travels, they are both sensitive and intolerable to significant uncertainty. But unfortunately, the data incompleteness is intrinsic for grey systems, leading to the inevitability and major concern of serious uncertainty issue in grey systems and their applications.\nOn the other hand, previous literature reveals that uncertainty in a learning system can be decomposed into epistemic and aleatoric. The epistemic one accounts for the insufficiency degree of knowledge that model learned from samples, while the aleatoric one characterizes the variations induced by inherent noise and unobservable factors 2. Identifying these two kinds of uncertainties not only helps understand the credibility of model outputs 3, but also can potentially moderate sample distributions and increase the anti-noise capacity with respective epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. However, pioneering works of spatiotemporal learning with uncertainty quantification  4 5 6 are mostly modified from classification tasks and fail to explicitly disentangle two types of uncertainty. Therefore, how to provide responsible predictions with effective uncertainty measurements and explicitly disentangling two types of uncertainty is another main challenge in grey system learning and understanding. Present works. In this paper, we aim to perform responsible learning in grey spatiotemporal systems by considering two non-consecutive forecasting settings, which simultaneously presents point predictions and uncertainty estimations. To this end, we propose a novel solution, Factor Decoupled Graph Learning framework for Grey Spatiotemporal System (FDG2S), integrating a Factor-Decoupled Graph Sequence Learning (FoDGSL) and a DisEntangled Uncertainty Quantification (DisEUQ) by factor decoupling strategies.\nIn FoDGSL, to address the unavailability of nearest historical observations, we progressively decouple multi-level factors and enable a dynamically learnable aggregation to vicariously estimate the statuses of future spatiotemporal elements. First, the contributors of target predictions are decomposed into endogenous historical observations and exogenous context factors. For historical observations, we devise a generic semantic-neighboring sequence sampling to retrieve representative sequences of periodical regularity and instantaneous variations for pattern extraction in training models. To perform customized aggregations and enable predictions of future intervals, we resort to exogenous factors as a status proxy and turn the predictions of non-consecutive future status into inferring status with combined expected exogenous factors. Specifically, by leveraging conditional random fields, factor-decoupled aggregation is proposed to decouple factor-induced intensity and region-wise aggregations by two energy functions. Further, we disentangle influences of different exogenous factors on region-wise aggregations and learn to re-aggregate, enabling the non-consecutive predictions conditioned on arbitrary combinations of exogenous factors. To disentangle the biases regarding two types of uncertainty and boost G2S robustness, a DisEUQ is proposed by considering factors of model, sample and context. In DisEUQ, a post-explained sample density prober estimates the epistemic uncertainty from sample-specific variances. By re-utilizing and organizing exogenous factors, our weak-supervised aleatoric variation learner can infer the aleatoric uncertainty and suppress the effects of outlier samples, providing responsible predictions and grey system understanding. In summary, the following contributions are made in this work. Novel data organizations. To remedy lacking observations, a semantic-neighboring sequence sampling with factor-aware constraints is proposed to perform personalized sampling of inherent periodicity and instantaneous variations. We also take exogenous factors as an intermediate proxy, and reorganize main observations by the types of exogenous factors to further achieve pluggable factor-wise combinations and factor-induced variations for future target estimations. FoDGSL hierarchically disentangles multi-level factors\nto enable dynamic aggregations conditioned on arbitrary factor-wise combinations. We design a sampling strategy to retrieve representative sequences, a factor-decoupled aggregation to jointly disentangle complicated factor influences on aggregations and couple both endogenous and exogenous factors into a unified graph sequence learning architecture. Finally, the LSTM captures the sequential evolution for achieving longer-horizon predictions. DisEUQ is proposed to identify two sources of uncertainty and alleviate their negative influences. A post-explained sample density prober is devised to explore the epistemic uncertainty regarding learning experiences, while an intrinsic aleatoric variation learner is to quantify aleatoric uncertainty and suppress effects of outliers.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: With the explosion of intelligent sensing devices in cities, spatiotemporal learning, which aims at supporting various smart city applications including intelligent transportation  , smart grid [ref]3  as well as weather forecasting  [ref]6, has become a pivotal technique for modern cities.
