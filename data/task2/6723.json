      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning-based Non-Autoregressive Solver for Traveling Salesman Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the recent advancements in deep learning, numerous NN-based models have been proposed to solve TSPs. These models can be generally categorized into AR or NAR according to their model decoding methods, and SL or RL according to their model training methods. It is worth noting that we focus on end-to-end learning methods for solving TSPs, and exclude neural improvement algorithms that combine deep learning and heuristic search because they typically have longer inference latency . In Table¬†I, we provide an overview of the difference between the existing end-to-end NN-based models and our work. In the remainder of this subsection, we first review the pioneering NN-based approaches used to solve TSPs, which adopt AR decoding and SL. Vinyals et al.  proposed a sequence-to-sequence SL model named Pointer Network¬†(PtrNet), which utilizes the Long Short-Term Memory¬†(LSTM) architecture commonly used in natural language processing  for solving TSPs. PtrNet takes node coordinates as its input, employs the attention mechanism and generates TSP solutions step-by-step, using the optimal solutions produced by Concorde as the ground-truth labels. While PtrNet provides a novel perspective for solving combinatorial optimization¬†(CO) problems, its unsatisfactory performance and high cost of label production make it challenging to be applied in practical settings  . Compared to SL models, which require optimal solutions at each step during training, RL is a more elegant alternative in the absence of ground-truth labels. Moreover, RL has demonstrated robust learning and optimized decision-making ability in AlphaGo Zero  and Atari . Thus, majority existing AR approaches use RL for training, lifting the prerequisite of optimal solutions. For instance, Bello et al.  expanded PtrNet using the actor-critic RL algorithm, making it possible to train models without using the optimal solutions. Nazari et al.  further enhanced PtrNet‚Äôs performance by replacing the LSTM architecture of the encoder with an embedding of all nodes. With Transformer setting new performance records in various applications , numerous Transformer-based TSP models have been proposed, with the most promising ones being [ref]22  [ref]16. These three models adopt the same Transformer-encoder architecture but differ in the decoder architecture. Briefly speaking, when a decoder generates the probability distribution of nodes at time tùë°t, Deudon et al. [ref]22 used the node information at time t‚àí1,t‚àí2,t‚àí3ùë°1ùë°2ùë°3t-1,t-2,t-3 as the input; Kool et al.  used the node information at time 1,t‚àí11ùë°11,t-1 as the input; and Bresson and Laurent [ref]16 used the fusion of all previously output node information as the input, all of which demonstrated superior performance. However, the type of step-by-step solution generation method used by AR models has a natural disadvantage in terms of inference speed when compared to the NAR approaches . Additionally, due to the sequential nature of AR models, beam search suffers from diminishing returns with respect to the beam size and shows limited search parallelism . To address these issues, several NAR models have been developed to improve the inference speed when solving TSPs  [ref]12. These models regard TSP as a link prediction problem that has been studied in various relevant research fields   . They use SL to train their models to estimate the importance of each edge belonging to the optimal solution. For instance, Nowak et al. [ref]12 utilized a GNN-based TSP solver trained with SL. The model takes a TSP instance as a graph for model input and directly outputs a heat map that represents the importance of edges. It is worth noting that during training, the model relaxes the sequential constraint of TSP to obtain the edge‚Äôs importance by minimizing the binary cross-entropy loss between the adjacency matrix corresponding to the optimal solution and the heat map. While during inference, the model imposes such constraints by using greedy search or beam search on the heat map to obtain a feasible TSP solution. Subsequently, Joshi et al.  replaced the architecture of the aforementioned model [ref]12 with a graph convolutional network¬†(GCN), which achieved better performance. Despite the significant improvement in inference speed offered by NAR approaches, the solution quality of these models is often suboptimal [ref]12 . In fact, existing NAR models generally fail to outperform most of the afore-reviewed AR models  . As such, we deem there is a pressing need to improve the existing models further to achieve high-quality solutions with low inference latency.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: an embedding of all nodes.
