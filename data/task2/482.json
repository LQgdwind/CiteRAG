      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Adversarial Koopman Model for Reaction-Diffusion Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo overcome the challenges in evaluating accurate g𝑔g and g−1superscript𝑔1g^{-1} functions, recent research works have addressed this with the use\nof emerging Deep Learning algorithms combined with large data sets [ref]13 [ref]15 [ref]16 and have demonstrated\ngood success for a variety of real world problems. Specifically, an autoencoder  is used to represent the functions g𝑔g and g−1superscript𝑔1g^{-1}.\nThe autoencoder comprises of two neural networks, an\nencoder to approximate the function g𝑔g, and a decoder to approximate g−1superscript𝑔1g^{-1}. The use of neural networks\nis a natural choice to represent complex functions as they are universal function approximators  .\nIn this setting, an input data xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} is mapped to the\nembedding space ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t} via the encoder as zt=g​(xt)subscript𝑧𝑡𝑔subscript𝑥𝑡z_{t}=g(x_{t}), which is then mapped through the decoder to obtain\na reconstruction of the original data point as xt^=g−1​(zt)^subscript𝑥𝑡superscript𝑔1subscript𝑧𝑡\\widehat{x_{t}}=g^{-1}(z_{t}). We represent the dimensionality as\nx∈ℛN𝑥superscriptℛ𝑁x\\in\\mathcal{R}^{N} and z∈ℛM𝑧superscriptℛ𝑀z\\in\\mathcal{R}^{M}, with M≪Nmuch-less-than𝑀𝑁M\\ll N.\nThe autoencoder mappings can be\nmathematically represented as g:ℛN→ℛM:𝑔→superscriptℛ𝑁superscriptℛ𝑀g:\\mathcal{R}^{N}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{R}^{M} and g−1:ℛM→ℛN:superscript𝑔1→superscriptℛ𝑀superscriptℛ𝑁g^{-1}:\\mathcal{R}^{M}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{R}^{N}.\nFor evolving the system dynamics in time, the analysis is extended as follows. Consider time snapshots of the system x1:T+1subscript𝑥:1𝑇1x_{1:T+1} and the matrices X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y\nintroduced in Eqn. (3). These snapshots are fed into the encoder g𝑔g to obtain latent embeddings Z=[z1,z2,⋯,zT+1]𝑍subscript𝑧1subscript𝑧2⋯subscript𝑧𝑇1Z=[z_{1},z_{2},\\cdots,z_{T+1}], which can\nbe written in a form similar to Eqn. (3), albeit in the latent embedding space: In [ref]13 [ref]16 least squares fit were undertaken to evaluate an K𝐾K-matrix that can propagate the latent embeddings in time as\nK=Z+1​Z†𝐾subscript𝑍1superscript𝑍†K=Z_{+1}Z^{\\dagger}. Subsequently, Z𝑍Z and the propagated state embeddings advanced in time, Z+1predsuperscriptsubscript𝑍1predZ_{+1}^{\\mathrm{pred}}, are\nfed into a decoder g−1superscript𝑔1g^{-1} to obtain the reconstructed X^^𝑋\\widehat{X} and the time advanced solution Y^^𝑌\\widehat{Y}.\nThe Deep Koopman model is trained to minimize the loss [ref]13 [ref]16: Here, the first term in the loss function enforces the autoencoder constraint that the decoded output is approximately close to the input.\nThe second term in the loss function ensures that the system dynamics’ time evolution is captured. In [ref]13, the time advanced latent embedings were evaluated as Z+1pred=K​Zsuperscriptsubscript𝑍1pred𝐾𝑍Z_{+1}^{\\mathrm{pred}}=K\\,Z, i.e., by\nadvancing the dynamics by one time step for each snapshot.\nThis, however, may not be very accurate at test time when one must predict the state of the system over a long time duration.\nTo overcome this problem, a second variant was proposed in [ref]16 where Z+1predsuperscriptsubscript𝑍1predZ_{+1}^{\\mathrm{pred}} was evaluated by applying the\nK𝐾K-matrix recursively from the embedding of the first time step snapshot, i.e., g​(x1)𝑔subscript𝑥1g(x_{1}).\n(Note that [ref]16 used the symbol A𝐴A for the matrix, which we rename as K𝐾K to refer to the Koopman matrix.)\nSpecifically, in this second variant [ref]16: (Note that KTsuperscript𝐾𝑇K^{T} is K𝐾K raised to the power of T𝑇T and not the transpose.) The authors of [ref]16 used time sequences of 32 and demonstrated lower\nerrors vis-à-vis the one time step dynamical advancement version (i.e., [ref]13) for the\nvon Karman vortex shedding problem  . In a third variant, [ref]15 also considered other\nlosses, including a loss in the embedding space: ‖Z+1pred−Z+1‖2superscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript𝑍1predsubscript𝑍12\\parallel Z_{+1}^{\\mathrm{pred}}-Z_{+1}\\parallel^{2} with Z+1predsuperscriptsubscript𝑍1predZ_{+1}^{\\mathrm{pred}} obtained as shown in\nEqn. (8), and also L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} losses to penalize the data point with the largest loss. We will now summarize the Deep Adversarial Koopman model.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: challenges in evaluating accurate g𝑔g and g−1superscript𝑔1g^{-1} functions, recent research works have addressed this with the use\nof emerging Deep Learning algorithms combined with large data sets [ref]13 [ref]15 [ref]16 and have demonstrated\ngood success for a variety of real world problems.
