      "content": "Paper Title: Near Tight Shortest Paths in the Hybrid Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe oracle 𝒪Eulersuperscript𝒪Euler\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{Euler}} solves the 𝖤𝗎𝗅𝖾𝗋𝗂𝖺𝗇𝖤𝗎𝗅𝖾𝗋𝗂𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Eulerian}-𝖮𝗋𝗂𝖾𝗇𝗍𝖺𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖮𝗋𝗂𝖾𝗇𝗍𝖺𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{Orientation} problem on certain Eulerian graphs H𝐻H (i.e., graphs containing an Eulerian cycle), which requires that all edges are oriented such that in- and out-degree of each node are equal.\nMore specifically, the requirements towards the oracle 𝒪Eulersuperscript𝒪Euler\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{Euler}} in conjunction with the input graph G𝐺G (the one which we want to solve SSSP on) are as follows. Let H𝐻H be an Eulerian graph that is a sub-graph of some H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}, where H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} is obtained by adding at most O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) arbitrarily connected “virtual” nodes to G𝐺G. Virtual edges, i.e., edges incident to at least one virtual node, are given in distributed form: an edge between a virtual and a real node is known by the latter, and edges between two virtual nodes are known by every node. Then 𝒪Eulersuperscript𝒪Euler\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{Euler}} outputs an orientation of edges of H𝐻H such that in- and out-degree of each node are equal. Our goal is to show that we can also efficiently implement a call of 𝒪Eulersuperscript𝒪Euler\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{Euler}} in 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID}. Our goal is to re-purpose the PRAM-model algorithm by [ref]9 for this task. The 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} model assumes multiple processors and a shared memory containing the input. Processors can write or read a memory cell in each step subject to some restrictions. Each cell may contain a real value but in the SSSP problem with polynomially bounded, integer weights, O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) bits per cell suffice.\nThe performance of a 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} algorithm is measured in the total number of processing steps N𝑁N (work) and the marginal number of required parallel steps T𝑇T (depth) if an arbitrary number of processors can be used. In the exclusive read, exclusive write variant (EREW) each memory cell can be read or written by at most one processor in each step. Since the memory is the only means by which processors can exchange information, intuitively, an EREW 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} algorithm that uses at most O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n) processors and memory cells can be simulated in O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) rounds via the 𝖭𝖢𝖢𝖭𝖢𝖢\\mathsf{NCC} model, where each node simulates O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) processors and cells of the shared memory and exclusive access to each cell is provided via the global network (𝖭𝖢𝖢𝖭𝖢𝖢\\mathsf{NCC} model). The simulation of 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} algorithms in 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID} requires O~​(N/n+T)~𝑂𝑁𝑛𝑇\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(N/n+T) rounds if each node has the same amount of cells to simulate. In  it is shown that the simulation of EREW 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} can also be done if the input is the local network G𝐺G, however this adds a term of O~​(a)~𝑂𝑎\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(a) to the running time, where a𝑎a is the arboricity of G𝐺G,333The arboricity of G𝐺G is defined as the smallest number of forests required to cover all edges of G𝐺G. which reflects imbalances in the number of memory cells that nodes must simulate. Note that a𝑎a can be linear in n𝑛n. Their result carries over to the concurrent read/write (CRCW) variant, which can be simulated with EREW incurring only O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) slowdown. The result of  implies the following lemma. A CRCW 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} algorithm that solves a graph problem on G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with depth T𝑇T using n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=|V| processors can be simulated in O~​(a)~𝑂𝑎\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(a) rounds in the 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID} model, w.h.p., where a𝑎a equals the arboricity of G𝐺G. We break the problem of Eulerian orientation down to sub problems with suitable properties so that in a final step we can efficiently simulate the PRAM-model algorithm by [ref]9. A call of the oracle 𝒪Eulersuperscript𝒪Euler\\,\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{Euler}} (see Definition 8) can be implemented in O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) rounds in the 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID} model. There is a CRCW 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} algorithm that solves the 𝖤𝗎𝗅𝖾𝗋𝗂𝖺𝗇𝖤𝗎𝗅𝖾𝗋𝗂𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Eulerian}-𝖮𝗋𝗂𝖾𝗇𝗍𝖺𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖮𝗋𝗂𝖾𝗇𝗍𝖺𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{Orientation} problem with linear work O~​(n+m)~𝑂𝑛𝑚\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n\\!+\\!m) (m:=|E|assign𝑚𝐸m:=|E|) and depth O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) [ref]9. Note that in the 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} simulation we can safely ignore the fact that some nodes and edges in H𝐻H are virtual (see Def. 8 for the definition of H𝐻H), because these add at most O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) nodes and O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(n) edges, which can be evenly distributed and simulated by real nodes.\nOur goal is to reduce the problem into sub-problems on sub-graphs of smaller arboricity using the local network, which admits a solution in O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) rounds simulating the 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} algorithm by [ref]9 using the simulation in 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID} (Lemma 9). The idea is to reduce the arboricity of H𝐻H by greedily orienting disjoint cycles in H𝐻H on small subgraphs in parallel, which will ultimately leave us with a remaining graph of yet unoriented edges with small arboricity. Note that by orienting disjoint cycles consistently in one direction, the remaining graph of unoriented edges retains even node degree, i.e., it still has an 𝖤𝗎𝗅𝖾𝗋𝗂𝖺𝗇𝖤𝗎𝗅𝖾𝗋𝗂𝖺𝗇\\mathsf{Eulerian}-𝖮𝗋𝗂𝖾𝗇𝗍𝖺𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖮𝗋𝗂𝖾𝗇𝗍𝖺𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{Orientation}. To identify disjoint cycles efficiently, we first compute a (χ,D)𝜒𝐷(\\chi,D)-network decomposition. This is a partition of nodes into clusters of diameter D𝐷D such that the cluster graph (where two clusters are incident if a pair of nodes from each cluster are incident) has a valid χ𝜒\\chi-coloring. A network decomposition with D,χ∈O​(log⁡n)𝐷𝜒𝑂𝑛D,\\chi\\in\\smash{O}(\\log n) can be computed in O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) rounds in the local network (𝖫𝖮𝖢𝖠𝖫𝖫𝖮𝖢𝖠𝖫\\mathsf{LOCAL}), see . However, we compute such a network decomposition not on G𝐺G, but on the power graph G2=(V,E′)superscript𝐺2𝑉superscript𝐸′G^{2}=(V,E^{\\prime}), where any two nodes in V𝑉V at distance at most 222 hops in G𝐺G share an edge in E′superscript𝐸′E^{\\prime}. Note that the round complexity is asymptotically the same as computing the network decomposition of G𝐺G, since G2superscript𝐺2G^{2} can be simulated in 222 rounds in the local network. Let C𝐶C be a cluster of the network decomposition of G2superscript𝐺2G^{2}. Since two nodes in different clusters of the same color can not be incident in G2superscript𝐺2G^{2}, the distance in the original network G𝐺G between such two nodes of must bigger than 222. Let C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} be the extended cluster of C𝐶C, defined as C𝐶C and all nodes within one hop of C𝐶C. Note, due to the aforementioned distance property any two such extended clusters of the same color are node-disjoint. For each color in [χ]delimited-[]𝜒[\\chi] and for each cluster C𝐶C with that color in parallel, all nodes in the extended cluster C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} learn C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} in D∈O​(log⁡n)𝐷𝑂𝑛D\\in\\smash{O}(\\log n) steps via the local network. This knowledge enables all nodes in C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} to consistently orient and greedily remove all cycles (w.r.t. G𝐺G) in C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime}. Note that edges that are nominally removed will still be used to communicate in C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime}. Further, we can do this for each extended cluster C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} of the current color in parallel since they do not overlap. Each extended cluster is now cycle-free, thus all edges in all extended clusters of that color can be covered by a single forest.\nSince each node is in some cluster C𝐶C of some color, both endpoints of any edge that was not removed are within some extended cluster C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime}, thus in the end all edges are covered by some forest. The number of forests a𝑎a corresponds to the number of colors χ∈O​(log⁡n)𝜒𝑂𝑛\\chi\\in\\smash{O}(\\log n). Thus the remaining graph can be oriented with the simulation of  to run the 𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬𝖯𝖱𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{PRAM} algorithm by [ref]9 in O~​(1)~𝑂1\\smash{\\widetilde{O}}(1) rounds.\n∎ We can now apply our implementation of the 𝖬𝗂𝗇𝗈𝗋𝖬𝗂𝗇𝗈𝗋\\mathsf{Minor}-𝖠𝗀𝗀𝗋𝖾𝗀𝖺𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖠𝗀𝗀𝗋𝖾𝗀𝖺𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{Aggregation} model and the oracle 𝒪Eulersuperscript𝒪Euler\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{Euler}} in 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID} to the result by , hence, Theorem 4 is proven by combining Lemma 5, Lemma 7 and Lemma 10.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: is to show that we can also efficiently implement a call of 𝒪Eulersuperscript𝒪Euler\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{Euler}} in 𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣𝖧𝖸𝖡𝖱𝖨𝖣\\mathsf{HYBRID}.
