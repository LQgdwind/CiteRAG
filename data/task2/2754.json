Incremental Domain Learning  (IDL ): Incremental domain refers to the scenario when each new task introduces changes in the marginal distribution of the inputs. This scenario has been extensively discussed in the domain adaptation literature, where this shift in domain is typically referred to as “non-stationary data distribution\" or domain shift. Overall, we aim to transfer knowledge from the old task to a new task where each task can be different in the sense of their marginal distribution. Incremental Class Learning  (ICL ): In this scenario, each task contains an exclusive subset of classes. The number of output nodes in a model equals the number of total classes in the task sequence. For instance, tasks could be constructed by using exactly one class from the MNIST data set where we aim to transfer knowledge from one class to another. Incremental Task Learning  (ITL ): In this setup, the output spaces are disjoint between tasks[ for example, the previous task can be a classification problem of five classes, while the new task can be a regression. This scenario is the most generic and allows for the tasks to be defined arbitrarily. For each tasks, a model requires task-specific identifiert𝑡t. Split-MNIST\nFor split-MNIST, the original MNIST-data set is split into five partitions where each partition is a two-way classification. We pick 60000 images for training (6000 per digit ) and 10000 images for test, i.e. (1000 per digit ). For the incremental task learning in the split-MNIST experiment, the ten digits are split into five two-class classification tasks (the model has five output heads, one for each task ) and the task identity (1 to 5 ) is given for test. For the incremental class learning setup, we require the model to make a prediction over all classes (digits 0 to 9 ). For the incremental domain learning, the model always predicts over two classes. Permuted-MNIST\nFor permuted-MNIST, we permute the pixels in the MNIST data to create tasks where each task is a ten-way classification. The three CL scenarios that are generated for the permuted-MNIST are similar to the Split-MNIST data set except for the idea that the different tasks are now generated by applying random pixel permutations to the images. For incremental task learning, we use a multi-output strategy, and each task is attached to a task identifier. For incremental domain and class, we use a single output strategy and each task as one where one of the 10 digits are predicted. In incremental class learning, for each new task 10 new classes are generated by permuting the MNIST data set. For incremental task and domain, we use a total of 10 tasks whereas for incremental classes, we generate a total of 100 tasks. Network Architecture\nWe keep our architecture identical to what is provided in [ref]19 [ref]42. The loss function is categorical cross-entropy for classification. All models were trained for 222 epochs per task with a minibatch size of 128128128 using the Adam optimizer (β1=0.9subscript𝛽10.9\\beta_{1}=0.9, β2=0.999subscript𝛽20.999\\beta_{2}=0.999, learning rate=0.001absent0.001=0.001 ) as the default. For BCL, the size of the buffer (i.e., a new task array ) 𝓓N​(k)subscript𝓓𝑁𝑘\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{D}}_{N}(k) and a task memory array (samples from all the previous tasks ) 𝓓P(k))\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{D}}_{P}(k)) is kept equivalent to naive rehearsal and other memory-driven approaches such as GEM and MER  (16,0001600016,000 samples ). Comparison Methods – Baseline Strategies\nAdditional details can be found from [ref]19 [ref]42 A sequentially-trained neural network with different optimizers such as SGD, Adam 4, and Adagrad . A standard L2−limit-fromsubscript𝐿2L_{2}-regularized neural network where each task is shown sequentially. Naive rehearsal strategy (experience replay ) where a replay buffer is initialized and data corresponding to all the previous tasks are stored. The buffer size is chosen to match the space overhead of online EWC and SI. Comparison Method-CL\nWe compared the following CL methods: EWC  / Online EWC  / SI : For these methods, a regularization term is added to the loss, with a hyperparameter used to control the regularization strength such that: L​(t​o​t​a​l)=L​(c​u​r​r​e​n​t)+λ​L​(r​e​g​u​l​a​r​i​z​a​t​i​o​n).𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐿𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝜆𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛L(total)=L(current)+\\lambda L(regularization). λ𝜆\\lambda is set through a hyperparameter. LwF  / DGR  Here, we set the loss to be L​(t​o​t​a​l)=α​L​(c​u​r​r​e​n​t)+(1​−​α)​L​(r​e​p​l​a​y)𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝛼𝐿𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡1−𝛼𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑦L(total)=\\alpha L(current)+(1−\\alpha)L(replay) where hyperparameter α𝛼\\alpha is chosen according to how many tasks have been seen by the model. For RtF [ref]42, MAS , GEM and MER, we refer to the respective publication for details. Additional details about the experiments can be found in [ref]19 as our paper retains their hyper-parameters and the experimental settings.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Much of this information is a repetition of details provided in [ref]19 [ref]42.
