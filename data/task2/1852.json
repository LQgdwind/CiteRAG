      "content": "Paper Title: MPTP: Motion-Planning-aware Task Planning for Navigation in Belief Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTMP has emerged as an active research area in the recent past, with particular focus on robot-based manipulation. Manipulation tasks are often rendered infeasible due to the end-effector’s reachability workspace. This calls for an integrated TMP approach to ensure geometric feasibility of high-level tasks. The genesis of TMP can be credited to Fikes and Nilsson for their work on STRIPS  which further led to the Shakey project . Initial works on TMP performed task planning first, synthesizing a sequence of actions to be executed later by a motion planner. Shakey’s planner performed a logical search first, assuming that the resulting robot motion plans can be formulated. This assumption limits the capability of the robot as the high-level actions may turn out to be non executable due to geometric limitations of the environment or the robot or both.  interleaves task and motion planning by checking individual high-level action feasibility using semantic attachments.  perform a combined search in the logical and geometric spaces using a state composed of both the symbolic and geometric paths. The aSyMov planner described in  adopts a combination of Metric-FF  and a sampling-based motion planner. In contrast, we use a temporal task planner, POPF-TIF  with roadmap-based sampling, incorporating robot state uncertainty. Srivastava et al. [ref]3 implicitly incorporate geometric variables, performing symbolic-geometric mapping using a planner-independent interface layer.  Erdem et al. leverage a boolean\nsatisfiability (SAT) solver, computing a task-level plan and then refining it until a feasible motion plan is found. Kaelbling and Lozano-Péres  propose a hierarchical approach that tightly integrates logical and geometric planning. The complexities arising out of long-horizon111Large environments require a robot to perform many actions to reach the goal, resulting in a long planning horizon. planning are tackled to the extent that planning is done at different levels of abstraction, thereby reducing the long-horizons to a number of feasible sub-plans of shorter horizon. This regression222Goal regression is the process of planning backwards from the goal .-based planner assumes that the actions are reversible while backtracking. This work is extended in  to consider the current state uncertainty, modeling the planning problem in the belief space.  The hierarchical approach is also employed in   to compute discrete actions with unbounded continuous variables. A geometric backtrack search is used to instantiate the symbolic actions in . They also prune certain geometric instantiations, reducing the complexity. FFRob  performs task planning by performing search over a sampled finite set of poses, grasps and configurations. The authors of  extend the FF heuristics, incorporating geometric and kinematic planning constraints that provide a tight estimate of the distance to the goal.  Our approach is similar to FFRob in the sense that we also pre-sample robot configurations and then plans with them, incorporating motion constraints. Toussaint  performs optimization over an objective function based on the final geometric configuration (and the cost thereby), finding approximately locally optimal solutions by minimizing the objective function. The planning problem is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem with symbolic states used to define the constraints in the optimization.  This logic-geometric programming is applied to a four manipulator setting in . Lozano-Péres and Kaelbling  model the motion planning as a constraint satisfaction problem over a subset of the configuration space. Iteratively Deepened Task and Motion Planning (IDTMP) is a constraint-based task planning approach that incorporates geometric information to account for the motion feasibility at the task planning level [ref]6. In our architecture, the motion costs are returned to the task planner, similar to the motion planner information that guides the IDTMP task planner. IDTMP performs task-motion interaction using abstraction and refinement functions whereas we use semantic attachments . Though the approaches discussed above fall under the category of TMP for manipulation, the scope of TMP is not limited to manipulation problems alone. TMP for navigation is pervasive in most real world scenarios.  For example, a mobile office robot may be tasked with collecting documents and delivering them across multiple floors. Yet, TMP for robot navigation has received less attention in the past. Real-world planning problems in large scale environments often require solving several sub-problems. For example, while navigating to a goal, the robot might have to visit other places of interests. Visiting these places of interest are high-level tasks that can be addressed using traditional task planners. Yet, these symbolic planners cannot compute the exact motion costs for these tasks, let alone perform navigation and path planning. This calls for task plans that are motion planning aware, in terms of motion costs and its feasibility. Task planning for robot Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) is introduced in , where each object is displace at most once throughout the plan. Van Den Berg et al.  provide a probabilistically complete algorithm for the NAMO class of problems. However, the robot state is assumed to be known perfectly. In contrast, we plan in the belief space, computing an estimate of the robot state at each instant. Hauser and Latombe   consider multi-model motion planning for manipulation and legged locomotion, wherein the space of feasible configurations consists of intersecting spaces of different dimensions. In  a TMP approach is presented in the context of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). They integrate probabilistic reasoning with symbolic reasoning by implementing a spoken dialog system, enabling the robots to ask intelligent queries. Their task planner is based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) . Jiang et al.  focus exclusively on task planning in robotics, assuming that a feasible motion plan exists for the synthesized task plan. They provide a comparison between ASP-based and PDDL-based task planners using different benchmark domains and conclude that PDDL-based planners perform better on tasks with\nlong solutions, and ASP-based planners tend to perform better on shorter tasks. In this paper, we employ a PDDL-based task planner. UP2TA  develops a unified path planning and task planning framework for mobile robot navigation. In this approach, the robot is required to perform a series of tasks at different locations before returning back to the initial location. An interesting feature of UP2TA is its task planner heuristic, which is a combination of the FF heuristic  and the Euclidean distance between the waypoints associated with locations. The path planning layer computes the optimal path between each waypoint with the help of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). Wong et al.  develop a task planning approach that takes into account the optimal traversal costs333The costs are defined in terms of mechanical work and the objective is to find the path with optimal mechanical work. For more details, refer  to . to synthesize a plan. Similar to UP2TA, they define tasks that are to be performed at different waypoints. However, the path planner pre-computes an optimal path for all pairs of waypoints, which are then passed to the task planner to find the optimal sequence of tasks. In contrast, we consider a general approach where the robot has to reason at a high-level about different objects or locations or regions to navigate to. The objects/locations/regions are instantiated to their geometric counterpart, by considering a set of sampled poses. For example, if a robot has to reach a location close to a chair, the geometric instantiations of this symbolic goal would correspond to a set of poses around the chair. Jiang et al.  introduced a framework that integrates TMP with reinforcement learning that is robust to changes in the environment. The inner loop of their dual layer architecture is a TMP planner that generates task-motion plans to be sent to the outer loop. The outer loop executes the generated plans to learn from rewards. In contrast MPTP is a purely planning approach. Lo et al.  introduced PETLON, a purely planning approach for navigation that is task-level optimal and is the work closest to our approach. The inner loop in  uses a TMP planner that is similar to PETLON. However,  in PETLON, the action costs returned by the motion planner is the trajectory length and complete observability is assumed. In contrast, our framework is more general, since we additionally consider the cost due to  motion and sensing uncertainty and the distance to the goal. It is to be noted that our approach is not limited to any particular cost function and can be easily adapted to support any general  cost formulation. In Section 5, we benchmark the scalability of our approach  and provide a comparison with PETLON by considering a motion planner that evaluates the geometric-level cost of navigation. In this way we compare MPTP to PETLON by adapting our cost function to incorporate only the geometric-level cost of traversing from one location to another.  Further, PETLON first compute a task plan using an admissible heuristic which is then sent to the motion planner for cost evaluation. This updates the heuristic and a refinement process repeats until the optimal plan is found. In contrast, MPTP evaluates the motion cost as each action is expanded by the task planner and hence the plan returned is optimal and needs no refinement.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: of Metric-FF  and a sampling-based motion planner.
