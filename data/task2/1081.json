      "content": "Paper Title: Noise2Same: Optimizing A Self-Supervised Bound for Image Denoising\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe baselines include traditional denoising algorithms (NLM , BM3D [ref]5), supervised methods (Noise2True, Noise2Noise ), and previous self-supervised methods (Noise2Void , Noise2Self [ref]1, the convolutional blind-spot neural network ). Note that we consider Noise2Noise as a supervised model since it requires pairs of noisy images, where the supervision is noisy. While Noise2Void and Noise2Self are similar methods following the blind-spot approach, they mainly differ in the strategy of mask replacement. To be more specific, Noise2Void proposes to use Uniform Pixel Selection (UPS), and Noise2Self proposes to exclude the information of the masked pixel and uses a random value on the range of given image data. As an additional mask strategy using the local average excluding the center pixel (donut) is mentioned in [ref]1, we also include it for comparison. We use the same neural network architecture for all deep learning methods. Detailed experimental settings are provided in Appendices D and E. Note that ImageNet and HànZì have combined noises and Planaria has unknown noise models. As a result, the post-processing steps in Noise2Self [ref]1 and the convolutional blind-spot neural network  are not applicable, as explained in Section 2. In order to make fair comparisons under the self-supervised category, we train and evaluate all models only using the images, without extra information about the noise. In this case, among self-supervised methods, only our Noise2Same and Noise2Void with the UPS replacement strategy can make use of information from the entire input image, as demonstrated in Section 3.2. We also include the complete version of the convolutional blind-spot neural network with post-processing, who is only available on BSD68, where the noise is not combined and the noise type is known. Following previous studies, we use Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) as the evaluation metric. The comparison results between our Noise2Same and the baselines in terms of PSNR on the four datasets are summarized in Table 3 and visualized in Figure 2 and Appendix F. The results show that our Noise2Same achieve remarkable improvements over previous self-supervised baselines on ImageNet, HànZì and CARE. In particular, on the ImageNet and the HànZì Datasets, our Noise2Same and Noise2Void demonstrate the advantage of utilizing information from the entire input image. Although the using of donut masking can achieve better performance on the BSD68 Dataset, it leads to model collapsing on the ImageNet Dataset and hence can be unstable. On the other hand, the convolutional blind-spot neural network  suffers from significant performance losses without the Bayesian post-processing, which requires information about the noise models that are unknown. We note that, in our fair settings, supervised methods still have better performance over self-supervised models, especially on the Planaria and BSD68 datasets. One explanation is that the supervision usually carries extra information implicitly, such as information about the noise model. Here, we draw a conclusion different from Batson et al. [ref]1. That is, there are still performance gaps between self-supervised and supervised denoising methods. Our Noise2Same moves one step towards closing the gap by proposing a new self-supervised denoising framework. In addition to the performance, we compares the training efficiency among self-supervised methods as well. Specifically, we plot how the PSNR changes during training on the ImageNet dataset. We compare Noise2Same with Noise2Self and the convolutional blind-spot neural network. The plot shows that our Noise2Same has similar convergence speed to the convolutional blind-spot neural network. On the other hand, as the mask-based method Noise2Self uses only a subset of output pixels to compute the loss function in each step, the training is expected to be slower .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: The baselines include traditional denoising algorithms (NLM , BM3D [ref]5), supervised methods (Noise2True, Noise2Noise ), and previous self-supervised methods (Noise2Void , Noise2Self [ref]1, the convolutional blind-spot neural network ).
