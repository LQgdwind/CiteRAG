      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Robust Generalization by Direct PAC-Bayesian Bound Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite their success in a wide range of fields and tasks, deep learning models still remain susceptible to manipulating their outputs by even tiny perturbations to the\ninput   [ref]33      . Several lines of work have focused on developing robust training techniques against such adversarial attacks [ref]33        .\nImportantly, Rice et al. [ref]39 observe a robust overfitting phenomenon, referred to as the robust generalization gap, in which a robustly-trained classifier shows much higher accuracy on adversarial examples from the training set, compared to lower accuracy on the test set.\nIndeed, several technical approaches have been developed that could alleviate this overfitting phenomenon, including ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} weight regularization, early stopping [ref]39, label smoothing, data augmentation  , using synthetic data [ref]22 and etc. According to learning theory, the phenomenon of overfitting can be characterized by a PAC-Bayesian bound      which upper-bounds the expected performance of a random classifier over the underlying data distribution by its performance on a finite set of training points plus some additional terms. Although several prior works  [ref]22   have built upon insights from the PAC-Bayesian bound, none attempted to directly minimize the upper bound,\nlikely due to the fact that the minimization of their forms of the PAC-Bayesian bound do not have an analytical solution. In this paper, we rely on a different form of the PAC-Bayesian bound , which can be readily optimized using a Gibbs distribution  with which we derive\na second-order upper bound over the robust test loss.\nInterestingly, the resulting bound consists of a regularization term that involves Trace of Hessian (TrH)  of the network weights, a well-known measure of the loss-surface flatness. For practical reasons, we limit TrH regularization to the top layer of the network only because computing a Hessian matrix and its trace for the entire network is too costly.\nWe further derive the analytical expression of the top-layer TrH and show both theoretically and empirically that top-layer TrH regularization has a similar effect as regularizing the entire network.\nThe resulting TrH regularization (illustrated in Figure 1) is less expensive and more memory efficient compared to other competitive methods  [ref]22  . In summary, our contributions are as follows:\n(1) We provide a PAC-Bayesian upper-bound over the robust test loss and show how to directly minimize it (Theorem 3). To the best of our knowledge, this has not been done by prior work. Our bound includes a TrH term which encourages the model parameters to converge at a flat area of the loss function;\n(2) Taking efficiency into consideration, we restrict the TrH regularization to the top layer only (Algorithm 3.1) and show that it is an implicit but empirically effective regularization on the TrH of each internal layer (Theorem 4 and Example 1); and\n(3) Finally, we conduct experiments with our new TrH regularization and compare the results to several baselines using Vision Transformers .\nOn CIFAR-10/100, our method consistently matches or beats the best baseline.\nOn ImageNet, we report a significant gain (+2.7%) in robust accuracy compared to the best baseline and establish a new state-of-the-art result of 48.9%.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Despite their success in a wide range of fields and tasks, deep learning models still remain susceptible to manipulating their outputs by even tiny perturbations to the\ninput   [ref]33      .
