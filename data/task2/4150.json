      "content": "Paper Title: DiffWire: Inductive Graph Rewiring via the Lov√°sz Bound\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs)   are a class of deep learning models applied to graph structured data. They have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in many graph-related tasks, such as node and graph classification [ref]3 , link prediction  and node and graph clustering  , and in a variety of domains, including image or molecular structure classification, recommender systems and social influence prediction [ref]8. Most GNNs use a message passing framework and thus are referred to as Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)¬† . In these networks, every node in each layer receives a message from its adjacent neighbors. All the incoming messages at each node are then aggregated and used to update the node‚Äôs representation via a learnable non-linear function ‚Äìwhich is typically implemented by means of a neural network. The final node representations (called node embeddings) are used to perform the graph-related task at hand (e.g. graph classification). MPNNs are extensible, simple and have proven to yield competitive empirical results. Examples of MPNNs include GCN [ref]3, GAT , GATv2 0, GIN 1 and GraphSAGE 2. However, they typically use transductive learning, i.e. the model observes both the training and testing data during the training phase, which might limit their applicability to graph classification tasks. However, MPNNs also have important limitations due to the inherent complexity of graphs. Despite such complexity, the literature has reported best results when MPNNs have a small number of layers, because networks with many layers tend to suffer from over-smoothing 3 and over-squashing 4. However, this models fail to capture information that depends on the entire structure of the graph¬†5 and prevent the information flow to reach distant nodes. This phenomenon is called under-reaching 6 and occurs when the MPNN‚Äôs depth is smaller than the graph‚Äôs diameter. Over-smoothing¬†7 8 [ref]8 9 takes place when the embeddings of nodes that belong to different classes become indistinguishable. It tends to occur in MPNNs with many layers that are used to tackle short-range tasks, i.e. tasks where a node‚Äôs correct prediction mostly depends on its local neighborhood.\nGiven this local dependency, it makes intuitive sense that adding layers to the network would not help the network‚Äôs performance. Conversely, long-range tasks require as many layers in the network as the range of the interaction between the nodes. However, as the number of layers in the network increases, the number of nodes feeding into each of the node‚Äôs receptive field also increases exponentially, leading to over-squashing¬†4 0: the information flowing from the receptive field composed of many nodes is compressed in fixed-length node vectors, and hence the graph fails to correctly propagate the messages coming from distant nodes. Thus, over-squashing emerges due to the distortion of information flowing from distant nodes due to graph bottlenecks that emerge when the number of kùëòk-hop neighbors grows exponentially with kùëòk. Graph pooling and graph rewiring have been proposed in the literature as solutions to address these limitations 4. Given that the main infrastructure for message passing in MPNNs are the edges in the graph, and given that many of these edges might be noisy or inadequate for the downstream task¬†1, graph rewiring aims to identify such edges and edit them. Many graph rewiring methods rely on edge sampling strategies: first, the edges are assigned new weights according to a relevance function and then they are re-sampled according to the new weights to retain the most relevant edges (i.e. those with larger weights). Edge relevance might be computed in different ways, including randomly¬†2, based on similarity¬†3 or on the edge‚Äôs curvature¬†0. Due to the diversity of possible graphs and tasks to be performed with those graphs, optimal graph rewiring should include a variety of strategies that are suited not only to the task at hand but also to the nature and structure of the graph. State-of-the-art edge sampling strategies have three significant limitations. First, most of the proposed methods fail to preserve the global topology of the graph. Second, most graph rewiring methods are neither differentiable nor inductive¬†0. Third, relevance functions that depend on a diffusion measure (typically in the spectral domain) are not parameter-free, which adds a layer of complexity in the models. In this paper, we address these three limitations. The main contribution of this work is to propose a theoretical framework called DiffWire for graph rewiring in GNNs that is principled, differentiable, inductive, and parameter-free by leveraging the Lov√°sz bound¬†5 given by Eq. 1. This bound is a mathematical expression of the relationship between the commute times (effective resistance distance) and the network‚Äôs spectral gap. Given an unseen test graph, DiffWire predicts the optimal graph structure for the task at hand without any parameter tuning. Given the recently reported connection between commute times and curvature¬†4, and between curvature and the spectral gap¬†0, the proposed framework provides a unified theory linking these concepts. Our aim is to leverage diffusion and curvature theories to propose a new approach for graph rewiring that preserves the graph‚Äôs structure. We first propose using the CT as a relevance function for edge re-weighting. Moreover, we develop a differentiable, parameter-free layer in the GNN (CT-Layer) to learn the CT. Second, we propose an alternative graph rewiring approach by adding a layer in the network (GAP-Layer) that optimizes the spectral gap according to the nature of the network and the task at hand. Finally, we empirically validate the proposed layers with state-of-the-art benchmark datasets in a graph classification task. We test our approach on a graph classification task to emphasize the inductive nature of DiffWire: the layers in the GNN (CT-Layer or GAP-Layer) are trained to predict the CTs embedding or minimize the spectral gap for unseen graphs, respectively. This approach gives a great advantage when compared to SoTA methods that require optimizing the parameters of the models for each graph. CT-Layer and GAP-Layer learn the weights during training to predict the optimal changes in the topology of any unseen graph in test time. Finally, we also perform preliminary node classification experiments in heterophilic and homophilic graphs using CT-Layer. The paper is organized as follows: Section¬†2 provides a summary of the most relevant related literature. Our core technical contribution is described in Section¬†3, followed by our experimental evaluation and discussion in Section¬†4. Finally, Section¬†5 is devoted to conclusions and an outline of our future lines of research.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: are a class of deep learning models applied to graph structured data.
