      "content": "Paper Title: New Models for Understanding and Reasoning about Speculative Execution Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA major application of our attack graph model is identifying potential defense strategies, as we illustrate by the red dashed arrows in Figure 8 for the attacks triggered by branch instructions.\nWe illustrate potential defenses that essentially add security dependencies to the system to defeat the attacks. We also show that our defense strategies cover the recently proposed defenses in industry and academia to defeat speculative execution attacks.\n Strategy ‚ë†: Prevent Access before Authorization.‚ÄÖ This prevents the illegal access of the secret, until the delayed authorization is resolved. LFENCE is an industry defense used to serialize the instructions before and after it. Adding an LFENCE instruction before the speculative load adds a new security dependency between the ‚ÄúBranch resolution‚Äù (software authorization) and ‚ÄúLoad S‚Äù (secret access), shown as ‚ë† in Figure 8. Context-sensitive fencing  prevents the speculative access by inserting fences at the micro-operation level, e.g., between a conditional branch and a load to defeat the Spectre v1 attack. This is done in hardware, rather than in software. Secure automatic bounds checking (SABC)  serialize the branch and the out-of-bounds access to mitigate the Spectre attack, by inserting arithmetic instructions with data dependencies between the branch and the access. Strategy ‚ë°: Prevent Data Usage before Authorization.‚ÄÖ This prevents the use of the speculatively accessed secret, until the delayed authorization is resolved. NDA , SpecShield , SpectreGuard [ref]17 and ConTExT [ref]34 prevent forwarding the speculatively loaded data to the\nfollowing instructions so that the secret cannot be used, e.g., to compute the address RùëÖR. SpectreGuard and ConTExT further provide the software interface for software developers to mark memory regions containing the secret as sensitive so the usage of non-sensitive data is allowed to reduce the performance overhead. Equivalently, this means adding a new security dependency between the ‚ÄúBranch resolution‚Äù (software authorization) and ‚ÄúCompute Load Address R‚Äù (data usage), shown as ‚ë° in Figure 8. Strategy ‚ë¢: Prevent Send before Authorization.‚ÄÖ This prevents the micro-architectural state changes of shared hardware resources that serve as the Send signal of the covert or side channel, until the delayed authorization is resolved. This defense strategy improves performance by adopting a looser security model where the secret is allowed to be accessed before authorization as long as it does not leak out. This strategy adds the security dependency between ‚ÄúBranch resolution‚Äù and ‚ÄúLoad R to cache‚Äù (cache state change), shown as ‚ë¢ in Figure 8. Different hardware implementations have been proposed under this strategy. STT  and SpecShieldERP+  prevent loads whose address is based on speculative data. Conditional Speculation  and Efficient Invisible Speculative Execution  both allow a speculative load that hits in the cache, because the cacheline state does not change on a hit, but delay speculative loads that encounter a miss. They further reduce the overhead by identifying trusted pages and predicting data, respectively. InvisiSpec  and SafeSpec  disallow speculative cache state modification but put the speculatively requested cache line in the shadow buffer. If the prediction is later found to be correct, InvisiSpec and SafeSpec reissue the memory access to fetch the proper cache lines. CleanupSpec  allows speculative cache state modification but restores the cache state on a mis-speculation. Strategy ‚ë£: Clearing Predictions.‚ÄÖ This strategy prevents the sharing of predictor states between different contexts. For example, the industry solution from Intel, Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier (IBPB) [ref]7, prevents the code before the barrier from affecting the branch prediction after it by flushing the Branch Target Buffer (BTB). It introduces a new operation, i.e., ‚Äúflush predictor‚Äù, to the attack graph and adds a security dependency between ‚Äúflush predictor‚Äù and the indicated branch instruction. Context-sensitive fencing also shows the feasibility of inserting micro-ops by hardware during a privilege change, to prevent a predictor being mistrained from a different context. We show that our attack graph can model not only the defenses that work, but also the defenses that do not work. In Figure 4, we show that a security dependency can be added at four different places to defend against the Meltdown attack, shown as red dashed lines. Defense strategies ‚ë†, ‚ë°, ‚ë¢ are similar to Figure 8. Typically, only one of these defense strategies is needed. However, sometimes a defense is not sufficient, as we now illustrate with a hypothetical Meltdown attack coupled with an attacker induced cache hit for the secret, like the L1 Terminal Fault . If the secret is already in the cache, the load instruction will fetch it from the cache rather than from the main memory. So while dependency ‚ë† can defend against the baseline Meltdown attack that speculatively loads a secret from main-memory in Figure 4, this is insufficient when ‚ë† can no longer prevent the secret access from the cache. In this case, an additional dependency ‚ë£ in Figure 4, i.e. from ‚ÄúAuthorization‚Äù to ‚ÄúRead S from cache‚Äù, has to be jointly added with ‚ë† to provide a valid defense. Hence, it is important to put security dependencies in the correct places, otherwise we get a false sense of security, especially when micro-architectural performance optimizations (like load from cache on a hit) can bypass an insecure security dependency like ‚ë†. In fact, there has to be a security dependency arrow between the ‚Äúauthorization resolved‚Äù node to every node that can be a source of the secret in Figure 4, such as load ports, line fill buffers and store/load buffers. The number of such ports and buffers suggests that the defense strategy ‚ÄúPrevent Data Usage before Authorization‚Äù may be a solution that is not only more efficient but also more secure.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: access.
