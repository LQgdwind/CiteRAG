      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of Resilience Problems via Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA research topic that has been studied in database theory is the computational complexity of the so-called resilience problem [ref]21  . We formulate\nit here for the case of conjunctive queries and, more generally, for unions of conjunctive queries.\nWe generally work with Boolean queries, i.e., queries without free variables. Our results, however, can be extended also to the non-Boolean case. A\nconjunctive query is a primitive positive τ𝜏\\tau-sentence and\na union of conjunctive queries is a (finite) disjunction of conjunctive\nqueries. Note that every existential positive sentence can be written as a union of conjunctive queries. Let τ𝜏\\tau be a finite relational signature and μ𝜇\\mu a conjunctive query over τ𝜏\\tau. The input to the resilience problem for μ𝜇\\mu consists of\na finite τ𝜏\\tau-structure 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}}, called a database111To be precise, a finite relational structure is not exactly the same as a database because the latter may not contain elements that do not contain in any relation. This difference, however, is inessential for the problems studied in this paper., and the\ntask is to compute the number of tuples that have to be removed from relations of 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} so that 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} does not satisfy μ𝜇\\mu. We call\nthis number the resilience of 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} (with respect to μ𝜇\\mu).\nAs usual, this can be turned into a decision problem where the input also contains a natural number u∈ℕ𝑢ℕu\\in{\\mathbb{N}} and the question is whether the resilience is at most u𝑢u.\nClearly, 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} does not satisfy μ𝜇\\mu if and only if its resilience equals 00.\nThe computational complexity of this problem depends on μ𝜇\\mu and various cases that can be solved in polynomial time and that are NP-hard have been described in [ref]21  . A general classification, however, is open. A natural variation of the problem is that the input database is a bag database, meaning that it may contain tuples with multiplicities, i.e., the same tuple may have multiple occurrences in the same relation.\nFormally, a bag database is a valued structure with all weights (which represent multiplicities) taken from ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}.\nResilience on bag databases was introduced\nby Makhija and Gatterbauer  who also present a conjunctive query for which the resilience problem with multiplicities is NP-hard whereas the resilience problem without multiplicities is in P. Note that\nbag databases are of importance because they represent SQL databases\nmore faithfully than set databases . Bag databases often require different methods than set databases  . In this paper, we exclusively consider bag databases. Note that if the resilience problem of a query μ𝜇\\mu can be solved in polynomial time on bag databases, then also the resilience problem on set databases can be solved in polynomial time. A natural generalization of the basic resilience problem defined above is\nobtained by admitting the decoration of databases with a subsignature σ⊆τ𝜎𝜏\\sigma\\subseteq\\tau, in this way declaring all tuples in R𝔄superscript𝑅𝔄R^{{\\mathfrak{A}}}, R∈σ𝑅𝜎R\\in\\sigma, to be exogenous. This means that we are not allowed to remove such tuples\nfrom 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} to make μ𝜇\\mu false; the tuples in the other relations are then called endogenous. For brevity, we also refer to the relations in τ𝜏\\tau as being exogenous/endogenous. If not specified, then σ=∅𝜎\\sigma=\\emptyset, i.e., all tuples are endogenous.\nDifferent variants of exogenous tuples were studied . However, in bag semantics all of them are polynomial-time equivalent to a problem of this form, see Remark 8.17. In this paper, we generally admit exogeneous relations. The resilience problem that we study is given\nin Figure 1. For every conjunctive query μ𝜇\\mu, the resilience problem for μ𝜇\\mu parametrized by the threshold u𝑢u is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT; we refrain from defining FPT here, but refer to ). Indeed, let τ𝜏\\tau be the signature of μ𝜇\\mu, let k𝑘k be the number of conjuncts of μ𝜇\\mu, and let 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} be an input database. Construct a k𝑘k-uniform hypergraph H𝐻H where the vertices are tuples R​(x¯)𝑅¯𝑥R(\\bar{x}), R∈τ𝑅𝜏R\\in\\tau, x¯∈R𝔄¯𝑥superscript𝑅𝔄\\bar{x}\\in R^{{\\mathfrak{A}}} (with multiplicity in H𝐻H according to their multiplicity in 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}}) and the hyperedges are copies of μ𝜇\\mu in 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}}. Then μ𝜇\\mu has resilience at most u𝑢u with respect to 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} if and only if there is a subset of vertices of H𝐻H of size at most u𝑢u that intersects every hyperedge. This shows that resilience of μ𝜇\\mu reduces to k𝑘k-Hitting Set parametrized by the threshold u𝑢u, which is known to be fixed-parameter tractable. .\n222We thank Peter Jonsson and George Osipov for suggesting this remark to us and letting us include it in this paper. We next explain how to represent resilience problems as VCSPs using appropriately chosen valued structures with oligomorphic automorphism groups. The following query is taken from Meliou, Gatterbauer, Moore, and Suciu [ref]39; they show how to solve its resilience problem without multiplicities in polynomial time by a reduction to a max-flow problem.\nLet μ𝜇\\mu be the query Observe that a finite τ𝜏\\tau-structure\nsatisfies μ𝜇\\mu if and only if it does not have a homomorphism to the τ𝜏\\tau-structure 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}}\nwith domain B={0,1}𝐵01B=\\{0,1\\} and the relations\nR𝔅={(0,1),(1,1)}superscript𝑅𝔅0111R^{{\\mathfrak{B}}}=\\{(0,1),(1,1)\\} and S𝔅={(0,0),(0,1)}superscript𝑆𝔅0001S^{{\\mathfrak{B}}}=\\{(0,0),(0,1)\\} (see Figure 2). We turn 𝔅𝔅{\\mathfrak{B}} into the valued structure ΓΓ\\Gamma with domain {0,1}01\\{0,1\\} where RΓ​(0,1)=RΓ​(1,1)=0=SΓ​(0,0)=SΓ​(0,1)superscript𝑅Γ01superscript𝑅Γ110superscript𝑆Γ00superscript𝑆Γ01R^{\\Gamma}(0,1)=R^{\\Gamma}(1,1)=0=S^{\\Gamma}(0,0)=S^{\\Gamma}(0,1) and RΓsuperscript𝑅ΓR^{\\Gamma} and SΓsuperscript𝑆ΓS^{\\Gamma} take value 1 otherwise.\nThen VCSP⁡(Γ)VCSPΓ\\operatorname{VCSP}(\\Gamma) is precisely the resilience problem for μ𝜇\\mu (with multiplicities).\nOur results reprove the result from \nthat even with multiplicities, the problem can be solved in polynomial time (see Theorem 7.17, Proposition 8.16\nand Example 8.13). Let μ𝜇\\mu be the conjunctive query This query is linear in the sense of Freire, Gatterbauer, Immerman, and Meliou and thus its resilience problem without multiplicities can be solved in polynomial time (Theorem 4.5 in [ref]39; also see Fact 3.18 in ).\nOur results reprove the result from \nthat this problem remains polynomial-time solvable with multiplicities (see Theorem 7.17, Proposition 8.16\nand Example 8.18). Note that if the resilience problem (with or without multiplicities) for a union μ𝜇\\mu of conjunctive queries is in P, then also the computational problem of finding tuples to be removed from the input database 𝔄𝔄{\\mathfrak{A}} so that 𝔄⊧̸μnot-models𝔄𝜇{\\mathfrak{A}}\\not\\models\\mu is in P. To see this, let u∈ℕ𝑢ℕu\\in\\mathbb{N} be threshold.\nIf u=0𝑢0u=0, then no tuple needs to be found and we are done. Otherwise,\nfor every tuple t𝑡t in a relation R𝔄superscript𝑅𝔄R^{{\\mathfrak{A}}}, we remove t𝑡t from R𝔄superscript𝑅𝔄R^{{\\mathfrak{A}}} and test the resulting database with the threshold u−m𝑢𝑚u-m, where m𝑚m is the multiplicity of t𝑡t. If the modified instance is accepted, then t𝑡t is a correct tuple to be removed and we may proceed to find a solution of this modified instance.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: A research topic that has been studied in database theory is the computational complexity of the so-called resilience problem [ref]21  .
