From this work, the application of deep learning progressively replaced classic SR computer vision methods . The pioneer work of Dong et al.  belongs to a group of SR methods that use mean squared error (MSE) as their objective function. VDSR  shows the importance of a deep layer architecture while SRResNet  and EDSR [ref]19 demonstrate the benefit of using residual block [ref]12 to alleviate the training. Several modifications of the residual structure such as skip connections [ref]33, recursive structures  and channel-attention  further improved the accuracy of SISR. The state-of-the-art CSNLN  integrates a cross-scale non-local attention module to learn dependencies between the LR and HR images. Other works propose lightweight networks to alleviate computational cost  .\nThese residual networks ignore the human perception and only aim to high values of PSNR and SSIM, producing blurry SR images . Generative adversarial networks (GANs), introduced in the SR task by Ledig et al. with SRGAN , aim to enhance the perceptual quality of the SR images.\nThe performances of SRGAN were improved by ESRGAN , which replaces the adversarial loss with a relativistic adversarial loss. RSRGAN  develops a rank-content loss by training a ranker to obtain state-of-the-art visual results.\n\n3D appearance super-resolution: There are only two deep learning works that super-resolve texture maps to enhance the appearance of 3D objects.\nThe method proposed by Li et al.  processes, with a modified version of EDSR [ref]19, LR texture maps and their normal maps to incorporate geometric information of the model in the learning. The pre-process to create normal maps introduces heavy computational cost.\nIn the second work , a redundancy-based encoder generates a blurry texture map from LR images that is then deblurred by a SISR decoder. Its main objective is not the super-resolution but the creation of texture maps from a set of LR multi-view images.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: work of Dong et al.  belongs to a group of SR methods that use mean squared error (MSE) as their objective function. VDSR  shows the importance of a deep layer architecture while SRResNet  and EDSR [ref]19 demonstrate the benefit of using residual block [ref]12 to alleviate the training.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
