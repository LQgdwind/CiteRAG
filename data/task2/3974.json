      "content": "Paper Title: Jointly Learning Span Extraction and Sequence Labeling for Information Extraction from Business Documents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is a widely studied task in NLP. NER models generally fall into two main categories: tag-based approaches and span-based approaches. For tag-based approaches, entity extraction is treated as a sequence labeling problem , with common architectures including: bidirectional LSTM-CRF [ref]2 , CNN  and seq2seq . With the advances of pre-training methods, models using contextual word representation such as Flair  or BERT  further enhanced the performance of NER, yielding state-of-the-art results. However, tag-based models still suffer from the nested NER problem, where overlapping entities can not be resolved efficiently . Also, common tag-based models can only operate on short sequences (i.e. sentences), so its adaptation to long business documents is still an open question. More recently, span-based approaches have attracted interest due to their generalization ability in both flat and nest NER tasks  .\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: tag-based approaches and span-based approaches.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
