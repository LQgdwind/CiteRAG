      "content": "Paper Title: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Multi-view Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph structured data is ubiquitous in the real world,\nsuch as social networks     and citation networks [ref]5 .\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become one of the standard paradigms for analyzing graph structured data.\nThe core idea of GNNs is to explore the multi-hop local structure of the target node, i.e., the ego network or ego graph ,\nby stacking multiple layers.\nAs a basic graph structure, homogeneous graphs consist of only one type of nodes and edges,\nand the ego graph in it has a clear definition and intuition , e.g., first-order or second-order structure.\nTherefore, GNNs have achieved great success on homogeneous graphs  [ref]5. However,\ntraditional GNN-based approaches cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous graphs (HGs)\nbecause of two essential properties of HGs: heterogeneity and semantics.\nAn example of an ego graph depicting the complex local structure in HGs is shown in Figure 1(a).\nFirst, the ego graph of HGs is equipped with multiple types of nodes and relations, i.e., heterogeneity.\nThe features of different types of nodes fall in different feature spaces, hindering the aggregation operation of GNNs.\nFor example, the Author nodes need to be projected into the feature space of the Paper nodes through the Write relation so as to aggregate with other Paper nodes.\nSecond, many meaningful and complex semantic information implicitly exists in the ego graph of HGs, i.e., semantics.\nThese implicit but important relationships are captured by high-order relations, i.e., metapaths.\nDifferent metapaths reveal different semantics, which can be regarded as a view to observe the target node’s local structure.\nFor example, as shown in Figure 1(b), Author-Paper-Author (APA) indicates the co-author relationship while the Author-Paper-Conference-Paper-Author (APCPA) indicates the co-conference relationship. In order to apply GNNs on HGs, a number of works have emerged recently.\nConsidering the two properties mentioned above, we divide related works into two categories.\nThe first category mainly focuses on heterogeneity.\nThese works model type-specific mapping functions to project heterogeneous nodes to the same feature space to eliminate heterogeneity.\nThen, they apply GNNs and stack multiple layers to catch high-order information 1 2 3 4.\nHowever, these methods do not explicitly make use of semantics.\nMoreover, simply stacking multiple layers to catch high-order information causes lower-order semantic information to suffer from over-smooth due to the different lengths of semantics in HGs.\nInstead, the second category explicitly utilizes metapaths as semantics111Following [ref]9 0, we use semantic and metapath interchangeably in this paper. to guide information aggregation.\nFirst, they decompose the multi-hop local structure of HGs, which contains complex semantic information, into multiple local structures under different semantics.\nThen, the node representations under different semantics are extracted by aggregating the local structure.\nFinally, representations under different semantics are fused together.\nBenefiting from modeling the heterogeneity and semantics simultaneously, these methods are effective and popular [ref]9 0 5 6 7 8 9. Despite the encouraging results,\nprevious works still fail to fully leverage the inherent heterogeneity and rich semantics contained in the complex local structures of HGs.\nSpecifically, they still suffer from at least one of the following limitations.\n(1) The modeling of local structures under each semantics is inadequately [ref]9 0 9.\nFor example, as shown in Figure 1(c), HAN [ref]9 aggregates information from metapath-based neighborhoods, discarding the intermediate nodes.\nMAGNN 0 aggregates information at the metapath instance level (i.e., sequence level),\nand neglects the overall graph structure of the local structure, which causes information loss and inflexibility in the aggregation process.\n(2) The modeling of the mapping function between heterogeneous nodes is neglected when aggregating the local structures under each semantics 7 8.\nThat is, the heterogeneity of HGs is not fully explored.\nMost of these works only project the feature of heterogeneous nodes to the same dimension[ref]9 0 9 and aggregate features directly, neglecting the mapping relation between them.\n(3) The representations from multiple semantics are not comprehensively utilized to obtain versatile node representations.\nMost methods use simple concatenation or the attention mechanism to fuse representations from different semantics [ref]9 0 0 5.\nHowever, the simple concatenation preserves redundant information among multiple semantics, leading to poor performance.\nMeanwhile, the attention mechanism can not theoretically guarantee versatile node embeddings, i.e., superior to any single view representation.\nMoreover, our experiments in Sections 5 demonstrate that the attention mechanism can not consistently outperform the simple mean average or single view. To tackle these issues,\nwe model the HG embedding from the perspective of Multi-view Representation Learning (MvRL).\nThe intuitive idea of introducing MvRL is that the semantic property of HGs conforms to the idea of MvRL,\ni.e., each semantics can be regarded as a view to observe the target node’s local structure.\n\nDifferent from existing works, the MvRL idea specifically requires adequate modeling of the structure and heterogeneity under each view, and comprehensive integration of representations from multiple views.\nOn the one hand, within each view, it requires adequately aggregating local structures and modeling heterogeneity to obtain view-specific representations.\nOn the other hand, among multiple views, it requires comprehensively integrating representations from multiple views into a latent representation with theoretical guarantees of versatility (i.e., superior to any single view) and better performance in downstream tasks.\nBased on the above motivation, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for HG embedding within a Multi-View representation learning framework (named MV-HetGNN).\nMV-HetGNN solves the above problems with two key components, the view-specific ego graph encoder and auto multi-view fusion layer.\n\nOn the one hand, MV-HetGNN first decomposes the original complete ego graph in HGs into a set of view-specific ego graphs, which preserve complete local structures under each semantics.\nThen, the view-specific ego graph encoder leverages TransE 1 to learn the representations of relations in HGs, so as to model the mapping function between heterogeneous nodes and aggregate information at the graph level in a bottom-up manner.\nOn the other hand, the auto multi-view fusion layer aims to integrate the embeddings from different views comprehensively.\nThere are two main challenges.\nFirst, there is much redundant information among multi-view representations 2, i.e., the overlap of representations.\nSecond, the fused representations require a theoretical guarantee of versatility 3, i.e., performing at least as good as any single-view representation.\nAuto multi-view fusion layer overcomes both challenges by using hierarchical autoencoders with orthogonal regularization.\nIn general, our method solves many issues and extends the second category by introducing the idea of MvRL.\nIn summary, this work makes several major contributions: We model the local structure under each semantics as view-specific ego graphs and propose a novel view-specific ego graph encoder module.\nIt learns the representations of relations to model the mapping function between heterogeneous nodes to address heterogeneity and aggregates information comprehensively. We propose a novel auto multi-view fusion layer to comprehensively integrate the embeddings from different semantics.\nIt utilizes hierarchical autoencoders with orthogonal regularization to remove the redundant information cross multiple views and obtain versatile node embeddings with theoretical guarantees.\n We conduct extensive experiments on three public real-world HG datasets with three different tasks.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MV-HetGNN over seven state-of-the-art models. The paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 covers related work, and Section 3 presents preliminaries and the problem definition.\nIn Section 4, we present the MV-HetGNN model in detail.\nIn Section 5, we conduct extensive experiments and visualizations to evaluate the effectiveness of MV-HetGNN.\nIn particular, Section 5.2 compares the performance of MV-HetGNN with other baselines.\nSection 5.3 compares our view-specific ego graph encoder with existing approaches [ref]9 0, and Section 5.4 compares our auto multi-view fusion layer with other popular approaches in detail.\nFinally, Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Graph structured data is ubiquitous in the real world,\nsuch as social networks     and citation networks [ref]5 .\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become one of the standard paradigms for analyzing graph structured data.\nThe core idea of GNNs is to explore the multi-hop local structure\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
