      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing Foundation Model Inference on a Many-tiny-core Open-source RISC-V Platform\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformers revolutionized NLP¬† and later, CV¬†, text generation¬†1, and other domains, thanks to their excellent representation capability. As a consequence of this remarkable performance, coupled with the difficulty of training large transformers from scratch for each new task and the effectiveness of newly developed label-free training schemes, FMs¬†[ref]5 have emerged as the most natural paradigm for training and deploying transformers, leveraging vast amounts of data¬†1 .\nFMs undergo extensive pre-training on large and diverse datasets, often through self-supervised procedures, which helps them develop a generalized and wide-range understanding of language patterns, visual information, audio, and many more mixed modalities, depending on the nature of training data. Once pre-trained, these models can be fine-tuned at a much lower cost (in terms of data and computing) to perform specific downstream tasks accurately. The large majority of SoA FMs belong to one of two big classes. Encoder-only models, which include classifiers such as ViTs, are feed-forward neural networks that simultaneously receive the entire input sequence and generate their output in a single inference pass. Decoder-only models, in contrast, are mainly used for generative tasks, typically in an autoregressive fashion. In this case, the final output is generated through multiple iterations of the network, each fed with the output of the previous one.\nIn our work, we describe a general FM kernel library and a flexible hardware platform able to optimize both model families. We use the dominant ViT and GPT as representatives of the two categories to demonstrate our results. The ViT encoder-only architecture exploits a first convolutional layer with a stride equal to the filter dimension to create a linearized series of patches used as the input sequence. The heart of the network constitutes Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) blocks that correlate all the input tokens with themselves, therefore having ùêóùüè=ùêóùüêsubscriptùêó1subscriptùêó2\\mathbf{X_{1}}=\\mathbf{X_{2}}. Fig. 2-A depicts the matrix operations executed and the tensor dimensions for the key blocks of the MHSA section. The operations are quadratically proportional to the input sequence length SùëÜS and linearly proportional to PùëÉP and Eùê∏E. All involved operations are on multi-dimensional matrices, and a single pass through all the network blocks produces the desired classification.\nAs reference models for this family, we considered ViT-{Base, Large, Huge}, denoted with suffixes -B, -L, and -H in the following, given their maturity and widespread adoption¬†. Although more recent models have been developed, the basic building blocks remained similar, and, therefore, our library can be identically employed for their deployment¬†2 3. Decoder-only models of the GPT family are employed as LLMs. They elaborate sequences of language tokens (words or portions thereof) from a dictionary. In their most basic use case, given an initial prompt, they are tasked to generate a highly likely continuation. Computationally, there are two crucial differences compared to the encoder model: First, the attention is causal, which means that the new tokens can only attend to the previous ones in the sequence and not to subsequent ones. Second, a single new token and not the entire output is generated at each pass through the network (see Fig. 2-B). For instance, to generate the reply to the question What is your name?, the model is first provided with the tokenized question as a prompt. In the first iteration, the initial token of the continuation (e.g., I) is generated. Then, such a token is appended to the input, and the network is invoked again, producing the following output token (e.g., am). This procedure repeats until a special end-of-sentence token is produced or another stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum length).\nCompared to encoder-only models, we observe a shift from matrix-matrix operations towards matrix-vector operations, which are less compute-intensive. In fact, except for the initial network invocation (prompt processing or pre-fill step), a single new query vector per layer is processed at each subsequent step, computing its attention weights against all previous keys and values. Note that the K and V projections involve just a vector-matrix multiplication since the keys and values relative to tokens processed in previous inference passes can be stored in memory to avoid re-computation in the so-called KV cache 4. These differences will be analyzed in detail in Sec. VII.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: of this remarkable performance, coupled with the difficulty of training large transformers from scratch for each new task and the effectiveness of newly developed label-free training schemes, FMs¬†[ref]5 have emerged as the most natural paradigm for training and deploying transformers, leveraging vast amounts of data¬†1 .\nFMs undergo extensive pre-training on large and diverse datasets, often\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
