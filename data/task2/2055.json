We briefly discuss these results here. Recent XNLP-completeness results that build upon our work include the following: several graph problems with a linear structure, including problems with pathwidth, linear cliquewidth, and linear mim-width as parameter 5; bùëèb-coloring with pathwidth as parameter [ref]38; several problems related\nto flow, with pathwidth as parameter ; integral 2-commodity flow with pathwidth as parameter . In¬†, it was shown that reconfiguration of\ndominating sets and of independent sets, with the sizes of these sets as parameter is XNLP-complete, when the number of reconfiguration steps is given in unary. In contrast, when the number of steps is respectively a parameter, given in binary, or unspecified, the problems become complete for W‚Äãùëädelimited-[]2W or W‚Äãùëädelimited-[]1W, for XNL, and for XL. The class XALP was introduced by Bodlaender, Groenland, Jacob, Pilipczuk and Pilipzcuk\n6 as an analogue to XNLP for ‚Äòtree-structured‚Äô problems. Natural problems with a ‚Äòtree structure‚Äô, such as List Coloring parameterized by treewidth or Max Cut parameterized by clique-width were shown to be XALP-complete. Determining the tree partition width (or strong treewidth) of a graph was also shown to be XALP-complete in 4 and the Perfect Phylogeny problem was shown to be XALP-complete by de Vlas¬†4. A probabilistic variant of XNLP with\na complete problem related to Bayesian networks was introduced in\n. Bodlaender, Groenland, and Pilipczuk¬†8 introduced the class XSLP, and showed\nsome natural problems with treedepth as parameter to be complete for that class.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: the following: several graph problems with a linear structure, including problems with pathwidth, linear cliquewidth, and linear mim-width as parameter 5; bùëèb-coloring with pathwidth as parameter [ref]38; several problems related\nto flow, with pathwidth as parameter ; integral 2-commodity flow with pathwidth as parameter .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
