      "content": "Paper Title: Distribution Knowledge Embedding for Graph Pooling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor the comparison experiments, we compare our method with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN-based methods, includingPooling (DiffPool) [ref]6, Hierarchical Adaptive Pooling (HAP) [ref]8, Second-Order Pooling (SOPool) , Pooling Architecture Search (PAS) 8, Harr Graph Pooling (HarrPool) , Differentiable Graph Memory Network (GMN) , Adaptive Structure Aware Pooling (ASAP)  and Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT)  on all datasets. Furthermore, we compare five kernel-based baselines on TU datasets,\nincluding Graphlet Kernel (GK) , Random Walk Kernel (RW) , Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel (WL) , Deep Graphlet Kernel (DGK) , and Anonymous Walk Embeddings (AWE) , and two GNN baselines on OGB datasets, including GCN  and GIN . To ensure the fairness of these comparison experiments, we select the same number of network layers, learning rate, hidden dimension, and batch size as the settings in the DKE framework. Other hyperparameters of different models remain unchanged as the settings in their source codes. Table I shows the classification accuracies achieved by our proposed approaches on TU datasets as compared with several aforementioned GNN-based and graph kernel baselines.\nAs demonstrated in Table I, our proposed methods achieve the best performances for graph classification on TU datasets. In particular, DKEPool and DKEPoolR achieved better accuracies than others on MUTAG, PTC, PROTEINS, RDT-B and NCI1 datasets. On the other hand, the performance of DKEPool is weaker than some baselines on IMDB-B and IMDB-M datasets.\nTable II provides the recognition results compared with different graph pooling methods on two OGB datasets, i.e., MOLHIV and MOLBBBP. The superior performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. The ROC-AUC of DEKPoolR on MOLHIV and MOLBBBP improve 1.25 % and 2.08 % compared with the second performance in Table II. Moreover, p-values are 4.81​e−24.81𝑒24.81e-2, 2.88​e−22.88𝑒22.88e-2 between DEKPoolR and second performance method on these two datasets, which analyze their performance by considering the mean values and standard deviations and show that the improvement of our approach is significant.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: For the comparison experiments, we compare our method with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN-based methods, includingPooling (DiffPool) [ref]6, Hierarchical Adaptive Pooling (HAP) [ref]8, Second-Order Pooling (SOPool) , Pooling Architecture Search (PAS) 8, Harr Graph Pooling (HarrPool) , Differentiable Graph Memory Network (GMN) ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
