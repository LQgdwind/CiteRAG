      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Hierarchical Relation Extraction for Generic Form Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdministrative documents are one of the most widely used medium for data storage and communication, which raises the need for an automated solution for form understanding. However, this task remains largely difficult due to the layout variations between forms for different purposes, organizations, etc. Owning to its complexity, classical works like heuristic-based , , or recent deep learning-based methods [ref]3,  often break the problem into several sub-components: text-line detection, entity recognition, relation extraction, etc.\nThe rationale of the division is that we may have better control of the input-output correspondence while cascading information for later steps.\nFollowing [ref]5, the problem of Form Understanding can be formulated as 3 main tasks: Word Grouping, Entity Labeling - detection of questions (keys) and answers (values), and Entity Linking - their linking.\nWithin this scope of this paper, we take another look at this prevalent problem by proposing an end-to-end model to solve both Entity Labeling and Entity Linking task at the same time. Aside from the aforementioned heuristic-based methods for document information extraction (i.e using hand-crafted rules to build up and extract tables and identifying key-value pairs), deep-learning-based methods are also received much attention during the recent years   .\nAlthough deep-learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy recently in both entity segmentation in documents [ref]9, link prediction on large social network graph 0, and matching between human pose joint 1, there have been few works on end-to-end models performing both entity extraction and link prediction of a document at the same time. Our hypothesis is that while being advantageous for intermediate supervision, the division of architecture to different stages are not necessary for optimal speed and performance. As they heavily depend on each other as a flow, if the previous steps like entity recognition do not perform well, it would severely affect the performance of the later entity linking stage by error accumulations. In this paper, we present the extension of Semantic Entity Labeling with relational linking by adapting the Part-Association-Field mechanism for mutual relations extraction among entities.\nOur work is based on the previously proposed Multi-Stage Attentional U-Net (MSAU) architecture [ref]9 for its proven effectiveness in entity segmentation from the char-grid embedding 2. We go beyond its limitation of having no direct supervision from the linking between entities by adding Part-Intensity Fields and Part-Association Fields (PIF-PAF) 3 which results in an additional two-head branch for entity linking and prediction from document images.\nIn addition to original segmentation output, the Part-Intensity Field head produces of confidence score of each entityâ€™s key points, while the Part-Association Fields head allows the associations between entities.\nApart from the major addition of PIF-PAF module, our work also improved upon MSAU by adding Corner Pooling 4 to solve the issue of long-range distance between entities, enabling the wider-range propagation of information both horizontally and vertically.\nThe Coordinate Convolution (CoordConv) 5 is also included to incorporate translational signals to the model.\nThe effectiveness of these modules will be shown in Section IV. We demonstrate the capability of our proposed model on the Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents dataset (FUNDS) [ref]5, focusing on the Entity Labeling and Entity Linking task. While the line of work for Entity Labeling is actively developed in  [ref]9 [ref]3 6, for the combined Entity Labeling and Entity Linking task, the methods reported in [ref]5, 7, 8 only achieved limited performance due to the bottleneck in exploiting both semantic and spatial features and the highly imbalanced links between entities. Under those challenging conditions, experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms various strong baselines (including Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP) with BERT, recently proposed MSAU [ref]9, LayoutLM 7, and Graph-based methods 9), achieving state-of-the-art performance. In short, we summarize our contribution list: We proposed an end-to-end architecture combining semantic entity extraction and link prediction for form understanding, which incorporates the Part-Association Field and Part-Intensity Field to the baseline MSAU model. We improved upon the original architecture of MSAU by adding Corner Pooling and Coordinate Convolution to aid spatial context modeling, which has been reaffirmed by our empirical experiments. Ablation studies show that utilizing the relations supervision can improve segmentation results for entity extractions in comparison with other baselines. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the related works, followed by that is the proposed method in Section III, the experiments in Section IV.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: due to the layout variations between forms for different purposes, organizations, etc. Owning to its complexity, classical works like heuristic-based , , or recent deep learning-based methods [ref]3,  often break the problem into several sub-components: text-line detection, entity recognition, relation extraction, etc.\nThe rationale of the division is that we may have better control of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
