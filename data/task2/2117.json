Spatial attention How neural approaches decompose scenes into object-centric representations largely segregates the relevant literature.\nAIR 4, SPAIR , and SPACE  use spatial attention to discover explicit object attributes such as position and scale similarly to unsupervised object detection.\nThese models excel at decomposing and generating synthetic scenes 6 0, but the underlying grid-based scene representation and symbolic bounding-box-like object representations are ill-suited for handling complex real-world scenes. Sequential attention\nMONet  and GENESIS 2 use sequential attention to bind latent variables to the components of a segmented image but as a result learn ordered representations.\nImposing an ordering on the set of representations for a scene is unnatural, can leak global scene information into the object-centric representations, and biases the decomposition (e.g., the background or large objects are always attended to first).111See Appendix A.3 of Greff et al. 8 and our Appendix B for a discussion on unordered vs ordered representations.\nIn a follow-up work, MONet was extended with an in-painting network to improve its spatial disentanglement . Iterative inference A line of methods 6 7  0 8 use iterative inference to bind symmetric latent representations with the components of a segmentation mixture model.\nIODINE is the state-of-the-art method in this category; our method, described in the next section, presents an efficient alternative without sacrificing representation quality.\nSlot Attention  is a general method for mapping a distributed representation to a symmetric set representation and has been used within a deterministic autoencoder for unsupervised object discovery.\nHowever, it tends to learn highly entangled representations, unlike ours, since it can only implicitly encourage disentanglement by adjusting the latent dimension.\nThe SRN 4 was published concurrently with Slot Attention and appears to offer a similar mechanism for mapping a single distributed representation to a set representation.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: algorithms are still used in vision pipelines, and although the community’s focus has shifted to learning representations from data, they contain valuable insights for improving neural methods [ref]4.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
