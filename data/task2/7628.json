However, the standard RLHF pipeline optimizes the policy towards the estimated reward model as a proxy for human feedback, a method shown to be susceptible to overoptimization issue. This vulnerability leads to potential misalignments with true user preferences and subsequent degradation in performance  [ref]9 1. Several recent works aim to directly learn the policy model without RL optimization, either through directly learning the policy model from preference data without involving reward modelling 1 8  0 5, or continuously mimicking responses ranked high by the reward model 0 5 . However, due to the inherent limitations of supervised learning, these approaches face challenges in generalization and are particularly vulnerable to out-of-preference data 0 . There is also a line of work [ref]9 1  that aims to directly address the overoptimization issue during policy optimization by penalizing samples with high uncertainty in the estimated reward. However, all of these approaches utilize the variance of reward ensembles with different seeds, either in pretraining or fine-tuning, as the measure of uncertainty. This not only incurs a high computational cost but also hinders achieving the maximum performance potential, given that the “scaling laws” generally advocate for larger reward models. Moreover, all of these methods adopt per-sample uncertainty penalization, which may be too conservative.\nAdditionally, several theoretical works consider the accuracy of reward models in RLHF, primarily from an offline RL perspective  . However, these works mainly contribute to the theoretical understanding of RLHF without any empirical experiments. Adversarial Learning in RLHF. In addition to approaches countering over-optimization [ref]9 1 , recent work  proposes an adversarial optimization framework to update the reward and policy models iteratively.\nHowever, they utilize a min-max objective, where the inner optimization learns a policy to maximize rewards, while the outer minimization refines reward models based on provided gold preference data. Their inner optimization still directly relies on estimated rewards, thus suffering from the overoptimization problem. In contrast, our framework employs a max-min objective, where the inner minimization with a confidence region searches for rewards conservatively, based on which the policy is then maximized. Furthermore, their work is currently implemented only with rejection sampling as the LLM updating algorithm, unlike the RL optimization stage in our approach.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: human feedback, a method shown to be susceptible to overoptimization issue.
