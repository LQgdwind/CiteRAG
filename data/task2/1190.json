      "content": "Paper Title: Cost–effective Variational Active Entity Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTypically, ER methods for structured data (e.g., ) include at least a blocking and a matching step .\nThe latter, which is the focus of this paper, involves detailed comparison of candidates efficiently identified by the former, often resorting to rule–based reasoning (e.g., 0 1), classification (e.g., 2 3 ), crowdsourcing (e.g., 4), or generative modeling (e.g., 5) to do so. In this paper, we focus on classification–based matching. In practice, it often relies on string similarities between attribute values of tuples (e.g., 2 3). Alternatively, NLP–specific feature engineering methods (e.g., 6 ) are employed to extract meaningful numerical features from attribute values. These are then passed to deep learning  classifiers that learn a similarity function consistent with given duplicate/non–duplicate training examples [ref]3  7. Our proposal in this paper, Variational Active Entity Resolution (VAER), is a deep learning ER solution that focuses on reducing the human–involvement cost of performing ER in practice. Specifically, existing supervised ER proposals, such as DeepER , DeepMatcher [ref]3, Seq2SeqMatcher 7, or DITTO 8 aim to perform feature engineering and match training simultaneously, using the same training instances. This leads to complex models that require thousands of labeled instances, potentially hours of training [ref]3, and that are not reusable. Similarly, unsupervised approaches, such as ZeroER 5, involve costly feature engineering efforts for every new ER task. Conversely, VAER decouples the feature engineering and matching tasks, conducting the former in an unsupervised fashion and only optimizing the latter on account of training data. Crucially, this leads to significantly smaller training times for matching and, consequently, enables the use of the resulting model in iterative active learning strategies that seek to assist the user in generating training data. Moreover, the feature engineering task in VAER builds on a representation learning paradigm 9 that enables the transfer of the resulting representation model to multiple different ER tasks, i.e. transfer learning 0. In supporting the above characteristics, the techniques used with VAER intersect with the following research areas: Variational Auto–Encoders. VAEs  1 are a type of neural network often used in dimensionality reduction, representation learning and generative learning. Typically, a VAE involves an encoder and a decoder that are trained simultaneously. The encoder aims to approximate a (lower dimension) probability distribution of the input using variational inference 2 3. The decoder assists the encoder by ensuring that any random sample from the approximated distribution can be used to reconstruct the input. Therefore, VAEs can be seen as unsupervised models, since the labels are the inputs themselves. In this paper, we use a VAE to perform unsupervised entity representation learning. Formal details about our VAE–based approach are further provided in Section III. Active Learning. AL is a sub–field of machine learning based on the key hypothesis that if a learning algorithm can suggest the data it learns from, it could perform better with less training 4. In ER, AL has been used to ease the user’s task of labeling training data (e.g., 5  6. For example, 6 offers a framework for AL in ER with various types of non–deep learning algorithms. With respect to deep learning ER, in , new training samples are used to adapt a transferred matching model from another ER use–case to the case at hand. While our approach follows a similar methodology, we do not assume pre–trained matching models and start from very few labeled instances to create an, often weak, initial model that is then iteratively improved based on evidence specific to and dictated by the nature of our entity representations.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: numerical features from attribute values.
