      "content": "Paper Title: VinVL: Revisiting Visual Representations in Vision-Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision language pre-training (VLP) has proved effective for a wide range of vision-language (VL) tasks\n [ref]26      5 [ref]21. VLP typically consists of two stages:\n(1) an object detection model is pre-trained to encode an image and the visual objects in the image to feature vectors, and\n(2) a cross-modal fusion model is pre-trained to blend text and visual features.\nWhile existing VLP research focuses mainly on improving the cross-modal fusion model, this paper focuses on improving the object-centric visual representations and presents a comprehensive empirical study to demonstrate that visual features matter in VL models. Among the aforementioned work, a widely-used object detection (OD) model [ref]2 is trained on the Visual Genome dataset . The OD model provides an object-centric representation of images, and has been used in many VL models as a black box. In this work, we pre-train a large-scale object-attribute detection model based on the ResNeXt-152 C4 architecture (short as X152-C4).\nCompared to the OD model of  [ref]2, the new model is better-designed for VL tasks, and is bigger and trained on much larger amounts of data, combining multiple public object detection datasets, including COCO , OpenImages (OI) , Objects365  and Visual Genome (VG) .\nAs a result, our OD model achieves much better results on a wide range of VL tasks, as shown in Table 1.\nCompared to other typical OD models, such as X152-FPN trained on OpenImages, our new model can encode a more diverse collection of visual objects and concepts (e.g., producing visual representations for 184818481848 object categories and 524524524 attribute categories), as illustrated by an example in Figure 1. To validate the effectiveness of the new OD model, we pre-train a Transformer-based cross-modal fusion model Oscar+ [ref]21 on a public dataset consisting of 8.858.858.85 million text-image pairs, where the visual representations of these images are produced by the new OD model and are fixed during Oscar+ pre-training. We then fine-tune the pre-trained Oscar+ for a wide range of downstream tasks, including VL understanding tasks such as VQA , GQA , NLVR2 , and COCO text-image retrieval , and VL generation tasks such as COCO image captioning  and NoCaps . Our results show that the object-centric representations produced by the new OD model significantly improve the performance across all the VL tasks, often by a large margin over strong baselines using the classical OD model [ref]2, creating new state of the arts on all these tasks, including GQA on which none of the published pre-trained models has surpassed the deliberately designed neural state machine (NSM) 2. We will release the new OD model to the research community. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n(i)i(\\textup{\\it i}) We present a comprehensive empirical study to demonstrate that visual features matter in VL models.\n(ii)ii(\\textup{\\it ii}) We have developed a new object detection model that can produce better visual features of images than the classical OD model [ref]2 and substantially uplifts the state-of-the-art results on all major VL tasks across multiple public benchmarks.\n(iii)iii(\\textup{\\it iii}) We provide a detailed ablation study of our pre-trained object detection model to investigate the relative contribution to the performance improvement due to different design choices regarding diversity of object categories, visual attribute training, training data scale, model size, and model architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Vision language pre-training (VLP) has proved effective for a wide range of vision-language (VL) tasks\n [ref]26      5 [ref]21.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
