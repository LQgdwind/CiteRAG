      "content": "Paper Title: Application of Ghost-DeblurGAN to Fiducial Marker Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA generative adversarial network (GAN) is an unsupervised deep-learning framework proposed by Goodfellow et al . Ramakrishnan et al.  first introduce a GAN to deblurring tasks, which indicates recovering a sharp image from a blurred image. Kupyn et al. proposed DeblurGAN-v1 in [ref]1 and DeblurGAN-v2 in [ref]2. To avoid the possible gradient explosion, DeblurGAN employs Wasserstein GAN  and DeblurGAN-v2 adopts modified Least Squares GAN . Zhang et al.  proposed learning-to-DeBlur GAN (DBGAN)  which has a better deblurring quality than DeblurGAN-v2 on the GoPro dataset. However, DBGAN  is developed neither as a lightweight implementation nor for real-time deblurring purposes while DeblurGAN-v2 (MobileNetV2) [ref]2 achieves real-time deblurring with a tiny model size. As a matter of fact, DeblurGAN-v2 is not the SOTA deblurring method and GAN is definitely not the only choice for deblurring, for instance, HINet  and MPRNet  already exceed it in terms of accuracy. Nevertheless, the DeblurGAN-v2 (MobileNetV2) still belongs to SOTA lightweight deblurring networks for real-time applications. There is some incremental work [ref]22 [ref]2 for the sake of better real-time deblurring based on the DeblurGAN [ref]1 [ref]2. A slimmed version of DeblurGAN-v1, called SlimDeblurGAN is introduced in [ref]22 by adopting the network slimming approach introduced in  on DeblurGAN-v1 [ref]1. However, DeblurGAN-v1 no longer belongs to the SOTA deblurring methods while SlimDeblurGAN shows accuracy degradation compared to it [ref]22. In [ref]2, Kupyn et al. propose a radical attempt named DeblurGAN-v2 (MobileNet-DSC) where all the normal convolutions are replaced by depthwise convolutions  in DeblurGAN-v2 (MobileNetV2). The aim of this approach is to further boost the deblurring efficiency, which is similar to the objective this work. Compared with DeblurGAN-v2 (MobileNetV2), the efficiency of MobileNet-DSC is promoted, but again at the cost of deblurring quality degradation [ref]2.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: proposed by Goodfellow et al .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
