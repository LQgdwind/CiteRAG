      "content": "Paper Title: FedVal: Different good or different bad in federated learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning (FL) is a novel privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that collaboratively trains a model across many devices, each using its own local data. As the popularity of machine learning (ML) has exploded in recent years, one of the most significant bottlenecks for ML projects has been the collection of, and access to large, high-quality datasets . However, with the growing concerns around privacy and data regulations [ref]42 , finding effective ways to gather data while preserving privacy has become increasingly important . FL offers a promising approach to address these challenges, and it has been applied in a range of industries, including mobile internet, healthcare, finance, and insurance   . Essentially, FL allows multiple participating devices or systems to collaboratively train an ML model while keeping their data on their own devices rather than gathering it in a single location, helping protect the privacy of the individuals or organizations. In FL, only the model parameters are shared and transmitted back to a server, where they are typically aggregated using a weighted averaging function  . However, this simple approach may not be sufficient in many situations due to the decentralized nature of FL, which introduces challenges such as byzantine failures , data heterogeneity    , security and privacy preservation of participants’ data\n  [ref]4 . Firstly, machine learning models trained using FL are vulnerable to byzantine failures such as faulty sensors, communication noise, and poisoning attacks . These failures can be caused by compromised clients contributing malicious or faulty global model updates . For example, in the context of training an ML model for autonomous cars, faulty sensors, inconsistent connection, or malicious attacks attempting to manipulate the model to gain an advantage could pose a threat. FL models are also vulnerable to attacks on the databases used for training , as the central server cannot access the data to verify its integrity. Protecting the ML model against these types of failures is important in FL, particularly because of its decentralized nature, which allows for the inclusion of potentially malicious clients in the training process. In addition, when working with FL systems, it is typical for the data distributions between clients not to be independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which can pose challenges for the model to effectively and fairly learn from the data  2. Consider the scenario of using FL to train an ML model on data collected from cars. The data distributions gathered by different cars will likely vary significantly due to differences in driving conditions such as location (e.g., rural areas versus cities) and climate. As a direct result of data heterogeneity, the performance of a model trained using FL might degrade when compared to its centralized counter-part  2   . Furthermore, one of the main benefits of FL is the ability to train ML models on large amounts of data without having to access or handle sensitive information directly. This is particularly important in the context of data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) , which require organizations to protect the personal data of individuals from unauthorized access or use. However, it is important to note that even with federated learning, there is still a risk that sensitive information could be inadvertently revealed or reconstructed from the model’s parameters or gradients [ref]4  . Since federated learning operates by communicating the gradients and the model parameter updates between the central server and the participating clients during each communication round, it is possible to learn sensitive and private information about the underlying data through these gradients and model updates. To address this concern, researchers have developed techniques for ensuring the privacy and security of FL systems, such as differential privacy  and secure multiparty computation [ref]4, which make it possible to prove that the sensitive data can not be reconstructed or compromised during the training process. It is important that the methods provided to handle non-IID issues and poisoning attacks are compatible with such privacy-preserving techniques so we can achieve the highest performance while securing access to private data. In this paper, we examine the overarching threat model posed by various issues, focusing on realistic Federated Learning settings that address privacy concerns and account for heterogeneity issues. Our primary emphasis is on mitigating large-scale byzantine failures and poisoning attacks, which can have significant consequences. We examine state-of-the-art solutions to these open problems in federated learning. We also evaluate the effectiveness of these solutions when applied in combination with differential privacy techniques such as norm clipping and noise injection . Our objective is to uncover potential avenues for enhancing the interrelated aspects of security, robustness, and fairness in FL systems and present innovative solutions to address these challenges simultaneously. Contributions    To this end, we propose FedVal, a novel adaptive server-side validation solution to address the challenges of both poisoning attacks and data heterogeneity. FedVal involves scaling the impact of client updates based on their performance to the extent that they have learned from the data. We argue that this approach is more effective than other existing methods that have been proposed, and we demonstrate its efficacy through comprehensive experiments conducted in different FL settings. Our experiments show that our method can provide strong protection against poisoning attacks, even under conditions where 80%percent8080\\% of clients are malicious and in the presence of differential privacy techniques. Additionally, FedVal is able to handle the fairness challenges posed by non-IID data effectively, for example by completely salvaging quantity distribution skew situations where other solutions struggle. We have also demonstrated that FedVal exhibits computational efficiency with the potential to deliver substantial robustness using only 101010 validation elements per class. Overall, our results highlight the importance of considering the interplay between poisoning attacks, data heterogeneity, and privacy-preserving techniques in the design of FL systems. We believe our work will inspire further research in this direction and contribute to the development of more robust and secure FL systems.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: of the most significant bottlenecks for ML projects has been the collection of, and access to large, high-quality datasets .
