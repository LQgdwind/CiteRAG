      "content": "Paper Title: On the Design Fundamentals of Diffusion Models: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion models are an emerging class of generative models to obtain novel data [ref]1. During training, a diffusion model is trained by adding and removing noise when given a set of training samples. During inference, it generates a new sample using random noise as input. Diffusion models have been applied in a wide range of fields. Diffusion models have shown impressive results in inpainting [ref]2, text-to-image , super-resolution , colorization [ref]5, instance segmentation , and so on. They have been popular as a non-autoregressive alternative solution in conventionally autoregressive tasks . Diffusion models have also demonstrated superiority in speech generation , music synthesis , and audio enhancement . Besides, they become increasingly popular in 3D shape generation , human motion synthesis , video synthesis , molecule synthesis , trajectory prediction , simulation , and astronomical data synthesis . The generic pipeline of diffusion models involves a forward process and a reverse process to learn a data distribution, as well as a sampling procedure to generate novel data. The pipeline is featured by a time-indexed multi-step chain where the three components move either forwards, i.e., timestep increases, or backwards, i.e., timestep decreases. The forward process moves forwards on the chain and perturbs the training data by adding noise at each timestep. The reverse process moves on the chain in the opposite direction. It optimizes a network to remove the aforementioned perturbation. The two processes jointly enable the network to be trained for distribution modelling. Finally, the sampling procedure obtains a random noise and uses the optimized network for data generation. It also moves backwards on the chain as the reverse process does. The main difference is that the network during the sampling procedure is already optimized and used for inference only. Typically, two distinctive formulations are available for realizing the three components in the generic pipeline. First, diffusion models may be formulated with discrete timesteps  . Second, diffusion models may also be formulated with continuous timesteps. These components are defined by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) [ref]5 . This formulation unifies the one with discrete timesteps, and facilitates the theoretical analysis of diffusion models . Although these three components generally define the generic pipeline, they are currently lacking a comprehensive survey. Some existing survey papers focus on higher-level solutions to facilitate applications, and explore less on the design details of each component  . Some concentrate on specific domains or aspects of diffusion models, lacking insights on the holistic design fundamentals of the generic pipeline       0. Others focus on the application side, and thereby provide fewer observations on theoretical designs 1 2 3. Overall, a survey that concentrates specifically on designing the aforementioned components of diffusion models is lacking. This survey bridges the gap in the literature by offering a thorough and cohesive review of component-wise design fundamentals in diffusion models. In particular, we have organized design fundamentals of diffusion models into the forward process, the reverse process, and the sampling procedure, as shown in Figure 1. This breakdown is aligned with the generic pipeline. Drawing upon the latest research and implementations, we have summarized the main streams of design fundamentals for each component. Overall, this survey offers a fine-grained perspective of diffusion models, and facilitates future analysis of individual components, the applicability of design fundamentals, and the implementation of diffusion models. The rest of this survey is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the preliminaries of diffusion models, including the generic pipeline and its two formulations. Sections 3, 4, and 5 respectively review the design fundamentals of the forward process, the reverse process, and the sampling procedure, as visualised in Figure 1. Section 6 provides insights on the future trends and Section 7 gives a brief conclusion on diffusion models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Diffusion models are an emerging class of generative models to obtain novel data [ref]1.
