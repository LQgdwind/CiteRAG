      "content": "Paper Title: Safety Verification for Neural Networks Based on Set-boundary Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning has seen rapid growth due to the high amount of data produced in many industries and the increase in computation power. NNs have emerged as a leading candidate computation model for machine learning, which promote the prosperity of artificial intelligence in various fields, such as computer vision  [ref]7, natural language processing   and so on. In recent years, NNs are increasingly applied in safety critical systems. For example, a neural network has been implemented in the ACAS Xu airborne collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft, which is a highly safety-critical system and currently\nbeing developed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Consequently, to gain users’ trust and ease their concerns, it is of vital importance to ensure that NNs are able to produce safe outputs and satisfy the essential safety requirements before the deployment. Safety verification of NNs, which determines whether all outputs of an NN satisfy specified safety requirements via computing output reachable sets, has attracted a huge attention from different communities such as machine learning [ref]29 , formal methods 9  [ref]28, and security  1. Because NNs are generally large, nonlinear, and non-convex, exact computation of output reachable sets is challenging. Although there are some methods on exact reachability analysis such as SMT-based  and polyhedron-based approaches  , they are usually time-consuming and do not scale well. Moreover, these methods are limited to NNs with ReLU activation functions. Consequently, over-approximate reachability analysis, which mainly involves the computation of super sets of output reachable sets, is often resorted to in practice. The over-approximate analysis is usually more efficient and can be applied to more general NNs beyond ReLU ones. Due to these advantages, an increasing attention has been attracted and thus a large amount of computational techniques have been developed for over-approximate reachability analysis . Overly conservative over-approximations, however, often render many\nsafety properties unverifiable in practice. This conservatism\nmainly results from the wrapping effect, which is the accumulation of over-approximation errors through layer-by-layer propagation. As the extent of the wrapping effect correlates strongly with the size of the input set , techniques that partition the input set and independently compute output reachable sets of the resulting subsets are often adapted to reduce the wrapping effect, especially for large input sets. Such partitioning may, however, produce a\nlarge number of subsets, which is generally exponential in the dimensionality. This will induce extensive demand on computation time and memory, often rendering existing reachability analysis techniques not suitable for safety verification of complex NNs in real applications. Therefore, exploring subsets of the input set rather than the entire input set could help reduce computation burdens and thus accelerate computations tremendously. In this work we investigate the safety verification problem of NNs from the topological perspective and extend the set-boundary reachability method, which is originally proposed for verifying safety properties of systems modeled by ODEs in , to safety verification of NNs. In , the set-boundary reachability method only performs over-approximate reachability analysis on the initial set’s boundary rather than the entire initial set to address safety verification problems. It was built upon the homeomorphism property of ODEs. This nice property also widely exists in NNs, and typical NNs are invertible NNs such as neural ODEs  and invertible residual networks . Consequently, it is straightforward to extend the set-boundary reachability method to safety verification of these NNs, just using the boundary of the input set for reachability analysis which does not involve reachability computations of interior points and thus reducing computation burdens in safety verification. Furthermore, we extend the set-boundary reachability method to general NNs via exploiting the local homeomorphism property with respect to the input set. This exploitation is instrumental for constructing a subset of the input set for reachability computations, which is gained via removing a set of points in the input set such that the NN is a homeomorphism with respect to them. The above methods of extracting subsets for performing reachability computations can also be applied to intermediate layers of NNs rather than just between the input and output layers. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on several examples. Main contributions of this paper are listed as follows. We investigate the safety verification problem of NNs from the topological perspective. More concretely, we exploit the homeomorphism property and aim at extracting a subset of the input set rather than the entire input set for reachability computations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the use of the homeomorphism property to address safety verification problems of NNs. This might on its own open research directions on digging into topological properties of facilitating reachability computations for NNs. The proposed method is able to enhance the capabilities and performances of existing reachability computation methods for safety verification of NNs via reducing computation burdens. Based on the homeomorphism property, the computation burdens of solving the safety verification problem can be reduced for invertible NNs. We further show that the computation burdens can also be reduced for more general NNs via exploiting this property on subsets of the input set.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: computation power.
