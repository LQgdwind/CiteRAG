Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

This dataset was used by [ref]3 to create a challenging DG task with single-attribute shifts, having multi-valued classes and attributes over realistic 3D objects. We create a multi-attribute shift dataset (l​i​g​h​t𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡light+a​z​i𝑎𝑧𝑖azi), consisting of a causal connection, 𝑨c​a​u​s​esubscript𝑨𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒\\bm{A}_{cause}\\>=l​i​g​h​t​i​n​g𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔lighting, between lighting and object category Y𝑌Y; and 𝑨i​n​dsubscript𝑨𝑖𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{ind}\\>=a​z​i​m​u​t​h𝑎𝑧𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑡ℎazimuth that varies independently across domains.

Waterbirds. We use the original dataset  where bird type (water or land) (Y𝑌Y) is spuriously correlated with background (𝑨c​a​u​s​esubscript𝑨𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒\\bm{A}_{cause}\\>). To create a multi-attribute setup, we add different weather effects (𝑨i​n​dsubscript𝑨𝑖𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{ind}\\>) to train and test data with probability p𝑝p = 0.5 and 1.0 respectively. Baseline DG algorithms & implementation. We consider baseline algorithms optimizing for different constraints and statistics to compare to causal adaptive regularization: IRM [ref]7, IB-ERM and IB-IRM , VREx , MMD [ref]29, CORAL , DANN , Conditional-MMD (C-MMD) [ref]29, Conditional-DANN (CDANN) , GroupDRO , Mixup , MLDG , SagNet , and RSC .\nFollowing DomainBed , a random search is performed 20 times over the hyperparameter distribution for 3 seeds. The best models obtained across the three seeds are used to compute the mean and standard error. We use a validation set that follows the test domain distribution consistent with previous work on these datasets [ref]7  [ref]3 .
