Indeed, it is common practice to assume a conditionally independent model – without any dependencies between the sources – in popular libraries   and related research [ref]15   , even though methods to learn the intra-LF structure have been proposed   . In natural language processing, 0 consider more relaxed and broader forms of weak supervision and introduce a framework that uses virtual evidence as prior belief over latent\nlabels and their interdependencies, learning an end model jointly with the label model via variational EM.\nAs in the approach proposed in this paper, the aforementioned methods do not assume any labeled training data, i.e. the downstream model is learned based solely on outputs of multiple LFs on unlabeled data.\nThe traditional co-training paradigm  on the other hand is similar in spirit but requires some labeled data to be available. Recent methods that study the co-training setup where labeled training data supplements multiple WS sources, include [ref]3 5.\nNote that the experiments in [ref]3 5 rely on large pre-trained language models, making the applicability of the approach without such models or to non-text domains unclear. Crowdsourcing  \nAggregating multiple noisy labels is also a core problem studied in the crowdsourcing literature. Common approaches model worker performance and the unknown label jointly [ref]15  2 using expectation maximization (EM) or similar approaches. Some core differences to learning from weak supervision sources are that errors by crowdworkers are usually assumed to be random, and that task assignment is not always fixed but can be optimized for.\nThe benefits of jointly optimizing the downstream model and the aggregator of the weak sources have been recognized in multiple end-to-end methods that have been proposed for the crowdsourcing problem setting  2 1 7  . They often focus on image labeling and EM-like algorithms for modeling and aggregating the workers.\nImportantly, our proposed approach can be used in general applications with weak supervision from multiple sources without any restrictive assumptions specific to crowdsourcing, and we show that our approach outperforms the aforementioned methods on a crowdsourcing benchmark task.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Multi-source Weak Supervision  \nThe data programming paradigm [ref]30 allows users to programmatically label data through multiple noisy sources of labels, by treating the true label as a latent variable of a generative PGM.\nSeveral approaches for learning the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
