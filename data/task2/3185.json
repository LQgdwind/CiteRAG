      "content": "Paper Title: An original model for multi-target learning of logical rules for knowledge graph reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge storage, representation and its causal relationship between each other, inspired by\nhuman problem solving, is to help intelligent systems understand human knowledge and gain the\nability to deal with complicated tasks  .\nKnowledge graphs (KGs), as a form of structured human knowledge, are collections of real-world factual triplets,\nwhere each triplet (s,p,o)ùë†ùëùùëú(s,p,o) denotes a predicate (a.k.a. relation) between the subject sùë†s and\nthe object oùëúo. Subjects and objects are usually called entities in KGs,\ne.g., the fact that Beijing is the capital of China\ncan be represented by (Beijing, capitalOf, China). Knowledge graphs\nare now widely used in a variety of applications such as recommender systems  \nand question answering  . Recently knowledge graphs\nhave drawn growing interests in both academia and industry communities\n  . However, because of the nature of rapid iteration and incompleteness of data, there are usually missing\nfacts in existing KGs. For example, we now have the fact(s) that Thiago Messi, Mateo Messi and\nCiro Messi are sons of Leo Messi, but in our KG there might be missing information about the relationship\nbetween the three brothers. A typical task is link prediction which is supposed to complete the\nrelation between two entities by reasoning on given facts. This paper studies learning\nfirst-order logical rules for knowledge graph reasoning (KGR). As illustrated in Fig. 1,\nthere is a rule in form of logic programming as sisterOf(XùëãX, ZùëçZ) ‚àß\\wedge\nsonOf(ZùëçZ, YùëåY) ‚áí‚áí\\Rightarrow daughterOf(XùëãX, YùëåY),\nmeaning that if XùëãX is a sister of ZùëçZ and YùëåY has a son ZùëçZ,\nthen we can infer that XùëãX is the daughter of YùëåY. Such logical rules gain strong interpretability\n  and can be applied for reasoning new facts and\ngeneralized to previously unseen domains and data without retraining the model .\nThe same might not be true for embedding methods like TransE [ref]5. Mining collections of relational rules is a subtask of statistical relational learning\n, and when the procedure involves learning new logical rules,\nit is often called inductive logic programming .\nTraditional methods such as Path Ranking [ref]23\nand Markov Logic Networks  failed to learn the structure\n(i.e. logical rules in discrete space) and the parameters (i.e. continuous confidence associated\nwith each rule) simultaneously. The Neural LP method ,\na fully end-to-end differentiable neural system, first combines learning rule structures\nas well as appropriate scores. Unluckily, Neural LP and current Neural LP-based methods\nlack attempts in multi-target scenarios, where there may be multiple objects\nconnecting by the same relation with one subject. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge,\nalthough there are metrics for evaluating models in knowledge graph completion tasks,\nthere is still an absence in assessing the quality of mined logical rules. In this paper, with reference to previous research in graph theory, we firstly propose two\nnovel indicators saturation and bifurcation that help with the evaluation\nin KGR tasks. Saturation helps to investigate the interpretability of learned rules,\nwhile bifurcation serves as a supplement to traditional metrics on reasoning performance.\nThen we explore Multi-target Probabilistic Logic Reasoning (MPLR):\nan extension to Neural LP framework that allows for reasoning in multi-target cases.\nOur approach reformulates the equations and improves the representation of entity and\nthe method to optimize the model, which enable our model to learn over more facts in the KG.\nWe apply the indicators to several knowledge graph benchmarks for better understanding of\ntheir data structure. Further, we evaluate our model on these datasets and experimentally show that\nour model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for knowledge graph reasoning.\nIn addition, MPLR is able to generate high-quality logical rules. Our work is related to previous efforts on the task of link prediction,\nwhich can be categorized into two main streams: knowledge graph embedding and logical rule learning. Knowledge graph embedding. Preliminary research on knowledge graph completion focused on\nlearning low-dimensional embedding for link prediction, and we term those methods as embedding-based methods.\nRepresentative methods, including TransE [ref]5, TransR ,\nComplEx , etc., infer facts by projecting entities and relations\nonto a semantic space and perform algebraic operations on that space.\nSpecifically, TransE [ref]5 presents factual triplets in d‚Äã-ùëë-d\\mbox{-}dimensional\nrepresentation space, s,p,o‚àà‚Ñùdùë†ùëùùëúsuperscript‚Ñùùëës,p,o\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} and makes embeddings follow the\ntranslational principle s+p‚âàoùë†ùëùùëús+p\\approx o. TransR  tackles the problem of\ninsufficient representation ability of single space, and utilizes separate spaces for\nentities and relations. ComplEx  is the first to introduce complex vector\nspace which can capture both symmetric and antisymmetric relations. In this space, s,p,o‚àà‚ÑÇdùë†ùëùùëúsuperscript‚ÑÇùëës,p,o\\in\\mathbb{C}^{d},\ne.g., sùë†s can be denoted as s=Re‚Äã(s)+i‚ÄãIm‚Äã(s)ùë†Reùë†ùëñImùë†s=\\texttt{Re}(s)+i\\texttt{Im}(s) where Re(sùë†s) and\nIm(sùë†s) are real and imaginary parts of sùë†s respectively.\nUnfortunately, one of the main\ndifficulties faced by embedding-based methods is the sparsity problem where their capability of\nencoding sparse entities is far from satisfactory [ref]55.\nWe also notice that recently there are methods trying to leverage logical rules into knowledge graph\nembedding [ref]55 , where they explore new triplets\nfrom the existing ones in the KG using pre-defined logical rules to deal with the sparsity problem.\n\nHowever, these sort of methods are still implemented in a black-box way, which is uninterpretable to human. Relation path reasoning. Learning relational rules has been previously studied in\nthe field of inductive logic programming (ILP) . These methods\noften learn a probability as a confidence score for each rule between query entities and answer entities.\nAmong these studies, Path-Ranking Algorithm (PRA) [ref]23 enumerates relational\npaths under a combination of path constraints and perform maximum-likelihood classification.\nMarkov Logic Networks  and Probabilistic Personalized Page Rank (ProPPR)\n equip logical rules with probability, so that one can leverage path information\nover the graph structure. Although ILP takes advantage of the interpretability of mined rules,\nthese methods typically require both positive and negative examples and suffer from\na potentially large version space, which is a critical shortage since most modern\nKGs are huge and contain only positive instances. Neural logic programming. Extending the idea by simultaneously learning logical rules and the\nweights in a gradient-based way, Neural LP  is the first\nend-to-end differentiable approach to combine continuous parameters and discrete structure of rules.\nSome recent methods    have improved the work\ndone by Neural LP  in different manners. DRUM \nintroduces tensor approximation for optimization and Neural-Num-LP \naddresses the limitation in mining numerical features like age and weight.\nHowever, the existing Neural LP-based methods needs a large proportion of triplets\nin preparation for constructing the graph structure, which can not make full use of the training data.\nMoreover, these models fail in the situation of multi-target inference in contrast to our work. Related research in graph theory. Although ILP shortens the gap between\nreasoning on KGs and interpretability, there is still a lack of a way to\nindicate the quality of learned rules. Inspired by accumulating studies such as k-saturated graphs\n and minimum saturated graphs , we propose\nsaturation concept as a complement in measuring the quality of rules.\nBesides, we also define bifurcation indicator to help with current metrics for evaluating\nreasoning models from the perspective of graph structure. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose two novel indicators as our extra performance metrics to evaluate models in experiment,\none for reasoning accuracy on the task of knowledge graph completion, and the other for\nthe feasibility of mined rules by our model. To tackle the problem of multi-target reasoning, which many existing methods fail to\naddress, we develop a model based on logical rule learning, called MPLR. The proposed method\nrepresents knowledge in a multi-target form and develops a corresponding formulation to\neliminate the side effects brought by learning over multiple factual triplets simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets with traditional metrics as well as our\nproposed indictors prove that our MPLR model outperforms baseline models, and more importantly,\nis capable of mining meaningful rules from knowledge graphs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, in Section 2,\nwe briefly review the basic concepts of knowledge graphs and propose the novel indicators by\ngiving definitions. Then, Section 3 introduces our proposed MPLR model for learning\nlogical rules on knowledge graphs in multi-target scenarios. Next, we conduct a series of comparative\nexperiments and the experimental results are reported in Section 4. Finally,\nwe conclude our work together with our future direction.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and can be applied for reasoning new facts and\ngeneralized to previously unseen domains and data without retraining the model .\nThe same might not be true for embedding methods like TransE [ref]5.
