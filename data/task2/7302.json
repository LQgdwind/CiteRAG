      "content": "Paper Title: EMP: Effective Multidimensional Persistence for Graph Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our model with three types of state-of-the-art baselines, covering six graph kernels, six graph neural networks (GNNs), and one topological method. Graph kernels: (i) comprised of the subgraph matching kernel (CSM) , (ii) Shortest\nPath Hash Graph Kernel (HGK-SP) , (iii) WL Hash\nGraph Kernel (HGK-WL) , (iv) Multiscale Laplacian\nGraph Kernel (MLG) , (v) Weisfeiler–\nLehman (WL) [ref]39, and (vi) WL Optimal Assignment (WL-OA) ; topological method: filtration curves (FC-V) [ref]41, six graph neural networks including GCN, DGCNN, Diffpool, ECC, GIN, GraphSage which are compared in [ref]42. We report the best results of these six GNNs in the GNNs row in Table 1. For each dataset, we report our best performing model (Table 3). For all methods, we report the average accuracy of 10 runs of 10-fold CV along with the standard deviation. Table 1 shows the results of different methods on nine graph datasets. Out-of-time (OOT) results indicate that a method could not complete the classification task within 12 hours, and OOM means “out-of-memory” (from an allocation of 128 GB RAM). In Table 2, we further compare our EMP model with other existing MultiPersistence vectorizations in the literature. Namely, MP landscapes (MP-L) , MP Images (MP-I) , multiparameter persistence kernel (MP-K) , the generalized rank invariant landscape (GRIL) , and MP Hilbert and Euler characteristic functions (MP-H and MP-E)  and MP Signed Barcodes (MP-SB)  where we reported the best of the four different vectorizations namely, MP-HSM-C, MP-ESM-C, MP-ESM-SW, MP-HSM-SW. We observe the following phenomena: Compared with all baselines, out of 9 benchmark datasets, the proposed EMP summaries achieve the best performance on 5 datasets (BZR_MD, DFHR_MD, MUTAG, IMDB-B, REDDIT-B), and second best in 2 datasets (COX2_MD, REDDIT-5K). EMP summary consistently outperforms Filtration Curves on all datasets except COX2_MD and PROTEINS, indicating that the multiparameter structure of the EMP summaries can better capture the complex structural properties and local topological information in heterogeneous graphs. When compared with other Multipersistence Vectorizations, EMP consistently ranks among top two performances. Moreover, EMP Summaries consistently deliver competitive results with GNNs and kernel methods in all benchmark datasets.\nThis indicates that EMP summary introduces powerful topological and geometric schemes for node features and graph representation learning.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: the subgraph matching kernel (CSM) , (ii) Shortest\nPath Hash Graph Kernel (HGK-SP) , (iii) WL Hash\nGraph Kernel (HGK-WL) , (iv) Multiscale Laplacian\nGraph Kernel (MLG) , (v) Weisfeiler–\nLehman (WL) [ref]39, and (vi) WL Optimal Assignment (WL-OA) ; topological method: filtration curves (FC-V) [ref]41, six graph neural networks including GCN, DGCNN, Diffpool, ECC, GIN, GraphSage which are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
