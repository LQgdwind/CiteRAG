The method has\nbeen presented for solid/liquid phase change for identical conductivity\nin the solid and the liquid in , and\nfor unequal conductivity in  .\nThat approach considers the ratio Œµ=W/d0ùúÄùëäsubscriptùëë0\\varepsilon=W/d_{0} as small\nparameter of expansion where d0subscriptùëë0d_{0} is the capillary length. This\nchoice of ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon yields a correction of second order on the\nkinetic coefficient Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta. That correction makes possible to cancel\nŒ≤ùõΩ\\beta, if desired, by choosing appropriately the parameters ŒªùúÜ\\lambda,\nWùëäW and MœïsubscriptùëÄitalic-œïM_{\\phi} of the phase-field model. Based on that analysis,\nthe anti-trapping current was derived in . The matched asymptotic expansions have been applied in \nfor dilute binary mixture with anti-trapping current and Ds=0subscriptùê∑ùë†0D_{s}=0.\nIn  the analysis has been\ndone for coupling with temperature. The case Ds‚â†0subscriptùê∑ùë†0D_{s}\\neq 0 with anti-trapping\ncurrent has been studied in . In reference\n[ref]44 the method has been applied to investigate\nthe impact of one additional term in the phase-field equation which\nis derived from a variational formulation. Finally, the method has\nbeen applied recently for coupling with fluid flow in .\nA pedagogical presentation of that method can be found in the Appendix\nof  which takes into account the\nanti-trapping current with Ds=0subscriptùê∑ùë†0D_{s}=0.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: current and Ds=0subscriptùê∑ùë†0D_{s}=0.\nIn  the analysis has been\ndone for coupling with temperature.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
