      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Generating Real-World Time Series Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime series data recorded by sensors become ubiquitous in many areas including healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing and many others . However, many of these data are highly confidential, e.g., patient records, which may cause privacy or accessibility concerns when using them   [ref]4  [ref]6. Generating synthetic data for applications, e.g., follow-up machine learning tasks has recently become one of the promising solutions [ref]6 [ref]4.\nAlthough lack of theoretical guarantee, recent works proved that the generated data can be resilient to membership inference attack , patient re-identification [ref]4, etc. More importantly, the generated data are often of higher utility than anonymization/perturbation methods [ref]4. Generating realistic time series data is a challenging problem [ref]7.\nA good generative model should not only capture the multidimensional distribution at each time point but also the temporal dynamics across time.\nFurther, synthetic time series should reflect corresponding global features, e.g., static features like age and the labels of our interests such as mortality in clinical data.\nRecently, due to the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  and its variants  0, it is natural to extend the GAN framework for time series data generation by applying recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the generator and the discriminator. Following this paradigm, several works were proposed to solve the generation problems on time series data 1 [ref]6  2 [ref]7.\nHowever, these works are usually targeted at generation for simple, well-formatted time series data, thus may not be applicable to real-world time series data generation as shown in our empirical studies. The imperfect real-world time series data raise new challenges to the data generation algorithms. 1) Long sequences with variable lengths. The lengths of real-world time series data can be long, variable and sometimes critical, e.g., in survival analysis 3 4. However, many existing methods [ref]6  [ref]7 were only evaluated on short, fixed-length time series, leaving their performance on long, variable-length time series unexplored. 2) Missing values. Missing values are very common in real-world time series data. An example in clinical data for mortality prediction is shown in Figure 1. These missing values can be informative 5. For instance, missing values in clinical data can reflect the patient’s situation and the physician’s decision 6. And more and more works are focusing on exploiting the missing patterns to improve prediction performance 7 8 9 0 1 2. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works has considered generating time series with informative missing values. In this paper, we propose the Real-world Time Series Generative Adversarial Network (RTSGAN), a novel generative framework to tackle the aforementioned challenges. RTSGAN consists of two key components: 1) an encoder-decoder module, which learns to encode each time series instance into a fixed-dimension latent vector and reconstruct the whole time series from the latent vector via an autoencoder; and 2) a generation module, in which a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) 0 is trained to generate vectors in the same latent space of the above autoencoder. By using the generator and the decoder, RTSGAN is able to generate real-world time series data which respect the original feature distributions and the temporal dynamics. To better address the informative missing issue, we extend RTSGAN to RTSGAN-M: an observation embedding is proposed to enrich the information at each time step, and a novel decide-and-generate decoder is also proposed which first decides the time and missing patterns of the next step and then generates the corresponding feature values based on both local and global dependencies.\nEmpirical studies on four real-world time series datasets show that synthetic data generated by the proposed framework are not only more “realistic-looking”, but also with higher utility for downstream machine learning tasks in the “train on synthetic, test on real (TSTR)” setting [ref]6. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a novel time series data generation framework named RTSGAN to tackle the challenges raised by real-world time series data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the problem of generating time series with missing values, in which an observation embedding and a novel decide-and-generate decoder in RTSGAN-M are proposed to achieve better generation performance. Detailed experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets including both complete, fixed-length time series and incomplete, variable-length time series, in which RTSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of synthetic data utility in downstream classification and prediction tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: agriculture, manufacturing and many others .
