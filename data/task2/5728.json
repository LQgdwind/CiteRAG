      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Phytoplankton Parasite Detection Using Autoencoders\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the first step of anomaly detection, we use AE models trained only on the OK data to reconstruct unknown input samples of both OK and NOK classes. Because of the non-optimal generalisation ability of the AE models and training only on the OK class of data, we hypothesize that data from the NOK class will be reconstructed worse than the data from the OK class as described in . To better understand the effect of the AE architecture’s core and the complexity of the convolutional encoding and decoding layers, we decided to build our implementation so that the core of the model could be combined with the selected convolutional pairs of the encoders and the decoders. This allows us to analyze contributions of the selected architecture and the convolutional layers separately. For the AE cores, we evaluated five different options. As the first ones, we used implementations of the basic convolutional AE  as the BAE1 core, convolutional variational AE  as the VAE1 core and the vector-quantized AE [ref]12 as the VQVAE1 core. Besides those cores, we tried to further reduce the features extracted by an encoder by inserting fully-connected layers to the basic convolutional AE as the BAE2 core [ref]36 and to the variational AE as the VAE2 core. Described modifications are shown in Fig. 3. (a)                                               (b) We expect that the basic convolutional AE is going to be surpassed by both variational and the vector-quantized cores, because of their non-probabilistic encoding space, which allows the encoding of more anomalies residuum. The quality of reconstructed images should be better in the case of the basic and vector-quantized cores than in the case of variational ones, which typically produce blurry outputs. When training on different classes, the best results are expected from the vector-quantized core, which are supposed to create separable clusters for each class in the encoded space. Besides the AEs cores described above, we consider six pairs of convolutional encoding and decoding layer architectures, whose structure is described in the complementary tables Table 5 for encoders and in Table 6 for decoders. Each convolutional layer or block described in those tables is complemented with the batch normalization layer. Activation function was set as Leaky ReLu by the ConvM1 architecture and as ReLu for the rest. The tested convolutional layers go from the most complex ConvM2 suggested for the anomaly detection in [ref]19 and ConvM1 architectures, where we expect the ability to reconstruct fine features and details, to the more simple architectures ConvM5, ConvM4 and ConvM3. By the more simple architectures, we expect that the fine features and smaller image structures are going to be suppressed and that they might perform better on the shape or structure anomalies. The last architecture ConvM6 is unsymmetrical as suggested in  and it uses a more complex encoder of the ConvM5 architecture and a simpler decoder of the ConvM4 architecture. By this architecture, we expect that the anomalies, which would be propagated to the encoded space, will be further suppressed by the decoder reconstruction. In the optimal case, anomalous areas of the original image are removed during the image reconstruction as shown in Fig. 1. A difference image between the original sample and the reconstructed sample is computed and used in the feature extraction.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: five different options. As the first ones, we used implementations of the basic convolutional AE  as the BAE1 core, convolutional variational AE  as the VAE1 core and the vector-quantized AE [ref]12 as the VQVAE1 core. Besides those cores, we tried to further reduce the features extracted by an encoder by inserting fully-connected layers to the basic convolutional AE as the BAE2\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
