      "content": "Paper Title: OFEI: A Semi-black-box Android Adversarial Sample Attack Framework Against DLaaS\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has been widely used in various tasks, such as vision, speech recognition, language processing, and financial fraud detection. With deep learning, large data sets can be used to achieve higher accuracy than was possible with previous classification techniques[ref]18. With the emergence of deep learning as a service (DLaaS), it is easier to apply deep learning to the processing of complex data in many fields. On the DLaaS platforms provided by Microsoft and Google, users can directly use the deep learning services. In Android malware detection, DLaaS can be used to effectively identify various variants of malware. Although deep learning is powerful, the deep learning algorithm is the weakest part of the DLaaS system. Because the deep learning algorithm is designed on the premise of the equivalent probability distribution of training data and testing data, attackers can carefully design attacks that do not adhere to this hypothesis to achieve the effect of deceiving the neural network . Recent research has shown that attackers can easily change the output of a deep neural network (DNN) by adding relatively small disturbances to the input. Therefore, many effective algorithms have been proposed to construct adversarial samples [ref]7 and the attacker can launch a variety of attacks on the DNN in the testing phase. This paper mainly studies evasion attacks on malware detection. Without affecting the training data, the attacker carefully interferes with a malicious instance so that it is incorrectly identified as benign by the trained model. Fortunately, the attacker cannot obtain the architecture and parameters of the model in DLaaS. Because DLaaS is a black box system, attackers can only call the corresponding APIs to obtain useful information [ref]10. Therefore, the DLaaS deployed on the cloud is more difficult to attack, which provides a sense of security to users. However, recent research has shown that attacks on cloud services can occur. Attackers can attack the model by querying the parameters and architecture of the cloud service model , which consumes many resources in reality. Transferring learning attacks relies on a large collection of open-source models. The adversarial samples are transferred between the models trained on the same data set . In addition, the attacker can also deceive the Google Cloud Vision API  by performing a spatial transformation on the image. A large number of attacks are aimed at image classification on DLaaS. To the best of our knowledge, there is no semi-black-box attack method to craft adversarial samples against DLaaS-based Android malware detection model. In the image field, the production of adversarial samples for DNNs usually involves adding a small amount of carefully adjusted perturbations, which are imperceptible to the human eye. The modified images are identified as completely different categories by the classifier. However, the attack algorithm used to craft adversarial samples needs to modify too many pixels in each iteration to deceive the target classifier. Different from adversarial images, there are strict restrictions on the production of Android adversarial samples, which are as follows: 1) The features of Android adversarial samples are usually not represented by continuous real numbers. For example, Android applications use or do not use a certain system call. Therefore, a binary value vector is used to represent an application. 2) The attacker must interfere with the application program without destroying the application program function to maintain the discreteness of the features. Unlike the continuous change of pixel values in the image, to ensure that the functions of the original Android package (APK) are not damaged, we can not delete the features in the adversarial sample and only add a limited number of features. To ensure that Android malware classification based on DLaaS has a more secure DNN interface, we mainly study the characteristics of Android adversarial samples to further understand attacks. Finding the characteristics of the adversarial area is the key to providing a good defense. Szegedy  believes that an adversarial area is a place with low probability density. Therefore, Feinman  proposed the use of kernel density detection against samples. However, this density-based method often has limitations in regard to representing the adversarial areas. When the adversarial sample and the normal sample are surrounded by the same number of samples, they cannot be distinguished. Ma X  proposed local intrinsic dimensions to describe the local structure around the adversarial sample. It regards the space surrounding the adversarial sample as a subspace that spans multiple manifolds. The local intrinsic dimension of this subspace is larger than any one of these manifolds considered separately. It is different from measuring the characteristics of the adversarial space through the neighbors of the adversarial sample. We use the Bayesian uncertainty estimation to solve the situation where density estimation cannot distinguish adversarial samples. Aleatoric uncertainty (AU) is the inherent noise in the data, which may be an error generated by extracting features from malware. Epistemic uncertainty (EU) is an error of the trained model. We use these two types of uncertainties  to construct the combined uncertainty, which characterizes the adversarial area and distinguishes the adversarial sample from the normal sample for defense. In this paper, we aim to study the attack and defense framework for Android malware classification based on DLaaS. In particular, our contributions are as follows: We propose a semi-black-box attack method, i.e., one-feature-each-iteration (OFEI), in the Android adversarial sample scenario. This method only needs to obtain probabilistic labels from DLaaS and perturbs one feature each iteration through the simulated annealing algorithm to deceive the DNN classifier. On the Virusshare  and Contagio  datasets, the OFEI achieves similar effects to the white-box attack algorithm JSMF . Compared with GenAttack  and pointwise attack , the OFEI has a higher misclassification rate and less disturbance. In addition, OFEI has fewer queries on DLaaS. Since gradient information is not required, the OFEI can attack many types of DNNs, even network structures with difficult gradient calculations. The OFEI we proposed can be used as an attack framework to convert the white-box attack algorithm that was originally not suitable for Android adversarial sample production into an attack algorithm for Android adversarial samples. To make DLaaS more secure, we propose a defense mechanism against attacks on Android malicious samples. Under the Bayesian neural network, we detect the combined uncertainty differences between adversarial samples and normal samples. The detection effect of this method is better than that of local intrinsic dimension and kernel density, and the detection rate reaches 99.28%. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the related work about adversarial sample attacks and defense against DLaaSs. Section 3 introduces the groundwork of this paper. In Section 4, we show the proposed OFEI attack framework. Section 5 discusses the uncertainty to defend against adversarial sample attacks. Section 6 analyzes the experimental results. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: recognition, language processing, and financial fraud detection.
