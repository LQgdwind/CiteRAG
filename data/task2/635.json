Reeb graphs have become increasingly useful in a wide range of applications, including settings such as\nshape comparison  8,\ndenoising ,\nshape understanding  ,\nreconstructing non-linear 1-dimensional structure in data    ,\nsummarizing collections of trajectory data ,\nand allowing for informed exploration of otherwise hard-to-visualize high-dimensional data  ; see  for a survey of these and more topics.\nAs a result, there is interest in defining metrics on these objects, to evaluate their quality in the face of noisy input data as well as to allow for more accurate shape comparison and analysis.\nIn this setting, we are focused on metrics that incorporate both the graph and function information: so d​((G,f1),(G,f2))𝑑𝐺subscript𝑓1𝐺subscript𝑓2d((G,f_{1}),(G,f_{2})) should be non-zero if f1≠f2subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2f_{1}\\neq f_{2} even though they are defined on the same underlying graphs. Several metrics have arisen recently to do this, taking inspiration from different mathematical backgrounds   [ref]3     8 .\nIn this paper, we focus on the Reeb graph interleaving distance .\nThe basic idea is to work with a notion of smoothing, which returns a parameterized family of Reeb graphs, Sε​(G,f)subscript𝑆𝜀𝐺𝑓S_{\\varepsilon}(G,f) for every ε≥0𝜀0\\varepsilon\\geq 0, starting with ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0 which leaves the input unchanged.\nThis procedure simplifies the loop structures and stretches tails 5; see Fig. 1 for an example.\nThen the goal is to find an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-interleaving, which is a pair of families of maps making a particular diagram commute.\nIf ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0, this diagram simplifies down to finding an isomorphism between the two Reeb graphs; increasing ε𝜀\\varepsilon provides more flexibility to find such pairs of maps.\nThen we have a metric by defining dI​((G,f),(Hh))subscript𝑑𝐼𝐺𝑓subscript𝐻ℎd_{I}((G,f),(H_{h})) to be the infimum over the set of ε𝜀\\varepsilon for which such a diagram exists. This metric takes root in the interleaving distance defined for persistence modules 7, and is largely inspired by the subsequent category theoretic treatment 3 2.\nThis viewpoint comes from encoding the data of a Reeb graph in a constructible set-valued cosheaf 0 1.\nIt was later shown that these metrics are special cases of a more general theory of interleaving distances given on a category with a flow 3 9 9.\nThis framework encompases common metrics including ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} distance on points or functions, regular Hausdorff distance, and the Gromov-Hausdorff distance 9 4.\nUsing this framework, interleaving metrics have been studied in the context of\nℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-spaces ,\nmultiparameter persistence modules ,\nmerge trees , and\nformigrams  ,\nand on more general category theoretic constructions 0 6.\nThere are also interesting restrictions to labeled merge trees, where one can pass to a matrix representation and show that the interleaving distance is equivalent to the point-wise ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} distance\n  4 0. On the negative side, it has been shown that Reeb graph interleaving is graph isomorphism complete  [ref]6, and that many other variants are also NP-hard [ref]6 . All of this means that these metrics, while mathematically interesting, may not lead to feasible algorithms for comparison and analysis.\nHowever, a glimmer of hope arises with work investigating fixed parameter tractable algorithms 9 0.\nDespite the issues of computational complexity, notions of similarity for graphs in general, and Reeb graphs in particular, are of pressing interest due to their extensive use in data analysis; in many such settings, we are concerned with questions of quality in the face of noise, and understanding convergence of approximations to a true underlying structure.\nFor example, the interleaving distance has been used in evaluating the quality of the mapper graph 7, which can be proven to be a approximation of the Reeb graph using this metric 0 1.\nFurthermore, there is considerable interest in unifying the interleaving distance with the emerging collection of other Reeb graph metrics. In this paper, we introduce a truncation operation, which intuitively cuts off portions of the Reeb graph near local extrema with respect to f𝑓f; this operation is easy to compute for any Reeb graph and tends to result in a simplified Reeb graph.\nWe show that truncation is a functor, and when combined with the smoothing functor, defines a flow on the the category of Reeb graphs.\nWe investigate and prove particularly desirable geometric and topological properties of truncated smoothing for certain ranges of the two parameters controlling the functors.\nWe then introduce a new family of metrics for Reeb graphs, called truncated interleaving distances.\nThey are parameterized by m∈ 𝑚01m\\in , and generalize the interleaving distance, with the setting m=0𝑚0m=0 being the original interleaving distance.\nWe show that the metrics arising from m∈[0,1)𝑚01m\\in[0,1) are strongly equivalent.\nAlthough the metrics are not stable in the sense of [ref]3, strong equivalence implies that they are at least stable up to a constant. When combined with preliminary work on geometric implications of smoothing 5, truncated smoothing is interesting in its own right, as it provides a collection of paths for Reeb graph space to be studied in terms of the resulting persistence diagrams. It also is useful when considering algorithms to test planarity for Reeb graphs, or find planar representations of them.\nThe new family of metrics also provide the possibility for new approaches for approximation algorithms for the interleaving distance, as well as\nnew avenues for further unification of the broader family of Reeb graph metrics. We give the basic background on Reeb graphs, smoothing, and the Reeb graph interleaving distance in Section 2.1, with more complete details on categories and interleavings given in Section 3.\nNext, we introduce our definition of truncated smoothing in Section 2.2; again, some alternative formulations and full justification are in Section 4.\nIn Section 2.2.1 we check properties of the truncated smoothing operation, with complete proofs given in Section 5.\nThen we take a categorical view of truncated smoothing to develop a family of metrics and investigate their properties in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, including the relevant technicalities in Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9.\nFinally, some implications of our work as well as possible future directions are discussed in Section 10.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: f_{2} even though they are defined on the same underlying graphs.
