      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Vision-and-Language Pre-training with Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate TRIPS on the four downstream vision-language tasks. The hyperparameters that we use for finetuning on the downstream tasks are listed in Table 11. Following ¬†4, all tasks adopt RandAugment, AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.05 and a cosine learning rate schedule. Next, we introduce the dataset settings in detail. The VQA task ¬† requires the model to answer natural language questions given an image. Most methods¬†  7 [ref]52 deal with visual question answering tasks as multi-label classification on pre-defined answer sets. This strategy achieves strong performance, but it is not suitable for real-world open scenarios. We conduct an experiment on the VQA2.0 dataset¬†4, which contains 83k/41k/81k images for training/validation/test. Following ¬†4, we use both training and validation splits for training, and incorporate additional training data from Visual Genome¬†. Following 7, we concatenate the question with the object labels and OCR tokens extracted from the image. Image captioning requires generating a descriptive and fluent caption for a given image. We evaluate the performance of TRIPS on two popular datasets: COCO Caption¬† and NoCaps¬†. We fine-tune TRIPS-mPLUG on the training set of COCO Caption and test it on the same Karpathy split¬†7 [ref]52 as well as the NoCaps validation set. To fine-tune TRIPS-mPLUG on COCO Caption, we follow the approach in¬†7 and first train the model with the cross-entropy loss for 5 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of 256. We then further fine-tune the model with CIDEr optimization¬† for an additional 5 epochs with a smaller learning rate of 8e-7. We use the best checkpoint on COCO Caption to predict on the NoCaps validation set.\nDuring inference, we use beam search with a beam size of 10 and set the maximum generation length to 20. We conducted experiments on both image-to-text retrieval (TR) and text-to-image retrieval (IR) using the COCO¬† and Flickr30K¬† datasets and used the widely-used Karpathy split¬†9 for both. COCO contains 113k/5k/5k images for train/validation/test, while Flickr30K contains 29k/1k/1k images for train/validation/test. During fine-tuning, for TRIPS-ALBEF and TRIPS-mPLUG we jointly optimized the ITC loss and the ITM loss following the approach in¬†4 5. During inference, we first selected the top-k candidates by computing the dot-product similarity between the image and text encoder features (We set k=256ùëò256k=256 for COCO and k=128ùëò128k=128 for Flickr30K). For the efficiency of coarse-grained ranking, we directly selected the patch based on the attention weights of the image [CLS] token to other patch tokens. The task of visual grounding involves localizing the referred object in an image given a plain text query. Instead of directly regressing bounding boxes, our approach concatenates visual features with textual features, which are then fed into the multi-modal decoder to predict the object‚Äôs coordinates. We evaluate our method on the referring expression grounding dataset: RefCOCO+. The RefCOCO+ dataset contains 19K images and 141K queries. The NLVR2¬† task requires the model to predict whether a sentence. We conduct experiments following the original train/val/test split in ¬†. Following 5, we use two cross-attention layers to process the two input images, and their outputs are merged and fed to the FFN. An MLP classifier is then applied to the output embedding of the language [CLS] token.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: 0.05 and a cosine learning rate schedule.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
