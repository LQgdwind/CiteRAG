      "content": "Paper Title: Relational Reasoning Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnriching deep learning models with explicit reasoning capabilities is a fundamental challenge in the AI agenda to realize semantically sound, robust and trustworthy AI systems [ref]1   . This is especially relevant for industrial applications, where (potentially large) relational databases are generally available as input knowledge to solve different tasks like query answering or knowledge base completion.\nA powerful class of methodologies  uses logic formulas as templates for Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM), which explicitly encode statistical dependencies among entities and their relationships. However, the application of these methods has been strongly limited due to their computational complexity. An interesting line of research is represented by solutions focusing\non reasoning over a set of objects represented via trainable embeddings , like Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE). Once the entities and relations are embedded, it is possible to use classical distance-based or neural-based decision functions to generalize the knowledge to new embedded facts, while scaling to very large domains.\nHowever, a limitation of these approaches is that they model statistical regularities among relations and/or entities but they fail to detect and exploit higher level logical knowledge, like formulas or programs. \nDevising a model that can effectively and efficiently preserve and integrate the benefits of embedded representations, probabilistic logic inference and neural architectures is still an open research problem.\nIn this regard, the presented work represents a relevant step forward towards this integration,\nas it enables to perform probabilistic logic reasoning on embedding representations by means of neural computations.\nThis claim is also supported by achieving state-of-the-art results in the experimental analysis. This paper introduces Relational Reasoning Networks (R2N), a class of models that exploits logic knowledge in a relational domain to define its structure and to produce semantically refined embedding representations.\nR2Ns jointly develop integrated representations for constants, ground atoms and ground knowledge by computing multiple sub-symbolic reasoning steps in a latent space.\nThe learning of embedding representations allows the model to automatically select whether and how much some specific logic knowledge is useful for the specific task. As a result, R2Ns maintain enough expressive power to perform relational reasoning under uncertainty, while allowing to scale up to larger relational settings compared to PGM-based approaches.\nR2N inference mechanism is divided into three phases. Firstly, symbolic ground atoms\nare embedded in a latent space using representation learning techniques, e.g. KGE. Secondly, the relations among atoms provided in the logic theory are used to sub-symbolically aggregate and refine the atom embeddings in a multi-layer fashion. This phase resembles multi-hop automated reasoning, as we discuss in Sec. VII, but in a latent space. Embedding representations of the correlated groups of atoms, i.e. ground logic rules,\nare also computed in this phase.\nLastly, the final embedding representations are used to make predictions. These predictions can be used to train the model end-to-end with respect to a supervised task. Contributions. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a neuro-symbolic architecture performing relational reasoning in a latent space. Distilling the relational structure at the embedding level allows to perform both learning and reasoning in a more scalable way. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach achieving state-of-the-art results on different experimental settings.\nIn addition, the proposed methodology is very general, as it can be used both in relational tasks where the prior logic knowledge is explicitly available, even if noisy (e.g. predictions can deviate from the knowledge with a variable degree that must be co-learned), and in tasks where the relational structure is present but left latent. Last but not least, the methodology provides a general platform for neuro-symbolic integration , as it can be transparently applied to pure symbolic inputs, or to cases where the inputs have a feature-based representation, like images.\nThe experimental section provides examples of applications of all these cases. The outline of the paper is the following:\nSec. II summarizes basic notions relevant to define our model, while Sec. III explicitly formulates the problem statement that is solved by the proposed model. Sec. IV presents the model\nand how it approximates the reasoning process,\nSec. V provides insights and theoretical guarantees for the reasoning process implemented by R2Ns, and Sec. VI shows the experimental results on multiple datasets and learning tasks.\nFinally, Sec. VII presents an overview of related works, while some conclusions and remarks on future works are drawn in Sec. VIII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Enriching deep learning models with explicit reasoning capabilities is a fundamental challenge in the AI agenda to realize semantically sound, robust and trustworthy AI systems [ref]1   .
