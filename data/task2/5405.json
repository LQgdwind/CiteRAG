      "content": "Paper Title: On Approximating the Dynamic Response of Synchronous Generators via Operator Learning: A Step Towards Building Deep Operator-based Power Grid Simulators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper aims to approximate the dynamic response of a synchronous generator interacting with a power grid (e.g., a reduced power grid model or a numerical simulator such as power systems toolbox (PST) [ref]10). We model such a generator using the following non-autonomous initial value problem (IVP): Here x​(t)∈𝒳⊆ℝnx𝑥𝑡𝒳superscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝑥x(t)\\in\\mathcal{X}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{n_{x}} is the vector-valued state function, y​(t)∈𝒴⊆ℝny𝑦𝑡𝒴superscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝑦y(t)\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{n_{y}} the interacting variables, u​(t)∈𝒰⊆ℝnu𝑢𝑡𝒰superscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝑢u(t)\\in\\mathcal{U}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{n_{u}} the control input, λ∈Λ⊂ℝnλ𝜆Λsuperscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝜆\\lambda\\in\\Lambda\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n_{\\lambda}} the vector of parameters describing a specific generator, [0,T]⊂[0,+∞)0𝑇0[0,T]\\subset[0,+\\infty) the finite time horizon of interest, and x0∈𝒳subscript𝑥0𝒳x_{0}\\in\\mathcal{X} is the initial condition. We will assume the vector field f:𝒳×𝒴×𝒰→𝒳:𝑓→𝒳𝒴𝒰𝒳f:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{Y}\\times\\mathcal{U}\\to\\mathcal{X} is (i) unknown (in Section 3) and (ii) partially known (in Section 4), i.e., we know some approximate model such that fapprox≈fsubscript𝑓approx𝑓f_{\\text{approx}}\\approx f. One can use the above non-autonomous IVP (1) to (i) describe the dynamic response of a synchronous generator that interacts with a numerical simulator, e.g., PST (see Figure 1) or (ii) shadow the dynamic response of an actual generator. More specifically, consider a multi-machine power grid described using the following differential-algebraic (DA) model introduced in Sauer et al. : In the above, (2a) are the synchronous generators’ dynamic equations, (2b) the stator algebraic equations, and (2c) the network equations. Within this DA model, the proposed operator learning framework could provide the dynamic response of a parametric family of synchronous generators, i.e., f​(⋅;λi)≈fo,i𝑓⋅subscript𝜆𝑖subscript𝑓𝑜𝑖f(\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\cdot\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ ;\\lambda_{i})\\approx f_{o,i} for some i𝑖i’s. In such a case, the interacting variables are (see Figure 1) the generator’s stator currents and bus terminal voltage, i.e., y​(t)=(Id​(t),Iq​(t),V​(t))⊤𝑦𝑡superscriptsubscript𝐼𝑑𝑡subscript𝐼𝑞𝑡𝑉𝑡topy(t)=(I_{d}(t),I_{q}(t),V(t))^{\\top} and the control input is the voltage regulator field voltage, i.e.,  u​(t)≡Ef​d​(t)𝑢𝑡subscript𝐸𝑓𝑑𝑡u(t)\\equiv E_{fd}(t). We remark, however, that the proposed method can use other interacting variables. For example, bus active and reactive powers, which we used in our previous work [ref]25. Focusing on interacting variables. In this paper, we only focus on the interacting variables input y​(t)𝑦𝑡y(t), neglect the control input u​(t)𝑢𝑡u(t), and fix the parameters λ𝜆\\lambda. This is because the analysis and learning protocols for u​(t)𝑢𝑡u(t) and λ𝜆\\lambda, which we will extensively study in a separate work, are similar to the analysis for y​(t)𝑦𝑡y(t). Furthermore, the interacting variables y​(t)𝑦𝑡y(t) propagate prediction errors when interacting with a numerical simulator for the rest of the grid. Thus, it is imperative to design robust deep-learning methods to control this error propagation. Without the control input u​(t)𝑢𝑡u(t), we write the dynamics of the non-autonomous IVP (1) as follows The solution operator. We describe the dynamic response of the selected generator using the solution operator (also known as flow map) of (3), which we denote as G𝐺G. G𝐺G takes as inputs the initial condition x​(0)=x0∈𝒳𝑥0subscript𝑥0𝒳x(0)=x_{0}\\in\\mathcal{X} and the continuous sequence of interacting variables, which we denote, with some abuse of notation, as y[0,t):={y​(s)∈𝒴:s∈[0,t)}assignsubscript𝑦0𝑡conditional-set𝑦𝑠𝒴𝑠0𝑡y_{[0,t)}:=\\{y(s)\\in\\mathcal{Y}:s\\in[0,t)\\}. G𝐺G then computes the state x​(t)∈𝒳𝑥𝑡𝒳x(t)\\in\\mathcal{X} at time t∈[0,T]𝑡0𝑇t\\in[0,T] as follows Approximate non-autonomous IVP. In practice, however, we may have only access to a discrete representation of the trajectory of y​(t)𝑦𝑡y(t) within the interval [0,T]0𝑇[0,T]. We denote such an approximation as y~~𝑦\\tilde{y}. Using y~~𝑦\\tilde{y} in (3) leads to the following approximate non-autonomous IVP: whose solution operator G~~𝐺\\tilde{G} is In Lu et al.  , the authors designed a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) to approximate the solution operator G𝐺G (with x0=0subscript𝑥00x_{0}=0) and proved its approximation capacity via G~~𝐺\\tilde{G}. The input to the proposed DeepONet was the trajectory of the function y[0,T]subscript𝑦0𝑇y_{[0,T]} discretized using m≥1𝑚1m\\geq 1 interpolation points (also known as sensors in ). However, their proposed DeepONet  has the following two drawbacks. (i) Their DeepONet can effectively approximate G𝐺G (with x0=0subscript𝑥00x_{0}=0) for small values of T𝑇T. For longer time horizons, i.e., for T≫1much-greater-than𝑇1T\\gg 1 second, one must increase the number m𝑚m of sensors, which makes the training process challenging. (ii) To predict x​(t)𝑥𝑡x(t) for any t∈[0,T]𝑡0𝑇t\\in[0,T], their DeepONet must take as input the trajectory u​(t)𝑢𝑡u(t) within the whole interval [0,T]0𝑇[0,T]. Such an assumption does not hold in the problem studied in this paper. That is, we only have access to past values of y​(t)𝑦𝑡y(t), i.e., within the interval [0,t)⊂[0,T]0𝑡0𝑇[0,t)\\subset[0,T]. The DeepONet designed in  is not applicable to the problem we are addressing here. To alleviate the above two drawbacks, we propose in the next section an operator learning framework that first designs and trains a novel DeepONet to approximate G𝐺G locally and then uses the trained DeepONet recursively to approximate the generator’s dynamic response over the whole interval [0,T]0𝑇[0,T].\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: paper aims to approximate the dynamic response of a synchronous generator interacting with a power grid (e.g., a reduced power grid model or a numerical simulator such as power systems toolbox (PST) [ref]10).
