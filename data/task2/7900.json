      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum automata and languages of finite index\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we investigate an issue of decidability for quantum (finite) automata. Quantum automata were introduced at the beginning of 2000’s in  as a new model of language recognizer (cf. ).\nNumerous publications have\never since compared their decision properties\nto those of other models and, in particular, to probabilistic finite automata.\nIn this theoretical setting, we investigate the decidability of a problem for quantum automata introduced in  , named Intersection Problem.\nThe starting point of that investigation is a result of Blondel, Jeandel, Koiran, and Portier which shows in  that, given a (“measure-once” in the sense of ) quantum automaton 𝒬𝒬\\cal Q, it is decidable whether the language recognized by 𝒬𝒬\\cal Q has a non trivial intersection with the free monoid\ngenerated by the input alphabet of 𝒬𝒬\\cal Q (Emptiness problem). It is worth remarking that these problems are strictly related to some computational issues concerning matrices. Precisely, a crucial step in the construction of the decision procedure\nfor both the Emptiness and Intersection Problem amounts to effectively compute the Zariski closure of a finitely generated group of matrices over ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}.\nFor that task, an appropriate algorithm has been developed in  by Derksen, Jeandel, and Koiran. Before coming back to the Intersection Problem, we find then convenient to recall some developments of the research on that aspect.\nTwo striking results have been obtained in the recent past years in connection with Derksen et al. algorithm. In 2022\nNosan, Pouly, Schmitz, Shirmohammadi, and Worrell, following an alternative approach for such computation,\nhave obtained in  a bound on the degree of the polynomials that define the Zariski closure of the set\nand showed that the latter can be computed in elementary time.\n The second was obtained in 2023 by Hrushovski, Ouaknine, Pouly, and Worrel for the study of the effective computation of\npolynomial invariants for affine programs . Precisely, it is\nexhibited an algorithm that, given a finite set of square matrices of the same size with coefficients in ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}, computes the Zariski closure of the semigroup generated by the set. It should be pointed out that the decidability issues for matrix semigroups\nis a challenge problem. Even in small size, a well-known result by Paterson shows that the problem of freeness and that of\nmembership are both undecidable for matrix semigroups over ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z} of size 333 (cf ). In contrast, in 2017, a surprising result of\nPotapov and Semukhin  shows that the membership is decidable for non-singular matrix integer semigroups of size 222.\nWe now come back to the Intersection Problem and give a formal presentation of our work.\nA finite quantum automaton (in the sense of ) is a quadruple where s∈ℝn𝑠superscriptℝ𝑛s\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nis a row-vector of unit Euclidean norm,\nP𝑃P is a projection matrix of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, φ:Σ∗→On:𝜑→superscriptΣsubscript𝑂𝑛\\varphi:\\Sigma^{*}\\rightarrow O_{n} is a morphism from the free monoid\nΣ∗superscriptΣ\\Sigma^{*}, generated by the input alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma of 𝒬𝒬\\cal Q, into the group Onsubscript𝑂𝑛O_{n}\nof orthogonal n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n-matrices over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} and the threshold λ𝜆\\lambda has value in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}. We are mainly interested in effective properties\nwhich require the quantum automaton\nto be effectively given.\nWe thus consider the model of rational quantum automaton, i.e., where all the coefficients\nof the components of (1) and λ𝜆\\lambda are rational numbers. For a real threshold λ𝜆\\lambda, the languages recognized by 𝒬𝒬\\cal Q with strict and nonstrict threshold λ𝜆\\lambda are where ||⋅||||\\cdot|| denotes the Euclidean norm of vectors.\nLet ℒℒ{\\cal L} be a family of effectively defined languages. The problem we tackle is thus the following: (L,𝒬)𝐿𝒬(L,{\\cal Q}) Intersection Input: a language L𝐿L in a family ℒℒ{\\cal L} of\nlanguages and a rational quantum automaton\n𝒬𝒬{\\cal Q}. Question: does L∩|𝒬>|=∅𝐿subscript𝒬L\\cap|{\\cal Q}_{>}|=\\emptyset hold? As already pointed out, it has been proven in  the\ndecidability of the problem in the specific case L𝐿L =Σ∗absentsuperscriptΣ=\\Sigma^{*}. This result contrasts with the corresponding problems (strict and non strict, respectively) for probabilistic finite automata. Indeed for this class of automata, the Emptiness problems w.r.t. |𝒬>|subscript𝒬|{\\cal Q}_{>}| and |𝒬≥|subscript𝒬|{\\cal Q}_{\\geq}| are both undecidable (see , Thm 6.17).\nAlso it contrasts with the undecidability of the Emptiness problem of |𝒬≥|subscript𝒬|{\\cal Q}_{\\geq}| for quantum automata .\nIt is also proven in  that both the problems (strict and non strict, respectively) remain undecidable for\nthe “measure many” model of quantum automata, a model not computationally equivalent to the “measure once”, introduced\nby Kondacs and Watrous in . In order to describe the main contributions of the paper, it may be useful to recall some lines of the technique used in the proof of the\nIntersection Problem in .\nFor this purpose, following the same strategy of , we first observe that the Intersection Problem is equivalent to the inclusion Since the function – where M𝑀M is an arbitrary matrix in ℝn×nsuperscriptℝ𝑛𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}, and s,P𝑠𝑃s,P are components of (1) –\nis continuous, it is sufficient to prove that, for all\nmatrices M𝑀M in the Euclidean closure 𝐂​l​(φ​(L))𝐂𝑙𝜑𝐿{\\mathbf{C}l}(\\varphi(L)) of\nφ​(L)𝜑𝐿\\varphi(L), the condition\n‖s​M​P‖≤λnorm𝑠𝑀𝑃𝜆||sMP||\\leq\\lambda holds (see Section 3). Such condition is then effectively tested by running, in parallel, two semialgorithms.\nThe first tests the inclusion φ​(L)⊆|𝒬>|𝜑𝐿subscript𝒬\\varphi(L)\\subseteq|{\\cal Q}_{>}| and it is readily seen to be semidecidable.\nThe second, which is the main bulk, is to prove that (2) is semidecidable. The semidecidability of the latter procedure is achieved by expressing the property (2)\nin first-order logic of the field of reals, which, in turn, consists to effectively compute a representation of 𝐂​l​(φ​(L))𝐂𝑙𝜑𝐿{\\mathbf{C}l}(\\varphi(L)) in term of semialgebraic set\n(a more general property than\nalgebraic, which allows to cope with the fact that algebraic sets are not closed w.r.t. the operation of product of sets).\nAfterwards, one applies on the constructed formula\nthe Tarski-Seidenberg quantifier elimination to verify whether (2) holds true or not.\n It turns out that the semialgebraicity of 𝐂​l​(φ​(L))𝐂𝑙𝜑𝐿{\\mathbf{C}l}(\\varphi(L)), and its effective computation (as a semialgebraic set), are reduced to those of an algebro-combinatorial object that is\nassociated with the grammar G𝐺G generating L𝐿L, and with every variable A𝐴A of G𝐺G: the monoid of cycles of A𝐴A.\nSuch monoid, denoted MAsubscript𝑀𝐴M_{A}, corresponds (up to a technical detail) to the matrix image, under taking the morphism φ𝜑\\varphi of (1), of the language of cycles in G𝐺G\nassociated with A𝐴A (see Eq. (21)). The reduction process mentioned above is made possible by resorting to two ingredients: the fact that the Euclidean closure 𝐂​l​(MA)𝐂𝑙subscript𝑀𝐴{\\mathbf{C}l}(M_{A}) is an algebraic set\n(because of a deep result of Algebraic Geometry, namely Theorem 3)\nand because of a suitably defined effective structuring of the computations, i.e., the derivations, of G𝐺G\n(Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 6.1).\nIn this theoretical setting,  and this work provides the following picture of the Intersection Problem: If L𝐿L is a context-free language, then 𝐂​l​(φ​(L))𝐂𝑙𝜑𝐿{\\mathbf{C}l}(\\varphi(L)) is semialgebraic. Moreover, if, for every variable A𝐴A of G𝐺G,\n𝐂​l​(MA)𝐂𝑙subscript𝑀𝐴{\\mathbf{C}l}(M_{A}) is effectively computable, then 𝐂​l​(φ​(L))𝐂𝑙𝜑𝐿{\\mathbf{C}l}(\\varphi(L)) is so as well (Proposition 9). If, for every variable A𝐴A of G𝐺G, MAsubscript𝑀𝐴M_{A} is finitely generated, then 𝐂​l​(φ​(L))𝐂𝑙𝜑𝐿{\\mathbf{C}l}(\\varphi(L)) is effectively computable. This is\nguaranteed by applying Proposition 9 and the results    mentioned above.\nThis, in particular, covers the cases of context-free linear languages, bounded semi-linear languages and a new class of languages, proposed in this paper, generated by\nrestricted matrix context-free linear grammars which non trivially extends the previous ones (Proposition 10). The effective computation of 𝐂​l​(φ​(L))𝐂𝑙𝜑𝐿{\\mathbf{C}l}(\\varphi(L)) is achieved for a subfamily of\nfinite index context-free languages, called monoidal, by considering the property of (algebraic) irreducibility on the Zariski closure of a family of monoids of cycles canonically associated with G𝐺G (Proposition 11). The new results of the paper are the following. In Section 6.1,\nwe extend the main contribution of  – i.e., the statement of decidability of the Intersection Problem for linear context-free languages and for\nbounded semilinear languages – to a class of matrix context-free grammar of finite index.\nPrecisely, whenever the quantum automaton is rational, such result (Proposition 10)\nallows, on one hand, to recover both the previous two cases as immediate corollaries of such result. On the other, it shows the decidability of the problem for languages of exponential growth that are not context-free.\nThe proof is based upon a combinatorial decomposition of these matrix grammars proposed by Choffrut, Varricchio and the second author in \nfor the study of rational relations. In particular, this decomposition permits a refinement of the algebro-combinatorial machinery developed in  for the\nmanipulation of the monoids of cycles of these grammars. In Section 6.2, we investigate the Intersection Problem for languages defined by finite index context-free grammars.\nThese are grammars G𝐺G where each word w𝑤w in the language generated by G𝐺G is obtained by a derivation δ𝛿\\delta, whose index\nis uniformly bounded, i.e., the number of variables in each sentential form of δ𝛿\\delta is bounded by an integer not depending on w𝑤w.\nA remarkable result by Ginsburg and Spanier  (see also Nivat [ref]24) provides a charaterization of such languages in terms of composition of grammars:\nprecisely, each language of this type is generated by a grammar G𝐺G given by the composition of families 𝒢i, 1≤i≤k,subscript𝒢𝑖1𝑖𝑘{\\cal G}_{i},\\ 1\\leq i\\leq k,\\  of linear context-free grammars.\nHere, we prove a statement of decidability for a subclass of these grammars called monoidal.\nInformally speaking, a grammar G𝐺G of the form (3) is monoidal if\nthe terminal productions of G𝐺G\nare of the form X→ε→𝑋𝜀X\\rightarrow\\varepsilon and the remaining productions are unit ones or of the form\nX→u​X​v→𝑋𝑢𝑋𝑣X\\rightarrow uXv, with X𝑋X being a variable of some grammar of 𝒢i, 1≤i≤ksubscript𝒢𝑖1𝑖𝑘{\\cal G}_{i},\\ 1\\leq i\\leq k (see Definition 10). We prove that, whatever is the length k𝑘k of the composition (3) for G𝐺G,\nif the Zariski closure of the monoids of cycles of the linear grammars of the lowest level 𝒢ksubscript𝒢𝑘{\\cal G}_{k} of (3), are (algebraic) irreducible,\nthen one can effectively computes the Euclidean closure 𝐂​l​(φ​(L))𝐂𝑙𝜑𝐿{\\mathbf{C}l}(\\varphi(L)) of\nφ​(L)𝜑𝐿\\varphi(L) (Proposition 11, Corollary 5). Extensions of such result to broader families of finite index context-free languages seem related to possible extensions of the algorithms\n   (cf Section 7, [α𝛼\\alpha]). The general case of context-free languages is still open and it would be even possible that the problem is undecidable (cf Section 7, [β𝛽\\beta]). The paper is structured in the following way. In Sec. 2 preliminaries on semialgebraic and irreducible algebraic sets are presented.\nIn Section 3 we recall an effective condition to which the decidability of the problem under discussion can be reduced.\nSection 4 provides combinatorial structurings of context-free languages in the general case and in the finite index case.\nSection 5 recalls some results relating context-free grammars and semialgebraic sets.\nIn Section 6 the main results of the paper are presented.\nSection 7 contains some concluding remarks and open problems.\nSection 8 shows the construction for monoidal grammars on an example.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: uniformly bounded, i.e., the number of variables in each sentential form of δ𝛿\\delta is bounded by an integer not depending on w𝑤w.\nA remarkable result by Ginsburg and Spanier  (see also Nivat [ref]24) provides a charaterization of such languages in terms of composition of grammars:\nprecisely, each language of this type is generated by a grammar G𝐺G given by the composition of families 𝒢i,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
