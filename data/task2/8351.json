One can argue that standard gradient descent on VQE-type circuits is implicitly using the l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} norm in parameter space (essentially copied from ): which can be seen from differentiating the minimisation argument with respect to x𝑥x and setting it to zero. While other works have argued that the l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} norm may be more appropriate , the main contribution of  is to argue that the relevant geometry is given by the Fubini-Study metric tensor, or quantum Fisher information (QFI). For quantum states parametrised by |ψ​(𝜽)⟩=|ψ​(θ1,…,θν)⟩ket𝜓𝜽ket𝜓subscript𝜃1…subscript𝜃𝜈\\ket{\\psi(\\bm{\\theta})}=\\ket{\\psi(\\theta_{1},\\dots,\\theta_{\\nu})}, the QFI is and |∂jψ⟩:=∂∂θj​|ψ​(𝜽)⟩assignketsubscript𝑗𝜓subscript𝜃𝑗ket𝜓𝜽\\ket{\\partial_{j}\\psi}:=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta_{j}}\\ket{\\psi(\\bm{\\theta})}. The update rule is then Here we consider the quantum natural gradient  and closely related imaginary time  approaches for the HV ansatz. The challenge with this ansatz in this context is that we have gates sharing the same parameter, with fixed gates (FSWAPs, see Section 1.2) in between. Another way of phrasing this is to say that in  all parametrised gates can be written in the form for some Hermitian generator K𝐾K, but as we in general have fixed gates between gates sharing the same angle (which may not be implemented in parallel), this is not always possible. Hence we will only consider 1-dimensional FH systems, as this removes fixed FSWAPs between gates sharing a parameter. The update rule for quantum natural gradient descent is where the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) matrix if given by and |∂jψ⟩:=∂∂θj​|ψ​(𝜽)⟩assignketsubscript𝑗𝜓subscript𝜃𝑗ket𝜓𝜽\\ket{\\partial_{j}\\psi}:=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta_{j}}\\ket{\\psi(\\bm{\\theta})}. We will just consider the diagonal terms of this as an approximation, which seems to be well justified in  (see e.g. their Figure 1 & 2). If we write the ansatz dependent on a single parameter as |ψ​(θ)⟩=U​ei​θ​P​|ψ⟩ket𝜓𝜃𝑈superscript𝑒𝑖𝜃𝑃ket𝜓\\ket{\\psi(\\theta)}=Ue^{i\\theta P}\\ket{\\psi} (i.e. absorb previous gates into |ψ⟩ket𝜓\\ket{\\psi} and subsequent gates into U𝑈U), then the derivative is ∂θ|ψ​(θ)⟩=i​U​P​ei​θ​P​|ψ⟩subscript𝜃ket𝜓𝜃𝑖𝑈𝑃superscript𝑒𝑖𝜃𝑃ket𝜓\\partial_{\\theta}\\ket{\\psi(\\theta)}=iUPe^{i\\theta P}\\ket{\\psi}, and the diagonal term with respect to this parameter is where we took P𝑃P to be Hermitian. Now consider having multiple gates sharing the same parameter θ𝜃\\theta. Assume that the generators P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q commute, are Hermitian, and the gates are next to each other, so that we have Then the relevant QFI component is where Cov denotes the covariance, recall that Var​(∑iXi)=∑i,jCov​(Xi,Xj)Varsubscript𝑖subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑖𝑗Covsubscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗\\text{Var}(\\sum_{i}X_{i})=\\sum_{i,j}\\text{Cov}(X_{i},X_{j})\nand Cov​(X,X)=Var​(X)Cov𝑋𝑋Var𝑋\\text{Cov}(X,X)=\\text{Var}(X). Note that this expression does not actually depend on θ𝜃\\theta, but on the parameters applied before, so e.g. ℱ00subscriptℱ00\\mathcal{F}_{00} is independent of all parameters. In our case we have generators P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q of the form We can approximate the variance and covariance terms from the statistical data collected, as we already measure these terms in the full energy measurement. To summarise our implementation: We just look at the diagonal approximation to the quantum Fisher information matrix. We focus on linear systems to avoid FSWAP networks. We calculate the variances and covariances numerically. The number of cost function calls to evaluate the FIM is ν𝜈\\nu (number of parameters), where we sequentially set certain parameters to zero. The six qubits are ordered by spins, then site, i.e. The onsite and hopping terms are then For two layers, parameters would be mapped to the ansatz as For e.g. θ4subscript𝜃4\\theta_{4}: where For e.g. θ2subscript𝜃2\\theta_{2}: where We then calculate the natural gradient as\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: The quantum natural gradient   has been introduced as a quantum generalisation of the natural gradient [ref]47 , and can be motivated by seeking to perform gradient descent on the most natural geometry of the search space in question.
