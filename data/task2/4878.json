      "content": "Paper Title: Augmentation-Free Graph Contrastive Learning of Invariant-Discriminative Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph contrastive learning (GCL) is a promising method that addresses the label dependence, poor generalization, and weak robustness of graph neural networks (GNNs). In general, contrastive learning is mainly built on the idea of mutual information estimation, which learns invariant and discriminative representations. Contrastive learning can be interpreted as a powerful discriminator that determines whether a pair of samples is derived from a joint distribution (positive samples) or from two marginal distributions (negative samples) [ref]1. Contrastive learning pulls the positive samples with similar semantic information close to capture the invariant signal, and negative samples with dissimilar semantic information are pushed away to guarantee the discriminability of representations. Naturally, the quality of the positive/negative samples is crucial for the performance of GCL [ref]2. GCL relies heavily on empirical data augmentation to construct positive and negative samples. In computer vision, positive samples are generated by randomly cropping, resizing, and color distorting the target image, and negative samples are randomly sampled from the rest of the images . Similar to the data augmentation of images, the common data augmentation techniques of graphs are node feature masking, node feature shuffle, edge modification, graph diffusion, and subgraph sampling . GRACE [ref]5 and CCA-SSG  generate positive samples by randomly masking node features and removing edges. MVGRL  proposes two graph diffusion methods based on Personalized PageRank  and heat kernel  to capture the global structural information and treats the diffuse graphs as positive samples. Benefiting from the adjacency of graphs, SUBG-CON  proposes a subgraph contrastive learning method that uses subgraphs of the target node as positive samples. Meanwhile, negative samples are generated in various ways including row-wise perturbing node features  and random sampling from the remaining nodes [ref]5. You et al. [ref]2 systematically analyzed the impact of four data augmentation techniques and their compositions on downstream tasks and summarized some observations. However, determining the type of data augmentation suitable for a particular task still relies heavily on empirical trials. Meanwhile the hyperparameters of data augmentation exponentially expand the search space of data augmentation configurations. Therefore, an applicable data augmentation configuration consumes a significant amount of time and computation resources. We rethink the essence of GCL to address the problem of empirical data augmentation. For GCL, positive samples are used to capture the invariant signal of data, and negative samples are used to prevent the representation from being indistinguishable . We separately analyze the role of positive and negative samples in order to discard data augmentation. For positive samples, data augmentation can be considered a transformation function that does not destroy the signal inherent in the data. Inspired by Siamese networks , we argue that two neural networks with similar or the same weights can transform the target sample into two representations with similar semantic information. Kefato et al.  used two projectors to transform the embeddings extracted by GNNs in order to obtain two representations with similar semantic information. In addition, neighboring nodes may have similar semantic information as the target node based on the homophily assumption  . For example, neighboring nodes are often classified in the same community as the target node in community detection. We argue that neighboring nodes can potentially serve as positive samples. Many loss functions, such as the mean square error (MSE), can pull the positive samples close. The role of negative samples is to avoid the representations from collapsing into a single point or a subspace, ensuring that the representation is discriminative . To achieve this goal, a considerable number of negative samples must be generated , which may lead to false negative samples  and exacerbate the consumption of computational resources. Recently, some studies addressed the problem of negative sampling by modifying the model architecture . According to the above analysis, we try to replace the empirical positive samples with Siamese networks and local structural information, and guarantee the discriminative power of representations by some effective measures. Here, we propose an augmentation-free GCL method called the invariant-discriminative graph contrastive learning (iGCL), which requires neither empirical data augmentation nor negative samples. Following the idea of Siamese networks, iGCL consists of two GNNs (online network and target network) with the same architecture that can generate high-quality positive samples with similar semantic information. We propose a positive sample construction strategy that selects the K𝐾K most similar representations from the 1-hop neighboring nodes of the target nodes as positive samples. To train the iGCL, we design the Invariant-Discriminative loss (ID loss) to include an invariance term and a discrimination term. To capture the invariant signal, we choose the simple but effective MSE as the invariance term to pull the positive samples close to the target sample. To empower representations discriminability, we add an orthonormal constraint as the discrimination term, which forces the different dimensions of the representations to be independent of each other and prevents the representation space from collapsing. In addition, our theoretical analysis explains the effectiveness of ID loss from the perspectives of redundancy reduction, canonical correlation analysis, and the information bottleneck principle. We conduct numerous experiments to illustrate the superior performance of the iGCL. iGCL not only outperforms supervised GCN and GAT but also all baselines on 5 node classification benchmark datasets. We also evaluate the generalization and robustness of the iGCL. The experimental results show that iGCL still achieves excellent performance at label ratios between 0.5%percent0.50.5\\% and 20%percent2020\\% and alleviates the impact of graph attacks. Moreover, we visualize the representations by t-SNE, which intuitively illustrates the discriminative power. Finally, the experimental results of hyperparameter sensitivity analysis illustrate the effectiveness of the positive sample construction strategy and the discrimination term. Our main contributions are as follows. We propose iGCL, which does not require empirical data augmentation or negative samples, to generate invariant and discriminative representations. We show that ID loss is equivalent to the redundancy reduction criterion and canonical correlation analysis under specific conditions, and iGCL can be considered an instance of the information bottleneck principle under self-supervised learning. Experimental results show that iGCL outperforms all baselines on 5 node classification benchmark datasets and has superior generalization and robustness. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we briefly review related work on GCL. Section 3 describes the network architecture, positive sample construction strategy, and ID loss in detail. Section 4 evaluates the performance, generalization, and robustness of iGCL through extensive experiments. Section 5 concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: can be interpreted as a powerful discriminator that determines whether a pair of samples is derived from a joint distribution (positive samples) or from two marginal distributions (negative samples) [ref]1.
