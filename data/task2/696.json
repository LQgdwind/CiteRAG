      "content": "Paper Title: Blind Face Restoration via Deep Multi-scale Component Dictionaries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBlind face restoration (or face hallucination) aims at recovering realistic details from real low-quality (LQ) image to its high-quality (HQ) one, without knowing the degradation types or parameters. Compared with single image restoration tasks, e.g., image super-resolution¬†  [ref]46, denoising¬†[ref]42 , and deblurring¬† , blind image restoration suffers from more challenges, yet is of great practical value in restoring real LQ images. Recently, benefited from the carefully designed architecture and the incorporation of related priors in deep neural convolutional networks, the restoration results tend to be more plausible and acceptable. Though great achievements have been made, the real LQ images usually contain complex and diverse distributions that are impractical to synthesize, making the blind restoration problem intractable.\nTo solve this issue, reference-based methods¬† [ref]7   have been suggested by using reference prior in image restoration task to improve the process of network learning and alleviate the dependency of network on degraded input.\nAmong these methods, GFRNet¬† and GWAINet¬†[ref]7 adopt a frontal HQ image as reference to guide the restoration of degraded observation. However, these two methods suffer from two drawbacks.\n1) They have to obtain a frontal HQ reference which is from the same identity with LQ image.\n2) The differences of poses and expressions between the reference and degraded input will affect the reconstruction performance.\nThese two requirements limit their applicative ability to some specific scenarios\n(e.g., old film restoration or phone album that supports identity group). In this paper, we present a DFDNet by building deep face dictionaries to address the aforementioned difficulties.\nWe note that the four face components (i.e., left/right eyes, nose and mouth) are similar among different people.\nThus, in this work, we off-line build face component dictionaries by adopting K-means on large amounts of HQ face images. This manner can obtain more accurate component reference without requiring the corresponding identity-belonging HQ images,\nwhich makes the proposed model applicable in most face restoration scenes.\nTo be specific, we firstly use pre-trained VggFace¬† to extract the multi-scale features of HQ face images in different feature scale (e.g., output of different convolutional layers). Secondly, we adopt RoIAlign¬† to crop their component features based on the facial landmarks. K-means is then applied on these features to generate the KùêæK clusters for each component on different feature levels.\nAfter that, component adaptive instance normalization (CAdaIN) is proposed to norm the corresponding dictionary feature which helps to eliminate the effect of style diversity (i.e., illumination or skin color).\nFinally, with the degraded input, we match and select the dictionary component clusters which have the smallest feature distance to guide the following restoration process in an adaptive and progressive manner.\nA confidence score is predicted to balance the input component feature and the selected dictionary feature.\nIn addition, we use multi-scale dictionaries to guide the restoration progressively which further improves the performance.\nCompared with the former reference-based methods (i.e., GFRNet¬† and GWAINet¬†[ref]7), which have only one HQ reference, our DFDNet has more component candidates to be selected as a reference, thus making our model achieve superior performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed DFDNet. The quantitative and qualitative results show the benefits of deep multi-scale face dictionaries brought in our method. Moreover, DFDNet can also generate plausible and promising results on real LQ images. Without requiring identity-belonging HQ reference, our method is flexible and practical in most face restoration applications. To sum up, the main contributions of this work are: We use deep component dictionaries as reference candidates to guide the degraded face restoration. The proposed DFDNet can generalize to face images without requiring the identity-belonging HQ reference, which is more applicative and efficient than those reference-based methods. We suggest a DFT block by utilizing CAdaIN to eliminate the distribution diversity between the input and dictionary clusters for better dictionary feature transfer, and we also propose a confidence score to adaptively fuse the dictionary feature to the input with different degradation level. We adopt a progressive manner for training DFDNet by incorporating the component dictionaries in different feature scales. This can make our DFDNet learn coarse-to-fine details. Our proposed DFDNet can achieve promising performance on both synthetic and real degraded images, showing its potential in real applications.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: from real low-quality (LQ) image to its high-quality (HQ) one, without knowing the degradation types or parameters.
