      "content": "Paper Title: PAC: Assisted Value Factorisation with Counterfactual Predictions in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, such as autonomous vehicle coordination  and network packet delivery [ref]2, often involve coordination among multiple entities and are naturally formulated as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).\nFactorization-based methods have greatly progressed in dealing with the exponentially growing joint state-action space in MARL.\nUnder the notion of Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE), algorithms like VDN  and QMIX  learn a centralized joint action-value function Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} through a monotonic factorization into local per-agent value functions so that Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} can be maximized as long as each per-agent value function is maximized by local action selection.\nEven conditioned on joint state information, a monotonic mixing network for Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} is shown to restrict the representable function class. Despite efforts to mitigate this, e.g., QTRAN [ref]5 and WQMIX [ref]6, in practice, they empirically perform poorly in complex MARL environments with partial observability   . In this paper, we show that in partially observable MARL problems (as exemplified by a multi-state matrix game), an agent’s ordering over its own actions could impose concurrent constraints on the representable action-value Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} in different states. This restriction causes large estimation errors of Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} during training. It cannot be addressed by existing methods, e.g., adding a state-value correction term (like QTRAN [ref]5) or introducing importance weights on dominant state-actions (like WQMIX [ref]6). It aggravates the relative over-generalization problem 0 – when fully decomposed, per-agent value functions only depend on partial observations and local actions. It renders optimal decentralized policies unlearnable when the employed value function does not have enough representational ability. Solving tasks that require significant coordination in partially observable problems remains a key challenge. The key insight of this paper is that an accurate factorization in partially observable MARL problems requires improved representation of the value functions, which is crucial to supporting the learning of optimal decentralized policies. We propose a novel architecture, denoted as PAC, for assisted value factorization with counterfactual predictions. It leverages a counterfactual baseline that marginalizes out an\nagent’s potential optimal action while keeping all other agents’ actions fixed. The counterfactual predictions of potential optimal actions enable (i) training assistive information that is generated using the variational inference method to expand the representational ability of value functions, and (ii) directly optimizing the factorization of Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} through a new counterfactual loss. We note that in contrast to communication-based methods like NDQ 1, the use of assistive information in PAC aims to directly improve per-agent value functions in factorization. Minimizing our proposed counterfactual loss together with an information bottleneck loss ensures that such assistive information is relevant, optimal, and succinct for value function factorization in PAC. Relying on the accuracy of assisted factorization, we further decouple the decision-making of local value function (through separate policy networks) from value function networks, which allows PAC to maintain full CTDE despite the use of assistive information during training and also enables the maximization of entropy to encourage exploration. The accuracy of assisted factorization makes PAC outperform policy-based methods with factorization like DOP 2 and FOP 3), especially on difficult tasks that require more coordination among the agents since sub-optimality from one agent’s policy might propagate and aggravate the training of other agents through the centralized critic 2 4. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a novel method, PAC, the first framework for value function factorization by providing variational-encoded counterfactual predictions as assistive information to facilitate per-agent value function estimation. The counterfactual predictions can be efficiently computed from a feed-forward baseline Q∗superscript𝑄Q^{*} and based on a local search to facilitate direct optimization of Qt​o​tsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡Q_{tot} factorization through a new counterfactual loss. PAC decouples individual agents’ policy networks from value function networks and thus maintains fully decentralized execution while enjoying the benefits of assisted value function factorization. It also leads to an entropy maximization MARL for more effective exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PAC and show that PAC significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art value-based and policy-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge in terms of better performance and faster convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, such as autonomous vehicle coordination  and network packet delivery [ref]2, often involve coordination among multiple entities and are naturally formulated as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).\nFactorization-based methods have greatly progressed in dealing\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
