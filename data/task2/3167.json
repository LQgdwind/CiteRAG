The teacher tries to choose more informative samples to guide the training of student networks. However, these methods cannot process the dataset with noisy labels. To make the above learning to teach algorithms be capable of processing noisy data, the authors in work [ref]33 proposed a novel MentorNet to supervise the training of the student network by focusing on the probably correct samples. However, the designed MentorNet suffers the disadvantage of accumulating error introduced by the sample-selection bias . Another method called Decoupling proposed by work  trains two models simultaneously and updates the models by sampling with different predictions. However, in the selected subset with disagreement labels, there are still some noisy ones, which will decrease the performance of the trained model . To solve these problems, based on Co-training of work , the authors in  proposed a learning scheme called Co-teaching, which can train the model successfully even in the extremely noised dataset. Co-teaching also includes two models, and each model adopts the samples with small losses to train its peer network. Through the prediction information exchange, the error flows can be reduced accordingly. The authors in  tried to improve the performance by proposing an Iterative Noisy Cross-Validation (INCV) method with the seriously noised dataset. The above Co-teaching based methods try to conduct noise-robust learning by selecting clean samples with a small loss as much as possible. However, both hard and noisy samples have a large loss, and this will inevitably ignore the informative hard samples. We attempt to solve the problem in two aspects. First, we pre-discard most of the noisy samples with our hard-sample aware post-processing module. Second, we enhance most of the hard samples while suppressing the few existing noisy ones at the same time with our NSHE scheme.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Learning to teach refers to the schemes that consist of two networks, the teacher and student networks [ref]31 [ref]32.
