To this end, many different algorithms have been proposed in the literature to predict the dynamic popularity over the recent years. Some inspiring examples include the time-series prediction method [ref]20 [ref]16, the social-driven prediction method  , and the statistics-based prediction method  . Jiang et al. [ref]20 proposed an online content popularity prediction algorithm by exploiting the content features and user preferences, where the user preferences were learned offline from the historically requested information. In [ref]16, an auto-encoder (AE) neural network was combined with the long short-term memory module to predict the popularity by extracting time-series features from the historical requests of users. Nevertheless, the time-sequence prediction approaches in [ref]20 [ref]16 rely heavily on the privacy of users such as historical requests to improve the prediction accuracy, which is intolerable for those privacy-sensitive users and not appropriate for the privacy-preserving systems. Xu et al.  explored the dynamically changing and evolving propagation patterns of videos in social media and the content popularity could be forecasted in a timely fashion. In , the social relationships among a small number of users were explored to bridge the gap between prediction accuracy and small population. A social-driven propagation dynamics model was proposed therein to improve the popularity prediction accuracy. However, as the hidden features can only be extracted from massive amounts of social information accumulated over a long-term time, the timeliness and privacy concerns of the social-driven prediction methods are questioned. Statistical prediction methods based on regression analysis have also been examined. For instance, Trzcinśki et al.  used support vector regression based on Gaussian radial basis functions to predict the online video popularity. Similarly, a Bayesian hierarchical probabilistic model was designed  to regress the content popularity in an EC network. While the existing statistical approaches show potentials in achieving accurate and stable prediction, they are still far from practical use. For instance, the selection of probabilistic models in statistics-based methods   has critical impacts on the prediction performance, but the selection criteria are unclear and impossible to be a priori given in the real world. Most importantly, they inevitably raise privacy issues due to the fact that statistics-based methods require access to the historical request log data of users for popularity prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: To this end, many different algorithms have been proposed in the literature to predict the dynamic popularity over the recent years.
