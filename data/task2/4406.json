      "content": "Paper Title: ReFactor GNNs: Revisiting Factorisation-based Models from a Message-Passing Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe perform experiments to answer the following questions regarding ReFactor GNNs: Q1. ReFactor GNNs are derived from a message-passing reformulation of FMs: do they also inherit FMs’ predictive accuracy in transductive KGC tasks? (Section 5.1) Q2. ReFactor GNNs “inductivise” FMs. Are they more statistically accurate than other GNN baselines in inductive KGC tasks? (Section 5.2) Q3. The term n​[v]𝑛delimited-[]𝑣n[v] involves nodes that are not in the 1-hop neighbourhood. Is such augmented message passing  necessary for good KGC performance? (Section 5.3) For transductive experiments, we used three well-established KGC datasets: UMLS , CoDEx-S , and FB15K237 .\nFor inductive experiments, we used the inductive KGC benchmarks introduced by GraIL , which include 12 pairs of knowledge graphs: (FB15K237_vi𝑖i, FB15K237_vi𝑖i_ind), (WN18RR_vi𝑖i, WN18RR_vi𝑖i_ind), and (NELL_vi𝑖i, NELL_vi𝑖i_ind), where i∈[ref]1 [ref]2  𝑖1234i\\in[ref]1 [ref]2  , and (_vi𝑖i, _vi𝑖i_ind) represents a pair of graphs with a shared relation vocabulary and non-overlapping entities.\nWe follow the standard KGC evaluation protocol by fully ranking all the candidate entities and computing two metrics using the ranks of the ground-truth entities: Mean Reciprocal Ranking (MRR) and Hit Ratios at Top K (Hits@K𝐾K) with K∈[ref]1  [ref]10𝐾1310K\\in[ref]1  [ref]10.\nFor the inductive KGC, we additionally consider the partial-ranking evaluation protocol used by GraIL for a fair comparison.\nEmpirically, we find full ranking more difficult than partial ranking, and thus more suitable for reflecting the differences among models on GraIL datasets – we would like to call for future work on GraIL datasets to also adopt a full ranking protocol on these datasets. Our transductive experiments used L=∞𝐿L=\\infty, i.e. node states cache is never cleared, as we wanted to see if ReFactor GNNs (L=∞𝐿L=\\infty) can reach the performance of the FMs; on the other hand, in our inductive experiments, we used ReFactor GNNs with L∈{1,2,3,6,9}𝐿12369L\\in\\{1,2,3,6,9\\}, since we wanted to test their performances in inductive settings akin to standard GNNs.\nWe used a hidden size of 768 for the node representations.\nAll the models are trained using    in-batch negative samples and one global negative node for each positive link.\nWe performed a grid search over the other hyper-parameters and selected the best configuration based on the validation MRR.\nSince training deep GNNs with full-graph message passing might be slow for large knowledge graphs, we follow the literature [ref]10  7 to sample sub-graphs for training GNNs.\nConsidering that sampling on the fly often prevents high utilisation of GPUs, we resort to a two-stage process: we first sampled and serialised sub-graphs around the target edges in the mini-batches; we then trained the GNNs with the serialised sub-graphs.\nTo ensure we have sufficient sub-graphs for training the models, we sampled for 20 epochs for each knowledge graph, i.e. 20 full passes over the full graph.\nThe sub-graph sampler we currently used is LADIES .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: inductive KGC benchmarks introduced by GraIL , which include 12 pairs of knowledge graphs: (FB15K237_vi𝑖i, FB15K237_vi𝑖i_ind), (WN18RR_vi𝑖i, WN18RR_vi𝑖i_ind), and (NELL_vi𝑖i, NELL_vi𝑖i_ind), where i∈[ref]1 [ref]2  𝑖1234i\\in[ref]1 [ref]2  , and (_vi𝑖i, _vi𝑖i_ind) represents a pair of graphs with a shared relation vocabulary and non-overlapping entities.\nWe follow the standard KGC evaluation\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
