Thus, we implement seven generic regression methods: L1subscript𝐿1L_{1}, MSE, and Huber [ref]44 ask the model to directly predict the target and utilize an error-based loss function; DEX  and DLDL-v2  divide the regression range of each label dimension into pre-defined bins and learn the probability distribution over them; OR  and CORN  design multiple ordered thresholds for each label dimension and learn a binary classifier for each threshold. Further details of these baselines are included in Appendix E.1.\nIn our comparison, we first train the encoder with the proposed ℒRnCsubscriptℒRnC\\mathcal{L_{\\text{{RnC}}}}. We then freeze the encoder and train a predictor on top of it using each of the baseline methods. The original baseline without the RnC representation is then compared to that with RnC. For instance, we denote the end-to-end training of the encoder and predictor using L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} loss as L1subscript𝐿1L_{1}, while RnC(L1subscript𝐿1L_{1}) denotes training the encoder with ℒRnCsubscriptℒRnC\\mathcal{L_{\\text{{RnC}}}} and subsequently training the predictor using L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} loss. Table 1 summarizes the evaluation results on AgeDB, TUAB, MPIIFaceGaze and SkyFinder. Green numbers highlight the performance gains by using RnC representation. The standard deviations of the best results on each dataset are reported in Appendix G.2. As the table indicates, RnC consistently achieves the best performance on both metrics across all datasets. Moreover, incorporating RnC to learn the representation consistently reduces the prediction error of all baselines by 5.8%, 9.3%, 11.7%, and 7.0% on average on AgeDB, TUAB, MPIIFaceGaze, and SkyFinder, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nAgeDB\nTUAB\nMPIIFaceGaze\nSkyFinder\n\nRepresentation learning methods (Linear Probing):\n\nSimCLR [ref]4\n9.59\n11.01\n9.43\n4.70\n\nDINO [ref]3\n10.26\n11.62\n11.92\n5.63\n\nSupCon \n8.13\n8.47\n9.27\n3.97\n\nRepresentation learning methods (Fine-tuning):\n\nSimCLR [ref]4\n6.57\n7.57\n5.50\n2.93\n\nDINO [ref]3\n6.61\n7.58\n5.80\n2.98\n\nSupCon \n6.55\n7.41\n5.54\n2.95\n\nRegression learning methods:\n\nL1subscript𝐿1L_{1}\n6.63\n7.46\n5.97\n2.95\n\nLDS+FDS [ref]44\n6.45\n−-\n−-\n−-\n\nL2CS-Net \n−-\n−-\n5.45\n−-\n\nLDE \n−-\n−-\n−-\n2.92\n\nRankSim 7\n6.51\n7.33\n5.70\n2.94\n\nOrdinal Entropy \n6.47\n7.28\n−-\n2.94\n\nRnC(L1subscript𝐿1L_{1})\n6.14\n6.97\n5.27\n2.86\n\nGains\n+0.31\n+0.31\n+0.18\n+0.06\n\n\n Comparison to state-of-the-art representation learning methods.\nWe further compare RnC with state-of-the-art representation learning methods, SimCLR [ref]4, DINO [ref]3, and SupCon , under both linear probing and fine-tuning schemes to evaluate their learned representations for regression tasks. Full details are in Appendix E.2. Note that SimCLR and DINO do not use label information while SupCon uses label information for training the encoder. The predictor is trained with L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} loss. Table 2 demonstrates that RnC outperforms all other methods across all datasets. Note that some of the representation learning schemes even underperform the vanilla L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} method, which further verifies that the performance gain of RnC stems from our proposed loss rather than the pre-training scheme. Comparison to state-of-the-art regression learning methods.\nWe also compare RnC with state-of-the-art regression learning schemes, including methods that perform regularization in the feature space [ref]44 7  and methods that adopt dataset-specific techniques  . We provide the details in Appendix E.3. L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} loss is employed as the default regression loss for all methods if not specified. The results are presented in Table 2, with a dash (−-) indicating that the method is not applicable to the dataset. We observe that RnC achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: learns a regression-suitable representation that can be used by any end-to-end regression methods.
