      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Quantize Vulnerability Patterns and Match to Locate Statement-Level Vulnerabilities\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe number of software vulnerabilities has been escalating rapidly in recent years.\nIn particular, National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [ref]6 reported 26,448 software vulnerabilities in 2022, soaring 40% from 18,938 in 2019.\nThe extensive use of open-source libraries, in particular, may contribute to this rise in vulnerabilities.\nFor instance, the Apache Struts vulnerabilities 1 indicate that this poses a tangible threat to organizations.\nThe root cause of these vulnerabilities is often insecure coding practices, making the source code exploitable by attackers who can use them to infiltrate software systems and cause considerable financial and social harm. To mitigate security threats, security experts leverage static analysis tools that check the code against a set of known patterns of insecure or vulnerable code, such as buffer overflow vulnerabilities and other common security flaws.\nIn contrast, deep learning-based vulnerability detection (VD) identifies vulnerabilities at the file or function levels by implicitly learning vulnerability patterns during training    .\nDL-based vulnerability detection (VD) methods have demonstrated higher accuracy compared to static analysis tools that only target specific vulnerability types  7 . Additionally, recent advancements have introduced fine-grained VDs that offer statement-level vulnerability predictions, aiming to minimize the manual analysis burden on security analysts.\nPrevious studies have employed graph structure of source code like the code property graph , along with graph neural networks to detect vulnerabilities at the statement level  . Additionally, transformers have demonstrated their capability to learn semantic features of code using self-attention, which is particularly beneficial for handling long sequences compared to RNN models 7 . In this paper, we consider a vulnerable scope of a function as the collection of all vulnerable statements in that function.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, each function consists of two vulnerable statements that form similar vulnerable scopes.\nThis suggests that even if two functions contain the same CWE-787 out-of-bound write vulnerability (the top-1 dangerous CWE-ID in 2022 ), the specific vulnerable statements can be written in different ways and located in different parts of the code. Therefore, identifying vulnerabilities at the statement level is challenging for both machine learning and deep learning models. Despite this difficulty, our analysis reveals that state-of-the-art VD approaches have not successfully leveraged the information contained in vulnerable statements (that could be grouped to form vulnerable scopes) to further improve the capability of machine learning and deep learning vulnerability detection approaches at both the function and statement levels. To address this issue, we propose a novel DL-based framework that can effectively utilize the information presented in vulnerable scopes. To achieve this, we develop a method for quantizing similar vulnerable scopes that share the same pattern into a vulnerability codebook consisting of common codewords which represent common patterns. This codebook captures a diverse range of vulnerabilities from the training data and facilitates the process of vulnerability matching inspired by the pattern-matching concept utilized in program analysis tools    . Our approach is the first to successfully exploit the benefits of vulnerability matching and codebook-based quantization to enhance DL-based VD. This allows us to effectively identify vulnerabilities in source code data, ultimately improving the overall capability of DL-based VD. Our approach involves collecting and quantizing a set of vulnerable scopes from the training set before using the optimal transport (OT) 6 to cluster this set into a vulnerability codebook consisting of a set of vulnerability centroids (i.e., codewords).\nThe vulnerable scopes (collected from the training set) that share a similar pattern would stay closely in representations, hence we cluster them into a centroid to summarize them.\nBy clustering the set of vulnerable scopes into a smaller set of centroids, we reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and make it easier for the model to perform matching during inference. Additionally, the use of centroids ensures that similar vulnerable scopes are mapped to the same location in the feature space.\nDuring training, we minimize the Wasserstein distance 6 between the set of vulnerable scopes and the vulnerability codebook, which allows us to effectively cluster vulnerable scopes and learn the representative centroids in the codebook.\nDuring inference, our model matches the input program against all centroids in the learned vulnerability codebook.\nBy examining all the vulnerability patterns in the codebook, the matching process enables a thorough search for potential vulnerabilities. This explicit matching method supports the identification of specific vulnerability patterns and their associated statements, providing a comprehensive approach to identifying vulnerabilities.\nWe name this model OptiMatch, a function and statement-level vulnerability identification approach via optimal transport quantization and vulnerability matching. In summary, our work presents several contributions: (i) an innovative vulnerability-matching DL framework utilizing optimal transport and vector quantization for function and statement-level vulnerability detection (VD); (ii) a novel statement embedding approach using recurrent neural networks (RNNs); and (iii) a thorough evaluation of our proposed method compared to other DL-based vulnerability prediction techniques on a large benchmark dataset of real-world vulnerabilities.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: The number of software vulnerabilities has been escalating rapidly in recent years.\nIn particular, National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [ref]6 reported 26,448 software vulnerabilities in 2022, soaring 40% from 18,938 in 2019.\nThe extensive use of open-source libraries, in particular, may contribute to this rise in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
