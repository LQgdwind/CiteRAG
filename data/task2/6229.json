      "content": "Paper Title: RLAD: Reinforcement Learning from Pixels for Autonomous Driving in Urban Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe encoder is responsible for transforming the data from the sensors (otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t}) into a low-dimension feature vector (𝒉~tsubscript~𝒉𝑡\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{h}}_{t}) to be processed by the RL algorithm. As demonstrated in [ref]11, the size of the image encoder is a critical element in an RLfP method. Due to the weak signal of the RL loss, encoders commonly used in AD methods, such as ResNet50  (∼similar-to\\sim 25M parameters) or Inception V3 [ref]30 (∼similar-to\\sim 27M parameters), are impracticable. On the other side, small encoders, designed for scenarios of smaller complexity, such as IMPALA [ref]31 (∼similar-to\\sim 0.22M parameters), cannot produce an adequate representation of the environment, which limits the performance of the driving agent. For urban AD, our findings suggest that the optimal configuration entails a trade-off between larger networks that are unsuitable for training with RL and smaller networks that cannot accurately perceive the environment. The architecture of the proposed image encoder is shown in Table I, containing around 1M parameters.\nSimilarly to DrQ and DrQ-V2, we leverage simple image augmentations to regularize the value function [ref]11 . First, we apply padding to each side of the 256×\\times256 image by repeating the 8 boundary pixels and then selecting a random crop of 256×\\times256. As in , we found it useful to apply bilinear interpolation on the cropped images. In addition to the image augmentations, we also found that appending an A-LIX layer  at the end of each convolution layer improves the performance of the agent, possibly by preventing a phenomenon called catastrophic self-overfitting (spatially inconsistent feature maps that lead to discontinuous gradients in the backpropagation). A-LIX is applied on the features produced by the convolution layers a∈ℝC×H×W𝑎superscriptℝ𝐶𝐻𝑊a\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C\\times H\\times W}, by randomly mixing each component ac​i​jsubscript𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑗a_{cij} with its neighbors belonging to the same feature map.\nConsequently, the output of A-LIX is of the same dimensionality as the input, but with the difference that the computation graph minimally disrupts the information of each feature ac​i​jsubscript𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑗a_{cij}, while smoothing discontinuous component of the gradients signal during backpropagation . Hence, this technique works by enforcing the image encoder to produce feature maps that are spatially consistent and thus minimizing the effect of the catastrophic self-overfitting phenomenon. This process can be succinctly summarized as\n𝒊~t=fi​(aug​([{𝑰t−k}k=02]))subscript~𝒊𝑡subscript𝑓𝑖augdelimited-[]superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑰𝑡𝑘𝑘02\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{i}}_{t}=f_{i}(\\mathrm{aug}(\\left[\\{\\boldsymbol{I}_{t-k}\\}_{k=0}^{2}\\right]))\n, where fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} is the image encoder, augaug\\mathrm{aug} corresponds to the data augmentation applied, and 𝒊~tsubscript~𝒊𝑡\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{i}}_{t} corresponds to the latent representation of the stack of three consecutive images ([{𝑰t−k}k=02])delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑰𝑡𝑘𝑘02\\left(\\left[\\{\\boldsymbol{I}_{t-k}\\}_{k=0}^{2}\\right]\\right). Usually, the waypoint encoder consists of using the mean orientation between the current pose of the agent and the next N𝑁N waypoints  or flattening the waypoints’ 2D coordinates into a vector and then applying an MLP . In our point of view, both approaches have serious limitations. The former approach clearly oversimplifies the problem by encoding all waypoint coordinates into a single value. This method only works for small values of N𝑁N, because as N𝑁N increases, the waypoints become more scattered, and thus the mean orientation ceases to be a reliable indicator. Although the latter approach works for all values of N𝑁N, by flattening the 2D waypoint coordinates into a vector, the 2D geometrical information is not being used. To overcome both limitations, we propose WayConv1D, a waypoint encoder that leverages the 2D geometrical structure of the input by applying 1D convolutions with a 2×\\times2 kernel over the 2D coordinates of the next N𝑁N waypoints. The output of the 1D convolution is then flattened and processed by an MLP. This process can be summarized as 𝒘~t=fw​(𝑾t)subscript~𝒘𝑡subscript𝑓𝑤subscript𝑾𝑡\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{t}=f_{w}(\\boldsymbol{W}_{t}), where fwsubscript𝑓𝑤f_{w} corresponds to the WayConv1D, and 𝒘~tsubscript~𝒘𝑡\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{t} corresponds to the latent representation of the waypoints for the current step (𝑾tsubscript𝑾𝑡\\boldsymbol{W}_{t}). We found that with WayConv1D, the agent learns more efficiently to follow the trajectory without oscillating near the center of the lane. This is a common issue encountered when utilizing RL in the urban AD domain, as documented in previous studies  . Similarly to , we apply an MLP to the vehicle measurements: 𝒗~t=fv​([{𝑽t−k}k=02])subscript~𝒗𝑡subscript𝑓𝑣delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑽𝑡𝑘𝑘02\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{v}}_{t}=f_{v}(\\left[\\{\\boldsymbol{V}_{t-k}\\}_{k=0}^{2}\\right]), where fvsubscript𝑓𝑣f_{v} is the MLP, and 𝒗~tsubscript~𝒗𝑡\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{v}}_{t} corresponds to the latent representation of the concatenation of the vehicle measurements across three steps ([{𝑽t−k}k=02])delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑽𝑡𝑘𝑘02\\left(\\left[\\{\\boldsymbol{V}_{t-k}\\}_{k=0}^{2}\\right]\\right).\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: transforming the data from the sensors (otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t}) into a low-dimension feature vector (𝒉~tsubscript~𝒉𝑡\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{h}}_{t}) to be processed by the RL algorithm.
