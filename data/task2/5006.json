      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Product Graphs from Spectral Templates\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo investigate the applicability of the proposed ProdSpecTemp on real-world Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals, we select the MASS-SS3 dataset  consisting of Polysomnogram (PSG) data from 62 healthy subjects during sleep, i.e., 20 EEG, 3 Electromyogram (EMG), 2 Electrooculogram (EOG), and 1 Electrocardiogram (ECG) channels with a sampling frequency of 256 Hz. The sleep scoring of the thirty-second sleep epochs into five sleep stages (Wake, Rapid Eye Movement (REM), N1, N2, and N3) is performed by sleep experts using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard . With no specific preprocessing on the PSG signals, Differential Entropy (DE) features in 9 crossed frequency bands 0.5-4 Hz, 2-6 Hz, 4-8 Hz, 6-11 Hz, 8-14 Hz, 11-22 Hz, 14-31 Hz, 22-40 Hz, and 31-50 Hz were extracted from each of PSG channels. As well as the spatial EEG electrodes‚Äô connectivities having 26 spatial factor graph nodes, the temporal connections of neighbor thirty-second sleep epochs have also been reported in the relevant literature for efficient sleep staging  [ref]37 , and, therefore, we consider four epochs before and after the target epoch and, therefore, temporal factor graphs have nine nodes. It has been shown that analysis of the spatial graphs can represent valuable information about brain functional connectivity during sleep  , where Nguyen et al.  showed that the functional connectivity of the brain varies across different sleep stages. In this way, we plot and analyze the averaged sparsified learned spatial/temporal graphs based on a specific threshold. To determine the thresholds that lead to the most significant differences, we propose a statistical procedure in which the thresholds are specified based on the statistical significance difference between edge values of different sleep stage graphs. We calculate the pùëùp-values obtained from a statistical test, e.g., tùë°t-test, in the threshold span of {0:0.1:1}conditional-set0:0.11\\{0:0.1:1\\} corresponding to the pairwise sleep stages in Figure 5. Besides, the average of the pùëùp-values of the threshold span corresponding to the graph connectivities is illustrated in Figure 6. From these results, it can be seen that T‚Äãh‚Äãr=0.4ùëá‚Ñéùëü0.4Thr=0.4 and T‚Äãh‚Äãr=0.3ùëá‚Ñéùëü0.3Thr=0.3 have approximately led to the lowest (non-zero) pùëùp-value and consequently higher statistical significance between different sleep stages for spatial and temporal averaged graphs, respectively. Therefore, these obtained thresholds are set to illustrate the binary averaged graphs. Figure 7 (a), i.e., the averaged learned spatial graphs related to the EEG channels, shows that during non-REM sleep stages (i.e., N1-3), the brain connectivities decrease compared to the Wake state, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies admitting reduced hypothalamic functional connectivity, which may be synchronized for establishing and maintaining sleep  . Moreover, this figure shows an increase in connectivity and activity of the occipital region corresponding to the REM vs. non-REM, which is consistent with the results of [ref]43  that illustrate the occipital metabolism and, therefore, its connectivity with the other brain regions increases during REM vs. non-REM. Besides, the N1 stage has the most connection-based activity vs. N2 and N3, and also N3 has the lowest, which are quite consistent and supported by the neuroscientific research literature   implying that the N1 stage is a complicated stage and the brain is still active unlike the N3 stage which is a typical deep stage and the brain is in its low active mode. Figure 7 (b) shows the averaged learned temporal graphs. It can be seen that the target epoch is (mostly) connected with its before/after epochs; however, the key point of this figure is that even distant neighboring epochs (e.g., t‚àí4ùë°4t-4 and t+3ùë°3t+3) do not necessarily follow a tree-like graph structure, which means that different sleep epochs could have connections, and it is not limited to only before/after neighbor epochs.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: connectivities having 26 spatial factor graph nodes, the temporal connections of neighbor thirty-second sleep epochs have also been reported in the relevant literature for efficient sleep staging  [ref]37 , and, therefore, we consider four epochs before and after the target epoch and, therefore, temporal factor graphs have nine nodes.
