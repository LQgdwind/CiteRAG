      "content": "Paper Title: Frontier AI Regulation:Managing Emerging Risks to Public Safety\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInformation is often considered the “lifeblood” of effective\ngovernance.383838See  (but see claims in article\nregarding the challenge of private incentives),  (see\np282 regarding the need for information and 285 regarding industry’s informational\nadvantage), . For regulators to positively impact a\ngiven domain, they need to understand it. Accordingly, regulators dedicate\nsignificant resources to collecting information about the issues, activities,\nand organizations they seek to govern  . Regulating AI should be no exception . Regulators\nneed to understand the technology, and the resources, actors, and ecosystem\nthat create and use it. Otherwise, regulators may fail to address the\nappropriate regulatory targets, offer ineffective regulatory solutions, or\nintroduce regulatory regimes that have adverse unintended\nconsequences.393939This is exacerbated by the pacing problem\n[ref]174, and regulators’ poor track record of monitoring\nplatforms (LLM APIs are platforms) .\nThis is particularly challenging for frontier AI, but certainly holds true for\nregulating AI systems writ large. There exist several complementary approaches to achieving regulatory visibility\n.\nFirst, regulators could develop a framework that facilitates AI companies\nvoluntarily disclosing information about frontier AI, or foundation models in\ngeneral. This could include providing documentation about the AI models\nthemselves     , as well as the processes involved in developing\nthem .\nSecond, regulators could mandate these or other disclosures, and impose\nreporting requirements on AI companies, as is commonplace in other\nindustries.404040One of many examples from other industries is the\nSecurities and Exchange Act of 1934, which requires companies to disclose\nspecific financial information in annual and quarterly reports. But see\n regarding the shortcomings of mandatory disclosure.\nThird, regulators could directly, or via third parties, audit AI companies\nagainst established safety and risk-management frameworks\n (on auditing, see\n ).\nFinally, as in other industries, regulators could establish whistleblower\nregimes that protect individuals who disclose safety-critical information to\nrelevant government authorities  . In establishing disclosure and reporting schemes, it is critical that the\nsensitive information provided about frontier AI models and their owners is\nprotected from adversarial actors. The risks of information leakage can be\nmitigated by maintaining high information security, reducing the amount and\nsensitivity of the information stored (by requiring only clearly necessary\ninformation, and by having clear data retention policies), and only disclosing\ninformation to a small number of personnel with clear classification policies. At present, regulatory visibility into AI models in general remains limited,\nand is generally provided by nongovernmental actors\n[ref]187  . Although these\nprivate efforts offer valuable information, they are not a substitute for more\nstrategic and risk-driven regulatory visibility. Nascent governmental efforts\ntowards increasing regulatory visibility should be supported and redoubled, for\nfrontier AI as well as for a wider range of AI models.414141The EU-US TTC\nJoint Roadmap discusses “monitoring and measuring existing and emerging AI\nrisks” . The EU Parliament’s proposed\nAI Act includes provisions on the creation of an AI Office, which would be\nresponsible for e.g. “issuing opinions, recommendations, advice or guidance”,\nsee [24, recital 76]. The UK White Paper “A pro-innovation\napproach to AI regulation” proposes the creation of a central government\nfunction aimed at e.g. monitoring and assessing the regulatory environment for AI\n[191, box 3.3].\n\nReference markers found: [174]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]174: the\nappropriate regulatory targets, offer ineffective regulatory solutions, or\nintroduce regulatory regimes that have adverse unintended\nconsequences.393939This is exacerbated by the pacing problem\n[ref]174, and regulators’ poor track record of monitoring\nplatforms (LLM APIs are platforms) .\nThis is particularly challenging for frontier AI, but certainly holds true for\nregulating AI systems\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
