      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Cycling (FedCy): Semi-supervised Federated Learning of Surgical Phases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning has emerged recently as a promising collaborative learning method to mitigate data privacy concerns and the dependence of deep learning methods on developing in large centralized data lakes. In its vanilla setting, federated learning is a process where a central server coordinates and allows for multiple data owners to train collaboratively without having to explicitly expose their data. Data owners can be medical institutions or data centers and are hereinafter referred to as clients. Learning in a federated setting involves several clients iteratively training local models on their data, which are then aggregated by a central server to form a single global model that is used by each client as an initialization for the next round of local training. Given the sensitive nature of medical data, federated learning has naturally been utilized in a variety of healthcare applications . For instance, it has been used for detecting COVID-19 lung abnormalities [ref]17 and for brain tumor segmentation . In these studies[ref]17, federated learning demonstrated comparable performance to conventional data sharing approaches while mitigating privacy concerns. To the best of our knowledge, no federated learning approach has yet been applied to surgical videos, which is the application context of this work.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: sensitive nature of medical data, federated learning has naturally been utilized in a variety of healthcare applications .
