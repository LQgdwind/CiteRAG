      "content": "Paper Title: YOLOSA: Object detection based on 2D local feature superimposed self-attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the neck structure[ref]1 of real-time object detection   [ref]1  [ref]6      3  , the most popular approach is to use the FPN + PAN structure. The feature concatenation stage of this structure (before input to the detection head) concatenates the output of the feature maps from multiple levels of the backbone network. Therefore, the feature information gathered here plays a vital role in the object inference of the detection head. We focused on adding an attention module at this stage and hoped to improve the model’s accuracy performance without affecting its inference speed. After adding the CAM[ref]14 or CBAM7 at this stage, we found that the accuracy of the model did not improve much (Table  1). We also tried to add the multi-head self-attention4 module here, but owing to the sharp increase in the number of model calculations and parameters (The matrix with the shape of c​h​a​n​n​e​l​s×(h⋅w)𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑠⋅ℎ𝑤channels\\times(h\\cdot w) is multiplied by its own transpose), the inference speed of the model is very low, which cannot meet the requirements of real-time object detection. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel self-attention module called 2D local feature superimposed self-attention (Fig. 2). The calculation procedure of LFSa is very similar to that of the self-attention module. We did not calculate the global feature weights for the feature maps of all channels, because doing so would entail a large number of calculations. We only calculated the local feature weights for rows or columns in the feature map of each channel. Assume X∈ℝC×H×W𝑋superscriptℝ𝐶𝐻𝑊X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C\\times H\\times W} is the input feature map, and Q𝑄Q, K𝐾K, and V𝑉V are the feature maps of X𝑋X after convolution with the convolving kernel size of 1×1111\\times 1. Qisubscript𝑄𝑖Q_{i}, Kisubscript𝐾𝑖K_{i}, and Visubscript𝑉𝑖V_{i} represent the feature map of one channel i∈{0,1,2,…,C}𝑖012…𝐶i\\in\\{0,1,2,...,C\\}. The calculation process can be summarized as follows: where Fir​o​w​(X)superscriptsubscript𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑋F_{i}^{row}(X), and Fic​o​l​(X)superscriptsubscript𝐹𝑖𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑋F_{i}^{col}(X) are globally weighted features for the rows or columns of one channel feature map. Relative to the feature map of one channel, this weighted feature is global, but relative to all channels of one picture, it is local. Next, we used the convolution with a convolving kernel size of 1×1111\\times 1 to extract the channel features of Fr​o​w​(X)superscript𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑋F^{row}(X), and Fc​o​l​(X)superscript𝐹𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑋F^{col}(X) in the dimension of the channel (Fig. 4 (a)). As the feature map of each channel is the global weighted feature of the row or column, it is equivalent to using the local receptive field to obtain the global weighted feature of the entire picture based on the row and column in the dimension of the channel. Therefore, the perception of global features is completed through these two steps of extracting local features. This method substantially reduces the amount of calculation and parameters of the model. As we use 1×1111\\times 1 convolution to make the receptive field of the feature map of each channel relatively small, if we increase the size of the convolving kernel, it will lead to an increase in the number of calculations and parameters. Therefore, we added a depthwise convolution (Fig. 4 (b)) after the 1×1111\\times 1 convolution and used the 7×7777\\times 7 large-size convolving kernel to increase the perception of the feature map information of each channel. As each convolving kernel is independent of each channel, the increase of calculation and parameters is within an acceptable range while increasing the receptive field. In the last step, we added the row global weighted feature maps and the column global weighted feature maps. In this manner, the globally weighted feature map of pixels based on all channel feature maps is obtained. The idea of the global weighted of the self-attention model is realized in another manner, which reduces the number of calculations and parameters of the model substantially. The calculation process can be summarized as follows: where C​o​n​v𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣Conv represents the convolution layer with a convolving kernel size of 1×1111\\times 1 and groups of 1, and D​e​p​t​h​w​i​s​e​C​o​n​v𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣DepthwiseConv represents the depthwise-convolution layer with a convolving kernel size of 7×7777\\times 7 and groups equal to the number of channels. To more intuitively compare the advantages of our LFSa with other attention modules, we used the Eigen-CAM visualization results to analyze the focus of the network on the picture (Fig. 5). Eigen-CAM computes and visualizes the principle components of the learned features/representations from the convolutional layers. Thus, we can intuitively determine the attention of various modules to the detection object through the heatmap in the picture and bounding box. In fig. 5, our LFSa module focuses more on the object and maximizes the range of attention within the bounding box of the object. In addition, our model pays less attention to the area outside the bounding box of the object, i.e., the background has less interference with the object. Our module also globally stratifies the attention of multiple objects. In Fig. 5 (a), we can see that YOLOv5[ref]6+CAM[ref]14’s attention range has a very large deviation. In addition, if we observe the image in the second row, we can find that except for our LFSa module, the backgrounds of other model inference images have spots of various sizes on the top of the object. This shows that the background has noticeable interference with the detected object, except for in our module. In Fig. 5 (b), compared with other models, our LFSa module’s attention range is closer to the edge of the object and pays more attention to the details. In Fig. 5 (c), our LFSa module divides the attention of different objects from a global perspective, so that the attention of different objects is obviously stratified, and the attention of the same object is roughly the same. This stratification is more obvious in the attention of multiple objects shown in Fig. 5 (d). Therefore, we can see from Fig. 5 that our method is superior to other methods. We also compared the AP of the LFSa module with other attention modules based on the YOLOv5l[ref]6 model. As presented in Table  1, our LFSa module achieved very good performance, with an increase of 0.7% over the baseline on AP, and the growth rate is much higher than CAM[ref]14 and CBAM7 modules. In general, our LFSa module combines the advantages of the self-attention module4 and convolutional network. We first calculate the weighted features based on rows/columns of the feature map based on each channel in each picture and then connect the entire picture from the dimension of the channel through the local receptive field of the convolution network, which is the global feature based on the picture. This realizes the idea of the self-attention module from a more efficient perspective.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In the neck structure[ref]1 of real-time object detection   [ref]1  [ref]6      3  , the most popular approach is to use the FPN + PAN structure.
