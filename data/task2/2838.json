      "content": "Paper Title: Dimensionality Reduction for 𝑘-Distance Applied to Persistent Homology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPersistent homology is one of the main tools to extract information from data in topological data analysis.\nGiven a data set as a point cloud in some ambient space, the idea is to construct a filtration sequence of topological spaces from the point cloud,\nand extract topological information from this sequence. The topological spaces are usually constructed by considering balls around the data points,\nin some given metric of interest, as the open sets. However the usual distance function is highly sensitive to the presence of outliers and noise.\nOne approach is to use distance functions that are more robust to outliers, such as the distance-to-a-measure and the related k𝑘k-distance\n(for finite data sets), proposed recently by Chazal et al. \nAlthough this is a promising direction, an exact implementation can have significant cost in run-time. To overcome this difficulty,\napproximations of the k𝑘k-distance have been proposed recently that led to certified approximations of persistent\nhomology  [ref]7. Other approaches involve using kernels  and\nde-noising algorithms  . In all the above settings, the sub-routines required for computing persistent homology have exponential or worse dependence on the\nambient dimension, and rapidly become unusable in real-time once the dimension grows beyond a few dozens - which is indeed the case in many applications,\nfor example in image processing, neuro-biological networks, and data mining (see e.g. ). This phenomenon is often referred\nto as the curse of dimensionality. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma.\nOne of the simplest and most commonly used mechanisms to mitigate this curse, is that of random projections, as applied in the\ncelebrated Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma (JL Lemma for short) .\nThe JL Lemma states that any set of\nn𝑛n points in Euclidean space can be embedded into a space of\ndimension O​(ε−2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝜀2𝑛O({\\varepsilon}^{-2}\\log n) with (1±ε)plus-or-minus1𝜀(1\\pm{\\varepsilon})\ndistortion.\nSince the initial non-constructive proof of this fact by Johnson and Lindenstrauss ,\nseveral authors have given successive improvements, e.g., Indyk, Motwani, Raghavan and Vempala ,\nDasgupta and Gupta 4, Achlioptas ,\nAilon and Chazelle , Matoušek 0,\nKrahmer and Ward 7, and Kane and Nelson 6.\nThese address the issues of efficient construction\nand implementation, using random matrices that support fast multiplication.\nDirksen 5 gave a unified theory for\ndimensionality reduction using subgaussian matrices. In a different direction, variants of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma giving embeddings into spaces of lower dimension than the JL bound have been given\nunder several specific settings. For point sets lying in regions of bounded Gaussian width, a theorem of Gordon 2\nimplies that the dimension of the embedding can be reduced to a function of the Gaussian width, independent of the number of\npoints. Sarlos  showed that points lying on a d𝑑d-flat can be mapped to O​(d/ε2)𝑂𝑑superscript𝜀2O(d/{\\varepsilon}^{2}) dimensions\nindependently of the number of points. Baraniuk and Wakin  proved an analogous result for points on a smooth submanifold\nof Euclidean space,\nwhich was subsequently sharpened by Clarkson 2 (see also Verma ), whose version directly preserves geodesic distances on\nthe submanifold. Other related results include those of Indyk and Naor 2\nfor sets of bounded doubling dimension and Alon and Klartag  for general\ninner products, with additive error only. Recently, Nelson and Narayanan 1, building on earlier\nresults 8 9, showed that for a given set of points or terminals, using just\none extra dimension from the Johnson-Lindenstrauss bound, it is possible to achieve dimensionality reduction in a way\nthat preserves not only inter-terminal distances, but also distances between any terminal to any point in the ambient space. Our results are based on the notion of weighted points, and as in most applications of the JL lemma, give a reduced dimensionality typically of the\norder of hundreds. This is very useful if the ambient dimensionality is much higher magnitude (e.g. 106superscript10610^{6}).\nMoreover, some of the above-mentioned variants and generalizations such as for point sets having bounded Gaussian width\nor lying on a lower-dimensional submanifold, the reduced dimensionality is independent of the number of input points,\nwhich allows for still better reductions. Dimension Reduction and Persistent Homology. The JL Lemma has also been used by Sheehy 5\nand Lotz 8 to reduce the complexity of computing persistent homology. Both Sheehy and Lotz show that the persistent\nhomology of a point cloud is approximately preserved under random projections 5 8, up to\na (1±ε)plus-or-minus1𝜀(1\\pm\\varepsilon) multiplicative factor, for any ε∈ 𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in . Sheehy proves this for an n𝑛n-point set, whereas\nLotz’s generalization applies to sets of bounded Gaussian width, and also implies dimensionality reductions for sets of bounded doubling dimension,\nin terms of the spread (ratio of the maximum to minimum interpoint distance).\nHowever, their techniques involve only the usual distance to a point set and therefore\nremain sensitive to outliers and noise as mentioned earlier. The question of adapting the method of random projections in order to reduce the complexity of\ncomputing persistent homology using the k𝑘k-distance, is therefore a natural one, and has been raised by Sheehy 5,\nwho observed that “One notable distance function that is missing from this paper [i.e. 5] is the so-called\ndistance to a measure or …k𝑘k-distance …it remains open whether the k𝑘k-distance itself is (1±ε)plus-or-minus1𝜀(1\\pm\\varepsilon)-preserved under random projection.”\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: can have significant cost in run-time.
