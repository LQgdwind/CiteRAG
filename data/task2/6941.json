      "content": "Paper Title: Interactive Graph Convolutional Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the field of modern recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) plays a prominent role [ref]27 [ref]28.\nCF models such as Matrix Factorization (MF)  were commonly employed, which used an embedding vector projection of a user or item ID to encapsulate users and items as embeddings and thus reconstructing historical interactions.\nAs the field evolved, the advent of neural network-based recommender models such as NCF  and LRML  brought about a shift. Although these models retained the use of the embedding component, they greatly enhanced the interaction modeling mechanism by exploiting the ability of neural networks to model complex interactions.\nMore recently, inspired by the power of graph convolution, new methods such as LightGCN [ref]10, GC-MC , PinSage [ref]28, SiGRec , and XSimGCL  have been developed that adapt GCN to the user-item interaction graph for recommendations.\nThese graph neural network-based models capture CF signals from high-hop neighbors, illustrating a significant leap forward in the field of recommendation systems.\nOur work effectively integrates the LightGCN [ref]10 model widely used in the field.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: In the field of modern recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) plays a prominent role [ref]27 [ref]28.\nCF models such as Matrix Factorization (MF)  were commonly employed, which used an embedding vector projection of a user or item ID to encapsulate users and items as embeddings and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
