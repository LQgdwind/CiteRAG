      "content": "Paper Title: Latent Video Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity Long Video Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion models are a class of likelihood-based generative models that have shown remarkable progress in image synthesis tasks.\nDue to their desirable properties like stable training and easy scalability, diffusion models have surpassed GANs on the image generation task and achieved both higher sample quality and better distribution coverage [ref]4.\nIts scalability further facilitates the building of large-scale text-to-image generation models   [ref]23 , which show marvelous image samples recently.\nThe groundbreaking work of diffusion models is DDPM [ref]9, which leverages the connection between Langevin dynamics  and denoising score matching  to build a weighted variational bound for optimization.\nHowever, the sampling process needs to follow the Markov chain step by step to produce one sample, which is extremely slow (e.g., usually 1000 or 4000 steps [ref]9 [ref]4).\nDDIM  accelerates the sampling process via an iterative non-Markovian way while keeping the same training process unchanged.\n  further improves the log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality, and ADM [ref]4 eventually outperforms GAN-based methods via an elaborately designed architecture and classifier guidance.\nContemporarily, a cascaded diffusion model  is proposed with a sequence of lower resolution conditional diffusion models as an alternative approach to improve the sample fidelity and shows that conditional noisy augmentation is pivotal to the stacked architecture.\nDespite their findings and achievement in image synthesis, diffusion models on video generation have not been well-studied.\nMost recently, VDM  extends diffusion models to the video domain, which initiates the exploration of diffusion models on video generation.\nSpecifically, they modify the 2D UNet to a spatial-temporal factorized 3D network and further present image-video joint training and gradient-based video extension techniques.\nMCVD  parameterizes unconditional video generation and conditional frame prediction and interpolation models as a unified one by randomly dropping conditions (previous or future frames) during training, which shares the similar underneath idea with classifier-free guidance which joint trains a class-conditional and unconditional model.\nMake-A-Video , and Imagen Video  leverage a series of big diffusion models for large-scale video synthesis conditioned on a given text prompt.\nHowever, previous video-based video generation approaches all perform diffusion and denoising processes in pixel space, which requires substantial computational resources.\nIn this paper, we extend the latent image diffusion model [ref]23 to video by devising a 3D auto-encoder for video compression.\nFounded on this baseline, we further show how long videos can be sampled via a hierarchical architecture and natural extensions of conditional noise augmentation. Concurrent works.\nWith the rapid development of diffusion models, two contemporary works share similar ideas with us and propose latent-based diffusion models.\nMagicVideo  proposes an efficient video generation framework via latent diffusion models.\nUnlike MagicVideo, which compresses videos frame-by-frame, we compress the redundant information along the temporal axis to obtain more compact latent.\nPVDM  proposes to parameterize videos as image-like latent by selecting three 2D latents along three axes of the 3D video latent. Then they train a 2D diffusion network to model these 2D latents for video. Differently, we exploit 3D diffusion networks to model the cubic video latents directly.\nAnother important difference between our work with Magic video and PVDM is that we make a further step towards long video generation and provide a hierarchical framework, conditional noise perturbation and unconditional guidance to boost the long video generation performance.\non alleviating the performance degradation problem.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: properties like stable training and easy scalability, diffusion models have surpassed GANs on the image generation task and achieved both higher sample quality and better distribution coverage [ref]4.\nIts scalability further facilitates the building of large-scale text-to-image generation models   [ref]23 , which show marvelous image samples recently.\nThe groundbreaking work of diffusion\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
