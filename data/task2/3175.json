      "content": "Paper Title: On visual self-supervision and its effect on model robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo set the setting, we will borrow the notation from Madry et al.  . Typically, machine learning models are optimized to maximize a certain metric and thus have a low expected loss, As mentioned earlier, neural networks were found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples [ref]25 0, which are images that have been altered to fool a model. Therefore, there is a lot of interest in developing models that are \\sayrobust, i.e. resistant to adversarial examples. Therefore, the goal is now to train models that minimize the adversarial loss, where ŒîŒî\\Delta is a set of lpsubscriptùëôùëùl_{p}-bounded perturbations, or alternatively a set SùëÜS of adversarial examples x‚Ä≤‚ààùí≥superscriptùë•‚Ä≤ùí≥x^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X} where S={x‚Ä≤‚ààùí≥:‚à•x‚Ä≤‚àíx‚à•p<œµ}ùëÜconditional-setsuperscriptùë•‚Ä≤ùí≥subscriptdelimited-‚à•‚à•superscriptùë•‚Ä≤ùë•ùëùitalic-œµS=\\{x^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X}:\\lVert x^{\\prime}-x\\rVert_{p}<\\epsilon\\}. One of the most successful methods for defending is adversarial training 0  [ref]31. A variant of adversarial training proposed by Madry et al  solves the above problem by finding the worst case lpsubscriptùëôùëùl_{p} bounded adversarial examples using projected gradient descent (PGD) and finds set of parameters Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta that minimize the empirical training loss using these examples , In adversarial training by Madry et al. , an image xùë•x is first perturbed in its neighborhood U‚Äã(x,œµ)ùëàùë•italic-œµU(x,\\epsilon), i.e. It then follows the generation process of the Basic Iterative Method 7 , where KùêæK is the number of \\sayattacks steps, or iterations of projected gradient descent performed to find the worst case lpsubscriptùëôùëùl_{p} bounded adversarial example xa‚Äãd‚Äãvsuperscriptùë•ùëéùëëùë£x^{adv}. Œ†psubscriptŒ†ùëù\\Pi_{p} is an operator that will project the iterates onto an lpsubscriptùëôùëùl_{p} ball, in our case p=2ùëù2p=2 and ‚àû\\infty. Algorithm 1 describes the general procedure for generating PGD adversaries. As we see in Figure 2 and Algorithm 1, there are several choices to be made regarding how to incorporate self-supervision into adversarial training (AT). For now, assume our self-supervised task of choice is rotation prediction , though we show that there is nothing unique about rotation prediction and one can substitute any self-supervised task of choice. One can use image rotation in the image pre-processing pipeline (without incorporating self-supervised loss), however this hurts the baseline AT performance, and therefore is not further considered. The first way to incorporate self-supervision into AT is to apply the transformation TùëáT to the batch of images XùëãX to obtain the rotated versions of the batch and corresponding labels XS‚ÄãSsubscriptùëãùëÜùëÜX_{SS} and yS‚ÄãSsubscriptùë¶ùëÜùëÜy_{SS} respectively. One then computes the adversarial version of XS‚ÄãSa‚Äãd‚ÄãvsuperscriptsubscriptùëãùëÜùëÜùëéùëëùë£X_{SS}^{adv} and compute the following loss where Œª1subscriptùúÜ1\\lambda_{1} is the weight of the self-supervised loss222Note that the loss ‚Ñí‚Ñí\\mathcal{L} also includes the weight regularization term. however this is not shown as this term is present for all of the cases., FŒ∏subscriptùêπùúÉF_{\\theta} represents a neural network model with two prediction heads, one for the supervised task (FŒ∏‚Äã(‚ãÖ)subscriptùêπùúÉ‚ãÖF_{\\theta}(\\cdot)) and the other for self-supervised task (FŒ∏S‚ÄãS‚Äã(‚ãÖ)superscriptsubscriptùêπùúÉùëÜùëÜ‚ãÖF_{\\theta}^{SS}(\\cdot)). This too is found to be inferior to baseline adversarial training, dropping the clean and robust (œµt‚Äãe‚Äãs‚Äãt=8/255subscriptitalic-œµùë°ùëíùë†ùë°8255\\epsilon_{test}=8/255) accuracy from 85.46% and 44.69% to 74.9% and 36.60% respectively. The following are options for adding self-supervision that involve making a copy of the batch to which the self-supervised transformation TùëáT will be applied, resulting in a batch XùëãX and a batch XS‚ÄãS=T‚Äã(X)subscriptùëãùëÜùëÜùëáùëãX_{SS}=T(X)333Transformation TùëáT also gives us the self-supervised labels yS‚ÄãSsubscriptùë¶ùëÜùëÜy_{SS}. These scenarios fit the description of Algorithm 1 and Figure 2. The simplest way to add self-supervision into AT (denoted as SS ùíØ1subscriptùíØ1\\mathcal{T}_{1}) is by generating adversarial examples Xa‚Äãd‚Äãvsuperscriptùëãùëéùëëùë£X^{adv}, while leaving XS‚ÄãSsubscriptùëãùëÜùëÜX_{SS} unchanged, and computing the combined loss Lastly, one can attack both the original batch images XùëãX and transformed images XS‚ÄãSsubscriptùëãùëÜùëÜX_{SS}, resulting in the following loss This scenario offers another set of decisions corresponding to lines 4-6 of Algorithm 1: when generating adversarial examples for XùëãX and XS‚ÄãSsubscriptùëãùëÜùëÜX_{SS}, should one use the supervised loss (SS ùíØ2subscriptùíØ2\\mathcal{T}_{2}), the self-supervised loss, or both (and what ratio Œª2subscriptùúÜ2\\lambda_{2}) (SS ùíØ3subscriptùíØ3\\mathcal{T}_{3}) to find the worst case adversarial examples? As can be seen, incorporating self-supervision into AT is not straightforward. Using just SS loss for generating adversarial examples is much worse as compared to the baseline, due to the fact that they are not optimized to defend against perturbations that they are tested against.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: machine learning models are optimized to maximize a certain metric and thus have a low expected loss, As mentioned earlier, neural networks were found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples [ref]25 0, which are images that have been altered to fool a model.
