      "content": "Paper Title: Questions of science: chatting with ChatGPT about complex systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection, as a proxy to the community, we turn to ChatGPT to explore the criticisms that the complex systems field has faced, following our earlier attempt to provide an overview of the field in Section 5.1.1. Figure 39 shows a very relevant spectrum of the critiques received by the field: lack of rigorous mathematical foundations, lack of experimental validation, overreliance on reductionism, Lack of clarity on what constitutes a complex system and lack of progress in solving real-world problems. All these critiques deserve special attention, since they are recurrent in the field. It is unfair to say that the field lacks mathematical rigor, since the lack of rigor is not widespread in the field. While there are some areas of the field that depend strongly on simulations, there are other areas that the mathematical rigor dominates. Among the areas with more rigor, we may cite the fields of chaos theory and information theory, with an intermediate level of rigor, we may cite the fields of complex networks and cellular automatas, and the field that depends mostly on simulations are the agent-based models (and less on mathematics). However, even if we consider the agent-based models, there are many attempts to become them more rigorous. For instance, while Challet and other physicists introduced the minority game181818A minority game is a simple computational model for the collective behavior of agents where they compete through adaptation for scarce resources. It has been applied to investigate relevant issues, such as the dynamics of financial markets  , the effects of information in transportation networks  , the concept of intelligence , the dynamics of auctions  and strategies in deregulated markets .  using computer simulations   to study the El-Farol Bar problem , there is today a mathematical basis for this model  . Furthermore, in general in the field of agent based models, the works  and  use the statistics of experiment design to make the results of agent-based models more credible. The lack of experimental validation is not also widespread in the field either. In particular, we should mention the list of practical laboratory experiments presented in Section 4.7 and many others that may be conceived following the same lines. Furthermore, a big fraction of the literature of complex systems depend on data and its consequent validation. Furthermore, even in the case of the agent based models, as we mention in Section 5.1.2, there are today some attempts to their validation. While there is no universal agreement on what constitutes a complex system, current accepted definitions are highly consistent with each other. A useful resource for exploring these definitions is the Journal of Physics: complexity , whose editors have independently provided a range of self-concordant definitions that align closely with the one presented in Section 3. The lack of progress in solving real-world problems in our opinion is the less relevant critique, since models that come from the field of complex systems have dealt with many real world problems in the fields of traffic management  , climate modeling , epidemiology  , power grid management  , ecological modeling  , information diffusion     [ref]264 , political science      and marketing  . While many of these approaches depend on the structure of a complex network to model the interaction of the actors of the system, we may also find specific applications of fractals, such as cancer diagnosis and therapeutic management  and the characterization of soil structure . \n\nWhat are the criticisms about the area of complex systems in physics from the physicists of other areas?\n\nChatGPT: There are several criticisms of complex systems in physics from physicists of other areas, including:\nLack of rigorous mathematical foundations: Some physicists criticize complex systems research for being too reliant on computer simulations and not having a solid mathematical foundation. They argue that without a firm mathematical basis, the results of complex systems research cannot be trusted.\nLack of experimental validation: Another criticism is that much of the research in complex systems has not been experimentally validated. Critics argue that without empirical evidence, the findings of complex systems research are little more than speculation.\nOverreliance on reductionism: Critics argue that complex systems research is too reductionist, meaning it attempts to explain complex phenomena by breaking them down into simpler parts. They argue that this approach is limited and fails to capture the true complexity of the systems being studied.\nLack of clarity on what constitutes a complex system: Some physicists argue that there is no clear definition of what constitutes a complex system. They argue that this lack of clarity makes it difficult to apply complex systems research to real-world problems.\nLack of progress in solving real-world problems: Critics argue that despite decades of research in complex systems, little progress has been made in using this approach to solve real-world problems. They argue that the field is too theoretical and lacks practical applications.\nIt should be noted that not all physicists hold these criticisms, and many see the study of complex systems as a valuable and promising area of research. However, these criticisms do exist and are worth considering in any discussion of complex systems research.\n\nReference markers found: [264]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]264: systems have dealt with many real world problems in the fields of traffic management  , climate modeling , epidemiology  , power grid management  , ecological modeling  , information diffusion     [ref]264 , political science      and marketing  .
