      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Computational Cost of Bayesian Optimization for Controller Tuning with a Multi-stage Tuning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nControl engineering is a core component of the operation of industrial and robotic systems. Proper design, implementation, and maintenance of control systems enables systems to meet a variety of performance objectives such as safe operation, robustness, low environmental impact, low energy consumption, high profit margins, etc. Control algorithms (or controllers) are characterized by parameters which must be adjusted, or tuned, to meet the desired performance objectives. For example, a PID controller has P, I and D parameters.\nTraditional controller fine-tuning is done by hand, which is quite inefficient; this approach requires some degree of expert knowledge, and can only achieve sub-optimal solutions due to the high number of performance evaluations needed. Limitations in manual control tuning have motivated the introduction of various degrees of automation.\nFor example, this may include an iterative experimental approach, in which performance objectives are evaluated (either in simulation or hardware) and the best set of parameters is selected.\nMore recently, several automated tuning (auto-tuning) methodologies have combined system-model knowledge, expert knowledge, historical data, and software tools. Relevant control auto-tuning research in recent years includes the use of reinforcement learning (RL) , evolutionary algorithms , and Bayesian Optimization [ref]5[ref]6, among others. Solving the control auto-tuning optimization problem is hard in general due to the costly black-box nature of its objectives. Bayesian Optimization (BO) auto-tuning, in particular, has gained traction in recent studies [ref]7, due to its sample-efficiency [ref]5, (which results in fewer system evaluations), and the fact that it is a model-free approach (i.e., does not require system-model knowledge) . However, BO is limited to optimization problems with low-dimensional search spaces . This makes it feasible only in local parameter search for control algorithms with a small number of parameters. This is particularly challenging in systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO), where the number of control parameters can be high. Most industrial and robotic systems have multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) 0 which, in turn, often leads to multiple control loops with independent controllers. Many tuning methods simplify the MIMO requirement 12, since tuning multiple controllers is significantly harder than tuning a single controller due to the increased number of parameters and coupling/interactions between variables . The high dimensionality of the control parameter space, coupled with the costly black-box nature of the system evaluations, makes control auto-tuning for MIMO systems computationally expensive,\nboth in terms of computation time and sample efficiency. Motivated by the challenges in MIMO control tuning, several works have tried to decompose the system into subsets of control loops. A common strategy consists of identifying control loops in the system that have few or no interactions with each other, which enables the tuning of each of these isolated control loops independently 3. This is often achieved through expert knowledge 4; however, research on variable decoupling and control loop isolation is still an open issue 5. Our contributions are as follows. To address the challenges in auto-tuning MIMO systems with high-dimension parameter spaces, we propose a multistage, optimisation-based control tuning framework for MIMO systems with decentralized control, which employs control loop decoupling and isolation. Our proposed framework is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to formalize control tuning for multiple control loops as a multistage optimization task. We apply this multistage tuning framework to redefine the control tuning task into a set of tuning optimisation subtasks, and show that decomposing the control parameter search space into smaller-dimensional search spaces at each stage results in improved computational complexity for the auto-tuning solution task. We formally show this computational complexity improvement using Bayesian Optimization, and empirically validate it by solving the control auto-tuning problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with multiple PID control loops. We demonstrate an 86% improvement in computational time and 36% decrease in sample complexity. This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the state-of-the-art research on control auto-tuning with an emphasis on Bayesian Optimization approaches. Section 3 formalizes the main concepts underpinning our approach. Section 4 presents the proposed multi-stage control tuning framework. Finally, Section 5 describes the experimental design to empirically validate our hypothesis, and in Section 6 we present and discuss our experimental results.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: historical data, and software tools.
