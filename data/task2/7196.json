      "content": "Paper Title: TIER: Text-Image Encoder-based Regression for AIGC Image Quality Assessment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) refers to the process of using AI technology to automatically generate various forms of content including text, images, audio, and video, etc. The core of AIGC involves utilizing machine learning models, particularly deep learning techniques, to understand and mimic the human creative process. The advantages of AIGC include increased efficiency in content creation, reduced costs, and enhanced diversity of creativity, etc. With technological advancements, AIGC has been increasingly applied in various fields such as media, advertising, entertainment, and education, etc. However, it also poses challenges such as content quality, authenticity, copyright issues, the role and employment impact on human creators, and the risks of being used to create false information or deep fakes, etc. In the realm of image generation, as AI-generative models[ref]24 [ref]2       continue to produce images, evaluating the quality of these images has become a significant challenge. Recently, AIGC image quality assessment (AIGCIQA), which aims to assess the quality of AI-generated images (AIGIs) from a human perception perspective, has emerged as a new topic in computer vision. Unlike common image quality assessment tasks where images are derived from original ones distorted by noise, blur, and compression, etc., in AIGCIQA tasks, images are typically generated by generative models using text prompts (Fig.1). Considerable efforts have been made in the past years to advance AIGCIQA. However, most existing AIGCIQA methods 6  0  regress predicted scores directly from individual generated images, overlooking the information contained in the text prompts of these images. This oversight partially limits the performance of these AIGCIQA methods. To address this issue, we propose a text-image encoder-based regression (TIER) framework. Specifically, we process the generated images and their corresponding text prompts as inputs, utilizing a text encoder and an image encoder to extract features from these text prompts and generated images, respectively. The text encoder employs a text transformer model 8 4   commonly used in natural language processing (NLP), while the image encoder can be a convolutional neural networks (CNN) 2 1  or a vision transformer. These extracted text and image features are then concatenated and fed into a regression network to regress predicted scores. Our proposed TIER method builds upon the NR-AIGCIQA method0, enhancing it by including text prompts as inputs and using a text encoder to extract text features. Consequently, in this study, we utilize the NR-AIGCIQA method as a baseline for comparison with our TIER method. Our primary focus is on examining whether the inclusion of text prompts and the use of a text encoder for feature extraction can yield performance gains, rather than asserting that our method achieves state-of-the-art status. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on three mainstream AIGCIQA databases, including AGIQA-1K, AGIQA-3K6, and AIGCIQA2023. The experimental results indicate that our proposed TIER method generally demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline in most cases. Our contributions are summarized as follows: ∙∙\\bullet We propose a text-image encoder-based regression (TIER) framework.
