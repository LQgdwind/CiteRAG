      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Attentive Belief Propagation: Integrating Reasoning and Learning for Solving Constraint Optimization Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince BPNN  and NEBP  are proposed for partition function estimation and error correction decoding, respectively, it is not trivial to adopt them for solving COPs. Although FGNN  can be applied to solve COPs, all of these existing DNN-based BP variants require expensive supervised learning and optimal labels which are not available in our experimental settings because we consider large-scale problems and it is not practical to obtain optimal labels using heavy exact solvers. Therefore, to be fair and practical, we do not consider existing DNN-based BP variants. We compare our DABP with the following state-of-the-art COP solvers: (1) DBP with a damping factor of 0.9 and its splitting constraint factor graph version (DBP-SCFG) with a splitting ratio of 0.95 ; (2) GAT-PCM-LNS with a destroy probability of 0.2 , which is a local search method combining the LNS framework [ref]43  with neural-learned repair heuristics; (3) Mini-bucket Elimination (MBE) with an iùëñi-bound of 9 [ref]12, which is a memory-bounded inference algorithm; (4) Toulbar2 with timeout of 1200s , which is a highly optimized exact solver written in C++. The hyperparameters for DBP and GAT-PCM-LNS are set according to the original papers, while the memory budget for MBE and timeout for Toulbar2 are set based on our computational resources. All experiments are conducted on an Intel i9-9820X workstation with GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs and 384GB memory. We terminate DBP(-SCFG) and GAT-PCM-LNS whenever convergence or the maximum iteration limit (Tmax=1000subscriptùëá1000T_{\\max}=1000) reaches. Finally, we report the best solution cost for each run, and for each experiment we average the results over 100 random problem instances.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: splitting constraint factor graph version (DBP-SCFG) with a splitting ratio of 0.95 ; (2) GAT-PCM-LNS with a destroy probability of 0.2 , which is a local search method combining the LNS framework [ref]43  with neural-learned repair heuristics; (3) Mini-bucket Elimination (MBE) with an iùëñi-bound of 9 [ref]12, which is a memory-bounded inference algorithm; (4) Toulbar2 with timeout of 1200s ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
