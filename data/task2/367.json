Millions of processors are\nidle –because of both software and hardware reasons–\nwhile one processor executes the serial-only fraction of the code [ref]20.\nIn contrast with [ref]8, that ”the serial fraction …is a diminishing function of the problem size”, the weight of the housekeeping activity grows linearly with the number of the cores (and so does the idle time of the other cores). The issue known since decades returned in a technically different form at a vast number of cores.\nAfter reaching a critical number of processors (using the\npresent paradigm and technology, one can guess its value to be slightly less than 10M), adding more processors leads to a decreasing performance [ref]20 [ref]8 , as witnessed by demonstrative supercomputer failures such as G​y​o​u​k​o​u𝐺𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑘𝑜𝑢Gyoukou, A​u​r​o​r​a𝐴𝑢𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑎Aurora or S​p​i​N​N​a​k​e​r𝑆𝑝𝑖𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑟SpiNNaker. It was also noticed that a larger number of computing nodes, the performance starts to decrease . The mathematical details are discussed in [ref]20 [ref]21. At the time of writing the paper [ref]8, the quantitative breakdown of the factors of inefficiency were not yet sufficiently known:\nthe relatively inefficient HW parallel efficiency\n(as well as the high contribution of the software)\ndid not enable us to study the other contributions.\nUnfortunately, later different other scalings were also\nintroduced (sometimes not with the proper care, see ), suggesting that the\nparallel efficiency can be enhanced infinitely, i.e.\nthat the computing performance of parallel systems has no (at least close-lying) limit. Some researchers, however, correctly guessed that initialization, threading, are the main reasons of inefficiency.\nThe software also contributes: the different need for synchronization of the different tasks causes different supercomputer efficiencies \nand, of course, the payload computation also needs time.\nAll this leads to different ”rooflines” of parallelized computing . As otherwise also predicted by [ref]8, the amount of synchronization (data and control communication) of the processors is a decisive factor in defining the efficiency   . Another critical factor can be a ”higher-level synchronization” such as the commonly used ”biological clock time” in brain simulation [ref]21 that also decreases the parallel efficacy of the computing systems by orders of magnitude.\nThis paper discusses how much the parallel efficiency depends on those different factors.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: large number of processors dominates.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
