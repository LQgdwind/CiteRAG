      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Multimodal Composite Editing and Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  have been pivotal in extracting hierarchical features from images.  has demonstrated that activations in the upper layers of a CNN serve as sophisticated visual content descriptors of an image. Specifically, a CNN (e.g., AlexNet , VGG , ResNet , DenseNet , GoogleNet  and MobileNet ) pre-trained on ImageNet  can be used to obtain image embedding by employing global pooling in the last CNN layer, and show remarkable success in various computer vision tasks      . Consequently, many CNN-based methods    4 4  [ref]77  [ref]115       , as shown in Table II, adopt CNN backbones as the image encoder for conducting ITCR task. To achieve more granular feature extraction, SAC  employs multiple levels to capture both coarse and fine-grained features. LBF [ref]77 utilizes Faster R-CNN  to improve the composition of text and image features. The fusion of these features is commonly categorized into coarse and fine-grained approaches. Coarse fusion, as proposed in   [ref]77 [ref]115   4 4   , involve integrating high-level features from each modality into a single, unified representation, which enhances retrieval performance by maintaining the overall context. In contrast, fine-grained fusion, as proposed in     , divide features into separate modules (e.g., style and content) and then combine the outputs to form a final representation. Coarse fusion methods.\nCoarse fusion is a technique commonly used in multimodal composite retrieval systems to integrate information. It involves synthesizing high-level features extracted from each modality into a single, unified representation. The goal is to capture the critical information from each modality while preserving the overall context, thus enhancing retrieval performance. Gating Mechanism.\nIn Text Image Residual Gating (TIRG) , the task of text-guided image semantic alignment is first proposed by employing a learned gated residual connection and a residual connection, in order to selectively modifies image features based on the text description while preserving the aspects of the image unrelated to the text. Many subsequent methods   4 adopt the gating mechanism of TIRG as their composition module.\nJVSM  jointly learn unified joint visual semantic matching within a visual semantic embedding framework. It seeks to encode the semantic similarity between visual data (i.e., input images) and textual data (i.e., attribute-like descriptions). CurlingNet  designs two networks named Delivery filters and Sweeping filter, the former transits the reference image in an embedding space and the latter emphasizes query-related components of target images in the embedding space, which aims to find better ranking of a group of target images.\nDCNet  introduces the Dual Composition Network, by taking into account both forward (the composition network) and inverse (the correction network, which models the difference between the reference and target images in the embedding space and aligns it with the text query embedding) pathways.\nEER  addresses the composite image retrieval task by methodically modeling two key sub-processes: image semantics erasure and text semantics replenishment. To explore the intrinsic relationships between different modalities, Yang et al. introduce the Joint Prediction Module (JPM) 4. To alleviate semantic inconsistencies caused by different pre-trained models and distinct latent spaces, AET  views the reference image and the target image as a pair of transformed images and regards the modification text as an implicit transformation. To slove the problem of data scarcity and low generalization, RTIC  utilizes a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) as a regularizer by facilitating information propagation among adjacent neighbors. Observing that the characteristics of training data significantly influence the training outcomes, and considering that traditional data often results in overfitting and exhibits a low diversity of training distributions, data augmentation becomes crucial. Therefore, Huang et al.  propose a gradient augmentation (GA) model for ITCR, an implicit data augmentation inspired by adversarial training for resisting perturbations and a rationale that gradient changes can also reflect data changes to some extent. Attention Mechanism.\nLBF [ref]77 represents the reference image by a set of local entities and establishes relationships between each word of the modification text and these local areas. This approach achieves bidirectional correlation between text and image. It then operates the fusion process by incorporating a cross-modal attention module. JGAN 9 introduces a unified model that simultaneously manipulates image attributes based on modification text using a jumping graph attention network and an adversarial network to learn text-adaptive representations for queries. ARTEMIS 4 treats the modification text as a distributor of weights across the visual representations of both the reference image and the target image and designs an Explicit Matching module and an Implicit Similarity module. CRR  introduces a memory-augmented cross-modal attention module for integrating image and text features and two graph reasoning modules to establish intra-modal relationships within the query and the target separately.\nCIRPLANT  is a transformer-based model that utilizes a pre-trained vision-and-language model i.e. Oscar  and constructs a multi-layer transformer as the composition module to modify visual features. MAAF 5 extract vector “tokens” that represent elements from each input modality, and then compile these tokens into a unified sequence via an attention model. Others.\nComposeAE  suggests a model based on auto-encoders and incorporates an explicit rotational symmetry constraint into the optimization process.\nAMC  is an Adaptive Multi-expert Collaborative network, whose routers can dynamically adjust the activation and achieve adaptive fusion of reference image and text embeddings.\nSceneTrilogy  is a unified framework that jointly model sketch, text, and photo to seamlessly support several downstream tasks like fine-grained sketch and text based image retrieval.\nRBIRR  is capable of performing instance retrieval related to multiple objects, providing the category or attribute of the objects and the position constraints among them, including spatial location, size, and relationship. SSIS  adopts a “first generate, then retrieve” paradigm, training a convolutional neural network to synthesize visual features that capture the spatial-semantic constraints from the user’s canvas query.\nEISSIR  is an interactive image retrieval system based on semantic segmentation, which interprets the segmentation map drawn by user as a binary probability map. Fine-grained fusion methods.\nGiven that the guided text can vary from describing concrete attributes, the ability to conduct fine-grained fusion is necessary. It is advantageous to design a framework capable of processing information from multi-layers and conduct fusion using multiple separate modules, e.g. content and style modules  [ref]115 and coarse to fine-grained levels  . Low-level and High-level.\nSAC  focuses on the importance of both pixel and text and addresses the challenge of Text-Conditioned Image Retrieval (TCIR) through a two-step process. Trace  introduces a hierarchical feature aggregation module to learn composite vision-linguistic representations, which can be considered a variant of SAC.\nThe multi-turn framework 8 comprises three modules: the composite representation module, the comparative analysis module, and the fashion attribute module in order to learn composite representations. HCL  encodes the images into three level representations (e.g. global, entity and structure) and then fuses it through hierarchical composition learning.\nIn VAL , a composite transformer that can be seamlessly integrated into a CNN is utilized to selectively preserve and transform visual features based on language semantics. Similar to VAL, DATIR 2 also composes features in multiple levels, which is a Distribution-Aligned Text-based Image Retrieval (DATIR) model, incorporating attention mutual information maximization and hierarchical mutual information maximization. Content and Style.\n [ref]115 divide the features into content and style features. Chawla et al.  propose to represent the image using its style and content components, then transform each of these components individually and merge for retrieval. CoSMo [ref]115 stands for Content-Style Modulator, founded on the concept of separately adjusting the content and style of a reference image in terms of the specified text. Uncertainty  focuses on the alignment of coarse-grained retrieval by considering the multi-grained uncertainty. It integrates fine- and coarse-grained retrieval as matching data points with small and large fluctuations respectively and further proposes uncertainty modeling. Global and Local.\nIn CLVCNet , a Comprehensive Linguistic-Visual Composition Network is introduced, which can effectively integrates both local-wise and global-wise compositions and achieve better results with a mutual enhancement mechanism.\nIn , the adversarial learning is introduced into TGIR in TIS  task to learn discriminative representations of the query, i.e. composite of reference image and the modification text by jointly training a generative model. FashionVLP  utilizes CNN as image feature extractor, BERT for text encoder and VinVL , a Multilayer Vision-Language multimodal Transformer with Self-attention Mechanism, for fusion.\n\nReference markers found: [77]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]77: be used to obtain image embedding by employing global pooling in the last CNN layer, and show remarkable success in various computer vision tasks      . Consequently, many CNN-based methods    4 4  [ref]77  [ref]115       , as shown in Table II, adopt CNN backbones as the image encoder for conducting ITCR task.
