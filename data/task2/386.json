As a light-weight deep neural network, MobileNet is designed and optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications. The first version of MobileNet [ref]31 is published in 2016, the second version MobileNetV2  is published in 2018, and the third version MobileNetV3  is published in 2019.\nMobileNet is based on depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computation FLOPs.\nDepthwise separable convolutions, initially proposed in [ref]34, factorizes a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution.\nThe depthwise convolution applies a single 3x3 filter to each input channel to capture the spatial relationship of features. The pointwise convolution applies a 1x1 convolution to capture the channel-wise relationship of features.\nThis factorization is widely adopted by the following design of light-weight neural networks, e.g. MobileNetV2 , MobileNetV3 , ShuffleNet [ref]35, ShuffleNetV2 , MnasNet . Beside depthwise separable convolutions, MobileNetV2 introduce two optimized mechanisms: 1) inverted residual structure where the shortcut connections are between the thin layers. 2) linear bottlenecks which removes non-linearities in the narrow layers. MobileNetV3 is searched by hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) algorithm. Considering the popularity and diversity, we choose the MobileNetV2, and another light-weight architecture searched by NAS, MnasNet, which is described in Section V-F. MobileNetV2 has 3.4 million parameters, 300 million FLOPs, and achieve 72% accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: is another series of models proposed by Google.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
