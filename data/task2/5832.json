      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Adversarial Training Through Adaptive Instance-wise Loss Smoothing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInspired by the above insights, we propose a new general AT paradigm, Instance Adaptive Robustness Enhancement, that alleviates the uneven vulnerability issue to improve robust generalization. This approach enhances robustness for training samples with a strength adaptive to their vulnerability. In general, a higher strength of regularization is applied to samples with higher vulnerability with the aim of improving robustness for these samples. In contrast, low-vulnerability samples, which are already robustly classified, receive weaker regularization due to the desire to avoid the effects of over-regularization. Specifically, we combine AT with a robustness regularizer and adapt the regularization strength for each instance based on its AV. Algorithm 1 illustrates this general framework. Our ultimate proposal for improving AT is a specific implementation of this general framework that uses AV weighted regularization to jointly smooth the input and weight loss landscapes. This specific realization of our proposal is called Instance-adaptive Smoothness Enhanced Adversarial Training (ISEAT), and is summarized in Algorithm 2 and described in detail below. First, in order to integrate weight loss smoothing into our framework, as described in detail in the following section, we extend the metric defined in Eq. 3 to measure instance-wise vulnerability against adversarial input, 𝜹𝜹\\bm{\\delta}, and weight, 𝒗𝒗\\bm{v}, perturbation: 𝒗𝒗\\bm{v} is an adversarial perturbation within a pre-defined feasible region, 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V}, applied to the model’s parameters to maximize adversarial loss (adversarial input perturbation 𝜹𝜹\\bm{\\delta} is assumed) [ref]9: To optimize, 𝒗𝒗\\bm{v} is searched like 𝜹𝜹\\bm{\\delta} by the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm  as: where ρ𝜌\\rho is the step size, and Πγ​(⋅)subscriptΠ𝛾⋅\\Pi_{\\gamma}(\\cdot) is a layer-wise projection operation, defined as follows: where N𝑁N denotes the collection of all layers in the network.\nΠγ​(⋅)subscriptΠ𝛾⋅\\Pi_{\\gamma}(\\cdot) restricts the weight perturbation 𝒗nsubscript𝒗𝑛\\bm{v}_{n} in the n𝑛n-th layer to be relative to the corresponding weight 𝜽nsubscript𝜽𝑛\\bm{\\theta}_{n} such that ∥𝒗n∥≤∥γ​𝜽n∥delimited-∥∥subscript𝒗𝑛delimited-∥∥𝛾subscript𝜽𝑛\\lVert\\bm{v}_{n}\\rVert\\leq\\lVert\\gamma\\bm{\\theta}_{n}\\rVert. For more detail of this relative perturbation size, please refer to the original work [ref]9. In practice, [ref]9 found that one step of search is enough for finding approximately optimal weight perturbation. 𝒗𝒗\\bm{v} can therefore be simplified (let ρ=γ𝜌𝛾\\rho=\\gamma) as: Next, we consider how to weight instances according to their AV. We decided that regularization strength should depend on the relative order, instead of absolute value, of vulnerability so that the overall strength of regularization remains constant throughout training, even if the overall AV declines at the later stage of training. This is important for balancing the influence of AT and the additional robustifying methods. The regularization weight is generated linearly, based on the ranking of vulnerability within the batch, as follows: where r​(⋅)𝑟⋅r(\\cdot) computes the ranking (indexed from 0 for the highest vulnerability) within the batch. Hence, the weights range from 1 (for the most vulnerable sample) to 1m1𝑚\\frac{1}{m} (for the least vulnerable).\nThis linear scheme is selected due to its simplicity and superiority over other options in performance (see Section 5.3 for an empirical comparison with some alternatives). Alternative robustifying methods that support instance-adaptive strength include adversarial perturbation customization [ref]20  , direct weight on loss  and loss smoothness regularization [ref]14.\nTypically, adversarial perturbation customization modifies the configuration of adversarial generation for each sample to reflect the required regularization strength, e.g., a large perturbation budget, ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, corresponding to a large strength.\nApplying this strategy naively in our framework is expected to double the computational overhead since adversarial examples will be first generated to measure AV and then re-generated using the modified configuration that is customized to the vulnerability of each sample. The increased computational burden can be very costly when the training adversary is multi-step. In contrast,\nthe direct weight on loss method weights each instance directly via a separate coefficient on the overall loss. It adds virtually no extra computational cost, but was observed before by [ref]20  to induce the model to overfit the training adversary resulting in a false security. Therefore, direct weight on loss is computationally efficient but ineffective.\nDifferent from the above two methods, loss smoothness regularization has been widely verified to be effective in improving AT  [ref]9 and can be computationally efficient if implemented properly [ref]14. Thus, we adopt loss smoothness regularization as the robustifying method to realize our framework.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: adversarial perturbation within a pre-defined feasible region, 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V}, applied to the model’s parameters to maximize adversarial loss (adversarial input perturbation 𝜹𝜹\\bm{\\delta} is assumed) [ref]9: To optimize, 𝒗𝒗\\bm{v} is searched like 𝜹𝜹\\bm{\\delta} by the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm  as: where ρ𝜌\\rho is the step size, and Πγ​(⋅)subscriptΠ𝛾⋅\\Pi_{\\gamma}(\\cdot) is a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
