      "content": "Paper Title: A phase-field model for thermo-mechanical fracture with an open-source implementation of it using Gridap in Julia\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe experimental results generated by Shao et al.  for quenching test is considered as a benchmark problem for numerical modeling of thermo-mechanical problems. For the present case, we have considered a specimen with an initial temperature of 680680680 K and 880880880 K quenched into an ambient temperature of 300300300 K. For the model development, we have considered only a quarter of the actual specimen due to the symmetry of the problem, as shown in Fig. 9 with a height of 4.94.94.9 mm and length of 505050 mm. The horizontal and vertical displacements have been fixed on the right and top edges, respectively. The bottom edge and right edge have been subjected to quenching through conduction by applying a fixed 300300300 K temperature. The length scale parameter has been selected as (length of the specimen)/250, and the element size has been selected such that lssubscriptùëôùë†l_{s} is at least two times the mesh size. The Julia code used for creating the finite element mesh for quenching test specimen is given in Julia code for meshing of quenching test specimen. For the simulation, we have considered the same material properties as mentioned in Section 4.2 under plane stress condition similar to Mandal et al. . We haven‚Äôt considered the degradation of the kùëòk considering the complex flow of water through the developed cracks for this problem. The distribution of temperature field across the domain is given in Fig. 10 and phase-field variable across the domain is demonstrated in Fig. 11 along with the experimentally found results by . The results show that, as the initial temperature increases, i.e., for higher temperature difference, the crack density is higher, and the depth of crack propagation is also higher. The obtained results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results of Shao et al. , and numerical results by Wang et al. , and Tangella et al. [ref]37.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: of crack propagation is also higher. The obtained results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results of Shao et al. , and numerical results by Wang et al. , and Tangella et al. [ref]37.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
