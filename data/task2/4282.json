      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Contrastive Distillation for Image-Text Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultimodal learning becomes a surging topic due to the increasing accessibility of multimodal data, such as image, text, video and audio. Also, with the advances of hardware, neural network models are able to scale up their capacity and expressive power to better leverage information from multiple modalities. Multimodal learning (e.g. cross-modal retrieval) becomes a popular research topic¬†[ref]3.\nImage-text retrieval focuses on obtaining a set of sentences given a query image, namely measuring cross-modal similarity of image and text.\nHow to accurately measure the similarity of images and texts is at the core of this task.\nMost image-text retrieval methods adopt the idea of contrastive learning¬†[ref]4  .\nIn this paradigm, different modalities are encoded into a semantic space to obtain modal-agnostic semantic representation, such that\nthe representations of a query and its corresponding matching key are clustered while unmatched key-query pairs are separate. Constructing a dynamic dictionary might be considered a typical contrastive learning strategy¬†[ref]7  .\nIn the dictionary, each word is a sample embedding encoded by the network.\nEssentially, such a dynamic dictionary can be regarded as a global negative sample pool to explore informative sample pairs. When the dictionary is large enough and contains enough negative samples, the encoder can extract more discriminative features.\nIn this way, large and consistent dictionaries can be constructed for unsupervised learning with a contrastive loss¬†0. Knowledge distillation (KD) 1 is to obtain a much smaller model with comparable performance, while greatly reducing the memory usage and accelerating the model inference. It has been widely used in recent years in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks 2 3 4 5.\nHowever, when applying KD for image-text retrieval, there are incompatibilities between the contrastive learning paradigm and image-text retrieval¬†6 7 8. On one hand, the dictionary [ref]7 is not suitable for image-text retrieval learning.\nTo acquire multimodal content embedding, most multimodal models must interact with distinct changing modalities of embedding.\nAs a result, the slowly updated dictionary cannot maintain a large and diversified sample pool. On the other hand, the existing image-text retrieval systems are too inefficient to learn the separability of sample pairs¬†9 7 8.\nThough state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, e.g. UNITER¬†7 and ViLBERT¬†8 using self-distillation¬†0, utilize an intermediate model to take a large number of random samples and select the top KùêæK sample pairs that are most similar to fine-tune the image-text retrieval model, it is inefficient due to the lack of a stable selection of hard negative samples and appropriate information guidance, as well as the fact that it is computationally intensive for contrastive learning.\nBecause of the limited information and low gradient values of these randomly picked samples, their contributions to the training may be less informative since many of them already satisfy the loss‚Äôs requirements.\nBesides, a longer training time is necessary to make the network converge.\nThese problems lead to our first research question (RQ): \nRQ1: How to facilitate the contrastive learning paradigm in the distillation of image-text retrieval with informative samples? Different from those recent SOTA methods 7 8, we directly introduce a teacher network to train a smaller student using knowledge distillation (KD)¬†1 to more efficiently learn the differences and similarities of samples within constrained resources, as shown in Figure 1(a).\nThis teacher network may convey knowledge to a student network and select informative samples for training the multimodal interaction layers.\nA well-learned teacher network is flexible in selecting hard samples, and stabilizes the training process.\nTo make an analogy with the real world, we equate teacher networks with professors and student networks with graduate students.\nProfessors typically have a certain level of knowledge and are aware of which topics are currently challenging, and it is advantageous for students to follow these topics. Another issue with visual language model compression is\nhow to make greater use of the available information of teacher.\nHowever, the vanilla KD approaches as shown in Figure 1(a) are static and unable to actively learn from different samples, consequently failing to learn the teacher‚Äôs separability of sample pairs well. Another research question arises as a result of this: \nRQ2: For the purpose of improving teacher knowledge transfer, is it possible to use the weighting method to dynamically learn diversified content, according to the information of the limited sample pairs? We design a basic weighting strategy based on the teacher‚Äôs uncertainty of samples and achieve dynamic distillation by adjusting the sample‚Äôs contribution to the training. The core of our solution is that, for the distillation loss item, we pay particular attention to the samples that the teacher believes to be mastered. Concerning the task loss item, we place a higher weight on samples that the teacher believes to be confusing so that students can focus on learning these samples through the hard label. As shown in Figure 1(b), our framework addresses the two research questions described above. Specifically, we first filter out the more informative and difficult samples for students to learn from the samples selected by the teacher. Second, we obtain adjusted scores by knowledge adjustment (KA) and weigh these samples by teacher uncertainty as soft labels for supervising student networks. Finally, we use teacher uncertainty to weigh the hard labels to obtain dynamic supervision signals to enhance students‚Äô self-learning ability. In this paper, we validate our approach in different training settings and benchmark datasets upon a single cross-modal fusion layer based on ViLT 1 model.\nThe experimental results indicate that dynamic data selection and supervision weighting improve image-text retrieval performance.\nAt the same time, we use METER¬†2 with a different architecture using co-attention 8 to achieve the same promising effects.\nOur contributions are: We propose to leverage the teachers‚Äô adjusted knowledge to mine in-batch hard samples and supervise the students (¬ßIV-A);\n We explore a variety of sample level weighted settings to achieve better teacher knowledge transformation (¬ßIV-B); Considering above aspects, we design a plug-in DCD framework to compress VLP models and guarantee competitive results compared to SOTA distillation approaches (¬ßV); To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to dynamically distill a pre-trained model based on Transformer architecture with modalities‚Äô interaction for image-text retrieval.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: are able to scale up their capacity and expressive power to better leverage information from multiple modalities.
