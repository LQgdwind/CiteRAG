      "content": "Paper Title: Improving DGA-Based Malicious Domain Classifiers for Malware Defense with Adversarial Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBlacklist is a security strategy that keeps network flow and computer environments secure . Typical network traffic blacklists include malicious IP addresses or domain names, which are blocked from communication attempts in both directions. However, the coverage of blacklists is insufficient and unreliable because adversarial hacker communities can compromise a system by generating malware domains dynamically using DGAs that easily bypass the static blacklist. Kuhrer et al.  evaluated 15 public malware blacklists as well as 4 blacklists, served by antivirus vendors. Their findings show that blacklists fail to protect systems against prevalent malware sites generated by DGAs. In order to address the shortcomings of the above problem, researchers have mostly proposed solutions based on reverse engineering techniques to identify and block bot malware . However, such solutions are not always feasible due to the obfuscation of underlying algorithms, as hackers adapt their algorithms swiftly to exploit the vulnerabilities in the system.\nOther alternative solutions require auxiliary contextual information. One of these alternative solutions focuses on the network traffic analysis ,  or broad network packet examination , . However, these techniques may not be able to keep up with large-scale network traffic. Therefore, there is a need for a sophisticated network traffic analysis tool for effective blacklisting. In response to the above issues, detection of malicious\ndomains has increasingly evolved towards usage of machine learning techniques. Performance of the solutions proposed to automatically detect malicious domains mostly suffers from never-seen-before malicious domains. This is due to the lack of generalization when a model is not trained effectively with representative or balanced training dataset. For this reason, blacklists must be constantly updated in order to identify and prevent DGA generated malicious domain connections. Data augmentation is an approach where more data is created from existing data in a way that can enhance the usefulness of the application. Anderson et al. [ref]15 demonstrated how data can be augmented more effectively by using an adversarial machine learning technique. The researchers enhanced adversarial domain names using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methodology. In their approach, two neural networks are trained simultaneously, and later trained with a dataset which includes adversarial samples to harden the DGA classifier. However, the main drawback of this approach is unpredictability of desirable results because of difficulties of controlling both classifiers at the same time, even though a good optimization algorithm is used. As a result, it fails to always converge to a point of equilibrium to generate new domain names. Additionally, controlling the diversity of produced samples is challenging with GAN models , [ref]17. In such cases, the newly generated data do not add to the diversity of the current data. Hence, this solution alone cannot increase the malicious detection capabilities of blacklists against never-before-seen DGA families. To improve the accuracy of such detection mechanisms, we propose a new technique based on data perturbation without relying on a fresh public blacklist or external reputation database. In our approach, we observe how the model works and use the knowledge to mislead the DGA classifier. To do this, a noise, carefully calculated from the observation is added to the DGA based malicious domains to appear non-malicious. These adversarial samples are then predicted as benign by the machine learning (ML) model. Such adversarial attack can be addressed with an adversarial training . Therefore, after correctly labeling these seemingly benign adversarial samples, the ML model is trained with the augmented dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the retrained ML model is able to detect never-before-seen DGA malwares better than any other similar approaches. Our work has the following contributions: Using a machine learning technique based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for automatic detection of malicious domains using a DGA classifier that analyses a massive labeled DGA dataset, character by character over. To the best of our knowledge it is the first study to propose the generation of malicious domain names using a data perturbation approach in order to expand the training dataset with adversarial samples. Demonstrating that, as expected, the LSTM model fails to recognize newly introduced adversarial samples in augmented training dataset. Applying an adversarial training to train the model with correct labelling of the adversarial samples in the training dataset to increase the model’s generalization ability. Demonstrating that the augmented training dataset can help the LSTM model to detect not only never-seen-before DGAs, but also novel DGA families. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the literature review in the context of our work is discussed in section II. The necessary background for DGA-based malicious domain models is reviewed in Section III. The core design of our system, including the adversarial machine learning models to generate malicious domain names and data containers to store them, are presented in Section IV. We discuss the implementation of the adversarial machine learning models in Section V. The evaluation results of our study are presented in Section VI. Section VII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: generated malicious domain connections.
