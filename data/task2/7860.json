      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Beamforming Design for RSMA-assisted mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe WMMSE algorithm , by introducing an equalizer, can provide equivalent solutions to the original WSR maximization problems and has been widely used in the RSMA framework [ref]32,[ref]33,[ref]34. Accordingly, we apply the WMMSE algorithm to the RSMA-assisted mmWave ISAC scheme. Specifically, user k𝑘k first detects the common data stream scsubscript𝑠𝑐s_{c} by equalizer wc,ksubscript𝑤𝑐𝑘w_{c,k} and then detects the private data stream sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k} by equalizer wksubscript𝑤𝑘w_{k} after removing the public data stream. We denote the estimates of scsubscript𝑠𝑐s_{c} and sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k} as s^c,ksubscript^𝑠𝑐𝑘\\hat{s}_{c,k} and s^ksubscript^𝑠𝑘\\hat{s}_{k}, respectively, given by s^c,k=wc,k​yksubscript^𝑠𝑐𝑘subscript𝑤𝑐𝑘subscript𝑦𝑘\\hat{s}_{c,k}=w_{c,k}y_{k} and s^k=wk​(yk−𝐡kH​𝐅RF​𝐟c​sc)subscript^𝑠𝑘subscript𝑤𝑘subscript𝑦𝑘superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑘𝐻subscript𝐅RFsubscript𝐟𝑐subscript𝑠𝑐\\hat{s}_{k}=w_{k}(y_{k}-\\boldsymbol{\\rm h}_{k}^{H}\\boldsymbol{\\rm F}_{\\rm RF}\\boldsymbol{\\rm f}_{c}s_{c}). Then, the mean square error (MSE) of estimating scsubscript𝑠𝑐s_{c} and sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k}, denoted by ec,ksubscript𝑒𝑐𝑘e_{c,k} and eksubscript𝑒𝑘e_{k}, respectively, can be expressed as where The optimal equalizer can be obtained by minimizing MSE (MMSE). Letting ∂ec,k∂wc,k=0subscript𝑒𝑐𝑘subscript𝑤𝑐𝑘0\\frac{\\partial e_{c,k}}{\\partial w_{c,k}}=0 and ∂ek∂wk=0subscript𝑒𝑘subscript𝑤𝑘0\\frac{\\partial e_{k}}{\\partial w_{k}}=0, the optimal equalizers for sc,ksubscript𝑠𝑐𝑘s_{c,k} and sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k} can be derived, denoted by wc,kMMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑐𝑘MMSEw_{c,k}^{\\rm MMSE} and wkMMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑘MMSEw_{k}^{\\rm MMSE}, respectively, and expressed as wc,kMMSE=𝐟cH​𝐅RFH​𝐡k​(Tc,k)−1superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑐𝑘MMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝐟𝑐𝐻superscriptsubscript𝐅RF𝐻subscript𝐡𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑇𝑐𝑘1w_{c,k}^{\\mathrm{MMSE}}=\\boldsymbol{\\rm f}_{c}^{H}\\boldsymbol{\\rm F}_{\\rm RF}^{H}\\boldsymbol{\\rm h}_{k}(T_{c,k})^{-1}, wkMMSE=𝐟D,kH​𝐅RFH​𝐡k​(Tk)−1superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑘MMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝐟D𝑘𝐻superscriptsubscript𝐅RF𝐻subscript𝐡𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑇𝑘1w_{k}^{\\mathrm{MMSE}}=\\boldsymbol{\\rm f}_{{\\rm D},k}^{H}\\boldsymbol{\\rm F}_{\\rm RF}^{H}\\boldsymbol{\\rm h}_{k}(T_{k})^{-1}. By substituting the optimal equalizers wc,kMMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑐𝑘MMSEw_{c,k}^{\\rm MMSE} and wkMMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑘MMSEw_{k}^{\\rm MMSE} into Eqs. (16) and (17), respectively, the corresponding MMSEs, denoted by ec,kMMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝑒𝑐𝑘MMSEe_{c,k}^{\\rm MMSE} and ekMMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝑒𝑘MMSEe_{k}^{\\rm MMSE} can be given by Based on Eqs. (20) and (21), the SINRs of decoding scsubscript𝑠𝑐s_{c} and sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k} can be rewritten as γc,k=1/ec,kMMSE−1subscript𝛾𝑐𝑘1superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑐𝑘MMSE1{\\gamma}_{c,k}=1/e_{c,k}^{\\rm MMSE}-1 and γk=1/ekMMSE−1subscript𝛾𝑘1superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑘MMSE1{\\gamma}_{k}=1/e_{k}^{\\rm MMSE}-1. Consequently, the achievable rates of decoding scsubscript𝑠𝑐s_{c} and sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k} for user k𝑘k can be computed as Rc,k=−log2⁡(ec,kMMSE)subscript𝑅𝑐𝑘subscript2superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑐𝑘MMSER_{c,k}=-\\log_{2}\\left(e_{c,k}^{\\rm MMSE}\\right) and Rk=−log2⁡(ekMMSE)subscript𝑅𝑘subscript2superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑘MMSER_{k}=-\\log_{2}\\left(e_{k}^{\\rm MMSE}\\right). Next, by introducing positive weights uc,ksubscript𝑢𝑐𝑘u_{c,k} and uksubscript𝑢𝑘u_{k}, the augmented weighted MSEs (AWMSEs) of decoding sc,ksubscript𝑠𝑐𝑘s_{c,k} and sksubscript𝑠𝑘s_{k}, denoted by ηc,ksubscript𝜂𝑐𝑘\\eta_{c,k} and ηksubscript𝜂𝑘\\eta_{k}, can be expressed as ηc,k≜uc,k​ec,k−log2⁡(uc,k)≜subscript𝜂𝑐𝑘subscript𝑢𝑐𝑘subscript𝑒𝑐𝑘subscript2subscript𝑢𝑐𝑘\\eta_{c,k}\\triangleq u_{c,k}e_{c,k}-\\log_{2}\\left(u_{c,k}\\right) and ηk≜uk​ek−log2⁡(uk)≜subscript𝜂𝑘subscript𝑢𝑘subscript𝑒𝑘subscript2subscript𝑢𝑘\\eta_{k}\\triangleq u_{k}e_{k}-\\log_{2}\\left(u_{k}\\right). By substituting the optimal equalizers and weights into the AWMSEs, the rate-WMMSE relationships can be established as follows: where g=1/ln⁡2+log2⁡ln⁡2𝑔12subscript22g=1/\\ln 2+\\log_{2}\\ln 2. The optimal equalizers for Eqs.(22) and (23) are wc,k⋆=wc,kMMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑐𝑘⋆superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑐𝑘MMSEw_{c,k}^{\\star}=w_{c,k}^{\\mathrm{MMSE}} and wk⋆=wkMMSEsuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑘⋆superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑘MMSEw_{k}^{\\star}=w_{k}^{\\mathrm{MMSE}}, which can be derived by ∂ηc,k∂wc,k=0subscript𝜂𝑐𝑘subscript𝑤𝑐𝑘0\\frac{\\partial\\eta_{c,k}}{\\partial w_{c,k}}=0 and ∂ηk∂wk=0subscript𝜂𝑘subscript𝑤𝑘0\\frac{\\partial\\eta_{k}}{\\partial w_{k}}=0. And then, the optimal weights, denoted by uc,k⋆superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑐𝑘⋆u_{c,k}^{\\star} and uk⋆superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑘⋆u_{k}^{\\star}, can be obtained by solving ∂ηc,k​(wc,k⋆)∂uc,k=0subscript𝜂𝑐𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑐𝑘⋆subscript𝑢𝑐𝑘0\\frac{\\partial\\eta_{c,k}(w_{c,k}^{\\star})}{\\partial u_{c,k}}=0 and ∂ηk​(wk⋆)∂uk=0subscript𝜂𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑘⋆subscript𝑢𝑘0\\frac{\\partial\\eta_{k}(w_{k}^{\\star})}{\\partial u_{k}}=0, which can be expressed as According to the rate-WMMSE relationships in Eqs.(22) and (23), the problem P1 can be equivalently transformed into the WMMSE problem, which can be expressed as follows: where 𝐮=[uc,1,⋯,uc,K,u1,⋯,uK]T𝐮superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑐1⋯subscript𝑢𝑐𝐾subscript𝑢1⋯subscript𝑢𝐾𝑇\\boldsymbol{\\rm u}=\\left[u_{c,1},\\cdots,u_{c,K},u_{1},\\cdots,u_{K}\\right]^{T} denotes the vector of weights and 𝐰=[wc,1,⋯,wc,K,w1,⋯,wK]T𝐰superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑐1⋯subscript𝑤𝑐𝐾subscript𝑤1⋯subscript𝑤𝐾𝑇\\boldsymbol{\\rm w}=\\left[w_{c,1},\\cdots,w_{c,K},w_{1},\\cdots,w_{K}\\right]^{T} denotes the vector of equalizers. However, there is still the nonconvex constraint in (26c) of problem P2-1, which leads to the fact that P2-1 cannot be solved directly. Regarding the relationship between the solutions of problems P1 and P2-1, the proposition is presented as follows: if {𝐅RF⋆,𝐅D⋆,𝐜⋆,𝐮⋆,𝐰⋆}superscriptsubscript𝐅RF⋆superscriptsubscript𝐅D⋆superscript𝐜⋆superscript𝐮⋆superscript𝐰⋆\\{\\boldsymbol{\\rm F}_{\\rm RF}^{\\star},\\boldsymbol{\\rm F}_{\\rm D}^{\\star},\\boldsymbol{\\rm c}^{\\star},\\boldsymbol{\\rm u}^{\\star},\\boldsymbol{\\rm w}^{\\star}\\} is a KKT optimal solution to problem P2-1, then {𝐅RF⋆,𝐅D⋆,𝐜⋆}superscriptsubscript𝐅RF⋆superscriptsubscript𝐅D⋆superscript𝐜⋆\\{\\boldsymbol{\\rm F}_{\\rm RF}^{\\star},\\boldsymbol{\\rm F}_{\\rm D}^{\\star},\\boldsymbol{\\rm c}^{\\star}\\} is a KKT optimal solution to problem P1.
