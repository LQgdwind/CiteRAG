      "content": "Paper Title: Operationalizing Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Prohibited Object Detection in X-Ray Imagery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nX-ray security screening is an extensively employed method within aviation and broader transportation. Prohibited item detection via scanned X-ray imagery provides a non-intrusive internal view of scanned baggage, freight and postal items. A modern X-ray security scanner  makes use of dual X-ray energy to acquire images at two discrete energy levels and subsequently combine the information with a help of colour transformation function to produce a single pseudo-colour X-ray image (Figure 1). Undertaking manual detection using the pseudo-colour X-ray imagery presents a significant image-based screening task for human operators. The cluttered nature of the X-ray imagery or the inclusion of compact, complex structures can seriously impact human operator performance. For instance, a prohibited item which is concealed within an electronics item can become very challenging to recognise, due to the compact structure of a laptop, limiting human detection capabilities . Human operator performance can be further impacted by external factors such as emotional exhaustion or job satisfaction that adversely affect manual screening accuracy . From examining expert human detection performance, the work of  suggests that an accuracy of only 80−90%80percent9080-90\\% is achieved by humans. Prior work on prohibited item detection in X-ray security imagery originally uses traditional computer vision methods that rely on handcrafted features such as Bag of Visual Words (BoVW)  . The work of  investigates the performance of a range of feature point descriptors within a classical BoVW model, supported by SVM and Random Forest classification, achieving 949494% accuracy on a two-class firearm detection problem with SVM classification. Subsequent advancements of deep learning have brought insight into the automation of this X-ray screening task, with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods proven to be effective in detecting a wide range of object classes within X-ray screening [ref]8  0  . The work of [ref]8 extends to examine object detection, evaluating the performance of a sliding window CNN detector against contemporary region-based detection strategies, Faster R-CNN 1, R-FCN 2 and YOLOv2 3. These contemporary models outperform the traditional sliding window approach, achieving a maximal 0.880.880.88 and 0.970.970.97 mean Average Precision (mAP) over a six-class object detection and two-class firearm detection problem respectively. The work of 0 addresses the limited availability of public datasets of X-ray security imagery by exploring the impact of using synthetic X-ray training imagery for CNN architectures. Faster R-CNN 1 and RetinaNet 4 are trained on real and synthetic X-ray training imagery with Faster R-CNN achieving a maximal performance of 0.880.880.88 mAP when trained and tested with real X-ray training data on a three-class detection problem. CNN based methods have proven effective in detecting prohibited items in X-ray security imagery [ref]8  5. However, the performance of such object detection approaches poses three main issues. Firstly, it is heavily reliant on the availability of a substantial volume of labelled X-ray imagery. The work of  introduces a large-scale dataset, SIXray, fully illustrating the extremely cluttered nature of X-ray security threats imagery (Figure 1, B). Another public dataset, OPIXray  focuses on the widely occurring prohibited items (Figure 1, A). The availability of such X-ray datasets suitable for training CNN architectures is limited and also restricted in size and item signature 0. The second considers the practical implementation of CNN architectures at security screening checkpoints. Such an implementation could be achieved through remote screening but the quantity of data involved during training and live application would require substantial storage and transmission infrastructure. Lossy compression techniques are used to reduce such overheads but lead to image quality degradation that can affect the performance of CNN 6. The work of 7 evaluates the effect of JPEG compression, among other quality distortions, using CNN architectures when classifying a subset of the ImageNet dataset 8.\nThe work of 6 thoroughly evaluates the impact of JPEG and H.264 lossy compression have on CNN architectures. They evaluate Faster R-CNN 1 upon the Pascal VOC dataset 9 and find similarly to 7 that performance degrades rapidly at high lossy compression levels. Thirdly, the use of CNN-based architectures result in the requirement for large datasets to avoid overfitting, but collating such large volumes of X-ray security imagery remains a significant challenge. This makes data augmentation, describing the set of techniques that can be used to increase the size, quality and variation of the training data, a particularly powerful tool within this domain. This is proven to reliably improve network generalisation 0 but selecting appropriate techniques requires prior knowledge of the dataset. There has been substantial investigation of data augmentation techniques within photographic imagery 1 2 3 but limited work has been done examining the performance of these techniques applied to X-ray imagery. Addressing the above issues, in this work we make the following contributions: We investigate two end-to-end CNN object detection architectures, which differ in design, i.e., multi-stage (Cascade R-CNN 4) vs one-stage (FreeAnchor 5), for prohibited item detection by balancing processing time and performance from an operational viewpoint. As dual energy pseudo-colour X-ray imagery exhibits inherently different properties from standard photographic imagery, we examine the impact of using lossy image compression 6 on CNN based prohibited item detection, this may form a key component of a remote screening solution. We evaluate a range of data augmentation techniques, including adaptions of the MixUp 3 and CutMix 2 strategies, as a method for improving CNN-based object detector performance for prohibited item detection.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: into the automation of this X-ray screening task, with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods proven to be effective in detecting a wide range of object classes within X-ray screening [ref]8  0  .
