      "content": "Paper Title: Practical 0.385-Approximation for Submodular Maximization Subject to a Cardinality Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present the Guided Random Greedy algorithm. The algorithm starts with an empty set, and adds one element in each iteration until it returns the final solution after k𝑘k iterations. In its first ⌈k⋅ts⌉⋅𝑘subscript𝑡𝑠\\lceil k\\cdot t_{s}\\rceil iterations, the algorithm ignores the elements of Z𝑍Z, and in the rest of the iterations, it considers all elements. However, except for this difference, the behavior of the algorithm in all iterations is very similar. Specifically, in each iteration i𝑖i the algorithm does the following two steps. In Step (i) the algorithm finds a subset Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} of size k𝑘k maximizing the sum of marginal gains of the elements u∈Mi𝑢subscript𝑀𝑖u\\in M_{i} with respect to the current solution Si−1subscript𝑆𝑖1S_{i-1}. In step (i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii), the algorithm chooses a random element from Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} and adds it to the solution. To prove the main Theorem of this algorithm (Theorem A.6), we first provide and prove two lemmas which will be useful in the proof of Theorem A.6. First, we define the Lovász extension of a submodular function f:2𝒩→ℝ:𝑓→superscript2𝒩ℝf\\colon 2^{\\mathcal{N}}\\to\\mathbb{R}, which will be useful in the proof of Lemma A.4. The Lovász extension of f𝑓f is a function f^:[ref]0 𝒩→ℝ:^𝑓→superscript01𝒩ℝ\\hat{f}\\colon[ref]0 ^{\\mathcal{N}}\\to\\mathbb{R} defined as follows. For every vector x∈[ref]0 𝒩𝑥superscript01𝒩x\\in[ref]0 ^{\\mathcal{N}}, where Tλ​(x)≜{u∈𝒩∣xu≥λ}≜subscript𝑇𝜆𝑥conditional-set𝑢𝒩subscript𝑥𝑢𝜆T_{\\lambda}(x)\\triangleq\\{u\\in\\mathcal{N}\\mid x_{u}\\geq\\lambda\\}. The Lovász extension of a submodular function is known to be convex. More important for us is the following known lemma regarding this extension. This lemma stems from an equality, proved by Lovász , between the Lovász extension of a submodular function and another extension known as the convex closure. Let f:2𝒩→ℝ:𝑓→superscript2𝒩ℝf\\colon 2^{\\mathcal{N}}\\to\\mathbb{R} be a submodular function, and let f^^𝑓\\hat{f} be its Lovász extension. For every 𝐱∈​[ref]0 𝒩subscript𝐱superscript01𝒩\\mathbf{x}_{\\in}[ref]0 ^{\\mathcal{N}} and random set Dx⊆𝒩subscript𝐷𝑥𝒩D_{x}\\subseteq\\mathcal{N} obeying Pr⁡[u∈Dx]=xuPr𝑢subscript𝐷𝑥subscript𝑥𝑢\\Pr[u\\in D_{x}]=x_{u} for every u∈𝒩𝑢𝒩u\\in\\mathcal{N} (i.e., the marginals of Dxsubscript𝐷𝑥D_{x} agree with x𝑥x), f^​(x)≤𝔼​[f​(Dx)]^𝑓𝑥𝔼delimited-[]𝑓subscript𝐷𝑥\\hat{f}(x)\\leq\\mathbb{E}[f(D_{x})]. For every i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k] and A⊆𝒩𝐴𝒩A\\subseteq\\mathcal{N}, it holds that where βi=max⁡{0,i−⌈ts⋅k⌉−1}subscript𝛽𝑖0𝑖⋅subscript𝑡𝑠𝑘1\\beta_{i}=\\max\\left\\{0,i-\\lceil t_{s}\\cdot k\\rceil-1\\right\\}. Fix i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k] and observe that each element from the set 𝒩∖S𝒩𝑆\\mathcal{N}\\setminus S stays outside of Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} with probability at least 1−1k11𝑘1-\\frac{1}{k}. This means each element belongs to Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} with probability at max 1−(1−1k)i−11superscript11𝑘𝑖11-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^{i-1}. To that end, to obtain the lower bounds in Lemma A.4, we use the Lovász extension. Such a step requires the need for a vector in [ref]0 𝒩superscript01𝒩[ref]0 ^{\\mathcal{N}} representing Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i}. We thus use the marginal vector of Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i}, namely, 𝐱Sisubscript𝐱subscript𝑆𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{S_{i}} which holds the probability of each item present in Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i}. This in turn ensures that ‖𝐱Si‖∞≤(1−(1−1k)i−1)subscriptnormsubscript𝐱subscript𝑆𝑖1superscript11𝑘𝑖1\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}_{S_{i}}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\\leq\\left(1-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^{i-1}\\right). For every A⊆𝒩𝐴𝒩A\\subseteq\\mathcal{N}, let 𝟏Asubscript1𝐴\\mathbf{1}_{A} denote a vector of size |𝒩|𝒩\\left|\\mathcal{N}\\right| containing 111s at the entries that correspond to elements present in A𝐴A. By definition of Tλ​(⋅)subscript𝑇𝜆⋅T_{\\lambda}\\left(\\cdot\\right), for every λ∈(1−(1−1k)i−1,1]𝜆1superscript11𝑘𝑖11\\lambda\\in\\left(1-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^{i-1},1\\right], Tλ​(𝐱Si∨𝟏A)=Asubscript𝑇𝜆subscript𝐱subscript𝑆𝑖subscript1𝐴𝐴T_{\\lambda}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{S_{i}}\\vee\\mathbf{1}_{A}\\right)=A where ∨\\vee denotes the coordinate-wise maximum operator. Hence, where the last inequality follows for some Bλ⊂𝒩∖Zsubscript𝐵𝜆𝒩𝑍B_{\\lambda}\\subset\\mathcal{N}\\setminus Z such that Tλ​(𝐱Si∨𝟏A)=Bλ∪Asubscript𝑇𝜆subscript𝐱subscript𝑆𝑖subscript1𝐴subscript𝐵𝜆𝐴T_{\\lambda}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{S_{i}}\\vee\\mathbf{1}_{A}\\right)=B_{\\lambda}\\cup A and observing that where the first inequality above follows from submodularity of f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f\\left(\\cdot\\right), and the second inequality holds by non-negativity of f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f\\left(\\cdot\\right).\n∎ With the above result, we can now bound the expected value of f​(Si)𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖f\\left(S_{i}\\right) for every i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k] as follows. Let k𝑘k a positive integer and α=1−1k𝛼11𝑘\\alpha=1-\\frac{1}{k}. Then for every positive integer i≤⌈ts⋅k⌉𝑖⋅subscript𝑡𝑠𝑘i\\leq\\lceil t_{s}\\cdot k\\rceil and for every positive integer i∈[⌈ts⋅k⌉+1,k]𝑖⋅subscript𝑡𝑠𝑘1𝑘i\\in\\left[\\lceil t_{s}\\cdot k\\rceil+1,k\\right] it holds that Fix i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k], and let Eisubscript𝐸𝑖E_{i} be the event of fixing all the random decisions in Algorithm 5 up to iteration i−1𝑖1i-1 (including). Let ℰisubscriptℰ𝑖\\mathcal{E}_{i} be the set of all possible events Eisubscript𝐸𝑖E_{i}. Following the analysis of [ref]4, we observe that where the last inequality holds by Algorithm 5, and A=𝕆​ℙ​𝕋∖Z𝐴𝕆ℙ𝕋𝑍A=\\mathbb{O}\\mathbb{P}\\mathbb{T}\\setminus Z for any integer i≤⌈ts⋅k⌉𝑖⋅subscript𝑡𝑠𝑘i\\leq\\lceil t_{s}\\cdot k\\rceil, while A=𝕆​ℙ​𝕋𝐴𝕆ℙ𝕋A=\\mathbb{O}\\mathbb{P}\\mathbb{T} otherwise. Since f​(Si−1)𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖1f\\left(S_{i-1}\\right) is independent of Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i}, it holds that 𝔼​[f​(ui∣Si−1)]=𝔼​[f​(Si)−f​(Si−1)]=𝔼​[f​(Si)]−f​(Si−1)𝔼delimited-[]𝑓conditionalsubscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑆𝑖1𝔼delimited-[]𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖1𝔼delimited-[]𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖1\\mathbb{E}\\left[f\\left(u_{i}\\mid S_{i-1}\\right)\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[f\\left(S_{i}\\right)-f\\left(S_{i-1}\\right)\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[f\\left(S_{i}\\right)\\right]-f\\left(S_{i-1}\\right). Hence, we obtain that 𝔼​[f​(Si)]≥k−1​f​(Si∪A)+α​f​(Si−1)𝔼delimited-[]𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖superscript𝑘1𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖𝐴𝛼𝑓subscript𝑆𝑖1\\mathbb{E}\\left[f\\left(S_{i}\\right)\\right]\\geq k^{-1}f\\left(S_{i}\\cup A\\right)+\\alpha f\\left(S_{i-1}\\right). Unfixing Eisubscript𝐸𝑖E_{i}, i𝑖i and taking an expectation over all possible such events yields that for every i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k],\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: Lovász extension of a submodular function f:2𝒩→ℝ:𝑓→superscript2𝒩ℝf\\colon 2^{\\mathcal{N}}\\to\\mathbb{R}, which will be useful in the proof of Lemma A.4.
