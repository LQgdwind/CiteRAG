      "content": "Paper Title: A Hybrid Rule-Based and Data-Driven Approach to Driver Modeling through Particle Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRule-based modeling is an approach that uses a set of rules that indirectly specifies a mathematical model. For instance, if an autonomous vehicle equipped with a rule-based driving model observes an orange traffic light while driving, its rule enforces the model to set its acceleration to zero.\nAlthough rule-based models are interpretable, they are brittle and struggle to generalize to diverse scenarios since they only rely on predefined rules.\nFor instance, in autonomous driving, different drivers inherently have different driving patterns [ref]9. Therefore, we need a model that generalizes human behavior while accounting for individual variations. In contrast to rule-based models, we can also develop a model to learn purely from data. Such black-box models do not have a prescribed set of rules. The advantage of data-driven models is that they can learn arbitrarily complex patterns from large amounts of data. However, they have two main disadvantages. First, it can be challenging to explicitly incorporate physical knowledge or structure in such models. For instance, as humans, we know that vehicles should not collide with each other. However, as found by , it is challenging for completely data-driven techniques to learn such rules. Second, because the data-driven models are not interpretable, it is difficult to verify and validate them, making them less attractive for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. In such applications, engineers should be able to stress test the system before deployment by taking into account various possible failure modes . In case of failure, they should be able to understand the underlying reason for the failure. In the field of system identification, attempts to combine black-box models with white-box models are known as gray-box modeling. A common approach is to combine a partial theoretical structure with data to complete the model. Such models have been used for modeling nonlinear system dynamics  [ref]13 . With the aim of operating robots around humans, both rule-based and data-driven techniques have been used to model human behavior.  and  attempt to infer the intentions of humans in a collaborative robot manipulation task using Bayesian estimation and pedestrian crossing using convolutional neural networks, respectively. Such signals about how humans would behave in the future can help robot decision-making  . In a similar problem, [ref]18 attempts to model future actions given the observations in previous time steps using recurrent neural networks. Some of these models are purely rule-based  while some are purely data-driven [ref]18. Another aspect of modeling human behavior is modeling its intrinsic decisions. There have been attempts to model the rationality  and legibility  in human-robot interaction. In imitation learning, the objective is to learn a policy to imitate a set of human demonstrations. Behavioral cloning  is one way to learn such demonstrations from data. However, such supervised learning techniques have proven to be less successful in applications such as modeling multi-agent traffic due to compounding errors and not taking into account multi-agent interactions . Techniques such as inverse reinforcement learning   and inverse reward design  attempt to directly model the underlying reward function of humans. However, it is not clear how to incorporate traffic rules and road geometry into these models. The intelligent driver model (IDM) is a widely used rule-based dynamics model used for human driving behavior . It can be used to drive a vehicle at a desired speed in a specific lane while maintaining a minimum spacing with the leading vehicle. Augmenting IDM with MOBIL , another rule-based model, can be used to switch lanes. Even though, by construction, these models are guaranteed to avoid collisions, they do not (1) consider interactions with other vehicles beside the leading vehicle, (2) reflect natural human driving styles as parameters are arbitrarily set by the model user, and (3) account for individual driving behavior because these deterministic models can only have a single set of scalar-valued parameters. To mitigate some of the limitations of rule-based driving models, especially the multiagent interactions, generative adversarial imitation learning has been used for highway driver modeling . Since it is a purely data-driven technique, it exhibits some undesirable behaviors such as collisions. A recent approach has proposed a way to learn distributional parameters of an IDM from data  to guarantee collision-free driving.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: brittle and struggle to generalize to diverse scenarios since they only rely on predefined rules.\nFor instance, in autonomous driving, different drivers inherently have different driving patterns [ref]9.
