Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Age of Semantics in Cooperative Communications: To Expedite Simulation Towards Real via Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCooperative relay communications have exhibited high potentials in expanding the system coverage and capacity [ref]1.\nRecently, hybrid relay systems are emerging to further enhance the relaying performance, where intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are deployed to improve the propagation conditions .\nSpecifically, an IRS consists of a large number of passive reflecting elements that adapt the propagation environment by tuning the amplitudes and/or phase-shifts [ref]3.\nWithout the need of any radio-frequency chains, an IRS is able to achieve cost and energy-efficient communications.\nIn this paper, we study an IRS-aided cooperative relay communication system, where a source node (SN) updates to the destination through sampling the status of an underlying process.\nTypical scenarios include the real-time monitoring in complex smart manufacturing  and the video analytics in autonomous driving , to mention a few, where the fresh information and semantics of the process of interest is crucial from the perspective of the destination.\nLet us take the vehicle detection and tracking as an illustrative example, where the intelligent camera (IC; i.e., the SN) responds to the remote control unit (RCU; i.e., the destination) [ref]6.\nEach image captured by the IC can be considered to be composed of the target vehicle part and the background part.\nIn order to save communication resource, the IC employs a semantic extraction module to compress the image, and the compressed data is sent to the RCU .\nAfterwards, the RCU performs semantic reconstruction to recover the image for inference, the result from which can be used as the input to high-level applications (e.g., traffic accident surveillance).\nWith the inference result from the RCU and the situational awareness, the IC decides whether or not to, for example, pan, tilt or zoom in/out to capture a new image in a relevant region.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Cooperative relay communications have exhibited high potentials in expanding the system coverage and capacity [ref]1.\nRecently, hybrid relay systems are emerging to further enhance the relaying performance, where intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are deployed to improve the propagation conditions\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
