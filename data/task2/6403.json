      "content": "Paper Title: Practical First-Order Bayesian Optimization Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we propose two gradient based\nmulti-level acquisition functions, namely, gradient based expected improvement (gEI) and the gradient based probability of improvement (gPI) that use features from existing acquisition functions such that GP-UCB, EI and PI efficiently with the hope of identifying query points with potentially zero gradient. The multi-level acquisition functions have the same functional form at the upper level while differing only in the lower level. When the context is clear, we will also refer to the lower level acquisition functions by gEI and gPI respectively. The lower level acquisition functions are based on the EI [ref]18, , , [ref]25, PI  and GP-UCB  but additionally incorporate the gradient information effectively when suggesting the next query point. Furthermore, each lower level acquisition function is optimized with kùëòk different seed points (restarts) and hence, each run of the lower-level acquisition optimizer results in potentially multiple candidates (points with zero gradients) to query. This is where we design and use an upper level acquisition function that ranks the potential query points (using the function GP) according to their likelihood of being points with zero gradient.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: only in the lower level. When the context is clear, we will also refer to the lower level acquisition functions by gEI and gPI respectively.
