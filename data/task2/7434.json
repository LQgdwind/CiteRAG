We follow   to study the few-shot and many-shot settings, sampling k𝑘k examples per class for k=512𝑘512k=512. DPZero [ref]49 is tested with moment accountant just for fairness. We summarize the results from Table 3 below. Our method works significantly better than zero-shot and other memory-equivalent methods. On all five diverse tasks, our method can optimize the pre-trained model and consistently perform better than zero-shot and prefix-tuning. We also show for several tasks that our method can outperform DPZero up to 5% even with the same privacy analysis. Our method outperforms 1.2% on SST-2 with ϵ=4italic-ϵ4\\epsilon=4 compared with the results shown in Table 1 of [ref]38. Pruning improves model performance in private settings. We compare Algorithm 5 (with pruning) and Algorithm 1 (without pruning). We show the best performance of Algorithm 5 among five different pruning rates in Table 2. Pruning improves performance greatly in almost five tasks in private settings (ϵ=2,4,8italic-ϵ248\\epsilon=2,4,8). As a detailed result, the best performance of Algorithm 5 is 71.5%percent71.571.5\\% on MNLI, outperforming Algorithm 20 (without pruning) by 4.2%percent4.24.2\\%. In different private settings, the optimal pruning rate varies which will be discussed in Section 5.5. With the promising results from RoBERTa-large, we extend our method to the OPT-2.7B [ref]52. We select SuperGLUE tasks  (including classification and multiple-choice). We randomly sample 1024 examples for training and 1000 test examples for each dataset. Our method works significantly better than zero-shot and ICL.\nOn both classification and multiple-choice tasks, our method exhibits strong performance. On a 2.7B-parameter scale, our method outperforms zero-shot and ICL across all tasks with equivalent memory consumption (details in Table 4). Our method outperforms DPZero [ref]49 in all five tasks on autoregressive language OPT-2.7B, but not as significantly as in RoBERTa-large which we blame for the poor quality of data-free pruning and fixed pruning mask which can be updated during training. How to enhance the performance of pruning is worth further studying and We leave it as future work.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: on sentiment classification, natural language inference and topic classification.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
