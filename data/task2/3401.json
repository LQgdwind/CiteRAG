It can dynamically select the best signal plan from a list of pre-defined candidates that can potentially achieve better intersection throughput by improving green time efficiency.\nVaraiya  proposed a traffic light signal control scheme named MaxPressure, which was proven to maximize the throughput of the entire road network, with each traffic light controller receiving local traffic information.\nOn the other hand, the field experiments in  prove that the speed control of CAV can stabilize traffic and is beneficial to reduce braking times and fuel consumption.\nGreen Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system guides CAV to adjust its speed according to the current traffic signal phase and the remaining distance to its approaching intersection . Therefore, the more smooth acceleration/deceleration of CAVs can further reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.\nHowever, these traffic control optimization approaches rely on deterministic formulations to make dynamic traffic problems tractable. These deterministic formulations remain static in ever-changing traffic and thus may not be flexible enough to improve realistic traffic. DRL has been used to cope with complex traffic environments, promising better urban traffic.\nPressLight  is a DRL-based model using Deep Q-learning (DQN). It collects local real-time traffic information inspired by the traditional method MaxPressure  while achieving more improvement on traffic efficiency than MaxPressure.\nWu et al. [ref]9 extended the field experiments in  using the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) method for training CAVs in a simulated experiment. The used DRL-based vehicle speed controller surpasses traditional optimization controllers on traffic improvement.\nVarious scenarios using CAV had been tested in , including road merging and unsignalized intersections. The DRL-based speed control of CAV can optimize the vehicle trajectory of the whole trip and reduce the risk of collision all the time.\nCompared to traditional optimization methods with deterministic solutions, DRL methods, which are used in our proposed CoTV, learn from trial-and-error in the interaction with the environment to train different optimal policies under various traffic scenarios, which is more capable of performing adaptive traffic control and generalizing well under fast-changing urban road scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Most existing research in sustainable urban traffic control adjusts either traffic light signals or vehicle speed.\nSydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) [ref]17 is one of the earliest and most widely applied traffic light signal control systems.
