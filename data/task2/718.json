Many works have focused on obtaining accurate models of these random processes. Instead, in this work, we directly use hourly energy generation traces from a solar source for the city of Los Angeles (CA, USA). The solar raw irradiance data has been collected from the national renewable energy laboratory and converted into harvested energy traces using the SolarStat tool . EH traces are generally bell-shaped with a peak around midday, whereas the energy harvested during night is negligible. Moreover, as discussed in , high variability of the harvested energy may occur during the day, even in summer months. As a result, although the energy inflow pattern can be known to a certain extent, intelligent and adaptive algorithms that make their decisions based on current and past inflow patterns, as well as predictions of future energy arrivals, have to be designed. For the demand profile, the UEs have been classified as heavy and ordinary users according to their amount of requested traffic  [ref]8.\nThe traffic demand of each UE with in a time slot are estimated to resemble realistic traffic profiles presented in , which are derived from time, location and frequency information of thousands of cellular towers. The analysis in  demonstrates that the urban mobile traffic usage can be described by mainly five basic time domain patterns that correspond to different functional regions, i.e., residential, office, transportation, entertainment, and comprehensive. In this article, we are considering residential and office profiles, which are the most common use cases for urban deployment scenarios. In addition, based on the average traffic generated by the users, traffic variability is added following a normal distribution using standard deviation from measurements of real mobile traffic traces . Based on the energy traces  and traffic profiles  [ref]8, an example of a normalized EH trace, residential traffic profile and office traffic profile for both week and weekend days is shown in Figure 3. The figure shows that EH and residential traffic profiles peak at different hours of the day, i.e., energy harvesting peak occurs around noon whereas traffic demand peak occurs during the evening. This calls for intelligent energy management to maximize the utilization of harvested energy.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: well as predictions of future energy arrivals, have to be designed.
