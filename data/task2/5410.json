We reformulate some of their statements, and extend some of their results. In particular, we allow more general discrete time and continuous time dynamical systems, while  was restricting to Piecewise Affine Maps (PAM), and hybrid systems, both of them assumed to work on a bounded domain. Our statements are established in a wide generality by considering only computability of the domain or the dynamics. We know about generalizations that have also been obtained in [ref]8, but focusing on dynamical systems as language recognizers, and mainly focusing somehow on generalizations of Theorem 14 ([1, Theorem 4]), while we discuss here reachability in a more natural and general way. We also connect our approach to Œ¥ùõø\\delta-decidability introduced in 6. Observe that the logics considered in the latter are not sufficiently expressive to cover our results (or ). Another clear difference is also that we talk about complexity issues (space, time), while all these references are only talking about computability issues. Furthermore, we consider not only space perturbations, but also time and length perturbations, and we prove that many of the results, even for computability, can also be extended to this framework. In Section II, we recall some known facts about the hardness of reachability (accessibility) problems in graphs, discussing in particular their encoding. Before going to general discrete time dynamical systems, and later continuous and hybrid time dynamical systems, we consider a specific case of discrete time dynamical systems, namely Turing machines (TMs). We think this helps to understand the coming statements. We basically introduce in in Section III the concept of (space) perturbed Turing machine, following , and recall some of the results established in this paper. The original contributions in this section are the extension of this framework to complexity. We prove that considering a polynomial robustness corresponds precisely to polynomial space, i.e. PSPACEPSPACE\\operatorname{PSPACE} (Theorem 17). We consider here space perturbations, but we prove later (in Section VIII) that a natural concept of time perturbation could also be considered in order to lead to a characterisation of polynomial time, i.e. PTIMEPTIME\\operatorname{PTIME} (Theorem 58), using similar ideas. Section IV, recalls how several undecidability results for dynamical systems are established using the embedding of a class of dynamical systems (e.g. TMs) into another. We believe this helps to understand the related sources of non-robustness. Section V is considering general discrete time dynamical systems (over ‚Ñùdsuperscript‚Ñùùëë\\mathbb{R}^{d}). We use the concept of perturbation and robustness from . But unlike the latter article, mainly restricting to Piecewise Affine Maps (PAMs), we consider general systems, discussing the importance of the domain, and of the preservation of rational numbers as in PAMs. A main technical result is then Theorem 24: this is an extension of [1, Theorem 5] to the general settings, established using similar ideas, but not exactly111As the proof there turns out to be ambiguous about whether ‚Äúcan make a transition‚Äù means in one step vs in one or many steps, and we are not sure to fully follow it in its exact form.. We also extend the framework to the case of systems that would not preserve rationals. This leads to an extension of main statement of : robustness implies decidability of reachability (Corollary 25 and Corollary 39). Then we prove that this theory can actually be related to the approach of Œ¥ùõø\\delta-decidability proposed in 6: (œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-)robust means true or (œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-)far from being true (Theorem 27). This is an also important original contribution relating the two approaches, giving arguments in the spirit of 6. Our key point is then to be able to extend all at the complexity level. One key result is that polynomially robust implies reachability in PSPACEPSPACE\\operatorname{PSPACE} (Theorem 35). This is even a characterization of PSPACEPSPACE\\operatorname{PSPACE} (Theorem 36).\nConcretely, Section V is split into two subsections. In the first part, we only need to talk about rational numbers, and classical computability. In the second part, as functions may take non-rational values, we use the framework of Computable Analysis (CA). The first part helps for the intuition of the second. But actually, as a computable function in CA is continuous, the first is not a consequence of the second, even if several methods and reasoning are shared. Section VI provides a nice and original view. Using various results established in the community of CA, we prove that robustness can also be seen as having a reachability relation that can be drawn. We use there the fact that the latter relates to computability for subsets of ‚Ñùpsuperscript‚Ñùùëù\\mathbb{R}^{p}. In Section VII, we state that similar statements hold also for continuous time, and even hybrid dynamical systems. Section VIII is proving that other perturbations could be considered and would lead to talk about time complexity PTIMEPTIME\\operatorname{PTIME} instead of PSPACEPSPACE\\operatorname{PSPACE}. Section IX discusses how the current work relates to the known characterizations of complexity classes with continuous time dynamical systems.\nNotice that some characterizations of PSPACEPSPACE\\operatorname{PSPACE} have been obtained recently in 7  (discussed in this section), but at the price of technical conditions, that we believe not to provide a fully satisfying answer to previous questions.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: a bounded domain.
