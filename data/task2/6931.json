      "content": "Paper Title: YaRN: Efficient Context Window Extension of Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIf we look at RoPE only from an information encoding perspective, it was shown in¬†, using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, that deep neural networks have trouble learning high frequency information if the input dimension is low and the corresponding embeddings lack high frequency components. Here we can see the similarities: a token‚Äôs positional information is one-dimensional, and RoPE expands it to an n-dimensional complex vector embedding. RoPE closely resembles Fourier Features¬† in many aspects, as it is possible to define RoPE as a special 1D case of a Fourier Feature. Stretching the RoPE embeddings indiscriminately results in the loss of important high frequency details which the network needs in order to resolve tokens that are both very similar and very close together (the rotation describing the smallest distance needs to not be too small for the network to be able to detect it). We hypothesise that the slight increase of perplexity for short context sizes after fine-tuning on larger context sizes seen in PI¬†[ref]9 might be related to this problem. Under ideal circumstances, there is no reason that fine-tuning on larger context sizes should degrade the performance of smaller context sizes. In order to resolve the problem of losing high frequency information when interpolating the RoPE embeddings, the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation was developed in¬†. Instead of scaling every dimension of RoPE equally by a factor sùë†s, we spread out the interpolation pressure across multiple dimensions by scaling high frequencies less and low frequencies more. One can obtain such a transformation in many ways, but the simplest would be to perform a base change on the value of Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta. More precisely, following the notations set out in Section¬†2.3, we define the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation scheme as follows (see the Appendix¬†A.1 for the details of the deduction). The \"NTK-aware\" interpolation is a modification of RoPE by using Eq.¬†12 with the following functions. where Given the results from¬†, this method performs much better at extending the context size of non-fine-tuned models compared to PI¬†[ref]9. However, one major disadvantage of this method is that given it is not just an interpolation scheme, some dimensions are slightly extrapolated to \"out-of-bound\" values, thus fine-tuning with \"NTK-aware\" interpolation¬† yields inferior results to PI¬†[ref]9. Furthermore, due to the \"out-of-bound\" values, the theoretical scale factor sùë†s does not accurately describe the true context extension scale. In practice, the scale value sùë†s has to be set higher than the expected scale for a given context length extension. We note that shortly before the release of this article, Code Llama¬†[ref]31 was released and uses \"NTK-aware\" scaling by manually scaling the base bùëèb to 1M.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: needs to not be too small for the network to be able to detect it). We hypothesise that the slight increase of perplexity for short context sizes after fine-tuning on larger context sizes seen in PI¬†[ref]9 might be related to this problem.
