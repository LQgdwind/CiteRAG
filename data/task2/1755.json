To extract short-term and long-term temporal features as well as spatial features, combining optical flow and recurrent operation with 2D convolutional operation are two normal strategies.\nTwo-stream CNNs [ref]7 [ref]4 [ref]5 combine a temporal stream that uses optical flow images as input with a spatial stream that uses RGB frame as input for spatial and temporal information fusion.\nThe long-term recurrent convolutional network  (LRCN) uses long short-term memory  (LSTM) layers after convolutional layers to model the temporal information. However, such a combination of CNN and LSTM brings huge computation and the performance of the model is far from satisfactory.\nFeature Aggregation for SpatioTEmporal Redundancy  (FASTER) can integrate subtle motion information from expensive models with scene changes from cheap models and aggregate different representations. Although FASTER utilizes recurrent operations to model temporal relations, it is more lightweight than LRCN. Another way of extracting spatiotemporal features is to employ 3D convolutional neural networks. C3D  extends the 2D convolutional kernels in VGG  to 3D, but this causes a heavy calculation burden and a mass of parameters, which is highly likely to engender over-fitting. Inflated 3D CNN [ref]4 (I3D) achieves higher accuracy in video classification using multi-scale 3D convolutional kernels, which further increases computational cost and memory consumption. Separable 3D CNN  (S3D) reduces calculation through separating 3D convolutional kernels. Pseudo-3D Residual Net  (P3D ResNet) divides spatiotemporal convolutional kernels into spatial and temporal domains, and exploits different combinations of the two domain blocks.\nMulti-fiber network  (MF-Net) employs group convolution with sparse connections into 3D residual blocks to decrease the amount of parameters and computation cost of 3D CNNs. Besides, it develops a multiplexer to compensate the information loss.\nTemporal Shift Module (TSM)  replaces the 3D convolution with temporal shift operation and 2D convolutions. It first stacks the frames as a clip of video, and then shift a part of frames along the temporal dimension. Finally it splits the clip into frames. Since TSM is implemented by 2D convolution network and the shift operation which does not give rise to additional computation, it alleviates considerable computational burden. We choose MF-Net and TSM as the backbones, because they have enough ability of feature extraction in action recognition task while maintain lightweight. In addition, they are both convenient to insert extra self-contained modules.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: short-term and long-term temporal features as well as spatial features, combining optical flow and recurrent operation with 2D convolutional operation are two normal strategies.\nTwo-stream CNNs [ref]7 [ref]4 [ref]5 combine a temporal stream that uses optical flow images as input with a spatial stream that uses RGB frame as input for spatial and temporal information fusion.\nThe long-term\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
