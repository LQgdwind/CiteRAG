      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Graph Matching Network for Graph Similarity Computation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe largely follow the experimental settings in¬† and introduce the details as follows. Datasets. We used 4 real datasets for the experiments, i.e., AIDS, PTC, LINUX and IMDB-MULTI. The AIDS dataset contains 42,687 chemical compound graphs from the Developmental Therapeutics Program at NCI/NIH 7 and each node in a graph is associated with one out of 29 labels. AIDS has been widely used for the evaluation of graph similarity computation [ref]36  and we randomly sampled 700 graphs from the dataset. PTC consists of 344 chemical compound graphs that report the carcinogenicity for male and female rats. Each node in the PTC dataset has one out of 19 possible labels. LINUX has 48,747 Program Dependence Graphs (PDG) generated from the Linux kernel. In each PDG, a node is one statement and an edge models the dependency between the two statements. We randomly sampled 1,000 graphs from the original LINUX dataset. IMDB-MULTI is a movie-collaboration dataset containing 1,500 ego-networks of movie actors/actresses. In the ego-networks, each node represents a person and an edge models the collaboration between two persons. On IMDB-MULTI and PTC, we removed graphs containing less than 16 nodes to test the scalability of our methods. For both LINUX and IMDB-MULTI, the nodes do not come with a label and we use the all 1 vector as the initial embedding of the nodes for the two datasets. The statistics of the datasets after preprocessing are reported in Table¬†I. Evaluation Methodology. For each dataset, we generated the training set, validation set and test set with a split ratio of 7:2:1. The model was trained on the training set and the hyper-parameters (e.g., the number of stages in hierarchical graph clustering and the number of layers in GCN ) were tuned using the validation set. Graphs in the test set were treated as queries and we evaluated how accurately the model approximates the similarity between the query graphs and the graphs in the entire dataset. For AIDS and LINUX, the A* algorithm was used to compute the ground-truth GED between the graphs. As A* has an exponential time complexity with respect to the number of nodes in the graphs, it took too much time for PTC and IMDB-MULTI. Therefore, we computed the ground-truth GED for PTC and IMDB-MULTI by taking the minimum of three approximate algorithms, i.e., Beam¬†, Hungarian¬† and VJ¬†. The distances returned by the algorithms are larger than or equal to the true GED and the same ground-truth approximation methodology was also adopted in¬†. To compute the ground-truth MCS, we used MC-SPLIT¬†[ref]21 as it can finish in a long but tolerable time for our datasets. Note that the algorithms used to provide the ground-truth distance/similarity are typically orders of magnitude slower than learning based methods¬†. We excluded the test set from model training to show that the trained models can generalize to unseen data and thus improve the efficiency of graph similarity search. We used four performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy of graph similarity approximation, i.e., average mean squared error (MSE), Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient (œÅùúå\\rho), Kendall‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient (œÑùúè\\tau) and precision at 10 (p‚Äã@‚Äã10ùëù@10p@10). MSE is the mean squared error of the predicted GED/MCS compared with the ground-truth GED/MCS. For a query graph ùí¢ùí¢\\mathcal{G}, the graphs in the dataset were ranked according to their predicted graph similarities. Both œÅùúå\\rho and œÑùúè\\tau evaluate how well the similarity prediction based ranking matches ground truth similarity based ranking, and higher value means better performance. p‚Äã@‚Äã10ùëù@10p@10 is the percentage of true top-10 nearest neighbor in the top-10 nearest neighbors obtained from estimated graph similarity. MSE measures the accuracy of graph similarity approximation, while œÅùúå\\rho, œÑùúè\\tau and p‚Äã@‚Äã10ùëù@10p@10 evaluate how well the estimated graph similarity ranks the graphs, which is also important for graph similarity search. Baselines. As the learning based methods were shown to outperform the graph theory based methods in both accuracy and efficiency¬†, we mainly compared with the learning based methods. The baselines include SMPNN¬†[ref]29, GCNMEAN, GCNMAX¬†, SIMGNN¬†, GMN¬† and GraphSIM¬†. EMBAVG is a simple baseline introduced in¬† that computes graph similarity using the dot product of two graph embeddings. As the results of our run for SIMGNN and GraphSIM on the AIDS and LINUX dataset are slightly worse than those reported in their papers, we reused the results from their papers. By default, HGMN uses 4 hierarchical cluster stages with size 6, 4, 2, 1 for AIDS and LINUX (small graphs), and 6 hierarchical cluster stages with size 64, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 for PTC and IMDB-MULT (large graphs).\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: the Developmental Therapeutics Program at NCI/NIH 7 and each node in a graph is associated with one out of 29 labels.
