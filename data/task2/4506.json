      "content": "Paper Title: Preconditioned Central Moment Lattice Boltzmann Method on a Rectangular Lattice Grid for Accelerated Computations of Inhomogeneous Flows\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we will present a robust and efficient implementation of a LB algorithm on rectangular lattice grids for solving preconditioned NS equations using and extending the results of the C-E analysis performed in the last section. In this regard, we note that the effect of the moment basis ùóßùóß\\bm{\\mathsf{T}} as defined in Eqs.¬†(6) and¬†(3.1) will be equivalently utilized in our implementation in a more modular fashion so the LB schemes based on the square lattice can be readily extended for utilizing rectangular lattice grids along with preconditioning and the necessary corrections. This involves using a simpler re-defined moment basis in conjunction with diagonal scaling matrices based on the grid aspect ratio for performing the pre- and post-collision transformations between the raw moments and distribution functions, and segregate the evolution of the trace of the diagonal parts of the second order moments from the others for achieving independent variations of bulk and shear viscosities¬†, along with accounting for the corrections to eliminate the grid-anisotropy and non-GI truncation errors, only within the collision step under moment relaxations (see Ref.¬†). In other words, the linear combinations of moments as required are considered only for performing the collision step and not for any mappings. This represents an improvement over the implementation discussed over all the previous 2D rectangular LB schemes for the solution of the NS equations, including our recent work¬†[ref]34, and is consistent with our more recent 3D formulation¬†), but extended here with a preconditioning strategy for convergence acceleration. Similar approach based on a natural independent moment set without involving the mixed moments has also been used in previous work¬†  by using a block diagonal relaxation matrix¬† in the context of LB formulations using a square lattice.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: not for any mappings.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
