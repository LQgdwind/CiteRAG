      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Motion Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum computer vision is an emerging field.\nRecently, several classical problems were reformulated to enable quantum optimization, including recognition   and matching tasks  .\nPromising results were shown so far, thus encouraging further research.\nAmong the two existing paradigms for quantum computing, i.e., gate-based and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC), experimental realizations of AQC are already applicable to real-world problems, provided that the objective is given as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem.\nThus, quantum annealing (QA)‚Äîwhich refers to not perfectly adiabatic implementations of AQC [ref]22 ‚Äîis an experimental and promising technology for finding solutions to combinatorial problems leveraging quantum mechanics [ref]24 .\nQA optimises objectives without relaxation and obtains globally-optimal or low-energy solutions with high probabilities. Note that these important properties are hardly present in traditional methods, hence it is crucial to identify problems benefiting from this new class of machines. In \nan AQC algorithm for permutation synchronization is proposed, which finds cycle-consistent matches across a set of images or shapes, where the matches are given as permutation matrices.\nThe recent survey  discusses many synchronization problems already studied in the literature (e.g., rotation synchronization for structure from motion  or pose synchronization for point-set registration ).\nNotwithstanding, permutation synchronization  is the only one that has been solved via quantum optimization so far. This paper advances the state of the art in quantum computer vision by bringing a new synchronization problem, i.e., motion segmentation, into an AQC-admissible form; see Fig.¬†1 for exemplary results.\nThe task of motion segmentation  is to classify points in multiple images into different motions, which is relevant in such applications as dynamic 3D reconstruction 5 or autonomous driving .\nObserve that quantum formulations do not make sense for all problems, but for those, e.g., that include combinatorial optimisation objectives, which are usually ùí©‚Äãùí´ùí©ùí´\\mathcal{NP}-hard.\nMotion segmentation is identified to have a combinatorial structure, and, hence, is a meaningful candidate to leverage the advantages of the quantum processor. Bringing motion segmentation into an AQC is challenging as only problems in a QUBO form are admitted. Thus, we primarily focus on how to formulate motion segmentation as a QUBO. Our work adopts the synchronization formulation of motion segmentation from , which we carefully convert to a QUBO problem.\nThis gives rise to the first variant of our quantum approach, named QuMoSeg-v1 (from ‚ÄúQUantum MOtion SEGmentation‚Äù): it works well in many practical scenarios but it can not manage large-scale problems since it is based on a dense matrix.\nFor this reason, we also develop an alternative method based on a sparse matrix which can solve larger problems, resulting in QuMoSeg-v2: its derivation, however, requires additional assumptions, i.e., the knowledge of the number of points per motion.\nIn summary, our primary contributions are: A new approach to motion segmentation that employs AQC (Sec.¬†3); A new real dataset (Q-MSEG) for motion segmentation (Sec.¬†5). We evaluated our approach on synthetic data, a new real dataset (Q-MSEG) and small problems sampled from the Hopkins benchmark .\nIn our extensive experiments, our approach achieves competitive accuracy (close to or higher than competing methods) on problem instances which are mappable to the AQC of the latest generation, and demonstrates its high robustness to noise.\nDue to the limits of current quantum hardware (that improves constantly and is far from maturity), our experiments are limited to small-scale data, as done also in previous work . However, it is expected that progress in quantum hardware alongside with the ability to solve combinatorial problems without approximation will give practical advantages for large-scale problems in the future. Our derivations share only a few similarities with Birdal et al.¬†: In fact, bringing motion segmentation into a QUBO form requires more analytical steps compared to previous work on quantum synchronization  because binary matrices are less constrained than permutation matrices.\nMoreover, our formulation for synchronization requires linearly-many variables in the number of input points, hence we are can handle more points compared to .\nOur source code and data will be made publicly available.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: provided that the objective is given as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem.\nThus, quantum annealing (QA)‚Äîwhich refers to not perfectly adiabatic implementations of AQC [ref]22 ‚Äîis an experimental and promising technology for finding solutions to combinatorial problems leveraging quantum mechanics [ref]24 .\nQA optimises objectives without relaxation and obtains\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
