      "content": "Paper Title: Pointwise Distance Distributions of periodic point sets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis appendix provides extra details for large-scale experimental comparisons of the new invariant PDD with the most widely used past tools: the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) for comparing finite subsets  and 1-PXRD similarity based on powder X-ray diffraction patterns.\nThe popularity of these tools does not help to resolve the key question for crystals : ‘the same or different?’ . The key advantage of Pointwise Distance Distributions (PDD) for searching (near-)duplicates and nearest neighbors in huge datasets is their hierarchical nature.\nThe weighted averages of columns in the PDD matrix form the simpler AMD vectors (Average Minimum Distances), which can be quickly subtracted and compared.\nSince the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) between PDD matrices can be only larger than the L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} distance between their AMD vectors by Theorem 4.2, it suffices to compute the slower EMD only on pairs of crystals whose AMD vectors are very close to each other. Any crystal dataset can be further organized into hierarchical families whose levels are parameterized by the number i𝑖i of atomic neighbors.\nThe i𝑖i-th level of this hierarchy can consist of disjoint or overlapping clusters of crystals that have close values of the i𝑖i-th coordinate AMDisubscriptAMD𝑖\\mathrm{AMD}_{i} in the vector AMD​(S;k)=(AMD1,…,AMDk)AMD𝑆𝑘subscriptAMD1…subscriptAMD𝑘\\mathrm{AMD}(S;k)=(\\mathrm{AMD}_{1},\\dots,\\mathrm{AMD}_{k}).\nIndeed, L∞​(AMD​(S;k),AMD​(Q;k))≥|AMDi​(S)−AMDi​(Q)|subscript𝐿AMD𝑆𝑘AMD𝑄𝑘subscriptAMD𝑖𝑆subscriptAMD𝑖𝑄L_{\\infty}(\\mathrm{AMD}(S;k),\\mathrm{AMD}(Q;k))\\geq|\\mathrm{AMD}_{i}(S)-\\mathrm{AMD}_{i}(Q)|.\nHence, any crystals with distant values of AMDisubscriptAMD𝑖\\mathrm{AMD}_{i} cannot have close AMD vectors. We use the public dataset of 5679 T2 crystals base on the same T2 molecule and predicted by 12-week supercomputer simulations [ref]46.\nOnly five were synthesized: T2-α𝛼\\alpha, T2-β𝛽\\beta, T2-γ𝛾\\gamma, T2-δ𝛿\\delta, T2-ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nBy request we can share CIFs of all mentioned crystals, which can be opened by any text editor and visualised by the free software Mercury.\nFig. 8 shows 10 PDD curves of T2-ε𝜀\\varepsilon corresponding to the 10 isometrically unique atomic positions within the T2 molecule.\nThe rotation through 120∘superscript120120^{\\circ} around an axis keeps the T2 molecule and the whole infinite crystal T2-ε𝜀\\varepsilon invariant, while the three oxygen atoms shown in red simply rotate their positions.\nHence all oxygen atoms have the same ordered distances to their neighbors and their PDD curves coincide.\nThe same conclusion holds for six nitrogens whose positions are isometrically equivalent in T2.\nCarbon atoms have five non-isometric positions, which generate five unique PDD curves in Fig. 8.\nAll 10 PDD curves provide a finer classification of atomic types not only by chemical elements, but by their geometric positions within a molecule.\nFor every atom, the first distance for k=1𝑘1k=1 is the bond distance to its closest neighbor, see the zoomed beginnings of PDD curves.\nThough chemical elements can be included into the PDD matrix as an extra column, the above shows that the PDD invariants can infer this chemistry. A key challenge in visualization is to justifiably represent invariant data in a simple form.\nPast algorithms such as t-SNE  and UMAP  are stochastic and can produce different outputs from repeated runs on the same input.\nHence we used the more recent deterministic TreeMap  to draw a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).\nInformally, any MST can be considered as an optimal road network between cities.\nSuch a network can be drawn in many different ways; the most valuable new data is the distances between PDDs of crystals but the MST is drawn only for visualization.\nSimilarly, positions of cities and distances between them are more important than a sketch of a road network. Fig. 10 illustrates key advantages of the invariant-based visualization in the right picture compared with the energy landscape in the left picture extracted from the state-of-the-art  in Fig. 9.\nBriefly, the MST based on stronger isometry invariants PDD​(S;100)PDD𝑆100\\mathrm{PDD}(S;100) provides more information about crystal similarity than the cloud of points (density, energy).\nIn the past, simulated versions were manually searched to match experimental crystals only by density.\nMeasuring the energy of an experimental crystal needs an explosion disintegrating this crystal.\nFor the experimental crystal T2-δ𝛿\\delta, dozens of simulated crystals were searched in the vertical strip in the left picture of Fig. 10.\nSimulated crystal 14 was visually chosen in  as the best match for T2-δ𝛿\\delta. The new PDD invariant automates the search for closest crystals, because PDD can be computed for all types of simulated and experimental crystals.\nThe MST in the right picture of Fig. 10 includes T2-δ𝛿\\delta as a red dot close to the near duplicate crystals 14 and 15, which were not filtered out by past tools because of very different unit cells and motifs in Fig. 7.\nThere were many other pairs of crystals with almost identical values of (density, energy), for example crystals 5920 and 0049, whose structures were found away from each other in the MST.\nWhen comparing this pair by the COMPACK algorithm, only one molecule is matched in Table 4.\nThe resulting zero value of RMSD only means that crystals 5920 and 0049 are different (no similarity found), while EMDEMD\\mathrm{EMD} provides a proper distance.\nFig. 10 (right) shows crystals 5920, 0049 in different branches of the MST. The 4950 comparisons of 100 crystals by COMPACK took 3 hours 53 min (2.825 sec per comparison), which is 3 orders of magnitude slower than EMD on PDD invariants.\nTable 3 says that over half the time (56%) only one molecule is matched, which means that no similarity was found between crystals based on identical molecules.\nIn fact, in 95% of cases three or fewer molecules are matched, which is also considered a non-match for the default number of 15 maximum matched molecules. The number of matched molecules rarely exceed 10 (0.5%), and only 6 comparisons matched 15/15. We also compare the new invariant to powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD), a popular way of measuring similarity between structures. We note that unlike Earth mover’s distance between PDDs, the ‘distance’ between PXRDs is not a proper metric on the space of crystals, and so is not appropriate to use it to continuously explore the space. Our experiments show that 1−limit-from11-PXRD (since a PXRD score of 1 means identical) fails to satisfy the triangle inequality on the T2 dataset over 8% of the time, and the RMSD values given by COMPACK similarly fail to satisfy this axiom, see Table 5. Our second dataset has all 12576 structures in the Drug Subset  of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).\nThough the CSD is the world’s largest collection of more than 1.1M crystals, it is effectively a huge folder of Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) with limited search functions, for example by a chemical composition. The CSD Drug subset only includes small-molecule crystal structures containing a drug molecule, typically smaller than the T2 molecule.\nSince larger than necessary values of k𝑘k don’t affect distances to closer neighbors, we tried k=100𝑘100k=100 and k=200𝑘200k=200 for the CSD Drug Subset. After computing PDD​(S;k)PDD𝑆𝑘\\mathrm{PDD}(S;k), we use a standard EMD algorithm for distances between the distributions.\nA Minimum Spanning Tree can be computed from a smaller graph on PDD invariants not requiring all pairwise distances.\nSince distances asymptotically approach PPC​(S)​k3PPC𝑆3𝑘\\mathrm{PPC}(S)\\sqrt{k}, we used the instantly computable Point Packing Coefficient PPC​(S)PPC𝑆\\mathrm{PPC}(S) to find 3000 neighbors for each of 12576 crystals.\nFor k=200𝑘200k=200, the computations of 12576×300012576300012576\\times 3000 EMD distances (excluding all repetitions) took 7 hours 39 min (1.238 ms per comparison, 2.19 sec per crystal for all 3000 neighbors). Any MST can be visualized by TreeMap  or any other graph drawing algorithm.\nThe continuity and invariance of Pointwise Distance Distributions in Theorems 3.2 and  4.3 guarantee that any crystal data analysis based on these invariants is theoretically justified.\nSince a Minimum Spanning Tree has no cycles, some close crystals might appear at terminal vertices of distant branches, which could be connected to form a cycle.\nDrawing a graph with cycles requires more advanced algorithms.\nHowever, the new invariants can be used for a quick search of similar crystals without visualization. We have interactive versions of Minimum Spanning Trees of the T2 dataset and CSD drug subset.\nIn any Javascript-enabled browser one can zoom these TreeMaps, color the vertices by properties, hover over any vertex to get more information.\nThough aspirin and paracetamol are chemically different, their crystal structures (dozens of polymorphs with CSD references ACSALA and HXACAN) were found in close branches confirming their similar pharmaceutical properties.\n The ‘structure’ of a crystal was previously measured by only one continuous isometry invariant: the physical density equal to the weight of atoms within a unit cell, divided by the cell volume.\nAll other descriptors are either non-invariants, e.g. powder diffraction patterns depend on various thresholds and are not always reliable, or are discontinuous under perturbations, e.g. symmetry groups. The main contribution is replacing the single-value density by much stronger more isometry invariants PDDPDD\\mathrm{PDD}.\nComparing crystals by only their densities was the latest ‘state-of-the-art’ in , where 5 forms of 9 experimental crystals were initially matched to dozens of simulated crystals with close densities.\nThen hundreds of crystals were visually inspected to select the five matches in Fig. 9. Now a ‘structure’ of a crystal can be much better represented by many more numerical invariants in PDDPDD\\mathrm{PDD}.\nFig. 11 is the first justified map of (a discretely sampled) space of T2 crystals, because the underlying distance between PDDPDD\\mathrm{PDD} invariants satisfies all metric axioms and continuity under perturbations by  and Theorem 4.3. The map in Fig. 11 shows a Minimum Spanning Tree built on 5679+9 crystals.\nEach crystal is a vertex.\nThe distance between any crystals is the Earth Mover’s distance between the first order PDD invariants.\nThe most interesting vertices in the T2 map are experimental crystals shown in red, because their energies are impractical to measure.\nThe map shows experimental crystals with simulated predictions for the first time, because past plots such as in Fig. 9 need all energy values.\n Fig. 11 is a substantial advancement in visualizing crystal datasets, because the underlying invariants PDD​(S;k)PDD𝑆𝑘\\mathrm{PDD}(S;k) are much more informative than a single-value density.\nThe nine experimental crystals (red dots) clearly split into five groups marked by T2-α𝛼\\alpha, T2-β𝛽\\beta, T2-γ𝛾\\gamma, T2-δ𝛿\\delta, T2-ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nThese nine experimental crystals have no known energies and cannot appear in the past energy landscapes.\nThe four red dots at the very top represent slightly different forms of a T2-γ𝛾\\gamma crystal synthesized at different temperatures. The map can be interactively explored by opening the file T2L_PDD125_TMap.html (available by request)\nin any browser in the same folder with the corresponding JavaScript files.\nIn the interactive version one can color vertices by a property, which can be changed in the drop-down menu in the bottom right corner. For example, all crystals with low energies appear in yellow colors. In Fig. 11 six of nine experimental T2 crystals have the codes DEBXIT01……\\dots06, though they split into two groups (unique polymorphs): four nearly identical crystals T2-γ𝛾\\gamma and two nearly identical crystals T2-β𝛽\\beta.\nOur final experiment on all 229K molecular organic crystals found thousands of such pairs in the Cambridge Structural Database. In addition to the five pairs of isometrically identical crystals discussed in section 6, a search on the CSD using PDD on molecular centers instead of atomic centers revealed nine pairs of structures which were almost identical, listed in table 6. The supplementary code includes a script to compare the previously mentioned five pairs by PDD, however the code to compute molecular centers is private, so it was not possible to include a script reproducing the results below. Instead, the .CIFs for each of these crystals is included in the folder identical_by_mol_centers and can be manually inspected (or opened in visualization software) to see the similarity.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: of AMDisubscriptAMD𝑖\\mathrm{AMD}_{i} cannot have close AMD vectors.
