Thus, a surge of research has focused on robust beamforming designs for RIS-aided networks  [ref]26  [ref]28 [ref]29    .\nParticularly, the authors of [ref]26 investigated the transmit power minimization problem under imperfect CSI conditions, which showed that whether to deploy the RIS depends on the level of the CSI error.\nIn addition to imperfect CSI, in , a robust beamforming algorithm with hardware defects was investigated, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the authors of [ref]28 studied a robust two-timescale transmission design in SF-RIS assisted cell-free massive MIMO networks. The effect of pilot contamination on channel estimation was studied, and the expression for spectral efficiency was then obtained in closed form. Since the STAR-RIS supports both signal reflection and refraction, the CSI acquisition is more challenging.\nIn [ref]29, the secure transmission in a STAR-RIS-aided NOMA system with imperfect CSI was investigated, which revealed that the size of RIS deployed in real-world scenarios depends on the CSI uncertainty.\nFurthermore, the authors of  theoretically analyzed the ergodic sum-rate of the STAR-RIS-assisted NOMA scheme under estimation errors and hardware impairments, which revealed that both the channel estimation and the ergodic sum-rate have performance floor at high transmit power regions caused by transceiver hardware impairments.\nOwing to the signal amplification achieved by amplifiers, the robust beamforming design for active RIS is necessary. In particular, the authors of  derived closed-form expressions of the average data rate and the RIS transmit power for transceiver design based on partial CSI in active RIS-aided systems, in which a rate outage constraint beamforming problem was formulated and solved using the Bernstein-Type inequality.\nMoreover, the authors of  proposed a robust secure communication scheme in active RIS-assisted symbiotic radio networks, which demonstrated that the active RIS can save more energy compared to passive RISs.\nIn , the authors obtained the closed-form expressions for uplink spectral efficiency and amplitude gain in active RIS-assisted MIMO networks in the case of imperfect CSI.\nIn addition, the outage probability and ergodic channel capacity were derived in closed-form with channel estimation errors in , which proved that incorporating amplifiers in RIS is comparable to boosting the transmit power, thereby enhancing the system performance.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: that the RIS is nearly-passive without bulky RF chains, the perfect CSI is difficult to acquire.
