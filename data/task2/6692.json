      "content": "Paper Title: A Memory-Augmented Multi-Task Collaborative Framework for Unsupervised Traffic Accident Detection in Driving Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIN recent years, autonomous driving technology   and advanced driver assistance systems   have achieved rapid development, bringing great convenience to human travel. At the same time, the everyday incidence of traffic accidents continually motivates efforts to increase the safety of driving systems in natural driving scenarios, especially in the detection of traffic accidents. Traffic accident detection (TAD) aims to detect abnormal traffic patterns in driving videos. Accurate TAD methods assist to reduce traffic accidents, increase road safety, shorten traffic recovery times and so on. Many researchers in computer vision have investigated the detection of anomalous events from dashboard-mounted cameras  [ref]6  [ref]8. These methods can be mainly divided into supervised and unsupervised approaches. While supervised methods [ref]8  have recently made great progress, the long-tailed distribution of driving events means that it may not be possible to collect all types of traffic accidents as training data, making it difficult to accurately detect traffic accidents outside the distribution of the dataset, potentially raising the risk of serious accidents. Therefore,\nto overcome the difficulty of modeling all possible driving events, we focus on exploring an unsupervised TAD approach in driving videos. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, unsupervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods 0 1 2 3 have significantly advanced in surveillance scenarios. However, in driving scenarios, high-speed moving vehicles cause videos with dynamically changing backgrounds, rendering these approaches not well-extended or even ineffective for driving scenarios 2 4.\nExisting unsupervised TAD methods mainly model the normal traffic pattern by building a single pretext task, i.e., appearance-based 5 6 7 8 or future-object-localization-based 9 0 1 TAD methods, and treat observed events that deviate from the normal pattern as anomalies.\nAmong them, appearance-based methods [ref]6 8 2 focus on detecting differences between predicted or reconstructed video frames and natural frames, while future-object-localization-based methods 1 2 aim to detect anomalous motion by computing the variance of observed objects in predicted positions. Despite significant advances in these single-pretext-task-based methods, accurate detection of traffic accidents remains challenging. First, when the camera moves rapidly in the driving scene, appearance-based methods are easily disturbed by many factors such as dynamic background and illumination change, which may lead to misjudgment of TAD models. Second, although future-object-localization based methods avoid the difficulty of predicting whole frames, they generally fail to detect traffic accidents involving the ego-vehicle but not involving other objects (e.g., out of control of the ego-vehicle) due to their inability to capture appearance changes of video frames.\nTherefore, how to accurately detect both ego-involved (i.e., traffic accidents involving the ego-vehicle) and non-ego (i.e., traffic accidents involving observed objects) accidents is very important for TAD in driving videos.\nBesides, traffic accident detection is essentially about detecting outliers that distinguish them from normal traffic patterns. Therefore, it is important to model normal traffic patterns and improve the sensitivity to abnormal patterns for accurate traffic accident detection. In this work, we argue that collaborating on optical flow reconstruction and future object localization tasks helps to more accurately detect both ego-involved and non-ego accidents. First, optical flow characterizes the appearance changes of video frames, which helps to detect ego-involved accidents. Second, accurate future object localization helps to detect abnormal object motion, which promotes the detection of non-ego accidents.\nAdditionally, optical flow in driving scenes also reflects the ego motion of the dashboard-mounted camera, which helps to better model the motion states of observed objects.\nFurthermore, the motion state of observed objects reflects the local motion cues of video frames, which is potentially beneficial to modeling the appearance changes.\n To fulfill the insights mentioned above, we propose a novel memory-augmented multi-task collaborative framework (MAMTCF) for unsupervised TAD in driving videos. First, we propose an unsupervised TAD framework that collaborates on optical flow reconstruction and future object localization tasks. Compared to existing TAD methods based on a single pretext task, our framework simultaneously modeling appearance changes and object motions in video frames, which helps detecting both ego-involved and non-ego accidents, achieving remarkable performance gains. In addition,\nwe propose a memory-augmented motion representation (MAMR) mechanism to model the interrelation between different types of motion representations, and utilize the high-level features of normal traffic patterns stored in memory to reconstruct motion representations. This enlarges the distinction from representations of abnormal traffic patterns and makes traffic accidents easier to detect.\nSpecifically, in the training phase, the MAMTCF is applied to train both the optical flow reconstruction and future object localization tasks. In the inference phase, we obtain an anomaly score for a driving video frame based on the reconstruction error of optical flow and the variance of predicted positions of observed objects. The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:\n We present a novel multi-task collaborative framework for unsupervised TAD. Compared to previous single-pretext-task-based TAD methods,\nour framework models both appearance changes and object motions in video frames by collaborating on optical flow reconstruction and future object localization tasks. This collaboration promotes the detection of both ego-involved and non-ego accidents, greatly improving the detection of traffic accidents.\n We further propose a memory-augmented motion representation mechanism to fully explore the interrelation between different types of motion representations and reconstruct motion representations utilizing the high-level features of normal traffic patterns stored in memory. Such reconstructed motion representations help increase differences from anomalies, which benefits the detection of traffic accidents. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the recently published large-scale benchmark, providing a promising direction for unsupervised traffic accident detection in driving videos. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II gives a brief review of related works. Section III details our proposed MAMTCF for traffic accident detection in driving videos. Extensive experimental results are presented in Section IV, and we finally draw a conclusion in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: accidents, increase road safety, shorten traffic recovery times and so on.
