      "content": "Paper Title: Incomplete Knowledge Graph Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) represent the facts about real-world entities in the form of triples ⟨h​e​a​d​_​e​n​t​i​t​y,r​e​l​a​t​i​o​n,t​a​i​l​_​e​n​t​i​t​y⟩ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑_𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙_𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦\\langle head\\_entity,relation,tail\\_entity\\rangle\n[ref]1 [ref]2. Popular knowledge graphs (e.g., DBpedia, YAGO, and BabelNet) are often multilingual, in which each language domain has a separate version . To encourage the knowledge fusion between different domains, knowledge graph alignment – the task of identifying entities in the cross-lingual KGs that refers to the same real-world object – has received great interest from both industry and acadamia  . The alignment result can be used for further data enrichment applications such as repairing inconsistencies, filling knowledge gaps, and building cross-lingual KBs  [ref]7 . Knowledge graph alignment faces challenges related to efficiency, scalability and richness of incorporated rich information of real-world KGs. Recent approaches solve these challenges by employing graph neural networks (GNNs)   to encode the attributional and the relational triples via some message-passing schemes, e.g., GCN-Align , RDGCN , MUGNN , KG-matching . However, existing techniques often assume that the input KGs are nearly identical (isomorphic), which is not true   . There is often a considerable gap between the levels of completeness of different monolingual KGs [ref]2, especially between the English domain and other languages . For example, in the DBP15K dataset, the ratio of relational triples between Chinese, Japanese, or French KGs over the English KG is only around 80% . Figure 1 gives an example of incomplete KGs, in which the neighborhood of the two entities referring to the actor Ronald Colman in English and French KGs are inconsistent (his occupation is missing in the English KG while his place of birth is missing in the French KG). Such inconsistencies easily lead to the different representations of the corresponding entities, especially for GNNs where the noise is accumulated over neural layers . In this paper, we address the above challenges by proposing a representation learning framework with multi-channel feature exchange for aligning incomplete knowledge graphs from different domains. To capture the multi-domain nature of KG entities, we develop a graph attention convolutional network that can combine the translated entity name (as the entity’s feature) and the relational structure simultaneously. The attention mechanism allows relational importance integration, which helps mitigate the noise by focusing on mutual relations in the input KGs and ignoring the missing ones. Our proposed attention mechanism goes beyond the existing techniques   by leveraging relation-aware attentive scoring, which helps the framework to integrate the KG edge information. To guarantee consistency across KGs, we develop an additional embedding component that encodes both entities and relations with the tradition translation constraint . While many recent works neglect this ‘seems-to-be-strict’ constraint , it turns out to strengthen the local information of relational triples and mitigate the information dilution phenomenon in graph convolutional networks . We also develop a missing links detector that consumes the two feature channels to exchange the knowledge from the two input KGs to discover and recover the missing triples. Finally, we combine these dimensions using late-fusion to instantiate the alignment result. We summarise our contributions as follows: We address the problem of aligning incomplete KGs from different domains and propose a framework called Incomplete Knowledge graphs Aligner via MultI-channel Feature Exchange (IKAMI). The model exploits multiple representations to capture the multi-channel nature of KGs (e.g., relational type, entity name, structural information). This is the first attempt to address the entity alignment and knowledge completion simultaneously, and we argue that this collaboration benefits both tasks, especially the alignment performance. We employ a translation-based embedding that encodes both entities and relations inspired from the translation model . The translation assumption helps to align both entities and relations and is a great supplement to mitigate the information dilution weakness of the GCN-based embedding . We propose a graph convolution attention network that efficiently captures relational triples, including the entity name, the relation type, and direction. The attention mechanism allows us to learn the underlying importance of relational triples based on their type, thus focusing on more popular relations and ignoring the ones that appear in only one network. We propose a missing triples detector that leverages the learned translation-based features to jointly discover and complete the missing links in the two input KGs. First, the potential missing links between the entities are proposed by selecting the ones with high-correlated embeddings, then the correct relation between them is chosen by selecting the appropriate relation embedding. We design a joint train schedule of the two embedding models to enable the holistic objectives of the embeddings can support each other well. Then, the similarity matrix for each channel is calculated and fused by weighted-sum to return the final result. We conduct experiments on real-world and synthetic KG datasets to evaluate our scheme. The results show that our framework outperforms other baselines in not only the entity alignment task but also the knowledge completion task by up to 15.2% and 3.5%, respectively. We publish the source code for use by the community. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the related works and motivates our approach. Section III presents a problem statement for the joint alignment and completion of incomplete knowledge graphs as well as our approach overview. Section IV describes the architecture of the two feature channels, including a translation-based embedding and a GCN embedding model that captures the relational correlation between the entities of KGs. Section V explains how the current extracted feature channels are iteratively used to instantiate the alignment result and recover the missing triples from the input KGs, which helps to refine the alignment results gradually. Empirical evaluation is given in Section VI, before Section VII presents a summary and conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: facts about real-world entities in the form of triples ⟨h​e​a​d​_​e​n​t​i​t​y,r​e​l​a​t​i​o​n,t​a​i​l​_​e​n​t​i​t​y⟩ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑_𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙_𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦\\langle head\\_entity,relation,tail\\_entity\\rangle\n[ref]1 [ref]2.
