      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Consensus Protocols for PoW based Blockchain and blockDAG\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSatoshi Nakamoto introduced blockchain as a P2P network for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin [ref]1. It has also found applications in smart contract-based decentralized applications (DApp) like medical records  and IoT applications . The bitcoin protocol in [ref]1 consists of a chain of blocks in which each block includes a reference to the previous block in the form of a block hash. The miners in the network collect multiple transactions from the clients and create a block by solving a computationally challenging problem called PoW. While creating a new block, this protocol restricts the miner from referring to the longest chain‚Äôs tip to maintain consensus among all the network nodes. Each client in the network validates the transactions through local copies of the blocks present with them. The difficulty of the PoW task is adaptively set so that a block is created approximately once every 10 minutes in the entire\nnetwork. As per the measurement study conducted in [ref]4, 10 minutes block interval was very high compared to the P2P network‚Äôs delay diameter (Dùê∑D). Because of this overestimation of delay diameter, bitcoin‚Äôs consensus rule [ref]1 has severe scalability limitations in terms of the number of transactions processed per second (TPS). Bitcoin‚Äôs network processes around 300000300000300000 transactions in a day  which limits the TPS to 3‚àí4343-4. Another major issue with the bitcoin protocol is the double-spend attack , where an attacker creates a secret chain with a block having a transaction that is a replacement for the original payment transaction to a merchant. An attacker publishes her secret chain with high probability after receiving the product from the merchant. To counter the double-spend attack the merchant should wait till the block with his transaction issued by the attacker achieves the required number of confirmations  before delivering his product to the attacker. In this paper, we propose two models for improving the transaction throughput in PoW based blockchain networks without compromising the fairness of the blockchain system. We propose a mathematical model for optimizing the TPS for the longest chain rule bitcoin protocol in the first model. We framed an optimization problem with the main chain growth rate as a cost function and double-spend attack characterized by attacker‚Äôs hash rate qùëûq, delay diameter Dùê∑D as constraints. The Dùê∑D is modeled by considering the blockchain as an Erdo¬®¬®ùëú\\ddot{o}s-Re¬¥¬¥ùëí\\acute{e}nyi random network topology . The main chain growth rate is derived as a concave function  of block-creation rate (ŒªùúÜ\\lambda). The TPS is obtained as a function of ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, block size (bùëèb), and Dùê∑D. Our model ensures an increase in ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, resulting in improved throughput. Through simulation results, it is shown that this is achieved without disturbing the balance between the hash rate and rewards of miners. However, accelerating ŒªùúÜ\\lambda beyond the optimal value proposed in this model causes more blocks in the network. This results in some honest nodes not having all the blocks created in the network and not extending the longest chain. This makes the system unfair in terms of the balance between hash rates and the rewards of miners. On the other hand, with a high probability, the attacker who does not follow the bitcoin protocol will increase her chain and gain from the double-spend attack .\nTo overcome this effect in the longest chain rule protocol, we propose a second model named Unsupervised Learning based consensus protocol for blockDAG (UL-blockDAG), a consensus protocol for DAG structure of the ledger instead of a chain of blocks. In the second model, while creating a new block, the miner includes reference to all its predecessor blocks called tips/leaf blocks (observed locally in its DAG) in its block header. This results in a DAG structure similar to the blockDAG structure in SPECTRE  and PHANTOM . In this protocol, each client constructs a blockDAG structure and simultaneously\nfollows the two-step strategy to achieve the consensus. In the first step, each client (node) applies a Graph clustering algorithm  for two clusters and separates the blocks with less inter-connectivity in the DAG. The intuition for applying the Graph clustering algorithm is to counter the double-spend attack. The attacker does not publish the blocks with double-spend transactions immediately after the creation. Instead, the attacker maintains its ledger secretly until the main ledger reaches the required number of confirmations. So, the attacker‚Äôs secret chain does not have well-connected blocks, and the client can easily separate those blocks by applying the unsupervised learning-based Graph\nclustering algorithms in . Finally, the client left with the blocks with well-connectivity, which are called honest blocks. In the second step, the ordering algorithm arranges the honest blocks in topological order, which makes this consensus mechanism suitable for smart contract applications, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) services due to fast confirmation times. The simulation results show that each honest client counter-attack the attacker‚Äôs double-spend strategy by executing the unsupervised learning-based clustering algorithm. The results also show that the drastic improvement in the TPS without compromising the fairness of the network. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the related work. Section 3 describes the System model and parameters. Section 4 describes the preliminaries for optimal throughput in the longest chain rule and unsupervised learning based-clustering algorithm. In section 5, we present the optimal longest chain rule. In section 6, we present an unsupervised learning based consensus mechanism for blockDAG. Section 7 discuss simulation results. Section 8 concludes the paper and\ngive future directions for research.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Satoshi Nakamoto introduced blockchain as a P2P network for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin [ref]1.
