After finding the effectively power-of-two bitwidths (through a novel quantization decomposition), the quantization technique employed is deterministic rounding. Since the framework starts from pre-trained models, the quantization is categorized as retraining. Bayesian Bits first introduces a novel quantization decomposition to guarantee that the bitwidths are powers-of-two, which in turn facilitates the hardware implementation. The quantization decomposition is summarized as follows. The residual error between a current quantized value qc​u​r​r​e​n​tsubscript𝑞𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡q_{current} whose bitwidth is bc​u​r​r​e​n​tsubscript𝑏𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡b_{current} and the next quantized value,qn​e​x​tsubscript𝑞𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡q_{next}, whose bitwidth is the next power-of-two value bn​e​x​t=bc​u​r​r​e​n​t∗2subscript𝑏𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡subscript𝑏𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡2b_{next}=b_{current}*2 is denoted as ϵn​e​x​t=qn​e​x​t−qc​u​r​r​e​n​tsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡subscript𝑞𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡subscript𝑞𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡\\epsilon_{next}=q_{next}-q_{current}. The scheme recursively quantizes the residual error of lower bitwidth quantization as follows. where RNI is a function that round to the nearest integer, x𝑥x is the input floating point value in the range [t​1,t​2]𝑡1𝑡2[t1,t2], sc​u​r​r​e​n​tsubscript𝑠𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡s_{current} is the step-size of the quantizer that is related to the bitwidth b𝑏b as: sc​u​r​r​e​n​t=t​2−t​12bc​u​r​r​e​n​t−1subscript𝑠𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑡2𝑡1superscript2subscript𝑏𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡1s_{current}=\\frac{t2-t1}{2^{b_{current}}-1}, sn​e​x​t=sc​u​r​r​e​n​t2bc​u​r​r​e​n​t+1subscript𝑠𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡subscript𝑠𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡superscript2subscript𝑏𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡1s_{next}=\\frac{s_{current}}{2^{b_{current}}+1}. For this decomposition scheme, the inputs should belong to the quantization grid [t​1,t​2]𝑡1𝑡2[t1,t2]. As such the inputs are clipped according to PACT  before applying the quantizer.\nThose quantized residual error tensors are added together to form the quantized approximation of the original tensor (hence quantizing to a specific bitwidth is seen as a gated addition of quantized residuals). After applying the aforementioned decomposition scheme, a learnable gate (i.e. a variable that ∈{0,1}absent01\\in\\{0,1\\}) is placed on each of the quantized residual error tensors. As such, the effective bitwidth can be controlled, optimized in a data-dependant manner, and learned jointly with the quantization scales and the DNN parameters. The gate of the lowest bitwidth possible allows pruning as well, since deactivating this gate (i.e. setting it to 0) will yield a quantized value having 0-bits i.e. pruned. The learning algorithm should utilize efficient gradient-based optimization while favoring gate configurations that yield efficient DNN. To have such a learning algorithm, Bayesian Bits relies on variational inference. As such, a gate regularizing term is derived via a prior which favors lower bitwidth configurations, and this term is added to the objective function. This objective function needs the expensive computation of an expectation of the log-likelihood with respect to the stochastic gates. To mitigate this complexity, Bayesian Bits approximates the gradient by exploiting the hard-concrete relaxations proposed by , thus allowing the optimization through the reparametrization trick proposed by  [ref]113. Moreover, the Straight-Through Estimator (STE)  is used for the gradients of the network parameters (for fine-tuning). Bayesian Bits is evaluated by quantizing all the weights and activations (except the output logits) of LeNet-5 on MNIST, and VGG-7 on CIFAR-10. In addition ablation studies (some with combined pruning and mixed quantization, some with pruning with fixed precision quantization, and some with mixed-precision quantization without pruning) are done on ResNet-18 and MobileNet-V2 with ImageNet. The batch normalization layers are treated as in [ref]43. Even-though Bayesian Bits supports joint training of network parameters and mixed quantization with pruning, in the experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 only the quantization parameters are updated (includes pruning) on the pre-trained models, whereas the weights (pre-trained) are kept fixed. The Giga Bit Operations (GBOPs) (i.e. # of multiplication operations x bit widths of the operands) relative to the full precision floating point models is reported along with the test accuracy, learned sparsity, and bitwidths of the models in several settings. The baselines used for the experiments are the full precision models, TWN [ref]61, LR-Net , RQ , WAGE , PACT , LSQ , AdaRound , TQT , and/or DQ . The results reported on MNIST and CIFAR-10 reveal that Bayesian Bits offers the least relative GBOPs with a competitive accuracy compared to the other baselines. Different settings for Bayesian Bits are used and their results are reported, and these show that the regularization term can be used to balance the trade-off between accuracy and complexity. The ablation studies on ResNet-18 and MobileNet-V2 vary the regularization settings to highlight the trade-offs between accuracy and complexity and reveal that Bayesian Bits performs well compared to the baselines. In one ablation study, post-training mixed-precision is tested on a pre-trained ResNet-18 model (i.e. no finetuning is used, and only gates and/or quantization ranges are learned), and the Pareto fronts are provided.\nIts results show that Bayesian Bits can serve as a midway method between post-training methods that do not require any backpropagation and other methods that require full model fine-tuning. To sum up, Bayesian Bits is a framework that relies on a variational inference to jointly optimize mixed-precision quantization and pruning, by proposing a novel quantization decomposition scheme and incorporating a regularization term in the objective function.\n\nReference markers found: [113]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]113: this complexity, Bayesian Bits approximates the gradient by exploiting the hard-concrete relaxations proposed by , thus allowing the optimization through the reparametrization trick proposed by  [ref]113.
