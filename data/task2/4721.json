In addition,  combines RGB images with thermal images,  combines lidar point clouds with HD maps, and recently an increasing number of works combine RGB camera images with radar points   . Only  proposes a general framework to fuse lidars, radars, and RGB camera images. State-of-the-art fusion networks follow either the two-stage (    [ref]17 [ref]18 ) or the one-stage object detection pipeline ( [ref]22  ). For example, MV3D [ref]17 proposes a two-stage object detector with RGB camera images and lidar points. In the first stage, camera images and lidar points are processed by sensor-specific networks to extract high-level features. The lidar branch also generates region proposals in order to crop lidar and camera feature maps. In the second stage, the cropped features are fused by a small detection head. AVOD  extends MV3D by fusing features both in the first and the second stages. 3D-CVF  applies a gating mechanism to learn the weights of each modality. MMF  adds additional tasks such as image depth completion and ground estimation to the fusion pipeline. Frustum-PointNet [ref]18 employs a pre-trained image detector to generate 2D object proposals and frustums in the 3D space, and applies a PointNet  to do object detection using lidar points within the frustums. In the one-stage pipeline, sensors can be fused at one specific layer  [ref]22, or at multiple layers  . For example, PointPainting [ref]22 applies a pre-trained semantic segmentation network to predict pixel-wise image semantics, and appends the semantic scores to the corresponding lidar points for further 3D object detection. ContFuse  gradually fuses the feature maps from the camera and the lidar branches via continuous fusion layers. Our proposed fusion architecture can be categorized into the one-stage object detection pipeline: each sensor modality is processed by a separate branch. The sensor-specific features are projected onto the bird’s eye view, aligned, and fused at a fusion layer.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: RGB cameras and lidars are the most common sensors for fusion in the literature [ref]17 [ref]18     [ref]22  .
