      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Generalizable Light Field Networks from Few Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset Following the settings in GRF  and PixelNeRF[ref]7, we evaluate first our synthesis results on the car and chair classes of dataset ShapeNet-V2. Precisely, the cars amount to 2151 training objects, 352 validation objects and 704 testing objects, while the chairs count 4612 training objects, 662 validation objects and 1317 testing objects. Hence the testing objects are not seen in training. In the training split, each object has 50 images with size 128×128128128128\\times 128. For testing, there are 251 views per object. Our model takes 1 or 2 fixed views as input and infers novel views for evaluation.\n Table 1 shows a quantitative comparison of our method with the recent state-of-the-art in few-shot view synthesis. We report the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) reconstruction metrics. We relay the numbers for methods TCO[ref]27, WRL, dGQN\nSRN and GRF  as they were reported in . We report the numbers of ENR and PixelNeRF[ref]7 from [ref]7, and the numbers for LFN[ref]11 from their paper. Figure 4 shows a qualitative comparison to a few of these methods. We obtain the visualizations for PixelNeRF[ref]7 and LFN[ref]11 using their publicly available codes and models. The teaser figure 1 shows additional 360-degree novel view synthesis results, and we provide further visual results in the supplementary material. The results confirm that 2D based image to image novel view methods (e.g. TCO) are outperformed by the 3D aware ones (e.g. ENR, SRN, etc). Furthermore, 3D aware methods that use implicit 3D representations (e.g. PixelNeRF, GRF, SRN) outperform generally their counterparts relying on explicit 3D latents (e.g. ENR). Our method is hybrid, in that it uses an explicit 3D latent, combined with a 2D implicit representation. Numerically, our method is overall second to PixelNeRF, while being two orders of magnitude faster at rendering. As we show in table 2, our method requires only 0.060.060.06 seconds to infer a full 128×128128128128\\times 128 image, while PixelNeRF takes 6.236.236.23 seconds using the implementation provided by the authors. As shown in figure 4, our method provides comparable reconstruction quality as well, while encountering similar difficulties for challenging views. While our performance is generally close to LFN across the benchmark, we note that LFN requires auto-decoding test time optimization. It also requires training hypernetworks, which are prohibitively expensive in compute and memory, thereby limiting the resolution of the reconstructed images. This hinders in turn the applicability of this method to real datasets with images larger than 128×128128128128\\times 128. Conversely, we demonstrate the ability of our method to model complex real scenes with bigger images using moderate computational resources, while providing optimization-free single forward pass prediction. We note that SRN requires test-time optimization as well.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Dataset Following the settings in GRF  and PixelNeRF[ref]7, we evaluate first our synthesis results on the car and chair classes of dataset ShapeNet-V2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
