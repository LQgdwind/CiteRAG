The fastest known algorithm for general n𝑛n-node graphs runs in n3/2Θ​(log⁡n)superscript𝑛3superscript2Θ𝑛n^{3}/2^{\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})} . In unweighted graphs, or graphs with small integer weights, faster algorithms are known. For APSP in undirected unweighted graphs (u-APSP), Seidel  and\nGalil and Margalit  \ngave O~​(nω)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega}) time algorithms where ω≤2.373𝜔2.373\\omega\\leq 2.373 is the exponent of matrix multiplication  9 [ref]17; the latter algorithm\nworks for graphs with small integer weights111\nIn this paper, [±c0]={−c0,…,c0}delimited-[]plus-or-minussubscript𝑐0subscript𝑐0…subscript𝑐0[\\pm c_{0}]=\\{-c_{0},\\ldots,c_{0}\\} and [c0]={0,…,c0}delimited-[]subscript𝑐00…subscript𝑐0[c_{0}]=\\{0,\\ldots,c_{0}\\}.\nThe O~~𝑂\\tilde{O} notation hides polylogarithmic factors (although\nconditions of the form c0=O~​(1)subscript𝑐0~𝑂1c_{0}=\\tilde{O}(1)\nmay be relaxed to c0≤no​(1)subscript𝑐0superscript𝑛𝑜1c_{0}\\leq n^{o(1)} if we allow extra no​(1)superscript𝑛𝑜1n^{o(1)} factors in the O~~𝑂\\tilde{O} time bounds).\n\nin [±c0]delimited-[]plus-or-minussubscript𝑐0[\\pm c_{0}] for\nc0=O~​(1)subscript𝑐0~𝑂1c_{0}=\\tilde{O}(1).\nThe hidden dependence on c0subscript𝑐0c_{0}\nwas improved by\nShoshan and Zwick 4. For directed unweighted graphs or graphs with weights in [±c0]delimited-[]plus-or-minussubscript𝑐0[\\pm c_{0}], the fastest APSP algorithm is by Zwick , running in O​(n2.529)𝑂superscript𝑛2.529O(n^{2.529}) time. This running time is achieved using the best known bounds for rectangular matrix multiplication  and would be Ω​(n2.5)Ωsuperscript𝑛2.5\\Omega(n^{2.5}) even if ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2. There is a big discrepancy between the running times for undirected and directed APSP. One might wonder, why is this? Are directed graphs inherently more difficult for APSP, or is there some special graph structure we can uncover and then use it to develop an O~​(nω)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega}) time algorithm for directed APSP as well? (Note that matrix multiplication seems necessary for APSP since APSP is known to capture Boolean matrix multiplication.) The first contribution in this paper is a fine-grained equivalence between directed unweighted APSP (u-APSP) and a certain rectangular version of the Min-Plus product problem. The Min-Plus product of an n×m𝑛𝑚n\\times m matrix A𝐴A by an m×p𝑚𝑝m\\times p matrix B𝐵B is the matrix C𝐶C with entries C​[i,j]=mink=1m⁡(A​[i,k]+B​[k,j])𝐶𝑖𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝑚𝐴𝑖𝑘𝐵𝑘𝑗C[i,j]=\\min_{k=1}^{m}(A[i,k]+B[k,j]).\nLet us denote by M⋆​(n1,n2,n3∣M)superscriptM⋆subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2conditionalsubscript𝑛3𝑀{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}\\mid M) the problem of computing the Min-Plus product of an n1×n2subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2n_{1}\\times n_{2} matrix by an n2×n3subscript𝑛2subscript𝑛3n_{2}\\times n_{3} matrix where both matrices have integer entries in [M]delimited-[]𝑀[M]. Let ℳ⋆​(n1,n2,n3∣M)superscriptℳ⋆subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2conditionalsubscript𝑛3𝑀{\\cal M}^{\\star}(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}\\mid M) be the best running time for M⋆​(n1,n2,n3∣M)superscriptM⋆subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2conditionalsubscript𝑛3𝑀{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}\\mid M). Zwick’s algorithm  for u-APSP can be viewed as making a logarithmic number of calls to the Min-Plus product\nM⋆​(n,n/L,n∣L)superscriptM⋆𝑛𝑛𝐿conditional𝑛𝐿{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n/L,n\\mid L) for all 1≤L≤n1𝐿𝑛1\\leq L\\leq n that are powers of 3/2323/2. The running time of Zwick’s algorithm is thus, within polylogarithmic factors, maxL⁡ℳ⋆​(n,n/L,n∣L)subscript𝐿superscriptℳ⋆𝑛𝑛𝐿conditional𝑛𝐿\\max_{L}{\\cal M}^{\\star}(n,n/L,n\\mid L). Let ℳ​(a,b,c)ℳ𝑎𝑏𝑐{\\cal M}(a,b,c) denote the running time of the fastest algorithm to multiply an a×b𝑎𝑏a\\times b by a b×c𝑏𝑐b\\times c matrix over the integers. Let ω​(a,b,c)𝜔𝑎𝑏𝑐\\omega(a,b,c) be the smallest real number r𝑟r such that ℳ​(na,nb,nc)≤O​(nr+ε)ℳsuperscript𝑛𝑎superscript𝑛𝑏superscript𝑛𝑐𝑂superscript𝑛𝑟𝜀{\\cal M}(n^{a},n^{b},n^{c})\\leq O(n^{r+\\varepsilon}) for all ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. The best known upper bound for the Min-Plus product running time ℳ⋆​(n,n/L,n∣L)superscriptℳ⋆𝑛𝑛𝐿conditional𝑛𝐿{\\cal M}^{\\star}(n,n/L,n\\mid L) is the minimum of O​(n3/L)𝑂superscript𝑛3𝐿O(n^{3}/L) (the brute force algorithm) and O~​(L⋅ℳ​(n,n/L,n))~𝑂⋅𝐿ℳ𝑛𝑛𝐿𝑛\\tilde{O}(L\\cdot{\\cal M}(n,n/L,n)) . For L=n1−ℓ𝐿superscript𝑛1ℓL=n^{1-\\ell}, ℳ⋆​(n,n/L,n∣L)superscriptℳ⋆𝑛𝑛𝐿conditional𝑛𝐿{\\cal M}^{\\star}(n,n/L,n\\mid L) is thus at most O~​(min⁡{n2+ℓ,n1−ℓ+ω​(1,ℓ,1)})~𝑂superscript𝑛2ℓsuperscript𝑛1ℓ𝜔1ℓ1\\tilde{O}(\\min\\{n^{2+\\ell},n^{1-\\ell+\\omega(1,\\ell,1)}\\}).\nOver all ℓ∈ [ref]1ℓ01\\ell\\in [ref]1, the runtime is maximized at O~​(n2+ρ)~𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌\\tilde{O}(n^{2+\\rho}) where ρ𝜌\\rho is such that ω​(1,ρ,1)=1+2​ρ𝜔1𝜌112𝜌\\omega(1,\\rho,1)=1+2\\rho. Hence in particular, the running time of Zwick’s algorithm is O~​(n2+ρ)~𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌\\tilde{O}(n^{2+\\rho}).\nThis running time has remained unchanged (except for improvements on the bounds on ρ𝜌\\rho) for almost 20 years. The current best known bound on ρ𝜌\\rho is ρ<0.529𝜌0.529\\rho<0.529, and if ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2, then ρ=1/2𝜌12\\rho=1/2. Our first result is that u-APSP is sub-n2+ρsuperscript𝑛2𝜌n^{2+\\rho} fine-grained equivalent to M⋆​(n,nρ,n∣n1−ρ)superscriptM⋆𝑛superscript𝑛𝜌conditional𝑛superscript𝑛1𝜌{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n^{\\rho},n\\mid n^{1-\\rho}): If M⋆​(n,nρ,n∣n1−ρ)superscriptM⋆𝑛superscript𝑛𝜌conditional𝑛superscript𝑛1𝜌{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n^{\\rho},n\\mid n^{1-\\rho}) is in O​(n2+ρ−ε)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌𝜀O(n^{2+\\rho-\\varepsilon}) time for ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, then u-APSP can also be solved in O​(n2+ρ−ε′)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌superscript𝜀′O(n^{2+\\rho-\\varepsilon^{\\prime}}) time for some ε′>0superscript𝜀′0\\varepsilon^{\\prime}>0.\nIf u-APSP can can be solved in O​(n2+ρ−ε)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌𝜀O(n^{2+\\rho-\\varepsilon}) time for some ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, then M⋆​(n,nρ,n∣n1−ρ)superscriptM⋆𝑛superscript𝑛𝜌conditional𝑛superscript𝑛1𝜌{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n^{\\rho},n\\mid n^{1-\\rho}) can also be solved in O​(n2+ρ−ε)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌𝜀O(n^{2+\\rho-\\varepsilon}) time. The Min-Plus product of two n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n matrices with arbitrary integer entries is known to be equivalent to APSP with arbitrary integer entries , so that their running times are the same, up to constant factors.\nAll known algorithms for directed unweighted APSP (including   and others), make calls to Min-Plus product of rectangular matrices with integer entries that can be as large as say n0.4superscript𝑛0.4n^{0.4}.\nIt is completely unclear, however, why a problem in unweighted graphs such as u-APSP should require the computation of Min-Plus products of matrices with such large entries. Theorem 1.1 surprisingly shows that it does. Moreover, it shows that unless we can improve upon the known approaches for Min-Plus product computation, there will be no way to improve upon Zwick’s algorithm for u-APSP. The latter is an algebraic problem in disguise. The main proof of Theorem 1.1 is simple—what is remarkable are the numerous consequences on equivalences and conditional hardness that follow from this idea.\nWe first use Theorem 1.1 to build a class of problems that are all equivalent to u-APSP, via (n2+ρ,n2+ρ)superscript𝑛2𝜌superscript𝑛2𝜌(n^{2+\\rho},n^{2+\\rho})-fine-grained reductions (see 1 for a survey of fine-grained complexity). In particular, if ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2 (or more generally when ω​(1,12,1)=2𝜔11212\\omega(1,\\frac{1}{2},1)=2), these are all problems that are n2.5superscript𝑛2.5n^{2.5}-fine-grained equivalent. Recall that in the\nAll-Pairs Longest Paths (APLP) problem, we want to output for every pair of vertices s,t𝑠𝑡s,t the weight of the longest path from s𝑠s to t𝑡t. While APLP is NP-hard in general, it is efficiently solvable in DAGs.\nIn the\nc𝑐cRed-APSP\nproblem, for a given graph in which some edges can be colored red, we want to output for every pair of vertices s,t𝑠𝑡s,t the weight of the shortest path from s𝑠s to t𝑡t that uses at most c𝑐c red edges. For convenience, we call all non-red edges blue. We use the following convention for problem names:\nthe prefix “u-” is for unweighted graphs;\nthe prefix “[c0]delimited-[]subscript𝑐0[c_{0}]-” is for graphs with weights in [c0]delimited-[]subscript𝑐0[c_{0}] (similarly for “[±c0]delimited-[]plus-or-minussubscript𝑐0[\\pm c_{0}]-” and for other ranges).\nInput graphs are directed unless stated otherwise. The following problems either all have O​(n2+ρ−ε)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌𝜀O(n^{2+\\rho-\\varepsilon}) time algorithms for some ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, or none of them do, assuming\nthat c0=O~​(1)subscript𝑐0~𝑂1c_{0}=\\tilde{O}(1): M⋆​(n,nρ,n∣n1−ρ)superscriptM⋆𝑛superscript𝑛𝜌conditional𝑛superscript𝑛1𝜌{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n^{\\rho},n\\mid n^{1-\\rho}), u-APSP, [±c0]delimited-[]plus-or-minussubscript𝑐0[\\pm c_{0}]-APSP for directed graphs without negative cycles, u-APLP for DAGs, [±c0]delimited-[]plus-or-minussubscript𝑐0[\\pm c_{0}]-APLP for DAGs,\n u-c𝑐cRed-APSP for undirected graphs for any 2≤c≤O~​(1)2𝑐~𝑂12\\leq c\\leq\\tilde{O}(1). Interestingly, while u-222Red-APSP in undirected graphs above is equivalent to u-APSP and hence improving upon its O~​(n2+ρ)~𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌\\tilde{O}(n^{2+\\rho}) runtime would be difficult, we show that u-111Red-APSP in undirected graphs can be solved in O~​(nω)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega}) time via a modification of Seidel’s algorithm, and hence there is a seeming jump in complexity in u-c𝑐cRed-APSP from c=1𝑐1c=1 to c=2𝑐2c=2. Besides the above equivalences we provide some interesting reductions from u-APSP to other well-studied matrix product and shortest paths problems. Lincoln, Polak and Vassilevska W.  reduce u-APSP to some matrix product problems such as All-Edges Monochromatic Triangle and the (min,max)(\\min,\\max)-Product studied in 6 8 and 7  respectively. Using the equivalence of u-APSP and M⋆​(n,n/ℓ,n∣ℓ1−p)superscriptM⋆𝑛𝑛ℓconditional𝑛superscriptℓ1𝑝{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n/\\ell,n\\mid\\ell^{1-p}), we can reduce u-APSP to another matrix product called Min Witness Equality Product (MinWitnessEq), where we are given n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n integer matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B, and are required to compute min⁡{k∈[n]:A​[i,k]=B​[k,j]}:𝑘delimited-[]𝑛𝐴𝑖𝑘𝐵𝑘𝑗\\min\\{k\\in[n]:A[i,k]=B[k,j]\\} for every pair of (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j). This can be viewed as a merge of the Min Witness product  222Recently, there has been renewed interest in studying the Min Witness product, due to a breakthrough  on the All-Pairs LCA in DAGs problem, which was one of the original motivations for studying Min Witness. and Equality Product problems  0. Another natural variant of APSP is the problem of approximating shortest path distances. Zwick  presented an O~​(nω​log⁡M)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔𝑀\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega}\\log M) time\nalgorithm for computing a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-multiplicative approximation for all pairwise distances in a directed graph with integer weights in [M]delimited-[]𝑀[M], for any constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0.333\nBringmann et al.  considered the more unusual setting of very large M𝑀M, where the log⁡M𝑀\\log M factor is to be avoided.\n\nThis is essentially optimal since any such approximation algorithm can be used to multiply n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n Boolean matrices. An arguably better notion of approximation is to provide an additive approximation, i.e. outputting for every u,v𝑢𝑣u,v an estimate D′​[u,v]superscript𝐷′𝑢𝑣D^{\\prime}[u,v] for the distance D​[u,v]𝐷𝑢𝑣D[u,v] such that D​[u,v]≤D′​[u,v]≤D​[u,v]+E𝐷𝑢𝑣superscript𝐷′𝑢𝑣𝐷𝑢𝑣𝐸D[u,v]\\leq D^{\\prime}[u,v]\\leq D[u,v]+E, where E𝐸E is an error that can depend on u𝑢u and v𝑣v. At ICALP’08,\nRoditty and Shapira 2 studied the following variant: given an unweighted directed graph and a constant p∈ [ref]1𝑝01p\\in [ref]1, compute for all u,v𝑢𝑣u,v an estimate D′​[u,v]superscript𝐷′𝑢𝑣D^{\\prime}[u,v] with D​[u,v]≤D′​[u,v]≤D​[u,v]+D​[u,v]p𝐷𝑢𝑣superscript𝐷′𝑢𝑣𝐷𝑢𝑣𝐷superscript𝑢𝑣𝑝D[u,v]\\leq D^{\\prime}[u,v]\\leq D[u,v]+D[u,v]^{p}.\nThey gave an algorithm with running time\nO~​(maxℓ⁡min⁡{n3/ℓ,ℳ⋆​(n,n/ℓ1−p,n∣ℓ1−p)})~𝑂subscriptℓsuperscript𝑛3ℓsuperscriptℳ⋆𝑛𝑛superscriptℓ1𝑝conditional𝑛superscriptℓ1𝑝\\tilde{O}(\\max_{\\ell}\\min\\{n^{3}/\\ell,{\\cal M}^{\\star}(n,n/\\ell^{1-p},n\\mid\\ell^{1-p})\\}).\nFor example, for p=0𝑝0p=0, this matches the time complexity of Zwick’s exact\nalgorithm for u-APSP; for p=1𝑝1p=1, this matches Zwick’s O~​(nω)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega})-time algorithm with constant multiplicative approximation factor.\nFor p=0.5𝑝0.5p=0.5, with the current rectangular matrix multiplication bounds , the running time is O​(n2.447)𝑂superscript𝑛2.447O(n^{2.447}). We obtain an improved running time: For any p∈ [ref]1𝑝01p\\in [ref]1, given a directed unweighted graph, one can obtain additive D​[u,v]p𝐷superscript𝑢𝑣𝑝D[u,v]^{p} approximations to all distances D​[u,v]𝐷𝑢𝑣D[u,v] in time O~​(maxℓ⁡ℳ⋆​(n,n/ℓ,n∣ℓ1−p))~𝑂subscriptℓsuperscriptℳ⋆𝑛𝑛ℓconditional𝑛superscriptℓ1𝑝\\tilde{O}(\\max_{\\ell}{\\cal M}^{\\star}(n,n/\\ell,n\\mid\\ell^{1-p})). The improvement over Roditty and Shapira’s running time is substantial.\nFor example, for all p≥0.415𝑝0.415p\\geq 0.415, the time bound is O​(n2.373)𝑂superscript𝑛2.373O(n^{2.373}) (the current matrix multiplication running time), whereas their algorithm only achieves O​(n2.373)𝑂superscript𝑛2.373O(n^{2.373}) for p=1𝑝1p=1.\nOur result also answers one of Roditty and Shapira’s open question (on whether O~​(nω)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega}) time is possible for any p<1𝑝1p<1), if ω>2𝜔2\\omega>2. The new algorithm is also optimal (ignoring logarithmic factors) in a strong sense, as our reduction technique shows that for all ℓℓ\\ell, M⋆​(n,n/ℓ,n∣ℓ1−p)superscriptM⋆𝑛𝑛ℓconditional𝑛superscriptℓ1𝑝{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n/\\ell,n\\mid\\ell^{1-p}) can be tightly reduced to the additive D​[u,v]p𝐷superscript𝑢𝑣𝑝D[u,v]^{p} approximation of APSP.\nIn particular, u-APSP with constant additive error is fine-grained equivalent to exact u-APSP. The All-Pairs Lightest Shortest Paths (APLSP) problem studied in  5 asks to compute for every pair of vertices s,t𝑠𝑡s,t\nthe distance from s𝑠s to t𝑡t (with respect to the edge weights) and the smallest number of edges over all shortest paths from s𝑠s and t𝑡t.\nTraditional shortest-path algorithms can be easily modified to find the lightest shortest paths, but not the faster matrix-multiplication-based algorithms.\nOur reduction for u-c𝑐cRed-APSP can be easily modified to reduce\nM⋆​(n,nρ,n∣n1−ρ)superscriptM⋆𝑛superscript𝑛𝜌conditional𝑛superscript𝑛1𝜌{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n^{\\rho},n\\mid n^{1-\\rho}) to {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}-APLSP in undirected graphs, which can be viewed as a conditional lower bound of n2+ρ−o​(1)superscript𝑛2𝜌𝑜1n^{2+\\rho-o(1)} for the latter problem. If {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}-APLSP in undirected graphs is in O​(n2+ρ−ε)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌𝜀O(n^{2+\\rho-\\varepsilon}) time for ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, then so is M⋆​(n,nρ,n∣n1−ρ)superscriptM⋆𝑛superscript𝑛𝜌conditional𝑛superscript𝑛1𝜌{\\mbox{\\rm M}^{\\star}}(n,n^{\\rho},n\\mid n^{1-\\rho}). The fastest known algorithm to date for {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}-APLSP,\nor more generally, [c0]delimited-[]subscript𝑐0[c_{0}]-APLSP for c0=O~​(1)subscript𝑐0~𝑂1c_{0}=\\tilde{O}(1), for directed or undirected graphs\nis by Zwick 5 from STOC’99 and runs in O​(n2.724)𝑂superscript𝑛2.724O(n^{2.724}) time with the current best bounds for rectangular matrix multiplication (the running time would be O~​(n8/3)~𝑂superscript𝑛83\\tilde{O}(n^{8/3}) if ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2). Chan  (STOC’07) improved this running time to O~​(n(3+ω)/2)≤O​(n2.687)~𝑂superscript𝑛3𝜔2𝑂superscript𝑛2.687\\tilde{O}(n^{(3+\\omega)/2})\\leq O(n^{2.687})\nbut only if the weights are positive, i.e., for\n([c0]−{0})delimited-[]subscript𝑐00([c_{0}]-\\{0\\})-APLSP\n(and so his result does not hold for {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}-APLSP). Both Zwick’s and Chan’s algorithms solve a more general problem, Lex2-APSP, in which one is given a directed graph where each edge e𝑒e is given two weights w1​(e),w2​(e)subscript𝑤1𝑒subscript𝑤2𝑒w_{1}(e),w_{2}(e) and one wants to find for every pair of vertices u,v𝑢𝑣u,v the lexicographic minimum over all u𝑢u-v𝑣v paths π𝜋\\pi of (∑e∈πw1​(e),∑e∈πw2​(e))subscript𝑒𝜋subscript𝑤1𝑒subscript𝑒𝜋subscript𝑤2𝑒(\\sum_{e\\in\\pi}w_{1}(e),\\sum_{e\\in\\pi}w_{2}(e)). Then APLSP is Lex2-APSP when all w2subscript𝑤2w_{2} weights are 111, and the related All-Pairs Shortest Lightest Paths (APSLP) problem is when all w1subscript𝑤1w_{1} weights are 111. To complement the conditional lower bound for APLSP, and hence Lex2-APSP, we present new algorithms for [c0]delimited-[]subscript𝑐0[c_{0}]-Lex2-APSP for c0=O~​(1)subscript𝑐0~𝑂1c_{0}=\\tilde{O}(1), both (slightly) improving Chan’s running time and also allowing zero weights, something that Chan’s algorithm couldn’t support. [c0]delimited-[]subscript𝑐0[c_{0}]-Lex2-APSP can be solved in O​(n2.66)𝑂superscript𝑛2.66O(n^{2.66}) time for any c0=O~​(1)subscript𝑐0~𝑂1c_{0}=\\tilde{O}(1). If ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2, the above running time would be O~​(n2.5)~𝑂superscript𝑛2.5\\tilde{O}(n^{2.5}),\nimproving Zwick’s previous O~​(n8/3)~𝑂superscript𝑛83\\tilde{O}(n^{8/3}) bound 5 and matching our conditional lower bound n2+ρ−o​(1)superscript𝑛2𝜌𝑜1n^{2+\\rho-o(1)}. For undirected graphs with positive weights in [c0]−{0}delimited-[]subscript𝑐00[c_{0}]-\\{0\\},\nwe further improve the running time to O​(n2.58)𝑂superscript𝑛2.58O(n^{2.58}) under the current matrix multiplication bounds. We next consider the natural problem, ##\\#APSP, of counting the number of shortest paths for every pair of vertices in a graph. This problem needs to be solved, for example, when computing the so-called Betweenness Centrality (BC) of a vertex. BC is a well-studied measure of vertex importance in social networks. If we let C​[s,t]𝐶𝑠𝑡C[s,t] be the number of shortest paths between s𝑠s and t𝑡t, and Cv​[s,t]subscript𝐶𝑣𝑠𝑡C_{v}[s,t] be the number of shortest paths between s𝑠s and t𝑡t that go through v𝑣v, then BC​(v)=∑s,t≠vCv​[s,t]/C​[s,t]BC𝑣subscript𝑠𝑡𝑣subscript𝐶𝑣𝑠𝑡𝐶𝑠𝑡\\text{BC}(v)=\\sum_{s,t\\neq v}C_{v}[s,t]/C[s,t] and the BC problem is to compute BC​(v)BC𝑣\\text{BC}(v)\nfor a given graph and a given node v𝑣v. Prior work  showed that ##\\#APSP and BC in m𝑚m-edge n𝑛n-node unweighted graphs can be computed in O​(m​n)𝑂𝑚𝑛O(mn) time via a modification of Breadth-First Search (BFS).444Brandes presented further practical improvements as well. However, all prior algorithms assumed a model of computation where adding two integers of arbitrary size takes constant time. In the more realistic word-RAM model (with O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) bit words), these algorithms would run in Θ~​(m​n2)~Θ𝑚superscript𝑛2\\tilde{\\Theta}(mn^{2}) time, as there are explicit examples of graphs with m𝑚m edges (for any m𝑚m, a function of n𝑛n) for which the shortest paths counts have Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) bits.555One example is an (n/3+2)𝑛32(n/3+2)-layered graph where the first n/3𝑛3n/3 layers have 222 vertices each and the last 222 layers have n/6𝑛6n/6 vertices each. The i𝑖i-th layer and the (i+1)𝑖1(i+1)-th layer are connected by a complete bipartite graph for each 1≤i≤n/31𝑖𝑛31\\leq i\\leq n/3, while the last two layers are connected by O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) edges. \nIn particular, the best running time in terms of n𝑛n so far has been O~​(n4)~𝑂superscript𝑛4\\tilde{O}(n^{4}). We provide the first genuinely O~​(n3)~𝑂superscript𝑛3\\tilde{O}(n^{3}) time algorithm for ##\\#APSP, and thus Betweenness Centrality, in directed unweighted graphs. u-##\\#APSP can be solved in O~​(n3)~𝑂superscript𝑛3\\tilde{O}(n^{3}) time by a combinatorial algorithm. This runtime cannot be improved since there are graphs for which the output size is Ω​(n3)Ωsuperscript𝑛3\\Omega(n^{3}). Since the main difficulty of the ##\\#APSP problem comes from the counts being very large, it is interesting to consider variants that mitigate this. Let U≤nO~​(1)𝑈superscript𝑛~𝑂1U\\leq n^{\\tilde{O}(1)}.\nLet #mod​Usubscript#mod𝑈\\#_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm mod}\\,U}APSP be the problem of computing all pairwise counts modulo U𝑈U. Let #≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP be the problem of computing for every pair of nodes u,v𝑢𝑣u,v the minimum of their count and U𝑈U (think of U𝑈U as a “cap”). Finally, let #approx-​Usubscript#approx-𝑈\\#_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm approx-}U}APSP be the problem of computing a (1+1/U)11𝑈(1+1/U)-approximation of all pairwise counts (think of keeping the log⁡U𝑈\\log U most significant bits of each count). We obtain the following result for u-#≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP in directed graphs: u-#≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP (in directed graphs) can be solved in n2+ρ​polylog ​U≤n2+ρ+o​(1)superscript𝑛2𝜌polylog 𝑈superscript𝑛2𝜌𝑜1n^{2+\\rho}\\text{\\rm polylog~{}}U\\leq n^{2+\\rho+o(1)} time. Furthermore, for any U≥2𝑈2U\\geq 2, if\nu-#≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP can be solved in O​(n2+ρ−ε)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝜌𝜀O(n^{2+\\rho-\\varepsilon}) time for some ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, then so can u-APSP (with randomization).\nFor any 2≤U≤O~​(1)2𝑈~𝑂12\\leq U\\leq\\tilde{O}(1), the converse is true as well.\n Thus, we get a conditionally optimal algorithm for u-#≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP.\nFor 2≤U≤O~​(1)2𝑈~𝑂12\\leq U\\leq\\tilde{O}(1), the theorem above gives a fine-grained equivalence between u-#≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP and u-APSP; in particular, for U=2𝑈2U=2, the problem corresponds to testing uniqueness for the shortest path of each pair.\n(For large U𝑈U, however,\nit is not a fine-grained equivalence since the algorithm for u-#≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP does not go through Min-Plus product, but rather directly uses fast matrix multiplication.) Our algorithm from Theorem 1.7 is based on Zwick’s algorithm for u-APSP. We show that one can also modify Seidel’s algorithm for u-APSP in undirected graphs to obtain O~​(nω)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega}) time algorithms for u-#≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP and u-#mod​Usubscript#mod𝑈\\#_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm mod}\\,U}APSP in undirected graphs. u-#≤Usubscript#absent𝑈\\#_{\\leq U}APSP and u-#mod​Usubscript#mod𝑈\\#_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm mod}\\,U}APSP in undirected graphs can be solved in O~​(nω​log⁡U)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔𝑈\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega}\\log U) time. We also show that u-#approx-​Usubscript#approx-𝑈\\#_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\rm approx-}U}APSP in undirected graphs can be solved in O​(n2.58​polylog ​U)𝑂superscript𝑛2.58polylog 𝑈O(n^{2.58}\\text{\\rm polylog~{}}U) time, somewhat surprisingly, by a slight modification of our undirected Lex2-APSP algorithm (despite the apparent dissimilarity between the two problems).\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: graphs (u-APSP), Seidel  and\nGalil and Margalit  \ngave O~​(nω)~𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega}) time algorithms where ω≤2.373𝜔2.373\\omega\\leq 2.373 is the exponent of matrix multiplication  9 [ref]17; the latter algorithm\nworks for graphs with small integer weights111\nIn this paper, [±c0]={−c0,…,c0}delimited-[]plus-or-minussubscript𝑐0subscript𝑐0…subscript𝑐0[\\pm\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
