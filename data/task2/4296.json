Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

HDP-HLM:\nNPB-DAA is a method for word and phoneme acquisition that evaluates language and acoustic models through unsupervised learning [ref]7.\nThe parameter inference method applies blocked Gibbs sampling to the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden language model (HDP-HLM).\nHDP-HLM is a PGM for time-series data that extends the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden semi-Markov model (HDP-HSMM) .\nThe language model represents the transition probabilities between words, and the acoustic model represents the relationship between each phoneme and acoustic features.\nAcoustic features are obtained by dimensional compression of the speech spectrum by conversion to the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) or deep sparse autoencoder with parametric bias in the hidden layer (DSAE-PBHL) . Prosodic HDP-HLM:\nOkuda et al. proposed a PGM that extends HDP-HLM to utilize prosodic features such as fundamental frequency and silent intervals for lexical acquisition from natural speech signals that include prosody [ref]8.\nProsody affects the duration distribution, which represents the time length of phonemes in speech. In a lexical acquisition experiment involving spoken utterances, the use of prosodic features was shown to outperform phonological-only speech unit discovery methods [ref]9. HDP-HLM+MLDA:\nMurakami et al. proposed a PGM for discovering speech units using distributional and co-occurrence cues [ref]9.\nHDP-HLM+MLDA is a model that integrates HDP-HLM and multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (MLDA) .\nMLDA is a multimodal extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation  and is capable of forming object categories from robot sensor observations.\nThis method acquires words and phonemes from speech signals through unsupervised learning, as well as utilizes object categories based on multiple modalities such as vision, haptics, and hearing.\nMLDA-segmented words (equivalent to nouns and adjectives) describe object features with accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: This study focused on phoneme and word discovery using phonological [ref]7, prosodic [ref]8, and co-occurrence cues of speech signals [ref]9.\nThese methods provide constructive approaches to infant lexical acquisition .\nHowever, they do not take neuroscientific\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
