      "content": "Paper Title: On the Evaluation of Commit Message Generation Models: An Experimental Study\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA tremendous amount of code is generated and updated every day, which is often maintained by version control systems such as Git. In the course of software development and maintenance, developers could frequently change their code to fix bugs, add features, perform refactoring, etc. Commits keep track of these code changes. Each commit is associated with a message which describes what and why these code changes are made.\nCommit messages can help developers understand and analyze code changes.\nFor example, they can provide additional explanatory power in maintenance classification  and Just-In-Time defect prediction . Refactoring opportunities can be found with the analysis of commit messages . However, writing commit messages manually is time-consuming and laborious especially when the code is updated frequently .\nGenerating commit messages automatically is very helpful to developers.\nEarly work on commit message generation    is based on expert rules. Commit messages generated by rule-based methods tend to have too many lines, making it difficult to convey the key intention of the code changes .\nLater, information retrieval techniques are introduced to commit message generation.\nFor instance, NNGen proposed by Liu et al.  is a simple yet effective retrieval-based method utilizing nearest neighbor algorithm.\nChangeDoc proposed by Huang et al. [ref]9 is another method that retrieves the most similar commits according to the syntax and semantics in the changed code.\nRecently, various deep learning-based models are proposed for commit message generation. Some studies 0 1 2 represent code changes as textural sequences and use Neural Machine Translation (NMT) techniques to translate the source code changes into target commit messages.\nIn addition, Liu et al. 3 adopt the pointer-generator network 4 to handle the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.\nOther studies leverage the rich structural information of source code. Xu et al. 5 jointly model the semantic representation and structural representation of code changes, Liu et al.  capture both the AST structure of code changes and its semantics for commit message generation. However, we notice that several important aspects are overlooked in existing work.\nFirstly, when evaluating commit message generation models, evaluation metrics being used vary a lot. The differences and applicability of these metrics have received little attention.\nSecond, the evaluation datasets are different for different models and most studies experiment on only one dataset.\nThird, the applicable scenarios of the models are rarely discussed, such as data splitting, etc.\nIn view of the above limitations of existing work, in this paper, we would like to dive deep into the problem and answer: how to evaluate and compare commit message generation models more correctly and comprehensively? To answer the above question, we conduct a systematic analysis of commit message generation methods and their performance.\nWe analyze the features in commit messages and compare the BLEU variants with human judgment.\nMoreover, we collect a large-scale commit message dataset from 500 repositories with more than 3.6M commit messages in five popular programming languages (PLs).\nBenefited from the comprehensive information provided by our dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing methods on multiple PLs.\nWe also compare the influence of different splitting strategies on model performance and discuss the applicable scenarios. Through extensive experimental and human evaluation, we obtain the following findings about the current commit message generation models and datasets: Most existing datasets are crawled from only Java repositories while repositories in other PLs are rarely taken into account. Moreover, we find some context information contributing to generation models is not available in the existing public datasets. By comparing three BLEU variants commonly used in existing work, we find they show inconsistent results in many cases. From the correlation coefficient between human evaluation and different BLEU variants, we find that B-Norm is a more suitable BLEU variant for this task and it is recommended to be used in future research. By comparing different models on existing datasets and our multi-programming-language dataset, we find existing models show different performance. On the positive side, most of them can be migrated to repositories in other PLs. The dataset splitting strategies have a significant impact on the evaluation of commit message generation models. Many studies randomly split datasets by commit. Such a splitting strategy cannot simulate the Just-In-Time situation, where the training set contains no data later than that in the test set. Our results show that evaluating models on datasets split by timestamp shows much worse performance than split by commit. In the scenario of Just-In-Time, we suggest splitting by timestamp for a practical evaluation of models.\nMoreover, splitting data by project also leads to worse performance, meaning that the generalization ability of existing models for new repositories is limited. Therefore, in order to evaluate models more comprehensively, it is suggested to also evaluate models on datasets split by project. Through these findings, we give\nactionable suggestions on comprehensively evaluating commit message generation models. Then, we discuss future work from three aspects: metrics, information, different scenarios. Finally, we discuss some threats to validity. To summarize, the major contributions of this paper are as follows: We perform a systematic evaluation of existing work on commit message generation and summarize our findings (including the inappropriate use of BLEU metrics and data splitting strategies, etc) which have not received enough attention in the past. We develop a large dataset in multi-programming-language which contains comprehensive information for each commit and is publicly available111https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5025758. We suggest ways for better evaluating\ncommit message generation models. We also suggest possible research directions that address the limitations of existing models.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: to commit message generation.\nFor instance, NNGen proposed by Liu et al.  is a simple yet effective retrieval-based method utilizing nearest neighbor algorithm.\nChangeDoc proposed by Huang et al. [ref]9 is another method that retrieves the most similar commits according to the syntax and semantics in the changed code.\nRecently, various deep learning-based models are proposed for commit\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
