      "content": "Paper Title: SubICap: Towards Subword-informed Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage captioning is a challenging task that bridges two different domains of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It takes both visual as well as linguistic understanding for a system to translate visual information into well-formed sentences. Over the past decade, numerous frameworks have been proposed for captioning , , , amongst which encoder-decoder based neural models have been very popular. In this particular framework, encoder transforms the visual input into a visual embedding, whereas, the decoder uses the encoded embedding as an input to generate text. Various encoder-decoder based models differ in the way of encoding the visual information. While some have used features from penultimate layers of CNN classifiers , others have focused on extracting the most relevant visual features, using attention . Leveraging semantic concepts , object attributes  and relationships [ref]40 has also garnered interest. In short, a lot of work has been done in terms of representing the visual input into meaningful latent representation(s). Such representations play an important role in IC and can be reflective of a model’s visual understanding. The decoder in an encoder-decoder based IC framework is usually a language model, which learns to generate captions as a sequence of words/tokens, given a visual encoding. Existing State-of-The-Art (SOTA) captioning systems have modeled individual words as atomic units. Captions have been treated as a sequence of words, completely ignoring the fact that words are also composed of smaller units called morphemes. To deeply understand the meaning of a caption, it can be useful to also leverage upon the composition of words. Limitations of the existing word-level captioning models are: 1) they assume a limited vocabulary of frequent words, thus poorly generalize rare words into a single category of ‘unknown words’, 2) these models are unable to exploit the relationship between the composition and meaning of words. For example the word ‘dog’ and ‘dogs’ might be considered as two individual words by a word-based model. However, ‘dogs’ is actually a plural of ‘dog’ and is composed of ‘dog’, and ‘s’. To alleviate these major limitations of the existing captioning models, we introduce subword-informed image captioning (SubICap). Subword units have become prevalent in various NLP models over the past few years 7, [ref]42. The subword-informed models represent words as a composition of subwords. Identifying similar subwords amongst words, can be helpful in exploiting the relationship between word segments, their meanings and compositionality. Since, the number of plausible subwords in a corpora is comparatively minuscule vs. the number of plausible words, subword-level models have a smaller number of trainable parameters compared to the word-level models. Moreover, subword-level models can effectively represent rare words. Since words that have similar substrings (such as ‘flower’ and ‘flowers’) can share similar representations, the model can see words that share the same sub-strings with rare words during training, resulting in rare words having more informative representations. In addition, the average frequency of subwords is higher than the frequency of words, which helps reduce the sparsity issue in the corpora and leads to better parameter learning and probability estimates. Our contributions in this work are: We propose subword-based language modeling for image captioning as a better alternative to word-level language modeling, to adequately handle rare words in the training set, reduce the training parameters (Sec. 6.1) and to improve the quality of captions (Sec. 6.2, 7.2).\\useshortskip To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs a learned subword tokenizer for captioning. We demonstrate the impact of choosing different vocabulary sizes for the subword tokenizer on various metric scores, number of learning parameters and percentage of unique captions (Sec. 6.1). An in-depth quantitative (Sec. 6.2, 7.1) and qualitative analysis (Sec. 7.2) to show that our model improves upon the word-level baseline not only in terms of popular metric scores but also on uniqueness and descriptiveness of captions.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: penultimate layers of CNN classifiers , others have focused on extracting the most relevant visual features, using attention .
