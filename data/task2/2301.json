      "content": "Paper Title: Provable Convergence of Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient Method for Over-Parameterized Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst-order methods.\nWith the growing demands for handling large-scale machine learning problems,\nfirst-order methods that only access the objective values and gradients have become popular due to their efficiency and effectiveness. For convex problems, GD is the most well-known first-order method, which achieves 𝒪​(1/t)𝒪1𝑡\\mathcal{O}(1/t) convergence rate with t𝑡t iterations .\nMomentum methods make a further step by exploiting the history of gradients.\nAmong first-order methods, NAG obtains the optimal rate 𝒪​(1/t2)𝒪1superscript𝑡2\\mathcal{O}(1/t^{2}) for convex problem with Lipschitz gradient .\nFocusing on non-smooth convex problems, Tao et al. [ref]29 proved that NAG improves the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent by a factor log⁡(t)𝑡\\log(t).\nIn contrast, Lessard et al.  found a counterexample that HB may fail to find the global optimum for some strongly convex problems.\nOn the other hand, several researches established a connection between the discrete-time methods and the ODE models.\nIn the limit of infinitesimally learning rate, Su et al.  formulated a second-order ODE associated with NAG.\nThe convergence of NAG is then linked to the analysis of the related ODE solution.\nShi et al.  further developed a more accurate high-resolution ODE that helps distinguish between HB and NAG. For non-convex problems, it is intractable to find a global optimum.\nAs an alternative, current researches consider the convergence to the stationary point or local minimum as a criterion for evaluation [ref]33   .\nIn contrast to previous work, we show a non-asymptotic convergence result for NAG to arrive at a global minimum for a non-convex and non-smooth problem. Convergence theory of over-parameterized neural networks.\nDu et al. [ref]16 was the first to prove the convergence rate of GD for training a randomly initialized two-layer ReLU neural network.\nTheir results showed that GD can linearly converge to a global optimum when the width of the hidden layer is large enough.\nBased on the same neural network architecture, Li and Liang  investigated the convergence of stochastic gradient descent on structured data.\nWu et al.  improved the upper bound of the learning rate in [ref]16, which results in a faster convergence rate for GD.\nOn the other hand, Jacot et al.  introduced the NTK theory, which establishes a link between the over-parameterized neural network and the neural tangent kernel.\nTheir result was further extended to investigate the convergence of GD for training different architectures of neural networks, including convolutional , residual  and graph neural network .\nWhile these results are mostly concerned with GD, there are few theoretical guarantees for momentum methods. Recently, some researchers have drawn attention to analyzing the convergence of momentum methods with NTK theory.\nWang et al.  studied the convergence of HB using a similar setting as [ref]16.\nThey proved that, as compared to GD, HB converges linearly to the global optimum at a faster rate.\nBu et al.  established the convergence results of HB and NAG by considering their limiting ODE from a continuous perspective.\nNonetheless, their analysis is asymptotic and far from practice because they use the infinitesimal learning rate and the approximation of Dirac delta function.\nIn contrast, our analysis focuses on the discrete-time situation and yields a non-asymptotic convergence rate of NAG with a finite learning rate, which is close to the reality. Furthermore, some researchers applied optimal transport theory to analyze the training dynamics of neural networks in the mean field setting  , where the evolution of the parameter can be approximated by a distributional dynamics.\nHowever, their results are limited to (stochastic) GD.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: first-order methods, NAG obtains the optimal rate 𝒪​(1/t2)𝒪1superscript𝑡2\\mathcal{O}(1/t^{2}) for convex problem with Lipschitz gradient .\nFocusing on non-smooth convex problems, Tao et al. [ref]29 proved that NAG improves the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent by a factor log⁡(t)𝑡\\log(t).\nIn contrast, Lessard et al.  found a counterexample that HB may fail to find the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
