      "content": "Paper Title: Random Walk on Multiple Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNetworks (graphs) are natural representations of relational data in the real world, with vertices modeling entities and edges describing relationships among entities. With the rapid growth of information, a large volume of network data is generated, such as social networks¬†, author collaboration networks¬†, document citation networks¬†, and biological networks¬†.\nIn many emerging applications, different types of vertices and relationships are obtained from different sources, which can be better modeled by multiple networks. There are two main kinds of multiple networks. Fig.¬†1 shows an example of multiple networks with the same node set and different types of edges (which are called multiplex networks¬†  or multi-layer networks). Each node represents an employee of a university¬†. These three networks reflect different relationships between employees: co-workers, lunch-together, and Facebook-friends. Notice that more similar connections exist between two offline networks (i.e., co-worker and lunch-together) than that between offline and online relationships (i.e., Facebook-friends). Fig.¬†2 is another example from the DBLP dataset with multiple domains of nodes and edges (which is called multi-domain networks¬† ). The left part is the author-collaboration network and the right part is the paper-citation network. A cross-edge connecting an author and a paper indicates that the author writes the paper. We see that authors and papers in the same research field may have dense cross-links. Multiplex networks are a special case of multi-domain networks with the same set of nodes and the cross-network relations are one-to-one mappings. Given a starting node in a graph, we randomly move to one of its neighbors; then we move to a neighbor of the current node at random etc,. This process is called random walk on the graph¬†.\nRandom walk is an effective and widely used method to explore the local structures in networks, which serves as the basis of many advanced tasks such as network embedding¬† [ref]15 [ref]46 [ref]47, link prediction¬†, node/graph classification¬† , and graph generation¬†. Various extensions, such as the random walk with restart (RWR)¬†, second-order random walk¬†, and multi-walker chain¬† have been proposed to analyze the network structure. Despite the encouraging progress, most existing random walk methods focus on a single network merely. Some methods merge the multiple networks as a single network by summation and then apply traditional random walk. However, these methods neglect types of edges and nodes and assume that all layers have the same effect, which may be too restrictive in most scenarios. To this end, in this study, we propose a novel random walk method, ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM} (Random Walk on Multiple networks), to explore local structures in multiple networks. The key idea is to integrate complementary influences from multiple networks.\nWe send out a random walker on each network to explore the network topology based on corresponding transition probabilities.\nFor networks containing the starting node, the probability vectors of walkers are initiated with the starting node. For other networks, probability vectors are initialized by transiting visiting probability via cross-connections among networks. Then probability vectors of the walkers are updated step by step. The vectors represent walkers‚Äô visiting histories. Intuitively, if two walkers share similar or relevant visiting histories (measured by cosine similarity and transited with cross-connections), it indicates that the visited local typologies in corresponding networks are relevant. And these two walkers should reinforce each other with highly weighted influences. On the other hand, if visited local typologies of two walkers are less relevant, smaller weights should be assigned. We update each walker‚Äôs visiting probability vector by aggregating other walkers‚Äô influences at each step. In this way, the transition probabilities of each network are modified dynamically. Compared to traditional random walk models where the transition matrix is time-independent¬† 7 2 4 3, ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM} can restrict most visiting probability in the local subgraph w.r.t. the starting node, in each network and ignore irrelevant or noisy parts. Theoretically, we provide rigorous analyses of the convergence properties of the proposed model. Two speeding-up strategies are developed as well. We conduct extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM} model on effectiveness and efficiency for local community detection, link prediction, and network embedding in multiple networks. Our contributions are summarized as follows. We propose a novel random walk model, ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM}, on multiple networks, which serves as a basic tool to analyze multiple networks. Fast estimation strategies and sound theoretical foundations are provided to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM}. Results of comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real multiple networks verify the advances of ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨ùñ±ùñ∂ùñ¨\\mathsf{RWM}.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: random walk on the graph¬†.\nRandom walk is an effective and widely used method to explore the local structures in networks, which serves as the basis of many advanced tasks such as network embedding¬† [ref]15 [ref]46 [ref]47, link prediction¬†, node/graph classification¬† , and graph generation¬†.
