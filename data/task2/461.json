      "content": "Paper Title: Content and Context Features for Scene Image Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the SVM classification performance of our three types of features - tag-based context features (T​F𝑇𝐹TF), deep content features (D​F=F​F+B​F𝐷𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐵𝐹DF=FF+BF) and fusion of context and content features (C​C​F𝐶𝐶𝐹CCF), with the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods including traditional CV-based methods, deep learning-based methods and tag-based methods. We present the accuracy numbers of all contending measures on MIT-67, Scene-15, and Event-8 in three separate Tables 2, 3 and 4, respectively. For existing methods, we simply present the accuracies reported in corresponding published papers. In Table 2, we present the classification accuracies of all contending methods on the MIT-67 dataset. We compare our features with different types of previous methods: 777 traditional CV-based methods, 999 deep learning-based methods and 666 tag-based methods. Our tag-based context features (T​F𝑇𝐹TF) outperform all existing traditional CV-based methods and existing tag-based features, by at least 27%percent2727\\% and 0.6%percent0.60.6\\%, respectively.\nOur features produce competitive results to many state-of-the-art deep content-based features. Our deep features (D​F=F​F+B​F𝐷𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐵𝐹DF=FF+BF) based on background and foreground information surpass all contending deep features by at least 1.5%percent1.51.5\\% except HDF method. The fusion of the two types of features (C​C​F𝐶𝐶𝐹CCF) further boost the performance by 5.3%percent5.35.3\\% aga t recent second best method (HDF [ref]42)\nand leads to the classification accuracy of 87.3%percent87.387.3\\%. Table 3 summarizes the classification accuracies on the Scene-15 dataset. For comparison with existing methods, we choose 666 traditional CV-based methods, 555 deep learning-based methods and 666 tag-based methods. Our context (T​F𝑇𝐹TF) features outperform all existing tag-based context features and some traditional CV-based methods, but they perform worse than other traditional CV-based and deep learning-based content features. Our deep features (D​F𝐷𝐹DF) surpass all existing tag-based, traditional CV-based and deep features except EISR  which is slightly higher than our D​F𝐷𝐹DF by 1%percent11\\%. As a result, the fusion of our context and content-based features (C​C​F𝐶𝐶𝐹CCF) exceed the best existing method (EISR ) by about 1%percent11\\%. In Table 4, we list the accuracies of contending feature extraction methods on Event-8. We select 444 traditional CV-based methods, 555 deep learning-based methods and 666 tag-based methods.\nThe results show that our context feature (T​F𝑇𝐹TF) outperforms all existing methods except ResNet1522, whereas our deep content features (D​F𝐷𝐹DF) outperform them all. The fusion of T​F𝑇𝐹TF and D​F𝐷𝐹DF (C​C​F𝐶𝐶𝐹CCF) generates the best result, which surpasses the best existing method, ResNet152 2 by more than 1%percent11\\%. To summarise, our context features (T​F𝑇𝐹TF) outperform existing context features on all three datasets, and our deep content features (D​F𝐷𝐹DF) produce generally better (with an exception of EISR  on Scene15). However, by simply fusing the two types (context and content) of features (C​C​F𝐶𝐶𝐹CCF), we achieve the best results in all datasets with the margin of 0.9%percent0.90.9\\% to 5.3%percent5.35.3\\% over the best existing methods. It shows that fusing context information with the content information can better differentiate images of different classes. It adds more value (more than 5%percent55\\% improvement in the classification accuracy) on the MIT-67 dataset, the largest dataset in our research involving lots of ambiguities between classes with inter-class similarity and intra-class dissimilarity. It is interesting to note that all three best existing methods – CNN-LSTM  (MIT-67), EISR  (Scene-15) and ResNet-152 2 (Event-8), have greater features sizes, which is one major problem in many existing methods as well. For instance, CNN-LSTM \nhas the feature size of 4,096-D on the MIT-67 dataset. Similarly, EISR  has an extremely higher dimensional features size, which is greater than 50×2,04850204850\\times 2,048-D after concatenation with the the tag-based features. Finally, ResNet-152 2 yields a feature size of 2,04820482,048-D, which is the average pooling layer of ResNet-152 and it is just the second best existing method on the Event-8 dataset.\nIn terms of the size of our features, we have the least features size than all other features. The size of our fused features (C​C​F𝐶𝐶𝐹CCF) on the MIT-67, Scene-15 and Event-8 are 1,53615361,536-D, <811absent811<811-D and <475absent475<475-D, respectively. The features size of images on the Scene-15 and Event-8 is not fixed because we used 101010 sets of train/test splits for each dataset and each set in the corresponding dataset has varied length of filter words, thus leading to varied sizes of tag-based context features. This impacts the final features size.\nAlso, the features size reduction through PCA to match the smallest size assists to decrease the final features size. Thus, our features size is significantly lower than existing methods’ features size. Despite this, our features can still enable better classification performance than existing methods, since our fused features account for both context and content information.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: by at least 1.5%percent1.51.5\\% except HDF method. The fusion of the two types of features (C​C​F𝐶𝐶𝐹CCF) further boost the performance by 5.3%percent5.35.3\\% aga t recent second best method (HDF [ref]42)\nand leads to the classification accuracy of 87.3%percent87.387.3\\%.
