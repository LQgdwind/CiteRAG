Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Since training very deep networks became feasible , the trend has changed to adapting deeper models and transferring knowledge from large scale image datasets (e.g. Imagenet[ref]15)  . The contribution of the existing methods mainly vary depending on the problematic part they propose to solve. For example,  focus on addressing misalignment in person bounding boxes. In  multi-scale feature learning is adapted to include information about the small details at representation level.  and 0 aim to improve the metric learning approach by defining a structured loss and hard mining strategy, respectively. In 1, the goal is to optimize the final ranking by utilizing similarity and dissimilarity ranking aggregations of two baseline models. In 2, a dynamic graph matching framework is designed to estimate cross-camera labels from unsupervised data. 3 aims at obtaining a more consistent similarity metric by adopting conditional random fields for integrating group similarity constraints.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: The pioneering works for deep person ReID designed custom and relatively shallow networks [ref]13.
