Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: PerceiverS: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA key factor in generating production-quality music lies in the selection of datasets. The Maestro dataset , consisting of real human performances, offers dynamic and expressive recording music. Datasets recorded from live performances are rare, but there are quite a few Automatic Music Transcription (ATM) datasets, including GiantMIDI , ATEPP , PiJAMA [ref]10, and others. Advanced models have been developed, from Hawthorne  to Kong , that convert audio into MIDI files. These advances have made it possible to use a vast amount of recorded audio music to train models, as the development of symbolic music models has long been constrained by the limited availability of datasets. Manually created MIDI datasets, like LAKH , provide valuable human-annotated information, e.g., beats, bars, and phrases, which allows for flexible segmentation and richer feature extraction but lack expressive nuances found in live performances, such as dynamics, tempo variations, and subtle timing shifts. Other attempts, such as ASAP [ref]13 with human-assisted beat correction, and advancements in automatic beat tracking, such as Beat This! [ref]14, aim to bring annotation to live-recorded datasets, though accuracy limitations still present challenges.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: and expressive recording music.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
