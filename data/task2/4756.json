      "content": "Paper Title: Movement Analytics: Current Status, Application to Manufacturing, and Future Prospects from an AI Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStatistical Relational Learning (SRL) is a research area that is concerned with domain models that exhibit both uncertainty and complex, relational structure. It utilizes first-order logic, for modeling relational structure, and probabilistic methods, mainly graphical methods such as Bayes networks and Markov networks, for probabilistic inference and learning.\nWhat separates SRL from \"non-relational\" learning algorithms, e.g., decision trees,\nsupport vector machines, Bayesian networks,\nis their ability to take the relationship between the individuals as well as their internal structure into account. As¬†Koller and Friedman [ref]126 explain under the\nnotion of template models, SRL\nsupports more complex modeling than is possible with a fixed set of propositional\nvariables. In a temporal setting, for example, one can express general rules for how\nsystem state distributions evolve over time, which then can be applied to individuals\n(e.g., current battery charge as a function of battery capacity and aggregated usage). In a non-temporal\nsetting, they can express general rules or relations that apply to all or certain classes\nof individuals (minimum battery capacity by\nvehicle type and mission requirements) or combined. Sometimes these relationships can be\ndiscovered automatically (learning) or the can be given as background knowledge for the\npurpose of informing learning and/or probabilistic inference. As an early application example,¬†Natarajan et¬†al.  used SRL for mining non-obvious statistical dependencies in health record databases for patient risk assessment.\nApplications of SRL methods for object tracking have been developed by Limketkai et¬†al.  and by Nitti et¬†al. . The books by Koller and Friedman [ref]126 and by Raedt et¬†al.  are\ncomprehensive introductory texts and overviews (the latter with a focus on probabilistic\nlogic programming) covering SRL languages and semantics, probabilistic inference, and parameter and structural learning. In the following we briefly summarize some of the main approaches to SRL with relevance to movement analytics. Relational Dynamic Bayes Networks¬† generalize dynamic Bayes networks (see Section 2.2.3) to relational data. Relational properties are to be specified with first-order logic. The formulas are interpreted on probabilistic facts whose distributions are presented in a certain way (first-order probability trees).\nVlasselaer et¬†al.  express Relational Dynamic Bayes Networks as a probabilistic logic program. They argue for better scaling behavior by exploiting structure. Markov Logic Networks¬† combine Markov\nnetworks and first-order logic by\nattaching probabilities to first-order formulas, similar to¬†Nilsson .\nAn Markov Logic Network program LùêøL is a set of pairs L=(Fi,wi)ùêøsubscriptùêπùëñsubscriptùë§ùëñL=(F_{i},w_{i})\nwhere FisubscriptùêπùëñF_{i} is a formula and wisubscriptùë§ùëñw_{i} is a real number representing its weight.\nPositive/negative weights increase/decrease probability\nthat the formula holds true in a world. Formulas act as templates, i.e., under a finite Herband semantics, thus allowing reduction to Markov Networks.\n(A Markov network is similar to a Bayesian network in its representation of dependencies, the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic, whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic.)\nSee  for a more recent overview article. Probabilistic logic programs (PLPs) are logic programs extended with\nfacilities to express probabilistic facts or conclusions. Roughly speaking, traditional logic programs¬† generally consist of if-then rules and atomic facts. The rules typically contain variables for the elements of the domain of interest. Rules act as templates then. Rule conclusions can be disjunctive, or not, and the conditions can use ‚Äúdefault negation‚Äù for enabling a closed-world semantics. Facts are statements of unconditional truths. The main reasoning tasks are query answering, akin to database query answering, and model computation. Model computation means to extend the given facts to an interpretation that also satisfies the relations defined by the rules (‚Äúmodel‚Äù). These tasks require computationally rather different methods and are typically used for rather different purposes, giving rise to corresponding sub-paradigms. In PLPs, facts are equipped with probabilities. A PLP then induces a joint distribution over all predicates (relations) according to the (generally accepted) distribution semantics¬†. Reasoning services include computing joint distributions, marginalizing, and query answering (posteriors). Some PLP languages are rather general and can express, e.g., Bayes networks, (hidden) Markov models, and Dynamic Bayes Networks.\nSee also Section¬†2.2.3 for Dynamic Bayes Networks and their expressivity. An advanced implementation of PLP is the ProbLog system¬† .\nRiguzzi and Swift  provide an overview over probabilistic logic programming. In Section¬†2.5.4 we return to logic programming\ncombined with ML. Lifted Inference¬† is a term that characterizes\nmethods that aim at inference directly at the first-order logic level, rather than through\nexhaustive instantiation (cf.¬†Markov Logic Networks above, or the ‚Äúweighted model counting‚Äù approach by\nGogate and Domingos ). The quantifiers of first-order logic enable reasoning with collections of\nindividuals as a whole, which can be much more efficient (and general) than reasoning on the individual level. Riguzzi et¬†al.  provide a survey of lifted inference for probabilistic logic programming. Learning.\nAll of the above approaches support ‚Äúlearning‚Äù in one way or the other.\nParameter learning in context of probabilistic logic programming, for instance, means learning the probabilities attached to facts. This can be done, for instance, with Monte-Carlo simulations and gradient descent optimization. Structural learning means learning a logic program. The underlying area of inductive logic programming is among the most traditional ones in ML.\nMuggleton and de¬†Raedt  and\nDe¬†Raedt and Kersting  provide overviews.\nIt has gained renewed interest in conjunction with knowledge graphs, see below. Belle  provides a brief but in-depth overview of issues and options around combining logic and learning.\n\nReference markers found: [126]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]126: decision trees,\nsupport vector machines, Bayesian networks,\nis their ability to take the relationship between the individuals as well as their internal structure into account.

In a temporal setting, for example, one can\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
