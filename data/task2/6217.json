      "content": "Paper Title: Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Dual Expectile-Quantile Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantile regression has been used for distributional RL in many previous studies [ref]7 [ref]8  where a parameterized quantile function 𝒬Zθ​(s,a,α)superscriptsubscript𝒬𝑍𝜃𝑠𝑎𝛼\\mathcal{Q}_{Z}^{\\theta}(s,a,\\alpha) is trained using a quantile temporal difference loss function derived from Eq. 4:222In practice, the original quantile loss is often replaced by a smooth Huber loss, but we omit it for simplicity. where the trainable quantile values qi=𝒬Zθ​(s,a,αi)subscript𝑞𝑖superscriptsubscript𝒬𝑍𝜃𝑠𝑎subscript𝛼𝑖q_{i}=\\mathcal{Q}_{Z}^{\\theta}(s,a,\\alpha_{i}) are obtained by querying the quantile function at various quantile fractions αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i}, which can be fixed by the designer [ref]8, sampled from a distribution [ref]7, or learned during training . In quantile-based temporal difference (QTD), the target samples zjsubscript𝑧𝑗z_{j} can be obtained by querying the estimated quantile function at the next state-action pair: zj=r+γ​𝒬Zθ​(s′,a′,αj)subscript𝑧𝑗𝑟𝛾superscriptsubscript𝒬𝑍𝜃superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′subscript𝛼𝑗z_{j}=r+\\gamma\\mathcal{Q}_{Z}^{\\theta}(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime},\\alpha_{j}).333We can have a′∼π(⋅∣s′)a^{\\prime}\\sim\\pi(\\cdot\\mid s^{\\prime}), as in actor-critic algorithms, or a′=arg⁡maxa⁡𝒬Zθ​(s′,a,αj)superscript𝑎′subscript𝑎superscriptsubscript𝒬𝑍𝜃superscript𝑠′𝑎subscript𝛼𝑗a^{\\prime}=\\arg\\max_{a}\\mathcal{Q}_{Z}^{\\theta}(s^{\\prime},a,\\alpha_{j}) as in Q-learning. This section is agnostic to that choice but we refer to  for convergence analysis in the latter case. Indeed, because the true quantile function is the inverse CDF of the action-value distribution, Dabney et al. [ref]8 and Bellemare et al.  showed that quantiles at equidistant fractions minimize the 111-Wasserstein distance with the action-value distribution and that the resulting projected Bellman operator is a contraction mapping in such a distance. Rowland et al. 1 extended these results to prove the convergence of QTD learning under mild assumptions. We refer to these studies for a more detailed convergence analysis. In contrast, expectile-based temporal difference (ETD) does not allow the same update rule as the one given by Eq. 7. We first write the generic ETD loss derived from Eq. 5: with ei=ℰZθ​(s,a,τi)subscript𝑒𝑖superscriptsubscriptℰ𝑍𝜃𝑠𝑎subscript𝜏𝑖e_{i}=\\mathcal{E}_{Z}^{\\theta}(s,a,\\tau_{i}). Here, choosing zj=r+γ​ℰZθ​(s′,a′,τj)subscript𝑧𝑗𝑟𝛾superscriptsubscriptℰ𝑍𝜃superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′subscript𝜏𝑗z_{j}=r+\\gamma\\mathcal{E}_{Z}^{\\theta}(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime},\\tau_{j}), analogously to QTD and non-distributional TD, would cause the update to approximate a different distribution because the expectile function is in general not the inverse CDF of the return distribution. Rowland et al. 0 formalized this idea using the concept of Bellman closedness, i.e., that the Bellman operator yields the same statistics whether it is applied to the target distribution or to the implicit distribution given by statistics of the target distribution (i.e., in our case a mixture of diracs with locations given by quantiles or expectiles). They showed that quantiles are approximately Bellman closed, while expectiles are not. In practice, one may observe that with the naive approach, every estimated expectile collapses to the mean after multiple updates 0, as we can show that, e.g., the expectile function of a Gaussian distribution is another Gaussian distribution with the same mean and a strictly lower variance . Rowland et al. 0 yield a well-behaved update by adding an imputation step that consists in generating samples zjsubscript𝑧𝑗z_{j} of the target distribution from estimated expectiles ejsubscript𝑒𝑗e_{j}, which requires solving a root-finding problem. This approach becomes extremely slow as we increase the number of estimated expectiles, rendering it unusable at scale.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Quantile regression has been used for distributional RL in many previous studies [ref]7 [ref]8  where a parameterized quantile function 𝒬Zθ​(s,a,α)superscriptsubscript𝒬𝑍𝜃𝑠𝑎𝛼\\mathcal{Q}_{Z}^{\\theta}(s,a,\\alpha) is trained using a quantile temporal difference loss function derived\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
