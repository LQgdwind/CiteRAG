Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fast and scalable neuroevolution deep learning architecture search for multivariate anomaly detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe selected relevant time series datasets, including the Secure Water Treatment Dataset (SWAT) , the Water Distribution dataset (WADI) [ref]34, the Mars Science Laboratory Rover dataset (MSL), and the Soil Moisture Active Passive Satellite dataset (SMAP) . All datasets either involve data gathered in real environments (MSL and SMAP) or carefully prepared testbeds reflecting existing systems (SWAT and WADI). The datasets contain anomalies resulting from either device malfunctions or external malicious activity. It is noteworthy that the chosen datasets are popular benchmarks used in many recent studies.\nFor all datasets, a clear separation in training and testing sets is provided. Training data contains clean conditions of the process without anomalies, whereas testing data contains both normal data and anomalies. As a result, our models are exclusively trained on normal data, without anomalies. Both training and testing data are processed in windows, according to the value of window size (in channels in the Conv1D layer) chosen during model optimization. Statistics about datasets characteristics are shown in Table 1. While the SWAT and WADI datasets contain one continuous data stream, SMAP and MSL are more complex and they are split into smaller subsets called entities. We concatenate data from these subsets for the evolution of subspaces and models. Following this idea, to better fit specific data characteristics of entities, we build subspaces separately for each entity, and then train and fine-tune separate models. The final result is calculated as the concatenation of the results from each entity. During prediction time, we choose the model corresponding to the particular entity of the source that generated the data instance.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: We selected relevant time series datasets, including the Secure Water Treatment Dataset (SWAT) , the Water Distribution dataset (WADI) [ref]34, the Mars Science Laboratory Rover dataset (MSL), and the Soil Moisture Active Passive Satellite dataset (SMAP) .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
