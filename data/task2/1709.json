      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Grained Complexity and Algorithms for the Schulze Voting MethodA previous version of this work appears in EC 2021 [44]. In this version we strengthen Theorem 6.2 which now holds also for the problem of finding a Schulze winner.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile we were able to achieve an essentially optimal 𝒪~​(m2)~𝒪superscript𝑚2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(m^{2}) time algorithm for finding all winners when given a weighted majority graph, computing the weighted majority graph itself seems more expensive.\nThe fastest algorithm comes from our simple reduction to Dominance Product, resulting in a running time of 𝒪~​(n​m(1+ω)/2+n(2​ω−4)/(ω−1)​m2)~𝒪𝑛superscript𝑚1𝜔2superscript𝑛2𝜔4𝜔1superscript𝑚2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(nm^{(1+\\omega)/2}+n^{(2\\omega-4)/(\\omega-1)}m^{2}), or very slightly faster if ω>2𝜔2\\omega>2 and one uses fast rectangular matrix multiplication.555If ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2, using rectangular matrix multiplication gives no improvement. Typically, the number of voters n𝑛n is no smaller than the number of candidates m𝑚m.\nIn this case, the running time for computing the majority graph using our reduction to Dominance Product is at least Ω​(m2.5)Ωsuperscript𝑚2.5\\Omega(m^{2.5}), regardless of the value of ω𝜔\\omega.\nThus, if the input to the Schulze winner problem is not the weighted majority graph, but the preference profile, then the Ω​(m2.5)≫m2much-greater-thanΩsuperscript𝑚2.5superscript𝑚2\\Omega(m^{2.5})\\gg m^{2} running time for computing the weighted majority graph is a significant bottleneck. This leads to the following questions: Can one compute the weighted majority graph in 𝒪~​(m2)~𝒪superscript𝑚2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(m^{2}) time, or at least in 𝒪​(m2.5−ε)𝒪superscript𝑚2.5𝜀\\mathcal{O}(m^{2.5-\\varepsilon}) time for some ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0? If not, can a winner be found in 𝒪​(m2.5−ε)𝒪superscript𝑚2.5𝜀\\mathcal{O}(m^{2.5-\\varepsilon}) time for some ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, given the preference profile, potentially without computing the weighted majority graph explicitly? We address the above questions through the lens of fine-grained complexity (see the surveys  ).\nThe main goal of fine-grained complexity is to relate seemingly different problems via fine-grained reductions, hopefully proving equivalences.\nIn recent years there has been an explosion of results in fine-grained complexity, showing that a large variety of problems are fine-grained reducible to each other.\nSometimes fine-grained results can be viewed as hardness results, in the sense that a running time improvement for a problem can be considered unlikely.\nFine-grained equivalences are especially valuable, as they often establish strong connections between seemingly unrelated problems. For running time functions a​(n)𝑎𝑛a(n) and b​(n)𝑏𝑛b(n) for inputs of size (or measure666In fact, in fine-grained complexity the running time is sometimes measured in terms of a different measure than the input size.\nFor instance, the running time of graph problems is often measured in terms of the number of vertices instead of the true size of the graph which is in terms of the number of vertices and edges.)\nn𝑛n, we say that there is an (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b)-fine-grained reduction from a problem A𝐴A and to a problem B𝐵B if for every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 there is a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 and an algorithm that runs in 𝒪​(a​(n)1−δ)𝒪𝑎superscript𝑛1𝛿\\mathcal{O}(a(n)^{1-\\delta}) time and solves a size n𝑛n instance of problem A𝐴A using oracle calls to problem B𝐵B of sizes n1,…,nksubscript𝑛1…subscript𝑛𝑘n_{1},\\ldots,n_{k} so that ∑j=1kb​(nj)1−ε≤a​(n)1−δsuperscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑘𝑏superscriptsubscript𝑛𝑗1𝜀𝑎superscript𝑛1𝛿\\sum_{j=1}^{k}b(n_{j})^{1-\\varepsilon}\\leq a(n)^{1-\\delta}.\nIn other words, any improvement in the exponent over the 𝒪​(b​(n))𝒪𝑏𝑛\\mathcal{O}(b(n)) runtime for B𝐵B on inputs of size n𝑛n can be translated to an improvement in the exponent over the 𝒪​(a​(n))𝒪𝑎𝑛\\mathcal{O}(a(n)) runtime for A𝐴A. We relate questions (1) and (2) above to the complexity of the aforementioned Dominance Product problem and its relative Dominating Pairs.\nThese problems have been studied within both algorithms (e.g.  ) and fine-grained complexity (e.g.  [ref]28). In the Dominance Product problem we are given two r×r𝑟𝑟r\\times r matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B and we want to compute for every pair i,j∈[r]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑟i,j\\in[r] the number of k∈[r]𝑘delimited-[]𝑟k\\in[r] for which A​[i,k]≤B​[k,j]𝐴𝑖𝑘𝐵𝑘𝑗A[i,k]\\leq B[k,j].\nIn the Dominating Pairs problem we are also given two r×r𝑟𝑟r\\times r matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B, but we now want to decide whether there exists a pair i,j∈[r]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑟i,j\\in[r] such that for all k∈[r]𝑘delimited-[]𝑟k\\in[r], A​[i,k]≤B​[k,j]𝐴𝑖𝑘𝐵𝑘𝑗A[i,k]\\leq B[k,j].\nIn other words, we want to decide whether the Dominance Product of A𝐴A and B𝐵B contains an entry of value r𝑟r. Both problems can be solved using the aforementioned 𝒪~​(r(3+ω)/2)~𝒪superscript𝑟3𝜔2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(r^{(3+\\omega)/2}) time algorithm by Matoušek .\nIf ω>2𝜔2\\omega>2, a slightly faster algorithm is possible using fast rectangular matrix multiplication , as shown by Yuster .\nThese running times are minimized at 𝒪~​(r2.5)~𝒪superscript𝑟2.5\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(r^{2.5}) (in the case that ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2). We prove an equivalence between Dominance Product and the problem of computing the weighted majority graph, given a preference profile for the special case of n𝑛n voters and m=𝒪​(n)𝑚𝒪𝑛m=\\mathcal{O}(n) candidates.\nNote that even m=n𝑚𝑛m=n is a natural case—when a group of voters chooses a winner among themselves. If there exists a T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n) time algorithm for computing the weighted majority graph when there are n𝑛n voters and 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) candidates, then there is an 𝒪​(T​(r)+r2​log⁡r)𝒪𝑇𝑟superscript𝑟2𝑟\\mathcal{O}(T(r)+r^{2}\\log r) time algorithm for computing the Dominance Product of two r×r𝑟𝑟r\\times r matrices.\nIf there is a T​(r)𝑇𝑟T(r) time algorithm for computing the Dominance Product of two r×r𝑟𝑟r\\times r matrices, then one can compute the weighted majority graph for n𝑛n voters and 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) candidates in 𝒪​(T​(n))𝒪𝑇𝑛\\mathcal{O}(T(n)) time. First notice that since the matrices in the Dominance Product themselves have sizes 𝒪​(r2)𝒪superscript𝑟2\\mathcal{O}(r^{2}), the 𝒪​(r2​log⁡r)𝒪superscript𝑟2𝑟\\mathcal{O}(r^{2}\\log r) running time in the first part of the theorem is necessary, up to the log⁡r𝑟\\log r factor.\nThe first part of the theorem is proven in Theorem 6.1 and the second part follows from our simple observation described in Proposition 3.1. As the r2.5−o​(1)superscript𝑟2.5𝑜1r^{2.5-o(1)} time bottleneck for solving Dominance Product and even Dominating Pairs has remained unchallenged for 30 years, it is believed that the two problems require r2.5−o​(1)superscript𝑟2.5𝑜1r^{2.5-o(1)} time (see, e.g., [ref]28).\nDue to Theorem 6.1 (in which m=2​n𝑚2𝑛m=2n), we get that it would likely be very challenging to obtain an 𝒪​(m2.5−ε)𝒪superscript𝑚2.5𝜀\\mathcal{O}(m^{2.5-\\varepsilon}) time algorithm for ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 for computing the weighted majority graph, even if ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2. We have shown that constructing the weighted majority graph is likely an expensive task.\nIt could still be, however, that one can find a winner without explicitly constructing the weighted majority graph, as per our question (2) above.\nOur final result relates question (2) to the Dominating Pairs problem: Suppose that there is an 𝒪​(T​(n))𝒪𝑇𝑛\\mathcal{O}(T(n)) time algorithm that, given n𝑛n voters with preferences over 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) candidates, can test whether a given candidate is a winner (or can find an arbitrary winner) of the Schulze method.\nThen there is an 𝒪​(T​(r)+r2​log⁡r)𝒪𝑇𝑟superscript𝑟2𝑟\\mathcal{O}(T(r)+r^{2}\\log r) time algorithm for the Dominating Pairs problem for two r×r𝑟𝑟r\\times r matrices. The theorem above appears as Theorem 6.2 in the body of the paper.\nBecause in the proof we have m=Θ​(n)𝑚Θ𝑛m=\\Theta(n), our result shows that even testing whether a candidate is a winner in 𝒪​(m2.5−ε)𝒪superscript𝑚2.5𝜀\\mathcal{O}(m^{2.5-\\varepsilon}) time for ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 would be a challenge under the plausible hypothesis that Dominating Pairs has no improved algorithms even in the case that ω=2𝜔2\\omega=2.\nUnder this hypothesis, we might as well compute the weighted majority graph and find all winners using Theorem 5.3, as it would take roughly the same time. Our paper is the first to bring fine-grained complexity into the field of computational social choice (see [ref]4  [ref]1 for a description of computational social choice topics).\nRelated areas such as Fixed Parameter Tractability (FPT)777\nWhere some standard assumptions are: FPT≠W​[ref]1FPTWdelimited-[]1\\textsf{FPT}\\neq\\textsf{W}[ref]1 and the Exponential Time Hypothesis.\nFor more about parameterized complexity see, e.g.,  .\nand hardness of approximation888\nHere some standard assumptions are P≠NPPNP\\textsf{P}\\neq\\textsf{NP} , the Unique Games Conjecture , and a recent Gap-Exponential Time Hypothesis .\nhave already gained significant traction in computational social choice.\nSee, e.g., the following surveys on FPT results and further challenges in computational social choice   ,\nand, e.g., the following papers on hardness of approximation in bribery problems ,\nmultiwinner elections     and a survey on fair-division with indivisible goods . While these related areas do discuss running time, they do not focus on the exact running time complexity, and in particular, say nothing about lower bounds for problems that already have fixed polynomial time algorithms.\nBy bringing fine-grained complexity into the picture we can identify which voting protocols have potentially practical algorithms, and those whose complexity is, say at least cubic, and hence are likely impractical for large numbers of candidates and/or voters. Our results provide reductions and equivalences that are even tighter than typical fine-grained reductions, in that the running times are preserved up to small additive terms and constant multiplicative factors.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the complexity of the aforementioned Dominance Product problem and its relative Dominating Pairs.\nThese problems have been studied within both algorithms (e.g.  ) and fine-grained complexity (e.g.  [ref]28).
