      "content": "Paper Title: Metapath and Entity-Aware Graph Neural Network for Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGNN is designed for learning on graph structured data   . GNNs employ message passing algorithm to pass messages in an iterative fashion between nodes to update node representation with the underlying graph structure.\nAn additional pooling layer is typically used to extract graph representation for graph-level tasks, e.g., graph classification or clustering.\nDue to its superior performance on graphs, GNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance on node classification , graph representation learning  and RSs .\nIn the task of RSs, relations such as user-item interactions and user-item features can be presented as multi-typed edges in the graphs.\nSeverel recent works have proposed GNNs to solve recommendation tasks 7 6 .\nNGCF 7 embeds bipartite graphs of users and items into node representation to capture collaborative signals.\nGCMC  proposed a graph auto-encoder framework, which produces latent features of users and items through a form of differentiable message passing on the user-item graph. KGAT 6 proposed a knowledge graph based attentive propagation, which enhances the node features by modeling high-order connectivity information.\nMulti-GCCF 3 explicitly incorporates multiple graphs in the embedding learning process and consider the intrinsic difference between user nodes and item nodes in performing graph convolution. Prior to GNNs, several efforts have been established to\nexplicitly guide the recommender learning with\nmetapaths  4 . Heitmann et al.  utilized linked data from heterogeneous data source to enhance collaborative filtering for the cold-start problem.\nSun et al. 4 converted recommendation tasks to relation prediction problems and tackled it with metapath-based relation reasoning.\nYu et al.  employed matrix factorization framework over meta-path similarity matrices to perform recommendation.\nHu et al.  proposed user- and item-metapath based co-attention to fuse metapath information for recommendation while ignored the inter-metapath interactions. Zhao et al.  fed the semantics encoded by meta-graph in factorization model but neglected the contribution of each individual meta-graph.\nHowever, only a limited number of works attempted to enhance GNNs with metapaths. Two recent works are quite prominent in this regard, MAGNN [ref]10 and MEIRec .\nMAGNN aggregates intra-metapath information for each path instance. But this causes MAGNN to get in the problem of unaffordable memory consumption.\nMEIRec devised a GNN to perform metapath-guided propagation. But MEIRec fails to generalize when no user intent is available and does not distinguish the contribution of metapaths. In contrast to these methods, our method saves computational time and memory by adopting a stepwise information propogation over meta-path aware subgraphs.\nMoreover, PEAGNN employs collaborative subgraph (CSG) to separate semantics introduced by different metapaths and fuses those semantics according to the learned metapath importance, in contrast to existing approaches  [ref]10 .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: neglected the contribution of each individual meta-graph.\nHowever, only a limited number of works attempted to enhance GNNs with metapaths. Two recent works are quite prominent in this regard, MAGNN [ref]10 and MEIRec .\nMAGNN aggregates intra-metapath information for each path instance.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
