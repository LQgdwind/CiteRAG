Consider a movie recommendation system where each user specifies what genres she is interested in, and the system has to provide a representative subset of movies from these genres. Assume that each movie is represented by a vector consisting of users’ ratings for the corresponding movie. One challenge here is that each user does not necessarily rate all the movies, hence, the vectors representing the movies do not necessarily have similar sizes. To overcome this challenge, low-rank matrix completion techniques  can be performed on the matrix with missing values to obtain a complete rating matrix. Formally, given a few ratings from k𝑘k users to n𝑛n movies we obtain in this way a rating matrix 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M} of size k×n𝑘𝑛k\\times n. Following  [ref]27, to score the quality of a selected subset of movies, we use f​(S)=∑u∈𝒩∑v∈Ssu,v−λ​∑u∈S∑v∈Ssu,v.𝑓𝑆subscript𝑢𝒩subscript𝑣𝑆subscript𝑠𝑢𝑣𝜆subscript𝑢𝑆subscript𝑣𝑆subscript𝑠𝑢𝑣f(S)=\\sum_{u\\in\\mathcal{N}}\\sum_{v\\in S}s_{u,v}-\\lambda\\sum_{u\\in S}\\sum_{v\\in S}s_{u,v}\\enspace.\nHere, 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} is the set of n𝑛n movies, λ∈[ref]0 𝜆01\\lambda\\in[ref]0  is a parameter and su,vsubscript𝑠𝑢𝑣s_{u,v} denotes the similarity between movies u𝑢u and v𝑣v (the similarity su,vsubscript𝑠𝑢𝑣s_{u,v} can be calculated based on the matrix 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M} in multiple ways: cosine similarity, inner product, etc). Note that the first term in the definition of f𝑓f captures the coverage, while the second term captures diversity. Thus, the parameter λ𝜆\\lambda denotes the importance of diversity in the returned subset which makes the function non-monotone. Note that for any λ≤0.5𝜆0.5\\lambda\\leq 0.5, f​(S)𝑓𝑆f\\left(S\\right) is monotone . We followed the experimental setup of the prior works  [ref]27 and used a subset of movies from the MovieLens data set 6 which includes 10,4371043710,437 movies. Each movie in this data set is represented by a 252525 dimensional feature vector calculated using user ratings, and we used the inner product similarity to obtain the similarity values su,vsubscript𝑠𝑢𝑣s_{u,v} based on these vectors. In this application, we fixed λ𝜆\\lambda to be 0.75,0.550.750.550.75,0.55, and varied k𝑘k. The results of this experiments are depicted by Figure 1. Our proposed method, Algorithm 3, demonstrates superior performance compared to the other methods, and demonstrate the stability of our algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: missing values to obtain a complete rating matrix.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
