      "content": "Paper Title: T-TAME: Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explaining Convolutional Networks and Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe following state-of-the-art methods are quantitatively compared with the proposed T-TAME, on all three considered backbones, using the evaluation measures described in Section¬†IV-B: Grad-CAM , Grad-CAM++ [ref]13, Score-CAM [ref]21, Ablation-CAM [ref]51, RISE  and Iterated Integrated Attributions (IIA) .\nAdditionally, we compare with L-CAM-Img  and Transformer Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) , only on CNN and Transformer backbones, respectively (because L-CAM-Img and Transformer LRP are only applicable to these specific backbones). These methods are selected because they are among the top-performing methods in the visual XAI domain and their source code is publicly available. For Grad-CAM , Grad-CAM++ [ref]13, Score-CAM [ref]21, Ablation-CAM [ref]51, we use the implementations of the pytorch_gradcam library . For RISE  and Iterated Integrated Attributions (IIA)  we use the original implementations available at https://github.com/eclique/RISE and https://github.com/iia-iccv23/iia, respectively.\nFor L-CAM-Img , which is only applicable to CNN backbones, we use the original implementation, available at https://github.com/bmezaris/L-CAM. Finally, for the Transformer Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method , which is only applicable to ViT backbones, we use the original implementation, available at https://github.com/hila-chefer/Transformer-Explainability. The results in terms of the AD‚Äã(v)ADùë£\\text{AD}(v) and IC‚Äã(v)ICùë£\\text{IC}(v) measures with v=15%,50%,100%ùë£percent15percent50percent100v=15\\%,50\\%,100\\%\nfor CNN and ViT models are shown in Tables II and III.\nThe respective results for the\nMoRF‚Äã(v)MoRFùë£\\text{MoRF}(v) and LeRF‚Äã(v)LeRFùë£\\text{LeRF}(v) measures are shown in Figs. 8 to 13, where vùë£v varies from 10%percent1010\\% to 90%percent9090\\%.\nIn order to acquire a single value for each ROAD measure, model, and examined explainability method, we also compute the average confidence score across all percentages vùë£v described above; these results are presented in Tables IV and V. In all tables, for each comparison (i.e., each row), the best and second-best results are shown in bold and underline.\nFrom the obtained results, we observe the following: For the CNN backbones, T-TAME generally provides the best performance. Specifically, in the case of the VGG-16 backbone, for the AD and IC measures, T-TAME provides the best results for the more challenging v=50%ùë£percent50v=50\\% and v=15%ùë£percent15v=15\\% thresholds and is only outperformed in the less-challenging v=100%ùë£percent100v=100\\% setup by the perturbation-based method RISE, which requires 4000 forward passes to generate a single explanation (thus, being 4000 times more computationally expensive than T-TAME at inference time). In the case of the ResNet-50 backbone, for the AD and IC measures, T-TAME is overall the top-performing method, while being second-best in one instance. In that instance, it is outperformed by the perturbation-based method Score-CAM, which however requires 2048 forward passes (instead of one, for T-TAME) to generate a single explanation. From the averaged ROAD measures of Table¬†IV, in the case of the VGG-16 backbone, we observe that T-TAME achieves the best results w.r.t. the MoRF measure. According to the LeRF measure, it is outperformed only by RISE, as in the case of the AD and IC metrics.\nIn the case of the ResNet-50 backbone, from Table¬†IV and Fig.¬†10 we observe that w.r.t. MoRF, the explanation maps of RISE produce the lowest (i.e., best) average confidence\nbut are overtaken by T-TAME in the higher removal percentages (50% or more, in Fig.¬†10). These results suggest that T-TAME correctly identifies the important regions, but the exact pixel-wise importance ordering is noisy. Additionally, w.r.t. LeRF for this backbone, RISE has the highest average confidence. To explain the LeRF results of T-TAME in the case of ResNet-50, we should recall that LeRF is computed by removing the less important features of the input image, and takes into account only the ordering of pixels according to the explanation map. As can be seen in Fig.¬†14, because of the low-resolution feature maps that are due to the specifics of the ResNet-50 architecture, the produced explanations are overly smooth. While they highlight the important regions of the input image, the ordering of less important pixels is noisy. Since for the computation of the ROAD measures the ordering of pixel importance is the only consideration for their computation, this quality is detrimental. Still, the ability of T-TAME to generate explanation maps in a single forward pass is a significant advantage for practical applications. For the ViT-B-16 backbone, T-TAME is the top-performing method across the board. It performs best for all thresholds of the AD and IC measures. It is the second-best method only in the case of the LeRF measure, being outperformed by RISE, which, in this case, requires 8000 forward passes to generate a single explanation. Moreover, T-TAME outperforms the Transformer-specific LRP-based method. In the case of MoRF, as observed in Fig.¬†12, T-TAME exhibits the overall best performance for all percentages except for the initial v=10%ùë£percent10v=10\\% removal percentage. Particularly for v=30%ùë£percent30v=30\\% to v=70%ùë£percent70v=70\\%, the difference between T-TAME and the second-best method, Transformer LRP, is large. This suggests that, except for the very fine-grained ordering examined in the case of v=10%ùë£percent10v=10\\%, T-TAME correctly identifies the most important pixels for the ViT-B-16 backbone. In the case of LeRF, RISE is initially the top-performing method, being outperformed by T-TAME in the higher removal percentages. This again suggests a more globally correct ordering of importance, with less finely-grained orderings in the lower percentages. Considering that T-TAME requires only one forward pass to compute an explanation, it is significant that it can compete with and in most cases outperform perturbation-based approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: state-of-the-art methods are quantitatively compared with the proposed T-TAME, on all three considered backbones, using the evaluation measures described in Section¬†IV-B: Grad-CAM , Grad-CAM++ [ref]13, Score-CAM [ref]21, Ablation-CAM [ref]51, RISE  and Iterated Integrated Attributions (IIA) .\nAdditionally, we compare with L-CAM-Img  and Transformer Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
