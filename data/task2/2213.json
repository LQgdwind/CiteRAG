      "content": "Paper Title: On the Importance of Environments in Human-Robot Coordination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen humans and robots coordinate well, they time their actions precisely and efficiently and alter their plans dynamically, often in the absence of verbal communication. Evaluation of the quality of coordination has focused not only on task efficiency but on the fluency of the interaction . Fluency refers to how well the actions of the agents are synchronized, resulting in coordinated meshing of joint activities. A closely related, important aspect of human-robot teaming is workload assignment. Human factors research has shown that too light or too heavy workload can affect human performance and situational awareness . The perceived robot’s contribution to the team is a crucial metric of fluency , and human-robot teaming experiments found that the degree to which participants were occupied affected their subjective assessment of the robot as a teammate . To achieve fluent human-robot coordination, previous work  enabled robots to reason over the mental states and actions of their human partners, by building or learning human models and integrating these models into decision making. While the focus has been on the effect of these models on human-robot coordination, little emphasis has been placed on the environment that the team occupies. Our thesis is that changing the environment can result in significant differences between coordination behaviors, even when the robot runs the same coordination algorithm. We thus advocate for considering diverse environments when studying the emergent coordination behaviors of human-robot teams. Manually creating environments that show a diverse range of coordination behaviors requires substantial human effort. Furthermore, as robotic systems become more complex, it becomes hard to predict how these systems will act in different situations and even harder to design environments that elicit a diverse range of behaviors. This highlights the need for a systematic approach for generating environments. Thus, we propose a framework for automatic environment generation, drawing upon insights from the field of procedural content generation in games [ref]41 [ref]16 .\nThe framework automatically generates environments which (1) share design similarities to human-authored environments provided as training data, (2) are guaranteed to be solvable by the human-robot team, and (3) result in coordination behaviors that differ according to provided metrics (i.e. team fluency or workload). In this paper, we study our framework in the collaborative game Overcooked , an increasingly popular domain for researching the coordination of agent behaviors. In this domain, a human-robot team must work together to cook and serve food orders in a shared kitchen. In the context of Overcooked, our framework generates kitchen environments that cause the human-robot team to behave differently with respect to workload, fluency, or any other specified metric. Fig. 1 provides an overview of our framework. First, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN)  with human-authored kitchens as examples. The GAN learns to generate kitchens that share stylistic similarities to the human-designed kitchens. However, GANs frequently generate kitchens which are, for the human-robot team, impossible to solve. For example, ingredients or the serve station may be unreachable by the agents, or the kitchen may not have a pot.\nTo guarantee the kitchen is solvable, mixed-integer linear programming (MIP)  edits the kitchen with a minimum-cost repair. By guaranteeing domain-specific constraints, the GAN+MIP pipeline forms a generative space of viable kitchens that can be sampled through the latent codes of the GAN. We then search the latent space directly with a state-of-the-art quality diversity algorithm, Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME) [ref]15, to discover kitchens that cause diverse agent behaviors with respect to specified coordination metrics.\nGenerated kitchens are added to an archive organized by the coordination metrics, and feedback from how the archive is populated helps guide CMA-ME towards kitchens with underexplored metric combinations. Evaluation of our framework in simulation shows that the generated environments can affect the coordination of human-robot teams that follow precomputed jointly optimal motion plans, as well as of teams where the robot reasons over partially observable human subtasks. In an online user study, we show that our generated environments result in very different workload distributions and team fluency metrics, even when the robot runs the same algorithm in all environments. Overall, we are excited to highlight the role that environments play in the emergent coordination behaviors of human-robot teams, and to provide a systematic approach for procedurally generating high-quality environments that induce diverse coordination behaviors.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: a systematic approach for generating environments.
