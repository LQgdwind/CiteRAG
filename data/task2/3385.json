      "content": "Paper Title: Grad2Task: Improved Few-shot Text Classification Using Gradients for Task Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer-based pretrained large-scale language models (LMs) have achieved tremendous success on many NLP tasks  [ref]34, but require a large number of in-domain labeled examples for fine-tuning 4.\nOne approach to alleviate that issue is to fine-tune the model on an intermediate (source) task that is related to the target task. While previous work has focused on this setting for a single source task  0, the problem of transferring from a set of source tasks has not been thoroughly considered. Wang et al.  showed that a naïve combination of multiple source tasks may negatively impact target task performance. Additionally, transfer learning methods typically consider the setting where more than a medium (N>100) number of training examples are available for both the source and target tasks. In this work we develop a method to improve a large pre-trained LM for few-shot text classification problems by transferring from multiple source tasks.\nWhile it is possible to directly adapt recent advances in meta-learning developed for few-shot image classification, a unique challenge in the NLP setting is that source tasks do no share the same task structure.\nNamely, on standard few-shot image classification benchmarks, the training tasks are sampled from a “single” larger dataset, and the label space contains the same task structure for all tasks.\nIn contrast, in text classification tasks, the set of source tasks available during training can range from sentiment analysis to grammatical acceptability judgment.\nDifferent source tasks could not only be different in terms of input domain, but also their task structure (i.e. label semantics, and number of output labels).\n This challenging problem requires resistance to overfitting due to its few-shot nature and more task-specific adaptation due to the distinct nature among tasks.\nFine-tuning based approaches are known to suffer from the overfitting issue and approaches like MAML  and prototypical networks (ProtoNet)  were not designed to meta-learn from such a diverse collection of tasks. CNAP , a conditional neural process , explicitly designed for learning from heterogeneous task distributions by adding a task conditional adaptation mechanism is better suited for solving tasks with a shifted task distribution.\nWe design our approach based on the CNAP framework. Compared with CNAP, we use pretrained transformers for text sequence classification instead of convolutional networks for image classification. We insert adapter modules  into a pretrained LM to ensure efficiency and maximal parameter-sharing, and learn to modulate those adapter parameters conditioned on tasks, while CNAP learns to adapt the whole feature extractor. Additionally, we use gradient information for task representation as opposed to average input encoding in CNAP, since gradients can capture information from both input and ouput space. In summary, our main contributions and findings are: We propose the use of gradients as features to represent tasks under a model-based meta-learning framework. The gradient features are used to modulate a base learner for rapid generalization on diverse few-shot text classification tasks. We use pre-trained BERT with adapter modules  as the feature extractor and show that it works better than using only the BERT model on few-shot tasks, while also being more efficient to train as it has much fewer parameters to learn. We compare our approach with traditional fine-tuning, sequential transfer learning, and state-of-the-art meta-learning approaches on a collection of diverse few-shot text classification tasks used in  and three newly added tasks, and show that our approach achieves the best performance.
