      "content": "Paper Title: The Power of Communication in a Distributed Multi-Agent System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCrucial ideas and milestones in RL and MA Learning are the basis for MARL .\nA diversity of fields in research but also industry \nsuch as game theory, distributed systems, and general Artificial Intelligence are interested in MA systems. Games such as GO  [ref]23,\nChess, Poker, but also autonomous driving \nand robotics  \nare popular testbed environments for RL systems. Most of the mentioned environments include multiple agents in competitive or collaborative settings. Therefore MARL systems can be categorised as such or a mix of both .\nCooperative problem solving by teams composed of people and or computers \nrequires collaboration and communication. Both are important sub-fields of research in MARL\n  \nand have a rich historical variety of literature .\nThere have been multiple works on collaboration without communication 0 ,\ni.e. by utilising gradient-based distributed policy search methods 1,\nusing the same reward function for all agents 2,\nsharing memory 3 4 5,\nParameter Sharing (PS)  5,\nLearning with an External Critic (LEC) 6,\nor by action replication based on observation 7, also called Learning By Watching (LBW) 6. While we think establishing the notion of collaboration from a non-communicative perspective is important, communication is the focus of the work presented in this paper. Naturally, communication requires a protocol as well as a mode of information transfer. The medium could be i.e. nonverbal communication 8,\ngesture, colour code, low-level data in the form of binary 9,\ndiscrete or continuous signals, or a text-based, structured communication system, also called language. A communication protocol is a set of rules expressed by algorithms and data structures. Communication protocols can be used to share observations in the form of sensory data  or strategies and planned intentions in the form of gradients 0. Giving agents the freedom to develop and learn their own communication protocol can help solve multi-agent problems and discover elegant communication protocols, stated by Foerster et al. (2016) 0.\nFor communication to become a choice, it must be part of the action space 1.\nSubsequently, communication needs to come at a cost; otherwise, why would the agent choose not to communicate and prevent itself and others from i.e. a richer observation of the environment. In combination with a collective reward function, individual communication holds collective value. This forces agents to carefully balance between observation and sharing information via communication7  2.\nInstead of streaming information, there could be real-world limitations that influence research on communication cost. Resources like bandwidth, a fixed count of broadcasting channels, power used, and the width of the network might constrain communication frequency and information data package size or maybe the number of agents able to simultaneously communicate is restricted 3.\nThere is a social aspect to communication as an individual choice that addresses questions of timing 4 3, importance 2 5, and i.e. agent position-dependent selective communication with nearest neighbours only 4.\nFinally, we want to point to work that assumes constant information broadcasting between all or selected agents. It has been argued that a constant broadcasting can provide the learner with shorter latency feedback and auxiliary sources of the experience 6.\nFoerster et al. proposed Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL) and Differentiable Inter-Agent Learning (DIAL), which use a discrete communication channel 0. CommNet, in contrast, allows for multiple communication cycles at each timestep, which allows for new or existing agents to join or leave the environment at runtime 5.\nWe believe our work could be classified as a decentralised, partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) 6 combined with a message passing 7 communication channel based on a GNN 6. Our strategy for MA collaboration through communication builds on previous work including communication at a cost: 1. By choice, as part of the agentsâ€™ action space 0, and 2. Communication streaming 5.\nThis is coupled with real-world bandwidth constraints, implemented as a nearest neighbour count limitation 4.\nPrior work has investigated RL combined with GNNs 7, but instead of the GNN being the main feedback for the learning agent, our implementation serves as an additional communication layer, not interfering with the environment, rewards or actions. In contrast to Tolstaya et al. (2019) 8, our GNN is trained offline and not modified by the RL training process of the learning agent. Pooled neighbourhood messages of ad hoc graphs 9, dependent on location and nearest neighbour count, predict future wind directions, while the agent learns when to communicate and pay attention to or ignore messages.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: basis for MARL .\nA diversity of fields in research but also industry \nsuch as game theory, distributed systems, and general Artificial Intelligence are interested in MA systems.
