      "content": "Paper Title: Automated Software Verification of Hyperliveness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRelational properties (also called hyperproperties ) move away from a traditional specification that considers all executions of a system in isolation and, instead, relate multiple executions.\nHyperproperties are becoming increasingly important and have shown up in various disciplines, perhaps most prominently in information-flow control.\nAssume we are given a program ℙℙ\\mathbb{P} with high-security input hℎh, low-security input l𝑙l, and public output o𝑜o, and we want to formally prove that the output of ℙℙ\\mathbb{P} does not leak information about hℎh.\nOne way to ensure this is to verify that ℙℙ\\mathbb{P} behaves deterministically in the low-security input l𝑙l, i.e., if the low-security input is identical across two executions, so is ℙℙ\\mathbb{P}’s output. The above property is a typical example of a 222-safety property stating a requirement on all pairs of traces.\nMore generally, a k𝑘k-safety property requires that all k𝑘k-tuples of executions, together, satisfy a given property.\nIn the last decade, many approaches for the verification of k𝑘k-safety properties have been proposed, based, e.g., on model-checking   , abstract interpretation    , symbolic execution , or program logics  6  0 . \n⬇\n@@$o$ = $l$ + $\\star_\\mathbb{N}$\n\nelse\n\n@@$x$ = $\\star_\\mathbb{N}$\n\n@@if ($x$ > $l$) then\n\n@@@@$o$ = $x$\n\n@@else\n\n@@@@$o$ = $l$\n\n\n However, for many relational properties, the implicit universal quantification found in k𝑘k-safety properties is too restrictive.\nConsider the simple program in Figure 1 (taken from [ref]12), where ⋆ℕsubscript⋆ℕ\\star_{\\mathbb{N}} denotes the nondeterministic choice of a natural number.\nThis program clearly violates the 222-safety property discussed above as the nondeterminism influences the final value of o𝑜o.\nNevertheless, the program does not leak any information about the secret input hℎh.\nTo see this, assume the attacker observes some fixed low-security input-output pair (l,o)𝑙𝑜(l,o), i.e., the attacker observes everything except the high-security input.\nThe key observation is that (l,o)𝑙𝑜(l,o) is possible for any possible high-security input, i.e., for every value of hℎh, there exists some way to resolve the nondeterminism such that (l,o)𝑙𝑜(l,o) is the observation made by the attacker.\nThis information-flow policy – called generalized non-interference (GNI)  – requires a combination of universal and existential reasoning and thus cannot be expressed as a k𝑘k-safety property. In this paper, we study the automated verification of such (functional) ∀∗∃∗superscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} properties.\nConcretely, we consider specifications in a form we call Forall-Exist Hoare Tuples (FEHT) (also called refinement quadruples  or RHLE triples ), which have the form where ℙ1,…,ℙk+lsubscriptℙ1…subscriptℙ𝑘𝑙\\mathbb{P}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbb{P}_{k+l} are (possibly identical) programs and Φ,ΨΦΨ\\Phi,\\Psi are first-order formulas that relate k+l𝑘𝑙k+l different program runs.\nThe FEHT is valid if for all k+l𝑘𝑙k+l initial states that satisfy ΦΦ\\Phi, and for all possible executions of ℙ1,…,ℙksubscriptℙ1…subscriptℙ𝑘\\mathbb{P}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbb{P}_{k} there exist executions of ℙk+1,…,ℙk+lsubscriptℙ𝑘1…subscriptℙ𝑘𝑙\\mathbb{P}_{k+1},\\ldots,\\mathbb{P}_{k+l} such that the final states satisfy ΨΨ\\Psi.\nFor example, GNI can be expressed as ⟨l1=l2⟩​ℙ∼ℙ​⟨o1=o2⟩similar-todelimited-⟨⟩subscript𝑙1subscript𝑙2ℙℙdelimited-⟨⟩subscript𝑜1subscript𝑜2\\boldsymbol{\\langle}l_{1}=l_{2}\\boldsymbol{\\rangle}\\mathbb{P}\\sim\\mathbb{P}\\boldsymbol{\\langle}o_{1}=o_{2}\\boldsymbol{\\rangle}, where l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} and o1subscript𝑜1o_{1} (resp. l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} and o2subscript𝑜2o_{2}) refer to the value of l𝑙l and o𝑜o in the first (resp. second) program copy.\nThat is, for any two initial states σ1,σ2subscript𝜎1subscript𝜎2\\sigma_{1},\\sigma_{2} with identical values for l𝑙l (but possibly different values for hℎh), and any final state σ1′superscriptsubscript𝜎1′\\sigma_{1}^{\\prime} reachable by executing ℙℙ\\mathbb{P} from σ1subscript𝜎1\\sigma_{1}, there exists some final state σ2′superscriptsubscript𝜎2′\\sigma_{2}^{\\prime} (reachable from σ2subscript𝜎2\\sigma_{2} by executing ℙℙ\\mathbb{P}) that agrees with σ1′superscriptsubscript𝜎1′\\sigma_{1}^{\\prime} in the value of o𝑜o.\nThe program in Figure 1 satisfies this FEHT.\nIn the terminology of Clarkson and Schneider , GNI is a hyperliveness property, hence the name of our paper.\nIntuitively, the term hyperliveness stems from the fact that – due to the existential quantification in FEHTs – GNI reasons about the existence of a particular execution.\nSimilar to the definition of liveness in temporal properties , we can, therefore, satisfy GNI by adding sufficiently many execution traces 2. For finite-state hardware systems, many automated verification methods for hyperliveness properties (e.g., in the form of FEHTs) have been proposed 0      2.\nIn contrast, for infinite-state software, the verification of FEHTs is notoriously difficult; FEHTs mix quantification of different types, so we cannot employ purely over-approximate reasoning principles (as is possible for k𝑘k-safety).\nMost existing approaches for software verification, therefore, require substantial user interaction, e.g., in the form of a custom Horn-clause template 7, a user-provided abstraction [ref]12, or a deductive proof strategy  .\nSee Section 6 for more discussion. In this paper, we put forward an automatic algorithm for the verification of FEHTs.\nOur method is rooted in a novel program logic, which we call Forall-Exist Hoare Logic (FEHL) (in Section 3).\nSimilar to many program logics for k𝑘k-safety properties 6 , our logic focuses on one of the programs involved in the verification at any given time (by, e.g., symbolically executing one step in one of the programs) and thus lends itself to automation.\nWe show that FEHL is sound and complete (relative to a complete proof system for over- and under-approximate unary Hoare triples). Our verification algorithm – presented in Section 4 – then leverages FEHL for the analysis of FEHTs.\nDuring this analysis, the key algorithmic challenge is to find suitable instantiations for nondeterministic choices made in existentially quantified executions.\nOur algorithm avoids a direct instantiation and instead treats the outcome of the nondeterministic choice symbolically, allowing an instantiation at a later point in time.\nFormally, we define the concept of a parametric assertion.\nInstead of capturing a set of states, a parametric assertion defines a function that maps concrete values for a set of parameters (in our case, the nondeterministic choices in existentially quantified programs whose concrete instantiations we have postponed) to sets of states.\nOur algorithm then recursively computes a parametric postcondition and delegates the search for appropriate instantiations of the parameters to an SMT solver.\nCrucially, our algorithm only explores a restricted class of program alignments (as guided by FEHL).\nTherefore, the resulting constraints are ordinary (first-order) SMT formulas, which can be handled using off-the-shelf SMT solvers. We implement our algorithm in a tool called ForEx and compare it with existing approaches for the verification of ∀∗∃∗superscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} properties (in Section 5).\nAs ForEx can resort to highly optimized off-the-shelf SMT solvers, it outperforms existing approaches (which often rely on custom solving strategies) in many benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: = $l$\n\n\n However, for many relational properties, the implicit universal quantification found in k𝑘k-safety properties is too restrictive.\nConsider the simple program in Figure 1 (taken from [ref]12), where ⋆ℕsubscript⋆ℕ\\star_{\\mathbb{N}} denotes the nondeterministic choice of a natural number.\nThis program clearly violates the 222-safety property discussed above as the nondeterminism\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
