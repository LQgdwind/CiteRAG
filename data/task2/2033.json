      "content": "Paper Title: Risk-Aware Transfer in Reinforcement Learning using Successor Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a general framework for solving sequential decision-making problems, in which an agent interacts with an environment and receives continuous feedback in the form of rewards. However, many classical algorithms in RL do not explicitly address the need for safety, making them unreliable and difficult to deploy in many real-world applications [ref]10. One reason for this is the relative sample inefficiency of model-free RL algorithms, which often require millions of costly or dangerous interactions with the environment or fail to converge altogether  [ref]44. Transfer learning addresses these problems by incorporating prior knowledge or skills  . Despite this, using the expected return as a measure of optimality could still lead to undesirable behavior such as excessive risk-taking, since low-probability catastrophic outcomes with negative reward and high variance could be underrepresented 8. For this reason, risk-awareness is becoming an important aspect in the design of practical RL . Thus, an ultimate goal of developing reliable systems should be to ensure that they are both sample efficient and risk-aware. We take a step in this direction by studying the problem of risk-aware policy transfer between tasks with different goals.\nA powerful way to tackle this problem in the risk-neutral setting is the GPI/GPE framework, of which successor features (SF) are a notable example . Here, generalized policy improvement (GPI) provides a theoretical framework for transferring policies with monotone improvement guarantees, while generalized policy evaluation (GPE) facilitates the efficient evaluation of policies on novel tasks and is a key component in satisfying the assumptions of GPI in practice. Together, GPI/GPE provide strong transfer benefits in novel task instances even before any direct interaction with them has taken place, a phenomenon we call task generalization. The key to the superb generalization of GPI/GPE lies in their ability to directly exploit the structure of the task space, taking advantage of subtle differences and commonalities between task goals to transfer skills seamlessly in a composable manner. This property could be an effective way of tackling problems in offline RL 3, such as the transfer of skills learned in a simulator to a real-world environment. However in many cases, such as helicopter flight control for example , making one wrong decision could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Hence, being risk-aware could offer one way to avoid worst-case outcomes when transferring skills in real-world settings.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: in the form of rewards.
