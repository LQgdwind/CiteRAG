      "content": "Paper Title: Digital Modeling for Everyone: Exploring How Novices Approach Voice-Based 3D Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe digital fabrication revolution aims to democratize the way people create tangible objects . With the widespread availability of 3D printing together with many other digital fabrication technologies such as laser cutters or  Computer Numerical Control (CNC) routers, end users are moving from passive consumers to active producers. While the actual manufacturing process is largely automated today, users are still required to have a profound knowledge of complex 3D modeling applications, when they adapt models to their needs or even design new objects from scratch . Thus, even if the introduction of technologies such as 3D printers has revolutionized the hobbyist community, lowering the barrier of entry to manufacturing even for novices (who can now put their hands in the process of creating artifacts without relying on third parties), we argue that the design of the 3D objects to be manufactured still requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. These limitations have pushed researchers to investigate natural interaction techniques to simplify 3D modeling tools . For example, research explored gestures  , virtual/augmented reality  , eye tracking  , brain-computer interface   and their combination     as a multimodal approach. However, their adoption is reserved for technical users and it is strongly limited by hardware costs and excessive size/weight that can make the users easily fatigued . As another possible solution, voice-based interaction has been explored, to both integrate the traditional  Graphical User Interface (GUI) interface (e.g., to enable shortcuts via voice commands) [ref]47 ) or as the primary interaction paradigm (e.g., see   ). Although voice-based interaction requires only a microphone, it does not yet provide adequate digital modeling support for everyone: existing solutions either do not consider final users at all  , or only target 3D experts    , and novices are not considered potential target beneficiaries of the proposed innovations. To lower the barrier to the design and customization of personalized 3D models by exploiting the potential of voice-based interaction, this study aims to understand how the mental model of novices translates into voice-based 3D modeling. We conducted a high-fidelity  Wizard of Oz (WoZ) study to elicit novices’ mental model, for example, their expectation, beliefs, needs, and abilities. We recruited a total of 22 participants without skills in 3D modeling, who performed 14 tasks revolving around some basic concepts of 3D modeling like the creation of objects, the manipulation of objects (e.g., scaling, rotating, and/or moving objects), and the creation of composite objects. All the WoZ sessions’ recordings were analyzed through thematic analysis. The findings of the study have been distilled in the form of lessons learned. For example, we found that: voice assistants must manage the corrections the novices do during and after the commands; deal with vague and incomplete commands; consider the prior novices’ knowledge; provide only a simplified set of operations for creating simple and composite 3D objects; design a workflow similar to what novices would do if they were building real objects; understand chained commands; understand commands that are relative to the users’ point of view. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we report the results of our WoZ study presenting the themes that emerged from the thematic analysis. Second, based on these results, we provide a set of design implications for the future design of voice-based interaction paradigms for 3D modeling for novices.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: .
