      "content": "Paper Title: CodeSAM: Source Code Representation Learning by Infusing Self-Attention with Multi-Code-View Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnlike natural languages, a lot of important information is contained in the structure of programming languages. These syntactic and semantic properties of source code can be extracted using structured or graphical representations like the AST   , CFG , and DFG . Source code representation learning techniques of this type are grouped under Structure-based Representation approaches. Rather than using the entire AST,  presents a novel ASTNN approach that splits each large AST into a sequence of small statement trees, and encodes the statement trees to vectors by capturing the lexical and syntactical knowledge of statements.\n presents a deep feature learning framework called CDLH that exploits the lexical and syntactical information extracted from an AST for fast computation of functional similarity between code fragments.  introduced a learning-based approach to the four types of code clone detection that harnesses information from both identifiers and structure through the AST. They evaluated their work and saw significant improvements over the traditional, structure based approaches and the prominent clone detection tool Deckard .  showed improvements over Deckard, CDLH  and RtvNN  by proposing a novel approach that encodes code control-flow and data-flow into a semantic matrix in which each element is a high-dimensional sparse binary feature vector.\nCombined Representation or Multi Code-view methods attempt to combine different structured representations.\n[ref]33 proposes a multi-view graph (MVG) program representation method that pays more attention to code semantics and simultaneously includes a DFG, a CFG and a read-write graph (RWG) as multiple views. These views are then combined and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) to obtain a comprehensive program representation which is evaluated in the context of the algorithm detection task using the POJ-104 and a custom and more challenging dataset called ALG-109. [ref]17 proposes SG-Trans, a model for source code summarization that incorporates local and global code structural properties into the self-attention module of a transformer as inductive bias.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: semantic matrix in which each element is a high-dimensional sparse binary feature vector.\nCombined Representation or Multi Code-view methods attempt to combine different structured representations.\n[ref]33 proposes a multi-view graph (MVG) program representation method that pays more attention to code semantics and simultaneously includes a DFG, a CFG and a read-write graph (RWG) as multiple\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
