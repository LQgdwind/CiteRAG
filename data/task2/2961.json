      "content": "Paper Title: Sparsely Changing Latent States for Prediction and Planning in Partially Observable Domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe core of GateL0RD implements the general mapping (𝒚^t,𝒉t)=fθ​(𝒙t,𝒉t−1)subscriptbold-^𝒚𝑡subscript𝒉𝑡subscript𝑓𝜃subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒉𝑡1(\\bm{\\hat{y}}_{t},\\bm{h}_{t})=\\mathit{f}_{\\theta}(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{h}_{t-1}) using three functions, or subnetworks:\n(1) a recommendation network r𝑟r, which proposes a new candidate latent state, (2) a gating network g𝑔g, which determines how the latent state is updated, and (3) an output function, which computes the output based on the updated latent state and the input.\nThe network is systematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The overall processing is described by the following equations: where ⊙direct-product\\odot denotes element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product). We start with the control of the latent state in Eq. 8.\nFollowing Eq. 4, a new latent value is proposed by the recommendation function r​(𝒙t,𝒉t−1)𝑟subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒉𝑡1r(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{h}_{t-1}) and the update is “gated” by Λ​(𝒔)Λ𝒔\\Lambda(\\bm{s}). Importantly, if Λ​(𝒔)=𝟎Λ𝒔0\\Lambda(\\bm{s})=\\bm{0} no change to the latent state occurs.\nNote that the update in Eq. 8 is in principle equivalent to the latent state update in GRUs , for which it is typically written as 𝒉t=Λ​(𝒔)⊙r​(𝒙t,𝒉t−1)+(1−Λ​(𝒔))⊙𝒉t−1subscript𝒉𝑡direct-productΛ𝒔𝑟subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒉𝑡1direct-product1Λ𝒔subscript𝒉𝑡1\\bm{h}_{t}=\\Lambda(\\bm{s})\\odot r\\mathopen{}\\mathclose{{}\\left(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{h}_{t-1}}\\right)+(1-\\Lambda(\\bm{s}))\\odot\\bm{h}_{t-1} with Λ​(𝒔)Λ𝒔\\Lambda(\\bm{s}) a deterministic sigmoidal gate. Because we aim for piecewise constant latent states, the gating function ΛΛ\\Lambda defined in Eq. 7 needs to be able to output exactly zero.\nA potential choice would be the Heaviside function, i.e. either copy the new latent state or keep the old one.\nThis, however, does not allow any multiplicative computation.\nSo a natural choice is to combine the standard sigmoid gate of RNNs with the step-function: Λ​(𝒔)=max⁡(0,tanh⁡(𝒔))Λ𝒔0𝒔\\Lambda(\\bm{s})=\\max\\mathopen{}\\mathclose{{}\\left(0,\\tanh(\\bm{s})}\\right) which we call ReTanh (rectified tanh)333Note that tanh⁡(s)=2⋅sigmoid​(2​s)−1𝑠⋅2sigmoid2𝑠1\\tanh(s)=2\\cdot\\text{sigmoid}(2s)-1..\nFigure 1(b) shows the activation function ΛΛ\\Lambda depending on its input.\nThe gate is closed (Λ​(si)=0Λsuperscript𝑠𝑖0\\Lambda(s^{i})=0) for all inputs si≤0superscript𝑠𝑖0s^{i}\\leq 0.\nA closed gate results in a latent state that remains constant in dimension i𝑖i, i.e., hti=ht−1isubscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝑡subscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑖𝑡1h^{i}_{t}=h^{i}_{t-1}.\nOn the other hand, for si>0superscript𝑠𝑖0s^{i}>0 the latent state is interpolated between the proposed new value and the old one. The next puzzle piece is the input to the gate. Motivated from the L0subscript𝐿0L_{0} regularization in Eq. 1 we use a stochastic input. However, in our RNN setting, it should depend on the current situation. Thus, we use a Gaussian distribution for q𝑞q with the mean determined by the gating network g​(𝒙t,𝒉t−1)𝑔subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒉𝑡1g(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{h}_{t-1}) as defined in Eq. 6.\nWe chose a fixed diagonal covariance matrix 𝚺𝚺\\bm{\\Sigma}, which we set to Σi,i=0.1superscriptΣ𝑖𝑖0.1\\Sigma^{i,i}=0.1.\nTo train our network using backpropagation, we implement the sampling using the reparametrization trick .\nWe introduce a noise variable ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon and compute the gate activation as During testing we set ϵ=𝟎bold-italic-ϵ0\\bm{\\epsilon}=\\bm{0}\nto achieve maximally accurate predictions. Finally the output 𝒚^bold-^𝒚\\bm{\\hat{y}} is computed from the inputs and the new latent state 𝒉tsubscript𝒉𝑡\\bm{h}_{t} in Eq. 9.\nInspired by LSTMs [ref]5, the output is determined by a multiplication of a normal branch (p​(𝒙t,𝒉t)𝑝subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒉𝑡p(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{h}_{t})) and a sigmoidal gating branch (o​(𝒙t,𝒉t)𝑜subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒉𝑡o(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{h}_{t})).\nWe thus enable both additive as well as multiplicative effects of 𝒙tsubscript𝒙𝑡\\bm{x}_{t} and 𝒉tsubscript𝒉𝑡\\bm{h}_{t} on the output, enhancing the expressive power of the piecewise constant latent states. In our implementation, all subnetworks are MLPs.\nr,p𝑟𝑝r,p use a tanh\\tanh output activation; o𝑜o uses a sigmoid; g𝑔g has a linear output.\np,o𝑝𝑜p,o are one-layer networks. By default, r,g𝑟𝑔r,g are also one-layer networks.\nHowever, when comparing against deep (stacked) RNNs, we increase the number of layers of r𝑟r and g𝑔g to up to three (cf. Suppl. B). We use the loss defined in Eq. 5. GateL0RD is fully differentiable except for the Heaviside step function ΘΘ\\Theta in Eq. 5.\nA simple approach to deal with discrete variables is to approximate the gradients by a differentiable estimator   .\nWe employ the straight-through estimator , which substitutes the gradients of the step function ΘΘ\\Theta by the derivative of the linear function (see Fig. 1(c)). We use GateL0RD as a memory module of a more general architecture illustrated in Fig. 1(d).\nThe network input is preprocessed by a feed-forward network fpre​(𝒙t)subscript𝑓presubscript𝒙𝑡f_{\\mathrm{pre}}(\\bm{x}_{t}).\nSimilarly, its output is postprocessed by an MLP fpost​(𝒚^t)subscript𝑓postsubscriptbold-^𝒚𝑡f_{\\mathrm{post}}(\\bm{\\hat{y}}_{t}) (i.e. a readout layer) before computing the loss.\nThe latent state 𝒉0subscript𝒉0\\bm{h}_{0} of GateL0RD could be initialized by 𝟎0\\bm{0}.\nHowever, improvements can be achieved if the latent state is instead initialized by a context network finitsubscript𝑓initf_{\\mathrm{init}}, a shallow MLP that sets 𝒉0subscript𝒉0\\bm{h}_{0} based on the first input [ref]30 . In the Supplementary Material we ablate various components of GateL0RD, such as the gate activation function ΛΛ\\Lambda (Suppl. C.1), the gate stochasticity (Suppl. C.2), the context network finitsubscript𝑓initf_{\\mathrm{init}} (Suppl. C.3), the multiplicative output branch o𝑜o (Suppl. C.4), and compare against L1subscript𝐿1L_{1}/L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}-variants (Suppl. C.5).\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: achieve maximally accurate predictions. Finally the output 𝒚^bold-^𝒚\\bm{\\hat{y}} is computed from the inputs and the new latent state 𝒉tsubscript𝒉𝑡\\bm{h}_{t} in Eq. 9.\nInspired by LSTMs [ref]5, the output is determined by a multiplication of a normal branch (p​(𝒙t,𝒉t)𝑝subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒉𝑡p(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{h}_{t})) and a sigmoidal gating branch\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
