It is worth mentioning that in the same years some\nother “probabilistic” quantifiers were introduced.\nFor example, Papadimitriou  characterizes\nPPSPACE by alternating standard quantifiers with a probabilistic quantifier, which expresses the fact that more than the half of the strings of a\ncertain length satisfy the underlying predicate.\nZachos and Heller characterized BPP by means of a\nrandom quantifier , and Zachos also\nconsidered the relationship between classical and\nprobabilistic classes introducing other quantifiers, such as\nthe overwhelming the\nand majority ones .\nRemarkably, all these works concern counting quantification on\n(classes of) languages,\nrather than stricto sensu logical operators.\nAn exception is represented by Kontinen’s work ,\nin which counting quantifiers are second-order quantifiers\nin an otherwise first-order logic,\nmuch in the style of descriptive complexity.\nIn other words, one formula stands for a complexity\nbounded algorithm, while here formulas are taken as data. Despite the extensive literature on logical systems enabling\n(in various ways and for different purposes) some forms of probabilistic\nreasoning, there is not much about logics tied to computational aspects,\nas CPL is.\nMost of the recent logical formalisms have been\ndeveloped in the realm of modal logic, starting from the work by\nNilsson  .\nIn particular, in the 1990s,\nBacchus   \ndefined probability terms by means of a modal operator 𝗉𝗋𝗈𝖻𝗉𝗋𝗈𝖻\\mathsf{prob},\nwhich effectively computes the probability of certain events,\nand probability formulas,\nwhich are equalities between probability\nterms and numbers, such as 𝗉𝗋𝗈𝖻​(α)=12𝗉𝗋𝗈𝖻𝛼12\\mathsf{prob}(\\alpha)=\\frac{1}{2}\n(this, by the way, is not too different from the formula of\nCPL0subscriptCPL0\\textsf{{CPL}}_{0} 𝐂12​Asuperscript𝐂12𝐴\\mathbf{C}^{\\frac{1}{2}}A;\nnoticeably, Bacchus’ 𝗉𝗋𝗈𝖻𝗉𝗋𝗈𝖻\\mathsf{prob} yields terms, whereas 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} yields\nformulas).\nIn the same years also Fagin, Halpern and Megiddo [ref]24\nintroduced an interesting form of probability logic (which was later\nfurther studied in   ).\nIn this logic, probability spaces are the underlying model,\nand can be accessed through so-called weight terms. Another class of probabilistic modal logics have been designed to model Markov chains and similar structures. Some of these logics are probabilistic extensions of CTL, the standard logic for model-checking (see, for example,   ).\nA notable example is Riesz modal logic , which admits a sound and complete proof system.\nDifferently from CPL, in these logics modal operators have a dynamical meaning, as they describe transitions in a MDP. Concerning proof theory, axiomatic proof systems have been provided\nfor both logics  [ref]24, in connection with well-known\nmodal systems such as KD45  .\nWith the sole exception of Riesz modal logic, we are\nnot aware of sequent calculi for probability logic.\nBy the way, our one-sided, sequent calculi are inspired by labelled\ncalculi such as G3K* and G3P*,\nas presented for example in 0 ,\nbut, differently from them, our rules are not invertible. Probabilistic models and randomized computation are pervasive\nin many areas of computer science and programming.\nFrom the 1950s on, the interest for probabilistic algorithms and\nmodels started\nspreading    0 3 4 7\nand probabilistic computation has been intensely\nstudied by the TCS research\ncommunity 0 5  6.\nNowadays, well-defined computational models,\nsuch as randomized variations on\nprobabilistic automata6,\n(both Markovian and oracle) Turing machines 5 6  ,\nand λ𝜆\\lambda-calculi, are available. Also probabilistic programming languages have been extensively\nstudied from the 1970s on, and are still under\nscrutiny.\nSpecifically, foundational work on probabilistic functional languages\nis 2, where Saheb-Djahromy’s the typed,\nhigher-order λ𝜆\\lambda-calculus LCF is introduced.\nOther early introduced calculi are, for example,\nRamsey and Pfeffer’s stochastic λ𝜆\\lambda-calculus, 1 and Park’s λγsubscript𝜆𝛾\\lambda_{\\gamma}, 6,\nsee also , 8, 7.\nOperational semantics and properties of higher-order\nprobabilistic programs have been studied in .\nA particularly fruitful approach to the study of higher-order probabilistic\ncomputation consists in enriching general λ𝜆\\lambda-calculus with a\nprobabilistic choice operator ⊕direct-sum\\oplus   .\nFor these calculi, type systems ensuring various form of termination\nproperties have recently been\nintroduced [ref]14  .\nOur calculus is particularly inspired by the one introduced\nin .\nMoreover, our probabilistic definition of normal forms is\nsomehow reminiscent of the operational\nsemantics from 7.\nIn all these cases, however, no logically inspired\ntype system or Curry-Howard style correspondence is currently known.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: 𝐂12​Asuperscript𝐂12𝐴\\mathbf{C}^{\\frac{1}{2}}A;\nnoticeably, Bacchus’ 𝗉𝗋𝗈𝖻𝗉𝗋𝗈𝖻\\mathsf{prob} yields terms, whereas 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} yields\nformulas).\nIn the same years also Fagin, Halpern and Megiddo [ref]24\nintroduced an interesting form of probability logic (which was later\nfurther studied in   ).\nIn this logic, probability spaces are the underlying model,\nand can be accessed through so-called\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
