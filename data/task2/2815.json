      "content": "Paper Title: Novel EEG-based BCIs for Elderly Rehabilitation Enhancement\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo better understand the reliability of the proposed relevant IMF selection, a preliminary experiment has been conducted on the ES dataset. MEMD has been applied for each trial of the clean and raw data, considering all the SNR realizations (from -20dB to 20dB).\nSubsequently, the TF images of the obtained IMFs have been generated considering the 8−308308-30 Hz frequency range. Finally, the entropy selection criterion has been applied and the entropy-selected IMFs summed up to obtain the reconstructed EEG signal. The assessment of the proposed method reliability has been performed by computing the similarity between the clean and raw/entropy-reconstructed data by means of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The similarity check have been applied to each SNR realization, trial, and electrode.\nWe find that for low SNRs (about -20dB to -17dB), the PCC obtained by comparing the clean data versus the entropy-reconstructed ones do not deviate from the results obtained by applying the PCC on the clean data versus the raw ones. However, a significant increase of the PCC is present for the clean versus entropy-reconstructed signal case with SNR greater or equal to -12dB.\nEven though the similarity between the clean and entropy-reconstructed signals increases with higher values of SNR, it seems that for the electrodes that are usually affected by ocular artifacts the PCC remains generally low. For all the clean versus raw data cases, the mean similarity remains always lower than 0.9 and for the majority of the electrodes remains under 0.6. Therefore, the proposed strategy is considered sufficiently reliable for relevant IMF selection and signal reconstruction, having that its results do not deviate from the raw data or that are sufficiently similar to the clean ones.\n Having obtained a reliable method for relevant IMF selection, it is hypothesized that the entropy-selected IMFs could be efficiently used to reconstruct simulated trials while sufficiently maintaining the intrinsic EEG brain dynamics. As previously introduced, having that the proposed strategy is modeled on the one described by Dinarès-Ferran et al.  and that considers a BCI experiment, the MIB dataset has been used for testing.\nThe procedure has been computed on each subject and again the MEMD has been applied for each trial separately. Notice that the final goal is to discriminate the left (LW) from the right (RW) wrist MI, which could be applied to control a rehabilitation system. Firstly, random trials were substituted by artificial ones. These trials were obtained by unique combinations of m​a​xI​M​F𝑚𝑎subscript𝑥𝐼𝑀𝐹max_{IMF} relevant IMFs selected through the entropy criterion and belonging to m​a​xI​M​F𝑚𝑎subscript𝑥𝐼𝑀𝐹max_{IMF} different original trials.\nRemind that m​a​xI​M​F𝑚𝑎subscript𝑥𝐼𝑀𝐹max_{IMF} corresponds to the overall maximum number of IMFs selected by the entropy criterion. The artificial trials were then reconstructed by summing the selected IMFs.\nTo reproduce Dinarès-Ferran et al.  testing, 2.50, 5.00, 7.50, 10.00, 12.50, 25.0, 37.50, 50.00% of trial substitutions were performed.\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) was extracted for each electrode through Morlet wavelet convolution . This feature extraction follows the TF image representation computation, but as a final step, the power data is integrated in the frequency range of interest. Two rhythms were considered separately, i.e., the α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta frequency bands, obtaining a total of 38 features. These rhythms have been chosen, due to the presence of MI tasks (Section 1). The feature extraction has been restricted on the signal portion during which the MI task is performed to mimic Dinarès-Ferran et al.  experimental setting.\nFinally, a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier has been applied. For each subject the first run has been used as the training set and the second run as the test set. As a first analysis, Table 2 reports the median error rates for both the RW and LW conditions after having applied LDA 100 times on the original and reconstructed data. Trying to mimic the analysis given by , the error rate is here intended as the percentage of predicted values that have been wrongly classified for each class.\nThe results obtained by Dinarès-Ferran et al.  (row DF of Table 2) have been reported for completeness, however notice that their error rate evaluation is based on all the signal samples and that the features are extracted through common spatial pattern application.\nThe remaining table rows present the results obtained by considering the runs in their original form (row OO), and the entropy-reconstructed data of run 1 as the training set and the original data of run 2 as the test set (row RO). This last test has been conducted trying to mimic a real-time scenario, during which previously analyzed data (e.g., BCI training phase) may be exploited to predict new unseen data (e.g., BCI translation phase). Firstly, notice that the results obtained by the proposed strategy seem to be more balanced compared to the ones reported by Dinarès-Ferran et al. . Secondly, the RO results have been used for comparison with the artificial trial substitution results, which are reported in Table 3, having that their values are comparable to the ones obtained for the OO test. Notice that the field AT (%) refers to the percentage of trial substitutions balanced between the RW and LW conditions. Therefore, row 1 (0.00%) corresponds to the RO results presented in the last row of Table 2.\nMoreover, it can be observed that the results vary from subject to subject. In fact, subject S01 may be considered a good MI task performer, having that in the RO case the error rates are 2.50 and 0.00 for the RW and LW task, respectively and thus complying with what has been stated in Section 1: a person is good in performing MI tasks when he/she can accurately imagine the movement for at least the 70%percent7070\\% of the task repetitions. \nConsidering a less stringent constraint, S07 may be also considered good in the MI experiment. Instead, the remaining subjects seem to have some difficulties performing the MI tasks.\nAnalyzing S01 and S07, besides the 37.50% and 50.00% substitutions performed on S01’s trial, it can be noticed that the error rates remain stable or improve. Concerning the remaining subjects, the error rates are generally not improved. However, these error rates become more balanced between the conditions and for S03 and S04 there seem to be a decrease in the error rate values for some substitution percentages.\n Therefore, to ensure that the results obtained with the trial substitutions are coherent with the original results, a double Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) [ref]18 has been applied to detect if the median results obtained on the original trials could be considered outliers in respect to all the 100 results obtained for each trial substitution. Notice that if more than the 50% of the classification results are equal, the MAD is 0. Table 4 reports the outliers detected by double MAD application, with the following interpretation: (i) if a cell contains 0 MAD, it means that the MAD is 0, (ii) if a cell contains original, it means that the result obtained on the original trial is considered an outlier in respect to the results obtained on the artificial trial substitution, and (iii) if a cell contains a non-zero number, it means that the double MAD detected that specific number of outliers. Analyzing Table 4, the original trial result seems to appear as an outlier in a sufficiently limited number of cases. The proposed strategy results unreliable for S02’s RW condition, otherwise it results efficient especially when making few substitutions (2.50 to 5.00%) or a greater number of substitutions (25.00 to 50.00%). The overall number of outliers seems also to be fairly low. \n Making a final evaluation of the results achieved by the trial substitution through the proposed artificial trial generation, the observation given by Dinarès-Ferran et al.  is confirmed: for subjects that naturally perform better the MI tasks, the strategy is generally more effective.\nIn fact, the reported error rates generally remain stable or slightly increase for the other subjects. This effect could be due not only to the difficulties a user may face in performing the MI task which could lead to unreliable trials for a control system, but also to the presence of noisy data. Therefore, a further development of the trial simulation could be represented by the identification of faulty trials in respect to the experiment of interest. In fact, these trials could deteriorate the overall classification performances and by removing them the trial recombination could benefit the data generation procedure.\nMoreover, a BCI system could benefit from the faulty trial detection not only intended as noisy trials but also as unreliable trials. In fact, understanding immediately if an elderly person has some difficulties in performing the MI task could provide a better BCI training phase by giving preciser feedback to the subject him/herself and thus increase the task success and decrease subjects’ possible frustration. As a final remark, the proposed methodology seems however to be not extremely faulty when dealing with possibly unskilled subjects. Thus, the performed data substitution may represent a good solution to the EEG data dimensionality problem, providing results that do not deviate excessively from the original ones to train a BCI system.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: for some substitution percentages.\n Therefore, to ensure that the results obtained with the trial substitutions are coherent with the original results, a double Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) [ref]18 has been applied to detect if the median results obtained on the original trials could be considered outliers in respect to all the 100 results obtained for each trial substitution.
