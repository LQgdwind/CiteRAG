      "content": "Paper Title: FREEDOM: Target Label & Source Data & Domain Information-Free Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Unsupervised Personalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we introduce related works and provide comparisons across various MSDA scenarios in Table I to clarify the position of this study. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation aims to boost the accuracy of unlabeled targets by exploiting labeled source data. To this end, the datasets are used to learn features that can reduce the gap between domains represented by ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-divergence  [ref]18.\nTwo popular streams for minimizing the gap measure the discrepancy between the two domains   and using the adversarial training method [ref]3. The discrepancy-based method performs optimization by calculating a metric such as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) . Adversarial training employs a gradient reversal layer (GRL) to find a feature space that does not differentiate between domains and makes classification well [ref]3 .\nFurthermore, other generative model-based studies have been conducted for domain alignment  .\nHowever, since they all presume a single source is given only, it is not practical in the real world. Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) handles unsupervised domain adaptation employing a source dataset with multiple domains, so it should consider domain discrepancies among various sources as well as domain gaps between the source and target.\nThe main branch of the MSDA is the hypothesis combination, where each pair of a single source and the target is used in finding a hypothesis first, and the ultimate model for the target is implemented by their weighted mixture. Mansour et al. [ref]18 and Hoffman et al  presented the theoretical support of this hypothesis mixture for MSDA. Recent studies following this lineage take the form of training a model for each source-target pair and ensemble them; The algorithm focuses on how to find a common hypothesis for each pair and how to combine them.\nFor pair training, adversarial learning [ref]4  or moment matching  is widely adopted; For weight assignment, perplexity score [ref]4, weighted averaging , or Wasserstein distance  is utilized. Unlike these,  extracts prototypes from multiple sources as another form of knowledge.\nAnother branch is to train a single feature extractor across multiple domains. For example,  implicitly aligns all domain distributions by adopting multiple classifiers while sharing a feature extractor.  trains a network with mDA layers that can provide domain-wise normalization, generating a network with a normalization layer with a different moment for each domain.\nThese MSDA methods commonly require domain labels to make multi-domain to be aligned. However, identifying domains from a multi-domain dataset is pricey. Latent Domain Discovery (DD) accounts for this practical issue of finding domain labels through    or a discriminative network  .\nHoffman et al.  and Wu et al.  adopt the Gaussian mixture model and hierarchical clustering to find domain identifiers. Meanwhile,   employ an additional branch for domain discrimination, where the inference result is directly used in the MSDA network. Even though these domain discovery studies alleviate the cost of labeling in the domain aspect, they still require knowledge of the number of source domains as a prior, so they are not entirely free from domain information, unlike FREEDOM. Source-Free Domain Adaptation is introduced to handle a challenging situation where existing DAs always require an enormous volume of the source dataset (even from multiple domains). For example,  resolves the problem via hypothesis transfer with self-supervised pseudo labeling;  use self-entropy for pseudo-label selection. In another way,  generates target-like data in order for model adaptation.\nHowever, these all presume the single source situation, in which performance is crushed with multiple source domains. Recent Multi-Source Free Domain Adaptation (MSFDA) studies deal with this via confidence-anchor  or hypothesis transfer with optimization-based ensembling . However, despite their outstanding contributions, they still rely on domain labels and their target model’s size increase as the number of source domains increase. Thus, in this paper, FREEDOM considers a more plausible situation where domain information is not given, and the target model is independent of the increase of source domains.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: accuracy of unlabeled targets by exploiting labeled source data.
