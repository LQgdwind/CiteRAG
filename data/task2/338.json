      "content": "Paper Title: Robust testing of low-dimensional functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecall that a property testing algorithm for a class of functions 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is an algorithm which,\ngiven oracle access to an f:{−1,1}n→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑛11f:\\{-1,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{-1,1\\} and a distance parameter ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, satisfies If f∈𝒞𝑓𝒞f\\in\\mathcal{C}, then the algorithm accepts with probability at least 2/3232/3; If 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍​(f,g)≥ϵ𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔italic-ϵ\\mathsf{dist}(f,g)\\geq\\epsilon for every g∈𝒞𝑔𝒞g\\in\\mathcal{C}, then the algorithm rejects with probability at least 2/3232/3. Here 𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍​(f,g)=Pr𝐱∈{−1,1}n⁡[f​(𝐱)≠g​(𝐱)]𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔subscriptPr𝐱superscript11𝑛𝑓𝐱𝑔𝐱\\mathsf{dist}(f,g)=\\Pr_{{\\bf x}\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}}[f({\\bf x})\\neq g({\\bf x})]. The principal measure of the efficiency of the algorithm is its query complexity. Also, the precise value of the confidence parameter is irrelevant and 2/3232/3 can be replaced by any constant 1/2<c<112𝑐11/2<c<1. Fischer et al. were\nthe first to study the problem of testing k𝑘k-juntas\nand showed that k𝑘k-juntas can be tested with query complexity O~​(k2/ϵ)~𝑂superscript𝑘2italic-ϵ\\tilde{O}(k^{2}/\\epsilon). The crucial feature of their algorithm is that the query complexity is independent of the ambient dimension n𝑛n. Since then, there has been a long line of work on testing juntas [ref]6   [ref]15 [ref]13 and it continues to be of interest. The flagship result is that k𝑘k-juntas can be tested with O~​(k/ϵ)~𝑂𝑘italic-ϵ\\tilde{O}(k/\\epsilon) queries and this is tight [ref]6 [ref]15. While the initial motivation to study this problem came from long-code testing  9 (related to PCPs and inapproximability), another strong motivation comes from the feature selection problem in machine learning (see, e.g.  ). The definition of property testing above requires the algorithm to accept if and only if f∈𝒞𝑓𝒞f\\in\\mathcal{C}. However, for many applications, it is important consider a noise-tolerant definition of property testing. In particular, Parnas, Ron and Rubinfeld 8 introduced the following definition of noise tolerant testers. For constants 1/2>cu>cℓ≥012subscript𝑐𝑢subscript𝑐ℓ01/2>c_{u}>c_{\\ell}\\geq 0 and a function class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, a (cu,cℓ)subscript𝑐𝑢subscript𝑐ℓ(c_{u},c_{\\ell})-noise tolerant tester for 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is an algorithm which given oracle access to a function f:{−1,1}n→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑛11f:\\{-1,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{-1,1\\} accepts with probability at least 2/3232/3 if\nming∈𝒞⁡𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍​(f,g)≤cℓsubscript𝑔𝒞𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔subscript𝑐ℓ\\min_{g\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\mathsf{dist}(f,g)\\leq c_{\\ell}. rejects with probability at least 2/3232/3 if\nming∈𝒞⁡𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍​(f,g)≥cusubscript𝑔𝒞𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔subscript𝑐𝑢\\min_{g\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\mathsf{dist}(f,g)\\geq c_{u}. Further, a tester which is noise tolerant for any (given) cu>cℓ≥0subscript𝑐𝑢subscript𝑐ℓ0c_{u}>c_{\\ell}\\geq 0 is said to be a “fully noise tolerant” tester. The restriction cu,cℓ<1/2subscript𝑐𝑢subscript𝑐ℓ12c_{u},c_{\\ell}<1/2 comes from the fact that most natural classes 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} are closed under complementation – i.e., if g∈𝒞𝑔𝒞g\\in\\mathcal{C}, then −g∈𝒞𝑔𝒞-g\\in\\mathcal{C}. For such a class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} and for any f𝑓f, ming∈𝒞⁡𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍​(f,g)≤1/2subscript𝑔𝒞𝖽𝗂𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔12\\min_{g\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\mathsf{dist}(f,g)\\leq 1/2.\nFurther, note that the standard notion of property testing corresponds to a (ϵ,0)italic-ϵ0(\\epsilon,0)-noise tolerant tester. The problem of testing juntas becomes quite challenging in the presence of noise. Parnas et al. 8 observed that\nany tester whose (individual) queries are uniformly distributed are inherently noise tolerant in a very weak sense. In particular,  used this observation to show that the junta tester of  is in fact a (ϵ,𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(ϵ/k))italic-ϵ𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒italic-ϵ𝑘(\\epsilon,\\mathsf{poly}(\\epsilon/k))-noise tolerant tester for k𝑘k-juntas – note that cℓsubscript𝑐ℓc_{\\ell} is quite small, namely 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(ϵ/k)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒italic-ϵ𝑘\\mathsf{poly}(\\epsilon/k). Later, Chakraborty et al.  showed that the tester of Blais [ref]6 yields a (C​ϵ,ϵ)𝐶italic-ϵitalic-ϵ(C\\epsilon,\\epsilon) tester (for some large but fixed C>1𝐶1C>1) with query complexity\n𝖾𝗑𝗉​(k/ϵ)𝖾𝗑𝗉𝑘italic-ϵ\\mathsf{exp}(k/\\epsilon). Recently, there has been a surge of interest in tolerant junta testing. On one hand, Levi and Waingarten showed that there are constants 1/2>ϵ1>ϵ2>012subscriptitalic-ϵ1subscriptitalic-ϵ201/2>\\epsilon_{1}>\\epsilon_{2}>0 such that any non-adaptive (ϵ1,ϵ2)subscriptitalic-ϵ1subscriptitalic-ϵ2(\\epsilon_{1},\\epsilon_{2}) tester requires Ω~​(k2)~Ωsuperscript𝑘2\\tilde{\\Omega}(k^{2}) non-adaptive queries. Contrast this with the result of Blais [ref]6 who showed that there is a non-adaptive tester for k𝑘k-juntas with O​(k3/2)𝑂superscript𝑘32O(k^{3/2}) queries when there is no noise. In particular, this shows a gap between testing in the noisy and noiseless case. In the opposite (i.e., algorithmic) direction a sequence of recent works improved on the results of . First, Blais et al.  improved on the results of  by obtaining a small and explicit value of C𝐶C.\nFinally, De, Mossel and Neeman \ngave a fully noise tolerant tester for k𝑘k-juntas on the Boolean cube with query complexity O​(2k⋅𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(k/ϵ))𝑂⋅superscript2𝑘𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑘italic-ϵO(2^{k}\\cdot\\mathsf{poly}(k/\\epsilon)).\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: The crucial feature of their algorithm is that the query complexity is independent of the ambient dimension n𝑛n.
