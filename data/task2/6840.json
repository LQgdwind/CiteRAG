      "content": "Paper Title: Lifted Inference beyond First-Order Logic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStatistical Relational Learning (SRL)   is concerned with modeling, learning and inferring over large scale relational data. Probabilistic inference and learning in SRL models like Markov Logic Networks (MLN)  and Probabilistic Logic Programs (PLP)  can be reduced to instances of Weighted First Order Model Counting (WFOMC)  . WFOMC is the task of computing the weighted sum of the models of a First Order Logic (FOL) sentence Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi over a finite domain of size nùëõn. Formally, where w is a weight function that associates a real number to each interpretation œâùúî\\omega. Fragments of FOL that admit polynomial time WFOMC w.r.t the domain cardinality nùëõn are known as domain-liftable  or equivalently are said to admit lifted-inference. Recent works have also explored WFOMC as a tool for dealing with combinatorics, providing closed form formulae for counting combinatorial structures [ref]32 [ref]30 and identifying novel combinatorial sequences  . This generality of WFOMC applications has led to significant interest in FOL fragments that are domain liftable 1  . A series of results  [ref]2 have led to a rather clear picture of domain-liftability in the two-variable fragment of FOL. Especially, these results have shown that any FOL formula in the two-variable fragment is domain-liftable [ref]2. These positive results are also accompanied by intractability results [ref]2 , showing that there is an FOL formula in the three variable fragment whose (W)FOMC can not be computed in polynomial time. Hence, a significant effort has been made towards expanding the domain-liftability of the two-variable fragment of FOL with additional constraints [ref]32 [ref]30   . However, many features of real-world data are still not captured in these domain-liftable fragments. Among such constraints are acyclicity and connectivity. Both of them are ubiquitous features of real-world data  , and have been investigated extensively in combinatorics literature 8  . Hence, extending domain-liftable fragments of FOL with these constrains is of both theoretical and practical interest. However, both acyclicity and connectivity cannot be expressed in FOL . Formally, this means that there is no FOL sentence with fixed number of variables or quantifiers that can express that a graph is acyclic or connected for arbitrary number of nodes. In this work, we expand the domain-liftablilty of the two-variable fragment of FOL (FO2) with directed acyclicity (Section 3) and connectivity constraints (Section 4). Formally, we show that an FO2 sentence, with a distinguished predicate restricted to represent a directed acyclic graph or a connected graph, is domain-liftable. We introduce a general principle of counting by splitting for relational structures. It is based on the simple observation (Proposition 1) that an interpretation preserves satisfaction of universally quantified FOL sentences, when projected onto a subset of the domain. Conversely, interpretations of a given universally quantified FOL sentence Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi over disjoint sets of domain constants can be expanded (in different ways) to a new interpretation on the union of the sets, such that Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi and some additional desired property are satisfied (as evidenced in Proposition 4, Proposition 10, and Proposition 19). Counting by splitting allows us to construct the base of our WFOMC results, for the universally quantified fragment of FO2. These results are easily extended to full FO2, extended with cardinality constraints, and counting quantifiers (C2), using existing techniques in the literature  .\nThe combination of directed acyclicity, connectivity, and counting quantifiers, allow easy extension of domain-liftability of C2, with tree, directed tree and directed forest constraints. Finally, forest constraints (Section 5) are obtained by using tree constraints, and counting by splitting. In the following section, we provide the necessary background on FOL and lifted inference.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: equivalently are said to admit lifted-inference.
