Projected gradient descent (PGD) attack can be viewed as a multi-step FGSM attack 6. Many other white-box attacks have also been developed by leveraging full information of the target model 7 .\nIn the black-box setting, query-based black-box attacks [ref]25  assume\nmodel information is hidden but attackers can query the model and observe the corresponding hard-label or soft-label predictions. Among them,   considered soft-label probability predictions and  [ref]25 considered hard-label decision-based predictions.\nConsidering that using a great many of data to query the target model is impractical in many scenes, several researchers proposed ways to further reduce the query counts 3 . Transferability of adversarial examples. In this paper, we consider the black-box attack scenario when the attacker cannot make any query to the target model 4  0.\nIn this case, the common attack method is based on transfer attack—the attacker generates AEs by attacking one or few surrogate models and hopes the AEs can also fool the target model 8 5 4 .\nCompared with query-based attacks, crafting AEs from the surrogate model consumes less computational resources and is more realistic in practice.\nAlong this direction, subsequent works have made attempts to improve the transferability of AEs. For instance,  boosted the transferability by integrating the momentum term into the iterative process. Other techniques like data augmentations 3, the gradients of skip-connection 1, and negative interaction between pixels  also contribute to stronger transferable attacks.\nIn addition to using the original surrogate models, AEG [ref]2 adversarially trains a robust classifier together with an encoder-decoder-based transferable perturbation generator.\nAfter the training, AEG uses the generator to generate transferable AEs to attack a set of classifiers.\nCompared to all the existing works, our method is the first that meta-trains a new meta-surrogate model (MSM) such that attacks on MSM can be easier transferred to other models. This not only differs from all the previous methods that attack standard surrogate models but also differs from the encoder-decoder based method such as [ref]2.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: Adversarial attacks.\n[ref]46 is the earliest work to reveal the interesting phenomenon that CNN models are vunerable to adversarial attacks.\nAfter that, many attacks have been developed  .\nAdversarial attacks can be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
