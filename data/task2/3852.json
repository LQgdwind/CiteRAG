      "content": "Paper Title: From prediction markets to interpretable collective intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSuppose each expert n∈𝑬𝑛𝑬n\\in\\bm{E} possesses\na certain amount of units that are valuable for him or her (real money or some play money). We use the following terminology (see, e.g., ). A contract on 𝝎↦1maps-to𝝎1\\bm{\\omega}\\mapsto 1 is the obligation that can be sold by one expert to another and that binds a seller to pay\na buyer 111 unit once it is revealed that 𝝎𝝎\\bm{\\omega} is true. We can associate with 𝝎𝝎\\bm{\\omega} a prediction market where the experts would be trading contracts on\n𝝎↦1maps-to𝝎1\\bm{\\omega}\\mapsto 1 with each other.\nThe potential ability of the price in a prediction market to aggregate experts’ information and to converge to a collective probability of 𝝎↦1maps-to𝝎1\\bm{\\omega}\\mapsto 1 has been the subject of many empirical and theoretical studies.\nBelow we provide a brief description of a classical Bayesian model, and many further details can be found in Appendix B. But before the formal model, we informally describe an important example that is a slight variation of an example from  and shows how experts’ information and beliefs may vary during the trade even if the initial beliefs are identical.\nSuppose there is an event with three mutually exclusive outcomes x𝑥x, y𝑦y, and z𝑧z.\nLet 𝝎𝝎\\bm{\\omega} be the proposition that x𝑥x has been realized. Suppose a random half of the experts know that y𝑦y has not been realized and the other half know that z𝑧z has not been realized.\nAll the experts also know that a random half of them know about y𝑦y and the other half know about z𝑧z.\nIf the experts reckon with the principle of indifference, they will have identical initial\nprobabilities πn0​(𝝎)=1/2superscriptsubscript𝜋𝑛0𝝎12\\pi_{n}^{0}(\\bm{\\omega})=1/2, n∈𝑬𝑛𝑬n\\in\\bm{E}.\nIn this situation, any static probability aggregation scheme yields nothing better than 1/2121/2.\nOn the other hand, if the experts generate a prediction market and are sophisticated enough to judge about others’ probabilities by watching others’ behavior in this market, then\ntheir beliefs will change toward 111. The discrete model of prediction market from  is one way to formally describe how the price and beliefs cease to fluctuate\nin a single consensus point, in particular in the x​y​z𝑥𝑦𝑧xyz-example.\nHere we provide those part of that model that is a direct consequence of the classical results of [ref]13 that, in its turn, extend the line of research started\nin  (see also Appendix B.1 for further discussion of that model). First, assume that we are in the Bayesian setting as it is described at the end of Section 2.1: there is a probability measure P𝑃P over 2𝒜superscript2𝒜2^{\\mathcal{A}}, where 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is the set of all assignments to 𝚫={𝝎}∪𝚪𝚫𝝎𝚪\\bm{\\Delta}=\\{\\bm{\\omega}\\}\\cup\\bm{\\Gamma}.\nAdditionally assume that the sets ΓnsubscriptΓ𝑛\\Gamma_{n} are pairwise disjoint and that each of them consists of a single signal. Of course, in this situation we can use a more conventional notation. Namely, following  (see also the survey ), we consider the information structure and bit\narrays (ω,s)=(ω,s1,…,sN)∈Ω×S𝜔𝑠𝜔subscript𝑠1…subscript𝑠𝑁Ω𝑆(\\omega,s)=(\\omega,s_{1},\\dots,s_{N})\\in\\Omega\\times S. This is the same as to consider\na set 𝚫𝚫\\bm{\\Delta} consisting of\nN+1𝑁1N+1 propositional variables, with all possible assignments δ@𝚫@𝛿𝚫\\delta\\mathbin{@}\\bm{\\Delta}. A vector r=(r1,…,rN)∈S𝑟subscript𝑟1…subscript𝑟𝑁𝑆r=(r_{1},\\dots,r_{N})\\in S is the real state of the world (𝜸𝑬subscript𝜸𝑬\\bm{\\gamma}_{{}_{\\bm{E}}} in our notation), and each expert n∈𝑬={1,…,N}𝑛𝑬1…𝑁n\\in\\bm{E}=\\{1,\\dots,N\\} privy to one bit rn∈Snsubscript𝑟𝑛subscript𝑆𝑛r_{n}\\in S_{n} of information.\n The experts’ probabilities of ω=1𝜔1\\omega=1 (of 𝝎↦1maps-to𝝎1\\bm{\\omega}\\mapsto 1 in our notation)\nare conditional probabilities generated by a probability measure P𝑃P over 2Ω×Ssuperscript2Ω𝑆2^{\\Omega\\times S} such that P​(s=r)≠0𝑃𝑠𝑟0P(s=r)\\neq 0\n(the world r𝑟r is not unexpected). There is a prediction market that proceeds in rounds. The clearing price is publicly revealed after each round, and it turns out to be the mean of the experts’ beliefs before the round. Such means are the only information channel between the experts.  All of the above is common knowledge (including the structure Ω×SΩ𝑆\\Omega\\times S and the measure P𝑃P). By πnksubscriptsuperscript𝜋𝑘𝑛\\pi^{k}_{n} and qkcsuperscriptsubscript𝑞𝑘𝑐q_{k}^{c} we denote the experts’ beliefs before the k𝑘k-th round and the clearing price after it, respectively.\nWe can write (iii) as We note that (2) means that the price qkcsuperscriptsubscript𝑞𝑘𝑐q_{k}^{c} combines information exchange with averaging, which is more than can be said for\nthe price in a real prediction market (see Appendix C). By Iksuperscript𝐼𝑘I^{k} we denote the public information accumulated by the market for the first k−1𝑘1k-1 rounds: where qkc​(s)superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑘𝑐𝑠q_{k}^{c}(s) are the prices in a world s𝑠s (in particular, qkc=qkc​(r)superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑘𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑘𝑐𝑟q_{k}^{c}=q_{k}^{c}(r)). The information of an expert n𝑛n before the k𝑘k-th round is and we have\nπnk=P(ω=1|s∈Ink).\\pi^{k}_{n}=P\\bigl{(}\\omega=1\\bigm{|}s\\in I^{k}_{n}\\bigr{)}.\nWe note that events {(w,s)∈Ω×S∣s∈Ink}conditional-set𝑤𝑠Ω𝑆𝑠subscriptsuperscript𝐼𝑘𝑛\\{(w,s)\\in\\Omega\\times S\\mid s\\in I^{k}_{n}\\} for k>1𝑘1k>1 may be irreducible to the partial assignments 𝜸𝑬|Γ′evaluated-atsubscript𝜸𝑬superscriptΓ′\\bm{\\gamma}_{{}_{\\bm{E}}}|_{{}_{\\Gamma^{\\prime}}} arising in (1), and, therefore, after the first round the corresponding probabilities πnksubscriptsuperscript𝜋𝑘𝑛\\pi^{k}_{n} may not always be described within the non-Bayesian context. Since I1⊇I2⊇⋯superset-of-or-equalssuperscript𝐼1superscript𝐼2superset-of-or-equals⋯I^{1}\\supseteq I^{2}\\supseteq\\cdots, there exists a moment k∞subscript𝑘k_{\\infty} when the information stops accumulating: In , the authors notice that the results of [ref]13 immediately imply that at k∞subscript𝑘k_{\\infty}\neach expert’s belief πnk∞subscriptsuperscript𝜋subscript𝑘𝑛\\pi^{k_{\\infty}}_{n} turns out to be independent of his or her own private information and\nall the beliefs stabilize at one point.\nNamely, we have the following proposition. For all n∈𝐄𝑛𝐄n\\in\\bm{E} we have Now we can formalize the x​y​z𝑥𝑦𝑧xyz-example as follows. Suppose S=S1×S2𝑆subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2S=S_{1}\\times S_{2} and r=(0,0)𝑟00r=(0,0), and set If px=py=pz=13subscript𝑝𝑥subscript𝑝𝑦subscript𝑝𝑧13p_{x}=p_{y}=p_{z}=\\tfrac{1}{3}, then we have k∞=2subscript𝑘2k_{\\infty}=2, I2={r}superscript𝐼2𝑟I^{2}=\\{r\\}, and q2c=1superscriptsubscript𝑞2𝑐1q_{2}^{c}=1. Finally, we can state the obvious fact that nothing changes when some experts are ignorant. Consider a situation where the dimension d𝑑d of S𝑆S is strictly less than N𝑁N:\nd𝑑d experts privy to d𝑑d bits of r∈S𝑟𝑆r\\in S as in (i)\nfrom Assumption 2.2, while remaining N−d𝑁𝑑N-d experts know no bits at all. We suppose (ii)–(v) from Assumption 2.2 remain fulfilled for all N𝑁N experts: in particular, both N𝑁N and d𝑑d are assumed to be common knowledge. Under these conditions,\nrelation (3) remains valid and we can shorten (3) by dropping the second identity: it becomes a part of the first.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: beliefs cease to fluctuate\nin a single consensus point, in particular in the x​y​z𝑥𝑦𝑧xyz-example.\nHere we provide those part of that model that is a direct consequence of the classical results of [ref]13 that, in its turn, extend the line of research started\nin  (see also Appendix B.1 for further discussion of that model).
