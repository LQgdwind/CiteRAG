      "content": "Paper Title: SOFT: Softmax-free Transformer with Linear Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently the step change brought by Transformers [ref]34 in natural language processing (NLP)   seems to have arrived in vision  2 8 7. Indeed, with less\ninductive bias in its architecture design than Convolution neural networks (CNNs), pure Vision Transformer (ViT)  and its variants have shown to be able to outperform CNNs on various vision tasks  .\nHowever, there is a bottleneck in any Transformer based model, namely its quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. This is intrinsic to the self-attention mechanism:\ngiven a sequence of tokens (e.g., words or image patches) as input, the self-attention module iteratively learns the feature representations\nby relating one token to all other tokens. This results in a quadratic complexity O‚Äã(n2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2O(n^{2}) with the token sequence length nùëõn\nin both computation (time) and memory (space) since an n√ónùëõùëõn\\times n sized attention matrix needs to be computed and saved during inference. This problem is particularly acute in vision: a 2D image after tokenization will produce a far longer sequence than those in NLP even with a moderate spatial resolution. This quadratic complexity thus prevents a ViT model from modeling images at high spatial resolutions, which are often crucial for visual recognition tasks. A natural solution is to reduce the complexity of self-attention computation via approximation. Indeed,\nthere have been a number of attempts in NLP [ref]35 [ref]5  0. For example, [ref]35 takes a naive approach by shortening the length of Key and Value via learnable projections. Such a coarse approximation would inevitably cause performance degradation.\nIn contrast, [ref]5  both leverage the kernel mechanism to approximate softmax normalization to linearize the computation in self-attention.\n instead adopts a hashing strategy to selectively compute the most similar pairs.\nRecently, 0 uses Nystr√∂m matrix decomposition to reconstruct the full attention matrix\nwith polynomial iteration for approximating the pseudo-inverse of the landmark matrix. Nonetheless, softmax normalization is\nsimply duplicated across the matrix decomposition process,\nwhich is theoretically unsound. We empirically found that none of these methods are effective when applied to vision (see Sec.¬†4.2). In this work, we identify that the limitations of existing efficient Transformers are caused by the use of softmax self-attention, and for the first time propose a softmax-free Transformer. More specifically, in all existing Transformers (with or without linearization),\na softmax normalization is needed on top of scaled dot-product between token feature vectors [ref]34. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts.\nTo overcome this obstacle, we introduce a novel\nsoftmax-free self-attention mechanism, named as SOFT,\nwith linear complexity O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n) in both space and time.\nSpecifically, SOFT uses Gaussian kernel to define\nthe similarity (self-attention) function without the need\nfor subsequent softmax normalization. With this softmax-free attention matrix, we further introduce a novel low-rank matrix decomposition algorithm for approximation. The robustness of the approximation is theoretically guaranteed by employing a Newton-Raphson method for reliably\ncomputing the Moore-Penrose inverse of the matrix. We make the following contributions.\n(I) We introduce a novel softmax-free Transformer with linear space and time complexity.\n(II) Our attention matrix approximation is achieved through a novel matrix decomposition algorithm\nwith theoretical guarantee.\n(III) To evaluate our method for visual recognition tasks,\nwe design a family of generic backbone architectures\nwith varying capacities using SOFT as the core self-attention component.\nExtensive experiments show that with a linear complexity (Figure¬†1(b)), our SOFT models can take in as input much longer image token sequences. As a result, with the same model size, our SOFT outperforms the state-of-the-art CNNs and ViT variants on ImageNet¬† classification in the accuracy/complexity trade-off (Figure¬†1(a)).\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Recently the step change brought by Transformers [ref]34 in natural language processing (NLP)   seems to have arrived in vision  2 8 7.
