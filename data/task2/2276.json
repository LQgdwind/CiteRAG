      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a fundamental task in computer vision, object detection has drawn much attention in the past decade [ref]34  .\nWith the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), some modern CNN-based detectors like Faster R-CNN  have emerged and been successfully applied to many tasks, such as autonomous driving  , face and pedestrian detection  , etc.\nHowever, the high-quality performance of detectors is based on large-scale training images with annotated bounding boxes.\nIn the real world, variances exist between training and test images in many aspects, including object appearance, background, even taken time.\nDue to these domain discrepancies, the performance on the test images may decrease dramatically.\nAlthough annotating more training data of the new domain is able to alleviate the phenomenon, it is not an optimal strategy due to large time and labor costs. To mitigate the domain gap, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely used for object detection [ref]6   . Domain adaptive Faster R-CNN [ref]6 is a milestone study developed for tackling the domain shift problem in object detection.\nIn the work, image-level features and instance-level features are respectively aligned through an adversarial manner.\nFollowing [ref]6, a series of Faster R-CNN based adaptation models  [ref]56 have emerged recently.\nConsidering that image-level alignment transfers massive unnecessary information background for object detection, Zhu et al. [ref]56 and Saito et al.  pay more attention to align informative local regions.\nTo minimize the domain distribution disparity on each block, He et al.  propose multi-adversarial Faster R-CNN to conduct layer-wise domain feature alignment.\nHowever, existing algorithms for domain adaptive object detection assume that the source data are sampled from a single domain, which limits the generalization of the model.\nWe consider a more practical scenario that the source data are collected from multiple domains with different distributions.\nAs shown in Figure 1, directly combining two sources and performing single-source domain adaptation (DA) cause performance decay compared with the best result of a single domain, i.e. 29.9% vs. 31.4%.\nIt is mainly resulted from the mutual interference between different sources that exist serious domain discrepancy, which is also demonstrated in other tasks   .\nTherefore, we need to design a specialized framework for domain adaptive object detection from multiple sources. Though multi-source domain adaptation has been explored for other tasks, such as image classification   and segmentation , they all belong to the straightforward classification task regardless of image-level or pixel-level.\nHowever, detection model like Faster R-CNN is a complex system for both regression and classification, and it contains multiple components including feature extractor, region proposal network (RPN), etc.\nIn this paper, for the new task, we develop a framework termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), in which multiple source subnets and a pseudo subnet are included.\nFirst, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy.\nSince low-level features have high resolution that is important to localization , we perform strong alignment for them of different domains.\nFor the high-level features that are important for object recognition, we weakly align each source and target in corresponding supervised source subnet.\nSecond, to approximate optimal parameters for the target domain, we develop a pseudo subnet learning (PSL) algorithm, in which the pseudo subnet is updated via exponential moving average (EMA)  parameters of different source subnets.\nFinally, a new consistency regularization on region proposals are conducted between each source subnet and the pseudo target, which enables the model to capture more robust instance-level invariances for object detection.\nIn the testing phase, the predictions of each subnet are merged into final inference. In summary, our contributions are threefold. We propose to conduct domain adaptation for object detection from multiple sources.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\non multi-source domain adaptation for object detection that contains both classification and regression.\n We propose a unified framework termed DMSN to tackle the new problem.\nThe characteristics of each source domain are preserved in each independent supervised source subnet.\nMeanwhile, an optimal pseudo subnet is approximated by aggregating parameters of different source subnets.\n A new consistency regularization is designed to facilitate each source subnet to propose similar region proposals with the pseudo subnet, so that the model is able to learn more abstract invariances.\nThe results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: As a fundamental task in computer vision, object detection has drawn much attention in the past decade [ref]34  .\nWith the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), some modern CNN-based detectors like Faster R-CNN  have emerged and been successfully applied to many tasks, such as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
