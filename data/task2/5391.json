      "content": "Paper Title: Cut and Learn for Unsupervised Object Detection and Instance Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now evaluate CutLER as a pretraining method for training object detection and instance segmentation models.\nWhile CutLER can discover objects without any supervision, finetuning it on a target dataset aligns the model output to the same set of objects labeled in the dataset. Setup.\nWe use CutLER to initialize a standard Cascade Mask R-CNN  detector with a ResNet50 [ref]28.\nPrior work uses more advanced detectors, SOLOv2 8 used in 7 and DDETR  used in [ref]3, that perform better.\nHowever, we choose Cascade Mask R-CNN for its simplicity and show in Sec. 5 that CutLER’s performance improves with stronger detectors.\nWe train the detector on the COCO  dataset using the bounding box and instance mask labels.\nTo evaluate label efficiency, we subsample the training set to create subsets with varying proportions of labeled images.\nWe train the detector, initialized with CutLER, on each of these subsets.\nAs a baseline, we follow the settings from MoCo-v2  and train the same detection architecture initialized with a MoCo-v2 ResNet50 model, given its strong performance on object detection tasks.\nBoth MoCo-v2 and our models are trained for the 1×1\\times schedule using Detectron2 , except for extremely low-shot settings with 1% or 2% labels. Following previous works 7, when training with 1% or 2% labels, we train both MoCo-v2 and our model for 3,600 iterations with a batch size of 16. Results.\nFig. 5 shows the results of fine-tuning the detector on different subsets of COCO. When tested with low-shot settings, e.g., 2% and 5% labeled data, our approach achieves 5.4% and 7.3% higher APboxbox{}^{\\text{box}} than the MoCo-v2 baseline, respectively.\nEven when training with full annotations, CutLER still consistently gives more than 2% improvements, outperforming MoCo-v2 for both object detection and segmentation.\nMore impressively, CutLER outperforms prior SOTA methods - FreeSOLO 7 and DETReg [ref]3 despite using an older detection architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: it on a target dataset aligns the model output to the same set of objects labeled in the dataset. Setup.\nWe use CutLER to initialize a standard Cascade Mask R-CNN  detector with a ResNet50 [ref]28.\nPrior work uses more advanced detectors, SOLOv2 8 used in 7 and DDETR  used in [ref]3, that perform better.\nHowever, we choose Cascade Mask R-CNN for its simplicity and show in Sec. 5 that\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
