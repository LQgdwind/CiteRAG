      "content": "Paper Title: FashionVQA: A Domain-Specific Visual Question Answering System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvery benchmark reported on our datasets is implemented via PyTorch-v1.10 on servers with 8 Nvidia 80GB A-100 GPUs, 2 AMD 2.25GHz 7742 CPUs, and 4TB system memory. In the training stage, we adopted data-parallel multi-GPU training and set the batch size to 2048, and trained for 40 epochs. The Adam optimizer is used across all the models. The learning rate is set to 0.0001 and reduced by half at the milestone epochs of 20, 30, and 35. We benchmark the FashionVQA dataset by training several VQA models to learn the interaction between images and questions. Figure 2 shows the VQA pipeline adopted in our experiment. Given the visual embedding of the input image and text embedding of the input question sentence, we train the model to output the given answer to the question. The dataset is used to train two variants of the MCAN [ref]10 model and a MUTAN [ref]17 model. One MCAN variant, named MCAN∗-v1, is a modification of the MCAN-small, which includes only two encoder-decoder modules. The other variant is named MCAN∗-VLM, which has a similar structure to MCAN∗-v1, but instead of an answer classifier, it has a token classifier covering all of the question and answer tokens. For MCAN∗-VLM, the answer to each question is tokenized as one token and concatenated with the question tokens as the language input. The special token ‘SEP’ is inserted between the question and the answer. Also, ‘EOS’ token is used at the end of the answer. During the training of MCAN∗-VLM, we randomly mask one token and predict the masked token as in the masked language modeling, similar to BERT [ref]18. Different from MCAN∗-v1 that answer vocabulary is independent of the word vocabulary of the questions, MCAN∗-VLM maps each answer to one token and expands the original word vocabulary to a larger one with the answer tokens. Thus, the tokens in the answers and questions share the same word vocabulary. This allows the MCAN∗-VLM to work as a visual language model, which directly benefits from the overlap in the question tokens of the binary questions and the answer tokens of the non-binary question. In the training stage, except MCAN∗-VLM, we treat the binary-question prediction and the non-binary question prediction as two different tasks and output the predicted answers from two different classifiers. We report top-1 accuracies for both binary and non-binary samples. Table 2 lists the benchmark results of the three aforementioned models on the validation split of our FashionVQA dataset. The results show that MCAN∗-VLM works better than MCAN∗-v1 and MUTAN, indicating that a decoder-only visual language model (VLM) performs better than the dedicated VQA architectures. By visualizing the image attention maps generated from an intermediate layer of the model, we can validate whether the model focuses its attention on the regions mentioned in a question. Figure 3 visualizes the attention map from two validation samples for a series of binary and non-binary questions. The three columns of images on each side are the input images, attention maps, and images overlayed by the attention maps, respectively, followed by the corresponding input questions, ground truth answers, and predicted answers. When the questions focus on different fashion items of the same image, the attention map shifts to the targeted region as expected.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: embedding of the input image and text embedding of the input question sentence, we train the model to output the given answer to the question.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
