Besides, there are some works that aim at learning weight for different feature interactions, including Attentional Factorization Machines (AFM) , Dual-attentional Factorization Machines (DFM) , Dual Inputaware Factorization Machines (DIFM) . Since the number of samples and the dimension of features have become larger and larger, many deep learning based models have been proposed, such as Wide&Deep 4, Deep Crossing , YouTube Recommendation , PNN , Deep&Cross . There are some studies that combine FM with DNN, such as DeepFM , NFM , xDeepFM , InterAtt , DeepLight 5 and DCN V2 .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: and recommendation systems, which aims at predicting the probability that a user clicks an item or ad.\nPioneer works of CTR prediction are proposed mainly based on Logistic Regression (LR) [ref]3  , polynomial 5, collaborative filtering 6, tree models 7, Bayesian models 8, etc.\nIn order to explicitly model the feature interactions, many factorization machine based methods are proposed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
