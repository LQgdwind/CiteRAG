      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Joint Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Image Transmission\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we introduce InverseJSCC as an unsupervised improvement on the DeepJSCC approach by treating the end-to-end reconstruction by DeepJSCC as the FP, and model the reconstruction of the source image with better perceptual quality as an inverse problem. More specifically, InverseJSCC treats the reconstructions at the receiver as the measurements, obtained by an unknown data sample going through a typically non-invertible forward process (FP). Inverse problems can be formalized as follows [ref]26, where A𝐴A is the forward operator, an approximate representation of FP, and 𝐧Asubscript𝐧𝐴\\mathbf{n}_{A} is an additive noise. Alternatively, non-additive noise can be considered in a more general model, i.e., 𝐲=𝒩​(A​(𝐱))𝐲𝒩𝐴𝐱\\mathbf{y}=\\mathcal{N}(A(\\mathbf{x})) for the noise distribution 𝒩​(⋅)𝒩⋅\\mathcal{N}(\\cdot). It is important to note that the FP and the forward operator A𝐴A are not necessarily identical, in fact, the FP is often a black box and the forward operator is an approximate model of FP. A typical inverse problem can be solved by minimizing the loss function with respect to 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} with the help of prior assumptions on 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}. In our communication setting, the source signal 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} goes through the encoder, channel, and decoder of the SotA DeepJSCC model in . We assume that the FP is only one realization of the DeepJSCC model. We have the knowledge of channel statistics, but not the noise realizations. Therefore, the FP is only partially known due to the stochastic channel noise. Our goal is to invert the FP and reconstruct the source signal 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} from the observations 𝐱^^𝐱\\mathbf{\\hat{x}} with high perceptual quality. We model the encoder and the decoder functions of the DeepJSCC model , i.e., fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} and gϕsubscript𝑔italic-ϕg_{\\phi}, as DNNs parameterized by θ𝜃\\theta and ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, respectively. Then,\nwe represent our forward operator A𝐴A as a non-linear process with AWGN noise function η𝜂\\eta, i.e., Extreme physical conditions, such as very low BCR or very low SNR in the communication pipeline introduce high distortion in the signal reconstructed by DeepJSCC, 𝐱^^𝐱\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}. This might lead to significant loss of semantic similarity between the original signal and the reconstruction, especially when the source data distribution is complex and high dimensional (e.g., high-quality images or videos). In classical signal reconstruction methods, some prior knowledge about the properties of 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, such as sparsity, dictionary, or geometric properties, are used to minimize the loss (8) effectively. Here, our assumption is that the distribution of our input signal, i.e., images from a certain dataset, is in the range of a GAN generator function G:ℝq→ℝm:𝐺→superscriptℝ𝑞superscriptℝ𝑚G:\\mathbb{R}^{q}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}, which is parameterized by DNNs trained on the same context as the input distribution. In general, DGMs have recently demonstrated unprecedented visual results for image generation and have been shown to represent complex-high dimensional distributions in inverse problems successfully [ref]26 [ref]29 . Primary examples for DGMs are VAEs , Diffusion Models  and GANs . In this paper, we use the StyleGAN-2  generator in the InverseJSCC approach to the semantic communication problem defined in Section III. In InverseJSCC, we are inspired by a general inverse problem approach called intermediate layer optimization (ILO) , which utilizes a pre-trained StyleGAN-2 generator for various inverse problems. Although we are mainly interested in high-quality face images, the same ideas can be applied to other domains. Here, ILO solves an inverse problem objective by adaptively changing the StyleGAN-2 layer to be optimized, moving from the initial latent vector to intermediate layers closer to the output. We solve a slightly modified optimization problem: where G​(⋅)𝐺⋅G(\\cdot) is the pre-trained generator network, and 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} and 𝐧Gsubscript𝐧𝐺\\mathbf{n}_{G} are the latent input and the noise vector of the generator, respectively. While the latent vector controls the style parts of the generated image, the noise fed to the generator determines the high-resolution details. ℒ​(⋅)ℒ⋅\\mathcal{L}(\\cdot) is the LPIPS loss function that uses VGG , and ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is the regularization loss defined by Here, GEO​(⋅)GEO⋅\\text{GEO}(\\cdot) is the geodesic distance which represents the shortest path between two points on a curved surface. This term regularizes the deviation of the latent vector 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w}. Unlike in ILO, we use an additional LPIPS regularization term that helps make sure that the generator output does not divert far from the reconstructed input perceptually. Recall that the forward operator A𝐴A is the DeepJSCC model in Fig. 2, which includes a pre-trained encoder/decoder pair (fθ,gϕ)subscript𝑓𝜃subscript𝑔italic-ϕ(f_{\\theta},g_{\\phi}) and the channel model η​(⋅,σ2)𝜂⋅superscript𝜎2\\eta(\\cdot,\\sigma^{2}), and is a partial description of the FP due to the stochasticity of the channel.\nFig. 3 shows the InverseJSCC scheme that reconstructs 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} from its distorted measurements 𝐱^^𝐱\\mathbf{\\hat{x}} with the help of the pre-trained generator.\nThe forward operator A𝐴A can be trained on any dataset regardless of the source dataset, whereas StyleGAN-2 generator G𝐺G is pre-trained on the same context data as the source dataset.\nThe generator G𝐺G can be decomposed into multiple layers as Similarly to ILO, the optimization in (12) is performed over 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} and 𝐧Gsubscript𝐧𝐺\\mathbf{n}_{G}. The optimized latent vector 𝐰∗superscript𝐰\\mathbf{w}^{*}, which is the input to the first layer of the generator G1subscript𝐺1G_{1}, is used for the intermediate latent representation of the input to G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}, i.e., 𝐰^=G1​(𝐰∗)^𝐰subscript𝐺1superscript𝐰\\mathbf{\\hat{w}}=G_{1}(\\mathbf{w}^{*}). This recursive optimization continues until the intermediate latent inputs are optimized for all the intended number of layers. The noise vector 𝐧Gsubscript𝐧𝐺\\mathbf{n}_{G}, on the other hand, is optimized up to a pre-determined layer. Note that the weights of the pre-trained A𝐴A and G𝐺G functions are fixed, and only the latent input and noise vectors are optimized. InverseJSCC has the same encoder/decoder structure used for the key frame structure in , which is shown in Fig. 4. We also incorporate the same residual blocks, attention modules, and attention feature (AF) modules proposed in [ref]9. AF module allows training a single model that works for a range of SNRs by randomly choosing the channel SNR during training and providing the AF modules with the current SNR. A single model trained with AF modules is shown by [ref]9 to perform as well as the models trained for each SNR individually. Moreover, StyleGAN-2 generator structure and the recursive optimization of the intermediate latent vectors are the same as ILO . We apply our own objective as well as the forward operator as shown in Eqn. (12) and Fig. 3. Our forward operator A𝐴A lies within the class of non-linear and stochastic forward operators in the inverse problem taxonomy [ref]26, which is only partially known during test time due to the stochastic noise function η𝜂\\eta. The novelty of our InverseJSCC approach is that inverse problem solution has not been considered in the context of wireless communication, and partially known forward operators have not been investigated in this context yet. In the numerical results section, we show for the image domain that InverseJSCC provides perceptually high-quality images that better preserve the semantics of the source image despite communication over the noisy channel. This is achieved by exploiting the remarkable representation quality that DGMs have achieved in the image domain in the past few years. In particular, the improvements that InverseJSCC provides compared to DeepJSCC become more significant as the physical condition of the channel deteriorates.\nMoreover, we also show in Section V that InverseJSCC allows transferability by generating high-quality images even though the forward operator is trained on a different dataset. This is due to the fact that the inverse problem approach is based on successfully inverting the FP with the help of function A𝐴A, which gives the flexibility to use various forward operators.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: reconstructions at the receiver as the measurements, obtained by an unknown data sample going through a typically non-invertible forward process (FP).
