      "content": "Paper Title: NPENAS: Neural Predictor Guided Evolution for Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSearch strategy plays a critical role in efficiently exploring the search space for NAS. The commonly used search strategies include reinforcement learning (RL)    6, gradient-based methods     , Bayesian optimization [ref]3 [ref]4, evolutionary algorithms,      and predictor-based methods 6   . RL for NAS takes a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a controller to generate neural architectures sequentially. As NAS is essentially an optimization problem and RL is a more difficult problem than optimization [ref]3, the RL search strategy always needs thousands of GPU days to train the controller. Gradient-based methods adopt a single super-network to represent NAS’s search space and architecture in the search space can be realized by sampling a sub-network via an architecture distribution from the super-network. All the sampled architectures share weights in the same super-network, which can speed up the evaluation of each sampled architecture. This kind of method can also be categorized as weight sharing method from the perspective of architecture evaluation. Some previous research has reported that the gradient-based methods typically incur a large bias and suffer from instability   . Bayesian optimization utilizes an acquisition function defined from a surrogate model to sample the potential optimal solution . NASBOT [ref]3 adopted a Gaussian process as the surrogate model and presented a distance metric to calculate the kernel function, which involved a computationally intensive matrix inversion operation. BANANAS [ref]4 employed a collection of identical meta neural networks to predict the accuracy of candidate architectures, which avoided the inverse matrix operation. BANANAS outperformed a variety of NAS methods and achieve state-of-the-art error on NASBench-101 . However, the ensemble of meta neural networks prohibits the end-to-end training of neural predictors. Due to the superior performance of BANANAS, we choose BANANAS as the baseline for comparison in this paper. Previous EA-based methods      for NAS mainly focused on the design of architecture encoding, parent selection, and mutation strategies. All of them adopted one-to-one mutation operation, i.e., one parent generates one offspring. Due to the locality of the search space, a property by which the architectures that are “close by” tend to have similar performance metrics , and the phenomenon that EA usually generates offspring close to their parents , the searching overheads of EA are always enormous. Predictor-based NAS utilizes an approximated performance predictor to find promising architectures for further evaluating. Liu et al. 6 designed a neural predictor to guide the heuristic search to search the space of cell structures, starting with shallow models and progressing to complex ones. AlphaX  explored the search space via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and proposed a Meta-Deep Neural Network as a neural predictor to speed up the exploration. Wen et al.  adopted a complicated cascade neural predictor to rank all the architectures in search space, select the top-k architectures to fully evaluate, the architecture with the best performance from the evaluated architectures is reported. Ning et al.  proposed a graph-based neural architecture encoding scheme as a neural predictor and illustrated its performance by utilizing the neural predictor to integrate with existing NAS methods. In this paper, we propose to adopt the one-to-many mutation strategy, i.e., one parent generates multiple candidate architectures, to enhance the exploration ability of EA for NAS. In order to alleviate the computational burden of candidate architectures evaluation, we propose to utilize a neural predictor to rank the candidate architectures. Our study focuses on the design of the neural predictor and its integration with EA for NAS. Because of our proposed neural predictors’ superior performance, that may be of independent interest beyond the combining with EA for NAS.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: a critical role in efficiently exploring the search space for NAS.
