Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: AlphaBlock: Embodied Finetuning for Vision-Language Reasoning in Robot Manipulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCreating embodied agents that are capable of general instructions has consistently been an active research field in recent years 8  [ref]30. Noteworthy advancements have been made by various approaches.\nHiveformer  employs a history-based approach to enhance motor control by tracking the full history of observation-action pairs. Perceive-actor  encodes language goals and RGB-D voxel observations with a Perceiver Transformer to provide a strong structural prior.\nBC-Z  and RT-1  focus on scaling and expanding the collection of real-world data to facilitate generalization of robots. The field has also benefited greatly from significant progress in multi-modal foundation models like CLIP [ref]34, which have served as a catalyst for more advancements. InstructRL 5 employs a pre-trained multi-modal autoencoder Transformer  to encode instructions and observations, while PAFF  utilizes the pre-trained foundation models CLIP [ref]34 to provide feedback for relabeling demonstrations. In contrast to previous works that primarily focus on evaluating simple manipulation instructions such as “picking and placing objects”  [ref]30, we deal with high-level cognitive instructions in this work, such as “arrange building blocks as a smiley face.” Consequently, the transformation of these high-level instructions into executable sub-task plans becomes crucial.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Creating embodied agents that are capable of general instructions has consistently been an active research field in recent years 8  [ref]30.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
