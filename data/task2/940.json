      "content": "Paper Title: A Distributed Model-Free Ride-Sharing Approach for Joint Matching, Pricing, and Dispatching using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we detailed two novel approaches—Demand-Aware and Pricing-based Matching and route planning (DARM) framework and Distributed Pricing approach for Ride-Sharing with pooling (DPRS)—that generate ideal routes on-the-fly and involve both customers as well as drivers in the decision-making processes of ride acceptance/rejection and pricing. Agents’ decision-making process is informed by utility functions that aim to achieve the maximum profit for both drivers and customers. The utility functions also account for the fuel costs, waiting time, and passenger’s spending power to compute the reward. These novel DARM and DPRS methodologies are also integrated via a Deep Q-network (DQN) based dispatch algorithm where the profits influence the dispatch and the Q-values impact the pricing and thus matching. Contradictory to an expected high rejection rate when agents are given a choice to reject rides, experimental results show that the rejection rate is significantly low for (DARM + DPRS) framework. Given the maximum number of vehicles (8000 vehicles) populated in the simulation, our framework only uses 50% of the vehicles to accept and serve the demand of up to 96% of the requests. When compared with no ride-sharing baselines, our framework provides 10 times more profits. Experiments also show that vehicle idle time (cruising without passengers) is reduced to under two hours and 80% - 100% of the vehicles are occupied all the time. Our model-free DARM + DPRS framework can be extended to large-scale ride-sharing protocols due to distributed decision making for different vehicles reducing the decision space significantly.\n Extension of this work to consider travel-time uncertainty where riders can change their ride information on-the-fly , and to compute global plans for a flexible ridesharing with different objectives  is left as future work. Additional future directions of extending this work are: including capabilities of a joint delivery system for passengers and goods as in  (considered in part in [ref]44), or using multi-hop routing of passengers as in  and transit services as in  for efficient fleet utilization.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: objectives  is left as future work. Additional future directions of extending this work are: including capabilities of a joint delivery system for passengers and goods as in  (considered in part in [ref]44), or using multi-hop routing of passengers as in  and transit services as in  for efficient fleet utilization.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
