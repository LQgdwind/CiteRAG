      "content": "Paper Title: Layer-wise shared attention network on dynamical system perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAttention, a cognitive process that selectively focuses on a small part of information while neglects other perceivable information  , has been used to effectively ease neural networks from learning large information contexts from sentences   , images   and videos . Especially in computer vision, deep neural networks (DNNs) incorporated with special operators that mimic the attention mechanism can process informative regions of an image efficiently. These operators are modularized and plugged into networks as attention modules [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4.\nGenerally, the self-attention module can be divided into three parts: “extraction”, “processing” and “recalibration” like Figure 1. First, the plug-in module extracts internal features of a network which can be squeezed as the channel-wise information [ref]9 5, spatial information 2 0 1, etc. Next, the module processes the extraction and generates an attention map to measure the importance of the features map via a fully connected layer [ref]9, convolution layer 2, etc. Last, the attention map is applied to recalibrate the features.\nMost existing works adpot a common paradigm where the attention modules are individually plugged into each block throughout DNNs [ref]9 0 1 2. This paradigm facilitates researchers to focus on the optimization of three parts in SAM\nand\nallows a fair and fast comparison of the performance of the designed modules, which has greatly advanced the community. However, the drawbacks of such a paradigm are obvious, i.e., the computation and memory create a bottleneck with the increasing numbers of SAMs. Specifically, for DNNs, the performance and depth are closely related. Under a suitable training setting, deeper networks can achieve better performance. This empirical phenomenon reveals that if we connect the SAMs individually with each block of the entire DNN backbone for granted, then this will inevitably lead to increasing computational cost and numbers of parameters with the growth of network depth. Considering these practical issues, it is necessary and essential to ask a question: Do we really need to set up so many self-attention modules for every layer in a neural network? To answer this question fundamentally, we first consider the dynamical system perspective of residual neural networks (ResNets), which successfully explains some behaviors of DNNs and improves the performance of the model. In general, as shown in Table I, the forward process of ResNet can be modeled as a forward numerical method for a dynamical system as Eq.(1). where 𝐜0subscript𝐜0\\mathbf{c}_{0} represents an initial condition, which corresponds to the input in the residual network and 𝐮​(t)≡𝐮t𝐮𝑡subscript𝐮𝑡\\mathbf{u}(t)\\equiv\\mathbf{u}_{t} is a time-dependent d𝑑d-dimensional state, which is used to describe the input feature xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} of tthsuperscript𝑡tht^{\\rm th} block. The neural network f​(⋅;θt)𝑓⋅subscript𝜃𝑡f(\\cdot;\\theta_{t}) with learnable parameters θtsubscript𝜃𝑡\\theta_{t} in tthsuperscript𝑡tht^{\\rm th} block can be regarded as a integration S​(⋅;𝐟,Δ​t)𝑆⋅𝐟Δ𝑡S(\\cdot;\\mathbf{f},\\Delta t) with step Δ​tΔ𝑡\\Delta t and numerical method S𝑆S. Some existing works 6 7 8 9 0 consider that since for the state 𝐮tsubscript𝐮𝑡\\mathbf{u}_{t}, the numerical methods always are the same integration method S𝑆S for solving Eq.(1), thus they also use the block shared with the same parameters to process the input xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} in ResNet. This design forms the ResNet as a recurrent structure, and with a suitable training setup, such a structure can achieve a relatively good performance while the number of parameters of the model can be greatly reduced. Based on this view, as shown in Figure 2, the feature map of any block in the same stage (the collection of successive layers with the same spatial size) can be regarded as a point in the same vector space, since they are fed by a same neural network f​(⋅;θt)𝑓⋅subscript𝜃𝑡f(\\cdot;\\theta_{t}), i.e. these feature maps belong to a same domain of a function.\nTherefore, the feature maps in each vector space can be considered as homogenous, which means we can naturally use only one self-attention module 𝐀​(⋅;ϕshare)𝐀⋅subscriptitalic-ϕshare\\mathbf{A}(\\cdot;{\\color[rgb]{1,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{1,0,0}\\phi_{\\text{share}}}) for feature map f​(xt;θt)𝑓subscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝜃𝑡f(x_{t};\\theta_{t}) as instead of customizing self-attention modules 𝐀​(⋅;ϕt)𝐀⋅subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑡\\mathbf{A}(\\cdot;\\phi_{t}) for each block, as in Eq. (3).\nMoreover, for the feature maps from different stages, since the dimensions of the feature maps in different stages are different (e.g., for ResNet164, the dimensions of three stages are (64×32×32)643232(64\\times 32\\times 32), (128×16×16)1281616(128\\times 16\\times 16) and (256×8×8)25688(256\\times 8\\times 8), respectively) and they are generally considered to contain different information from low level to high level 1 2.\nTherefore, the features from different stages are usually supposed to be heterogeneous, which can be intuitively verified from the visualization of the feature maps in Figure 2, e.g., in different stages, “A1”, “A2” and “A3” look quite different. According to the above analyses, in the present work, we take a step forward toward efficient parameter sharing that we propose a novel-and-simple framework, i.e., sharing a self-attention module throughout different network layers to encourage the integration of layer-wise information, and this parameter-sharing module is referred to as dense-and-implicit-Attention (DIA) unit. The structure and computation flow of a DIA unit is visualized in Figure 3. There are also three parts: extraction (\\raisebox{-.9pt}{1}⃝), processing (\\raisebox{-.9pt}{2}⃝) and recalibration (\\raisebox{-.9pt}{3}⃝) in the DIA unit. The \\raisebox{-.9pt}{2}⃝ is the main module in the DIA unit to model network attention and is the key innovation of the proposed method where the parameters of the attention module are shared among different channels and blocks. In Section 4, we verify the performance of the DIA unit for several popular self-attention modules [ref]9 3 0 4 5. Our experiments show that DIA can significantly reduce the number of parameters in these modules on different backbones and datasets, while achieving competitive performance improvement without any elaborated model crafting. These results extensively demonstrate the versatility of the DIA unit.\nMoreover, to verify the versatility of our method across different artificial intelligence tasks and its transferability for the downstream tasks, in Section 5, we consider several benchmarks for DIA-LSTM, a kind of novel DIA architecture called DIA-LSTM, including image classification, object detection, and a medical application. Further experiments reveal that DIA-LSTM can consistently improve the performance of the model in different tasks.\nFurthermore, we conduct the ablation studies for DIA-LSTM in Section 6 and analyze how DIA benefits the training in Section 7.\nSpecifically, we destabilize the model training by (1) removing the skip connection of the residual neural network, (2) removing the batch normalization of the model, or (3) removing all data augmentation during training. In these cases, we verify that the dense and implicit connections formed by our method can effectively emphasize layer-wise feature interrelation, which can recover and enhance the information communication across layers and the value of the gradient thus alleviating the training instability.\nFinally, we have a discussion for DIA-LSTM.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: with special operators that mimic the attention mechanism can process informative regions of an image efficiently.
