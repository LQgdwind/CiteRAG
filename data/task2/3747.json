      "content": "Paper Title: PDNPulse: Sensing PCB Anomaly with the Intrinsic Power Delivery Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFacing numerous board-level attacks, detection methods have been developed, but they are often piecemeal solutions, capable of identifying only a particular attack under specific restrictions. Reverse Engineering and Image Inspections.\nReverse engineering   provide most comprehensive detection, but it suffers from long detection time and high cost, and it is destructive.\nImage inspection methods can be divided into surface imaging and volumetric imaging.\nSurface imaging uses such as visible light  and interferometry  to detect anomalies.\nCameras or microscopes are needed to detect the change of PCB surface pattern  or to visually examine PCBs .\nHowever, surface imaging cannot detect sophisticated counterfeits.\nFor volumetric imaging using radiation, X-ray   is commonly applied to comprehensively capture the internal structure of PCBs, which also suffers high cost and needs to de-solder components.\nIn contrast, our method does not require expensive optical/X-ray equipment and can be conducted with a standard VNA. Side-Channel Analysis. System-level delay side-channel information\n(such as based on JTAG , I2C ),\npower side-channel information , or combined\nmultiparameter side-channel analysis  can be utilized to\nperform anomaly detection and run-time monitoring.\nAlthough, power and delay side-channel leakage are fundamentally caused by the PDN of target devices,\ntheir analysis is usually limited to specific anomaly types and offers only partial PCB area coverage.\nRather than relying on leaked information, we directly measure the PDN and thus can retrieve more in-depth\ninformation.\n Impedance Measurement.\nThe changes to impedance patterns, resonant frequency, signal response of the trace, bus, or transmission line can be measured to detect anomalies       .\nHowever, due to using parts of the PCB design (e.g., bus), these approaches can only detect the anomalies attached to this trace, limiting both detectable anomaly types and locations.\nSince PDNPulse is based on the PDN, which is connected to each part of the system, the coverage of detection is significantly increased. PDN Impedance-based Measurement.\nPDN impedance-based detection has been explored in various ways  [ref]55.\nAs discussed in Sec.I, although successful, existing PDN impedance solutions only focus on specific types of anomalies and parts features (e.g., impedance at fixed frequencies) of the local PDN.\nOur work comprehensively explores the characteristics of PDN of the whole PCB.\nWe specify the systematic analysis of PDN effects and the experimental setup for accurate multi-port, multi-domain PDN measurements and demonstrate experimentally PDNPulse’s robustness to probe location, PCB scale, and port numbers.\nOur extensive experimental results show PDNPulse’s effectiveness in detecting board-level attacks and counterfeiting. In recent work  , the authors proposed a PCB tampering and counterfeit detection framework based on monitoring changes in the scatter parameters (i.e., S-parameters) of the PDN. Our work, PDNPulse, is distinct from this approach as we utilize multi-port and multi-domain detection, measuring transfer impedance between ports to detect system-level anomalies. Additionally, we use Z-parameters, which are commonly used in modeling PDN    , allowing for direct comparison with simulation results to better interpret and model the impacts of anomalies. Our measurement setup also utilizes a customized probe that can be applied to legacy systems and attached to any point on the PCB, eliminating the need for hardware modifications and allowing for multi-port detection. Our experiments cover a wide range of PCBs, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method in various design scenarios.\nOverall, our work achieves a unique contribution to the field.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: which is connected to each part of the system, the coverage of detection is significantly increased.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
