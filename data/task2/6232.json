      "content": "Paper Title: Prediction Error-based Classification for Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost approaches to CIL rely on discriminative classification (see Figure 1(a)) together with some mechanism to prevent forgetting. Among those, some methods use a memory buffer in which data from past tasks are stored, while others refrain from it. As storing data might be forbidden in some protocols, it is often considered a desirable property for CIL methods to not rely on a memory buffer. When stored data from past tasks is available, the typical approach is to revisit that data when training on new data. For instance, Experience Replay (ER)  directly retrains on the buffer data, while A-GEM [ref]7 uses the stored data for gradient projections to reduce interference between tasks. Dark Experience Replay (DER)  is a form of ER that combines replay with self-distillation. Further variants of DER include DER++ and X-DER [ref]4.\niCaRL [ref]38 combines replay with a nearest-mean-of-exemplars classifier in the feature space. BiC  additionally uses stored data to calibrate logits for classes coming from different tasks, and thus can be classified as a bias-correcting algorithm. Among methods that do not store data, sometimes referred to as rehearsal-free, there are\nregularization-based approaches that add an auxiliary term to the loss function, discouraging large changes to parts of the model important for past tasks. For example, EWC  relies on a diagonal approximation of the Fisher matrix to weigh the contributions from different parameters. Additionally, there are rehearsal-free bias-correcting algorithms such as the Labels trick , which only incorporates classes from the current task in the loss function to prevent negative bias on past tasks. Another paradigm for CIL, which also does not require a memory buffer, is generative classification, where class-conditional generative models are leveraged directly for classification, see Figure 1(b).\nFor example, in an approach described in , a separate variational autoencoder (VAE)  is trained for every class; we refer to this method as VAE-GC. However, when only a single pass through the data is allowed, VAE models might be too complex, and generative classifiers based on simpler models might be preferred. One option is SLDA , which can be interpreted as learning a Gaussian distribution for each class with a shared covariance matrix . This can be simplified further by using an identity covariance matrix, in which case it becomes the Nearest mean classifier.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: data from past tasks is available, the typical approach is to revisit that data when training on new data.
