      "content": "Paper Title: A Deep RL Approach on Task Placement and Scaling of Edge Resources for Cellular Vehicle-to-Network Service Provisioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn line with the development of ML techniques, different standardization bodies also started to consider and include the use of ML methods into their architecture specification and roadmaps. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has started exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML technologies for 5th generation (5G) systems across the Radio Access Network (RAN) and core domain and in the management plane. In the RAN domain, the O-RAN Alliance defined  non-Real-Time (RT) and near-RT Radio Intelligent Controller (RIC) [ref]29  to empower self-driving, leveraging new learning-based technologies to automate operational network functions and reduce operational costs. Similarly, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)’s Industry Specification Group (ISG) Experiential Network Intelligence (ENI)  focuses on AI-enabled network management and proposed the cognitive network management system based on AI, which allows operators to improve the flexibility in the network operation, by automating network configuration and monitoring processes.\nThe goal is to achieve a seamlessly network automation, as envisioned by ETSI Zero touch network & Service Management (ZSM) , which focuses on network service automation and is working on the definition of a network architecture that supports various functionality such as the end-to-end network service management and network slice as a service.\nIn addtion to the 3GPP and ETSI,\nthe International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication standardization sector (ITU-T) Focus Group on Autonomous Networks (FGAN) also studies how to apply ML for building autonomous networks. With the increasing number of available data sets and growing maturity of the AI/ML techniques in recent years, it is feasible to achieve the standarization\ncommunity vision of building autonomous networks\nusing ML solutions. In this direction, there have been quite some research work of adopting the AI/ML algorithms to solve service function chain (SFC) placement problem, that is quite similar to the service task placement problem in this paper. Traditional solutions mostly use mathematical models or heuristic methods, which are usually not applicable in the context of large-scale networks. Leveraging intelligent learning algorithms, efficient solutions can automatically adapt to changes in the dynamic network environment and service load through learning. For example  proposes a joint optimization approach of flow path selection and VNF placement, which explores the best utilization of bandwidth to reduce network delay for delay-sensitive applications. Authors employ Reinforcement Learning, while they use both the flow path delay and network function-related delay for the estimating the reward for placing VNFs. Similarly,  presents a multi-objective optimization SFC placement algorithm based on reinforcement learning. The goal of the algorithm is to optimize resource allocation, considering several performance metrics. The authors model the problem as an MDP, and use a two-layer policy network as an intelligent agent. Authors in [ref]35 employ a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) approach to address admission control for the SFC placement problem.\nThe SFC placement problem has been also investigated in the context of Edge-enabled 5G/6G networks. For instance  develops a practical solution using Q-Learning, considering both computational and communication resources when placing VNFs in the network. In the area of resource scaling, authors in [ref]37\nclassify the scaling techniques as either\nschedule-based or rule-based solutions, with the\nlatter being related to auto scaling methods.\nSpecifically, authors in [ref]37\nshow that threshold-based policies, queuing theory,\ncontrol theory, time-series analysis, and RL are candidates for rule-based auto scaling.\nHowever, among the prior rule-based auto scaling\nsolutions RL is not the only\nAI/ML approach – as pointed out by .\nSome works propose using classification-based\nML solutions  that tell\nwhether the current network status lies within\na category that requires to scale up; and other\nworks  propose to forecast the\nfuture network demand to trigger an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver that takes provisioning and scaling decisions. Forecasting the future traffic demand is actually\nthe most proliferous approach, since an accurate\nestimation of the incoming demand provides rich\ninsights\nto anticipate the scaling operation.\nWorks in the literature\nforecast the future demand resorting to classic\ntime-series techniques such as AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) or\nTES  ,\nNeural Network (NN) solutions based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells\n , convolutional neural networks , or even Graph Neural Network (GNN) s .\nSuch approaches have been successfully used in the\ncontext of effective network\nslicing   \nand cloud dimensioning .\nBut despite the context where forecasting is used,\nit is important to keep in mind that\nAI/ML approaches require large amounts\nof data and computing resources, whilst traditional\ntime-series approaches do not. Thus, the interest\nof works as  is\ncomparing the trade-offs between traditional\nand AI/ML solutions for forecast-assisted\nscaling. In the context of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services, there is\na rich literature on how to use\nAI/ML solutions to automatically scale radio resources.\nAuthors in  propose an autoencoder and\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that detects incoming\nroad events to allocate radio resources for different\nslices (infotainment or emergency services).\nAuthors in 0 resort to DQN 1\nto provision radio resources for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) services, while 2\nassesses channel resource allocation for V2X\nservices using a blend of LSTM with\nAdvantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Deep Q-Network (DQN). Authors in 3 use\nA2C and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to select the\nradar channel, such that the age of information of high\npriority notifications is minimized.\nHowever, all the aforementioned works use\nAI/ML to auto scale or manage the\nwireless resources for vehicular networks.\nTo the best of our knowledge, approaches studied in this context neglect that fact that edge computing resources should\nalso scale with the increase in vehicular service demand. There are however cases where either servers with fixed\nresources are considered 4, or BS s are associated with slices that offer static computational\nresources 5. Moreover, existing approaches address the function/task placement and scaling problems separately. Our work advances the state-of-the-art by jointly assessing task placement and\nscaling of computational resources coupling the two problems and considering their inter-dependency, to support C-V2N applications at scale over a city area spanning multiple PoP s.\nFurthermore, we employ DDPG rather than the widely used A2C agents to scale edge computing resources and prove its efficiency and applicability in both centralized and decentralized decision making modes.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: across the Radio Access Network (RAN) and core domain and in the management plane.
