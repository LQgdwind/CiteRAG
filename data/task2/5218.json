      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion Video Autoencoders: Toward Temporally Consistent Face Video Editing via Disentangled Video Encoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs one of the standard tasks in computer vision to change various face attributes such as hair color, gender, or glasses of a given face image, face editing has been continuously gaining attention due to its various applications and entertainment. In particular, with the improvement of analysis and manipulation techniques for recent Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models     2, we simply can do this task by manipulating a given image’s latent feature. In addition, very recently, many methods for face image editing also have been proposed based on Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM)-based methods that show high-quality and flexible manipulation performance   3   . Naturally,\nfurther studies [ref]41 5  have been proposed to extend image editing methods to incorporate the temporal axis for videos. Now, given real videos with a human face, these studies try to manipulate some target facial attributes with the other remaining features and motion intact.\nThey all basically edit each frame of a video independently via off-the-shelf StyleGAN-based image editing techniques  2 [ref]41. Despite the advantages of StyleGAN in this task such as high-resolution image generation capability and highly disentangled semantic representation space, one harmful drawback of GAN-based editing methods is that the encoded real images cannot perfectly be recovered by the pretrained generator 4 6 . Especially, if a face in a given image is unusually decorated or occluded by some objects, the fixed generator cannot synthesize it. For perfect reconstruction, several methods 7  are suggested to further tune the generator for GAN-inversion 4 6 on one or a few target images, which is computationally expensive. Moreover, after the fine-tuning, the original editability of GANs cannot be guaranteed. This risk could be worse in video domain since we have to finetune the model on the multiple frames. Aside from the reconstruction issue of existing GAN-based methods, it is critical in video editing tasks to consider the temporal consistency among edited frames to produce realistic results.\nTo address this, some prior works rely on the smoothness of the latent trajectory of the original frames 5 or smoothen the latent features directly  by simply taking the same editing step for all frames. However, smoothness does not ensure temporal consistency. Rather, the same editing step can make different results for different frames because it can be unintentionally entangled with irrelevant motion features. For example, in the middle row of Fig. 1, eyeglasses vary across time and sometimes diminish when the man closes his eyes. In this paper, we propose a novel video editing framework for human face video, termed Diffusion Video Autoencoder, that resolves the limitations of the prior works. First, instead of GAN-based editing methods suffering from imperfect reconstruction quality, we newly introduce diffusion based model for face video editing tasks. As the recently proposed diffusion autoencoder (DiffAE) 3 does, thanks to the expressive latent spaces of the same size as input space, our model learns a semantically meaningful latent space that can perfectly recover the original image back and are directly editable. Not only that, for the first time as a video editing model, encode the decomposed features of the video: 1) identity feature shared by all frames, 2) feature of motion or facial expression in each frame, and 3) background feature that could not have high-level representation due to large variances. Then, for consistent editing, we simply manipulate a single invariant feature for the desired attribute (single editing operation per video), which is also computationally beneficial compared to the prior works that require editing the latent features of all frames. We experimentally demonstrate that our model appropriately decomposes videos into time-invariant and per-frame variant features and can provide temporally consistent manipulation. Specifically, we explore two ways of manipulation. The first one is to edit features in the predefined set of attributes by moving semantic features to the target direction found by learning linear classifier in semantic representation space on annotated CelebA-HQ dataset 0. Additionally, we explore the text-based editing method that optimizes a time-invariant latent feature with CLIP loss . It is worth noting that since we cannot fully generate edited images for CLIP loss due to the computational cost, we propose the novel strategy that rather uses latent state of intermediate time step for the efficiency. To summarize, our contribution is four-fold: We devise diffusion video autoencoders based on diffusion autoencoders 3 that decompose the video into a single time-invariant and per-frame time-variant features for temporally consistent editing. Based on the decomposed representation of diffusion video autoencoder, face video editing can be conducted by editing only the single time-invariant identity feature and decoding it together with the remaining original features. Owing to the nearly-perfect reconstruction ability of diffusion models, our framework can be utilized to edit exceptional cases such that a face is partially occluded by some objects as well as usual cases. In addition to the existing predefined attributes editing method, we propose a text-based identity editing method based on the local directional CLIP loss 4  for the intermediately generated product of diffusion video autoencoders.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: face image editing also have been proposed based on Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM)-based methods that show high-quality and flexible manipulation performance   3   .
