      "content": "Paper Title: A 23 ùúáW Keyword Spotting IC with Ring-Oscillator-Based Time-Domain Feature Extraction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFig.¬†16 shows the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting IC, which is fabricated in TSMC 65 nm CMOS LP process with an active area of 2.03mm2 for the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting core. The area occupied by the analog and digital circuits is 1.6mm2 (79%) and 0.428mm2 (21%) respectively in the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting core. The \\pdftooltipGRUGated Recurrent Unit-\\pdftooltipFCFully Connected neural network accelerator and the associated peripherals in the digital circuits are synthesized from a standard auto place-and-route (P&R) flow. Fig. 17(a) and (b) show the measured frequency response of the 16-channel \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor with and without per-channel gain calibration. In this case, VIN,VTCsubscriptùëâIN,VTCV_{\\text{IN,VTC}} was connected to a function generator. The center frequencies of the 16 \\pdftooltipBPFBand-Pass Filter channels range from 111‚ÄâHz to 10.4‚ÄâkHz. The center frequencies are distributed according to the Mel scale therefore low-frequency (<<1 kHz) channels are spaced further apart than high-frequency channels. As shown in Fig. 17(a), the measured gain curve before the calibration shows the inter-channel gain deviations which are caused by systematic mismatches from the \\pdftooltipSROSwitched-Ring-Oscillator-based \\pdftooltipPFMPulse-Frequency Modulation encoder. The main cause of gain deviation is the voltage bias (VVARsubscriptùëâVARV_{\\text{VAR}} in Fig. 11) which is generated from a single \\pdftooltipFLLFrequency-Locked Loop circuit and it is shared over the 16-channel \\pdftooltipSROSwitched-Ring-Oscillator as depicted as ‚Äò\\pdftooltipFLLFrequency-Locked Loop (\\pdftooltipSROSwitched-Ring-Oscillator)‚Äô in the chip photograph. We expect this systematic mismatch due to distribution of the voltage bias can be improved with a better layout floorplan, for example with a centralized placement of the bias circuits while the random mismatch can be improved with larger sizing of the biasing transistors. Fig. 17(c) shows the measured output spectrum of channel 8 for two different input conditions of the \\pdftooltipVTCVoltage-to-Time Converter; the black curve is obtained with a zero input condition while the red curve is obtained with a 2 kHz sinusoidal input of 390 mVPP. Here, the amplitude of the input to the \\pdftooltipVTCVoltage-to-Time Converter circuit was assumed to be sufficiently large, and our future work will include an additional ultra-low-power pre-amplifier  before the \\pdftooltipVTCVoltage-to-Time Converter circuit. The oversampling clock frequency that is fed into the XOR differentiator is 62.5‚ÄâkHz. It is clearly seen that the output spectrum has a first-order noise-shaping property with a 20‚ÄâdB/dec slope for both input conditions. After the feature data is decimated by 210, the in-band frequency is limited as 30‚ÄâHz which is translated into a 16‚Äâms frame shift or 61‚Äâframe/s throughput, and so the 16-channel \\pdftooltipFVFeature Vector is generated every 16‚Äâms. The integrated in-band noise with zero input is calculated as 248 Œºùúá\\muVRMS, which is dominated by 1/f1ùëì1/f noise. When the input amplitude is increased to 390 mVPP, the in-band noise is dominated by thermal noise. We believe that the noise increase is caused by a higher running frequency of the \\pdftooltipSROSwitched-Ring-Oscillator, since the phase noise of ring oscillators increases with operating frequency . Fig. 18 shows the measured audio response of the \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor. A 254‚ÄâmVPP ‚ÄúYes‚Äù keyword sample from \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Dataset is selected and applied to the \\pdftooltipVTCVoltage-to-Time Converter while measuring the \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor output. The magnitudes of \\pdftooltipFVFeature Vector in this figure are normalized by subtracting DC offset and dividing by the standard deviation of the sample clip, for better visualization. It is clearly seen that the 16-channel \\pdftooltipFVFeature Vector has higher response at low frequencies for the ‚ÄúYe‚Äù sound, and at higher frequencies for the ‚Äús‚Äù sound. Fig. 19 shows the measured \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting accuracy of the prototype chip obtained using the full 12-class verification flow of the \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Datasetv2 . The 12 classes include ‚ÄúSilence‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù, and 10 target keywords. As shown in the measurement setup in Fig.‚Äâ‚Äâ16, the generated \\pdftooltipFVsFeature Vector (FVRawsubscriptFVRaw\\text{FV}_{\\text{Raw}} in Fig.¬†3) from our time-domain \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor are recorded using the \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Dataset training set that is fed to the \\pdftooltipVTCVoltage-to-Time Converter of our chip (VIN,VTCsubscriptùëâIN,VTCV_{\\text{IN,VTC}} in Fig.¬†16), to train the classifier network. The 16 ms frame window and 16 ms frame shift (stride) are used for recording, so there is no overlap between two consecutive frames. The detected class is the most active output at the end of the \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Dataset sample. The prototype \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting IC achieves an overall 86.03% accuracy with the \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Dataset test set. The measured true positive rates show that ‚ÄúSilence‚Äù is the easiest class with 100% accuracy and the classifier performed the best on two keywords, ‚ÄúStop‚Äù and ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù with 93% accuracy. The most challenging class is ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù class since it includes 25 non-target keywords such as ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù and ‚ÄúDog,‚Äù which requires the classifier to train more parameters with larger model capacity to improve the accuracy. We expect that the detection accuracy of ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù and thus the overall accuracy on this \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting dataset will improve with a larger network model, but at the expense of additional power consumption and silicon area.\nThe state-of-the-art accuracy on \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Dataset using \\pdftooltipGRUGated Recurrent Unit-\\pdftooltipRNNsRecurrent Neural Network is 94.2%  with a network which has 499‚ÄâKB parameters and running on a Cortex-M7 microcontroller. This network size would require 21√ó\\times more on-chip memory leading to higher power consumption and chip area. Fig.¬†20 shows the dependence of the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting classification accuracy on added noise levels to the recorded feature vector FVRawsubscriptFVRaw\\text{FV}_{\\text{Raw}} (see Fig.¬†3). We first computed the average power PAvg,GSCDsubscriptùëÉAvg,GSCDP_{\\text{Avg,GSCD}} using the recorded FVRawsubscriptFVRaw\\text{FV}_{\\text{Raw}} (see Section¬†III-F). Then Gaussian noise of different standard deviation values (œÉ2=PAvg,Noisesuperscriptùúé2subscriptùëÉAvg,Noise\\sigma^{2}=P_{\\text{Avg,Noise}}) were added to create different SNR values following the equation below. The noise is randomly generated for each training epoch and test evaluation. For each \\pdftooltipSNRSignal-to-Noise Ratio case, our \\pdftooltipGRUGated Recurrent Unit-\\pdftooltipFCFully Connected network is retrained using the noisy training set and the noisy test set is used to evaluate the classification accuracy. The proposed \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting IC ensures <<1% accuracy drop even for noise levels up to 432‚ÄâŒºùúá\\muVRMS (input-referred to VIN,VTCsubscriptùëâIN,VTCV_{\\text{IN,VTC}}), or 40‚ÄâdB \\pdftooltipSNRSignal-to-Noise Ratio. Fig.¬†21 shows the power breakdown of the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting IC. As it is stated in Section¬†I, this paper focuses on the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting core only therefore the power breakdown in Fig.¬†21 does not include energy harvester, low-dropout regulator, and voltage reference circuits. The total power consumption of the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting core is 23‚ÄâŒºùúá\\muW when it is measured at 25‚àòC room temperature. The \\pdftooltipGRUGated Recurrent Unit-\\pdftooltipFCFully Connected neural network accelerator accounts for 43% of the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting core power. When the 16IN-48H-48H-12C \\pdftooltipGRUGated Recurrent Unit-\\pdftooltipFCFully Connected network is updated at 250 kHz clock frequency and 0.75‚ÄâV supply voltage while performing continual inference on random \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Dataset samples with 16 ms frame shift, the accelerator consumes 9.96‚ÄâŒºùúá\\muW. The accelerator power consumption can be further decomposed into dynamic power (75%) and leakage (or static) power (25%). The leakage power is dominated by the \\pdftooltipSRAMStatic Random Access Memory block (78%) while both logic (44%) and \\pdftooltipSRAMStatic Random Access Memory (56%) contributed rather evenly to the dynamic power. We expect that leakage power can be reduced with custom memory cells . Table I compares the performance of our time-domain \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor with the state-of-the-art voice processing analog \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor    . The proposed \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor circuit is the first that demonstrated ring-oscillator-based \\pdftooltipBPFBand-Pass Filter topology used for the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting task. It supports \\pdftooltipSESingle-Ended microphones, thereby offering a lower system-level power. Unlike sequential \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor, our parallel \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor does not lose frequency-selective information at any time . To allow a fair comparison with previously reported designs with a variety of frame shifts, we derive a Schreier Figure of Merit (FoM)  (8), widely used for \\pdftooltipADCsAnalog-to-Digital Converter. The Schreier FoM considers the trade-off between \\pdftooltipDRDynamic Range and bandwidth, also accounting for power consumption. For near DC input \\pdftooltipADCsAnalog-to-Digital Converter, the bandwidth is replaced with a reciprocal of conversion time . As a band-pass filtered signal is demodulated into baseband (DC) after the rectifier   or mixer  stage, we consider analog \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor as a DC-input \\pdftooltipADCAnalog-to-Digital Converter with a pre-processing stage. The \\pdftooltipFoMFigure of Merit equation (8) includes the normalized power consumption PNormsubscriptùëÉNormP_{\\text{Norm}} (7) proposed in , the \\pdftooltipDRDynamic Range, and the frame shift. The frame shift is part of the denominator of (8) because the \\pdftooltipFVsFeature Vector are generated in every frame shift. The amount of integrated in-band noise is reduced with a larger decimation window (i.e., averaged over the longer time interval) in our design and also in  where the number of \\pdftooltipADCAnalog-to-Digital Converter cycles was used for decimation window. The proposed \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor records the best Schreier FoM among the state-of-the-art designs. In addition, the time-domain processing circuits offer better technology scaling, and will outperform voltage-domain designs     in terms of power and area when implemented in advanced technology nodes. Table II compares the performance of our KWS IC with other state-of-the-art \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting ICs 8 9   . This work uses an on-chip analog \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor while other works needed an off-chip high-resolution (16-bit) \\pdftooltipADCAnalog-to-Digital Converter 8 . Sometimes even the digital \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor and \\pdftooltipADCAnalog-to-Digital Converter were implemented off-chip 9. Furthermore, only this work and  support the essential ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù class to be detected as a distinct class, which is the most challenging class in the \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Dataset test set. As such, it implies that concessions would be made in terms of \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting accuracy for 9  , or a larger model size will be required for the classifier to uphold the accuracy, leading to additional power and area costs. In addition, the proposed chip supports \\pdftooltipSESingle-Ended microphone interface and the \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting task is verified with a \\pdftooltipSESingle-Ended input condition. This work shows competitive performance and better system-level power efficiency by using a low-power \\pdftooltipMEMSMicro-Electromechanical Systems \\pdftooltipSESingle-Ended microphone instead of the differential microphone used in . Last but not least, our prototype chip is the first silicon-verified analog \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor-based voice processing IC that demonstrates 12-class \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting task on \\pdftooltipGSCDGoogle Speech Command Dataset, using an on-chip classifier. Our belief is that the 5% degradation in the classification accuracy of our \\pdftooltipKWSKeyword Spotting IC (86%) as compared to the software model accuracy (91%, Section¬†II) is mainly due to the increased noise floor when the input amplitude is high, as shown in Fig.¬†17(c). Advanced noise suppression techniques such as chopper stabilization [ref]43 and dynamic element matching  when applied to the front-end, will help mitigate the accuracy discrepancy. Our time-domain \\pdftooltipFExFeature Extractor still needs to address the per-chip gain calibration requirement due to the mismatch of analog circuits, which is not necessary in a fully-digital approach . For this, as discussed in the paragraph in Section¬†IV describing Fig.¬†17(a), improved layout floorplan and larger device sizes accompanied with mismatch-aware \\pdftooltipDNNDeep Neural Network training  will be another opportunity to remove the calibration requirement.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: accuracy (91%, Section¬†II) is mainly due to the increased noise floor when the input amplitude is high, as shown in Fig.¬†17(c).
