      "content": "Paper Title: SoftCLIP: Softer Cross-modal Alignment Makes CLIP Stronger\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince OpenAI proposed Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) [ref]28, large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) has achieved rapid development. Many approaches 7  [ref]9  have been proposed and achieved remarkable success on several downstream tasks. Among these methods, the alignment of the visual and linguistic modalities is a critical component, often requiring the use of image-text contrastive learning. This learning process aims to bring paired image and text samples closer while simultaneously pushing unpaired samples away, necessitating the complete mutual exclusivity between any two unpaired samples.\nHowever, acquiring high-quality image-text pairs is a challenging task, owing to the fact that the majority of image-text pairs are obtained through web crawling over the Internet, which frequently results in significant noise. As evidenced in Figure 1(a), there are some local similarities between the three pairs, the caption of (i) can also be used to describe the image (ii) and (iii), indicating many-to-many relationships instead of perfect one-to-one correspondences, which is also pointed out in CLIP-PSD . Therefore, it is too harsh and unreasonable to completely push away the image (i) and the text (ii)/(iii). Recent work PyramidCLIP [ref]9 also noticed this problem and proposed to use label smoothing  to mitigate this problem. However, assigning equal weight to all the negative samples is improper and ignores the information pertaining to their relationships. The neglect of the potential distinctions among negative samples results in the underutilization of valuable information and an incomplete understanding of the underlying data structure. In this paper, we propose SoftCLIP, a novel approach that relaxes the strict one-to-one contrastive constraint and leverages the intra-modal discriminative information to guide the interaction between visual and linguistic modalities. Specifically, we employ fine-grained intra-modal self-similarities as the softened targets for soft cross-modal alignments. Figure 1(b) illustrates how our softened targets allow for the existence of some similarities between the image (i) and the text (ii)/(iii). By incorporating the softened targets, SoftCLIP overcomes the limitations of traditional contrastive methods and captures the nuanced information between visual and linguistic modalities, leading to a significant improvement in cross-modal learning. Furthermore, treating different negative samples with different weights helps the model to capture the authentic distribution of data more effectively. However, the contribution of negatives in the softened target distribution can still be overwhelmed by the dominant positive one. To address this problem, we take further step to disentangle the negatives in the distribution. Specifically, we sift out the negative logits regardless of the positive logit in both prediction and target distributions with renormalization, and then bring the new two distributions closer, which boosts the relation alignment with negatives and brings further improvement. Extensive experiments on several downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SoftCLIP. Specifically, using CC3M /CC12M 1 as pre-training dataset and ResNet50 1-Transformer 4 as the image-text encoder, SoftCLIP achieved 24.2%/43.2% top-1 accuracy on zero-shot ImageNet  classification task, which is 6.8%/7.2% higher than its baseline CLIP. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose to employ fine-grained intra-modal self-similarities as softened targets for cross-modal learning, thereby alleviating the problem of non-strict mutual exclusion between any two pairs. We boost the relation alignment with negatives by disentangling the negatives in the distribution to alleviate them being overwhelmed by the positive one. We also use symmetric KL-Divergence to replace the conventional cross-entropy when incorporating the softened targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SoftCLIP, which can steadily bring significant improvements under various scales of pre-training data and various model architectures.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Since OpenAI proposed Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) [ref]28, large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) has achieved rapid development.
