Examples are hypergraph domains, multigraph domains, directed graph domains, etc. This result provides an alternative way to design individual GNNs for a specific graph domain. First, each graph in the domain can be transformed into a SAUHG and then a standard message passing GNN (such as OGNN , GIN  or a GNN characterized by sufficiently \"expressive\" AGGREGATE and COMBINE functions) can be used. as we take into account a discrete recurrent model\nworking on graph snapshots (also known as Stacked\nDGNN); nevertheless, in [ 15 ] several DGNNs of this\nkind are listed, such as GCRN-M1 [ 37], RgCNN [ 38],\nPATCHY-SAN [ 39 ], DyGGNN , and others. Still,\nthe approximation capability depends both on the functions\nAGGREGATE and COMBINE designed for each GNN\nworking on the single snapshot and the implemented\nrecurrent neural network. As an example, the most\ngeneral model, the original Recurrent Neural Network\nhas been proved to be a universal approximator  Theorem 5.2.3 doesn’t hold for any Dynamic GNN, as we take into account a discrete recurrent model working on graph snapshots (also known as Stacked DGNN); nevertheless, in[ref]15 several DGNN of this kind are listed, such as GCRN-M1 , RgCNN [ref]37, PATCHY-SAN , DyGGNN , and others.\nStill, the approximation capability depends both on the functions AGGREGATE and COMBINE designed for each GNN working on the single snapshot and the implemented Recurrent Neural Network. As an example, the most general model, the original RNN, has been proved to be a universal approximator .\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: a universal approximator  Theorem 5.2.3 doesn’t hold for any Dynamic GNN, as we take into account a discrete recurrent model working on graph snapshots (also known as Stacked DGNN); nevertheless, in[ref]15 several DGNN of this kind are listed, such as GCRN-M1 , RgCNN [ref]37, PATCHY-SAN , DyGGNN , and others.\nStill, the approximation capability depends both on the functions AGGREGATE and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
