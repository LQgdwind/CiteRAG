      "content": "Paper Title: Catch Me If You Can: Semi-supervised Graph Learning for Spotting Money Laundering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we employed semi-supervised graph learning techniques on graphs of financial transactions in order to identify nodes involved in potential money laundering. We use SARs annotations from alerts as the ground truths. We trained different GE models such as Word2vec, Node2vec, Attri2Vec, GraphSAGE, and DGT models that embed the nodes into a lower dimensional vector space. Then, using the embeddings, we trained RF, GBT, and ERT classifiers to predict the suspiciousness of a given target node in the graph via direct or indirect connections to nodes known to be suspicious. Further, we critically reviewed existing AML methods and outlined their potential limitations. With the rapid development of a cashless society engaged in global economic exchange, the advent of cryptocurrency has catalyzed a paradigm shift in peer-to-peer transactions and extranational financial governance. Cryptocurrencies not only impose great challenges to AML but also increase difficulty across cryptocurrency types. Another challenge lies involving temporal dynamics with the emergence/disappearance of new entities in the blockchain. For example, Weber et al. [ref]27 have shown that at time step the market may appear to follow Dark Market shutdown. In such a situation, no models (including EvolveGCN or DGT) would be able to capture such high volatility and consequently may not perform well. AML detection mechanisms as explored in this study are not immune to attacks, while deep models may lack robustness under adversarial attacks. A transactional dataset itself might be viewed as private since the transactional dataset contains sensitive personal information and data with a high monetary value for the organisation possessing it. Thus, any form of privacy attack that could potentially disclose privacy-sensitive information could be very costly. Moreover, an adversary might craft202020e.g., by adding noise or minor perturbations in the embedding space. a series of specific transactions to fool the AML detection system to classify an illicit transaction to be licit. Such adversarial attacks are real security threats for any financial systems [ref]36. On the other hand, since the computed embeddings might need to be shared, which an attacker could apply techniques to reverse212121e.g., by employing a sophisticated approach for input reconstruct. to original input or link back to a natural person. Further, a deployed AML detection model could be directly attacked too. In particular, membership inference attacks [ref]37 can be introduced in order to disclose whether a particular training record was used to train the model. In future studies, we will expand on this research and apply realistic attacks on AML detection algorithms in order to assess whether sensitive information can be disclosed or fool the model to hide illicit transactions. Based on that, we will also explore defence strategies to mitigate these attacks. One popular defence strategy against privacy attacks is differential privacy .\nOur main results learn from graphs which are totally available, such as graphs of banking transactions in blockchains where these are public. However, there are also many real-life scenario in classical banking where money-launderers take advantage of banks by not disclosing private transactions to split the laundered amounts into intermediates across different banks to go undetected (cf. the model of), and we would also like to provide tools to grant financial authorities the ability to detect such patterns with these privacy constraints, as a complementary approach to the more efficient learning methods on public graphs presented in previous sections. Work on this topic has already been done in literature , to give a cryptographic functional encryption scheme to allow ’s similarity calculations to be performed by financial authorities on data from concurrent banks. However, size of embedding vectors on which the similarity scores are calculated are linear w.r.t number of existing bank accounts, which would be huge in a practical use-case. Using graph embedding techniques the way we have in previous sections could drastically improve these sizes. One of the challenges in this context is for banks to provide embeddings of each of their nodes (the bank accounts), from the graph of transactions, knowing only the subgraph of the transactions made to and from the accounts they control. Because of this, we will perform an embedding depending only on nodes’ first neighbors, those they are directly having transactions with. This is also relevant with respect to the corresponding first topological pattern in fig. 1, as we are considering intermediate nodes split across different banks but having the same direct neighbors, and this is the sole criteria upon which we would want to have similar node embeddings. Hence, we use a variant of fast random projection embeddings that we describe with the following algorithm steps, to get the incoming (resp. outgoing) transaction embeddings: Each node n𝑛n in the subgraph and its direct neighbors gets an initial random embedding vector value en,0subscript𝑒𝑛0e_{n,0} from a public hash function on the node, instantiated with a public seed (and with no null outputs). For each node n𝑛n in the subgraph, denoting N𝑁N the set of its direct neighbors, and wi→jsubscript𝑤→𝑖𝑗w_{i\\to j} the amounts sent from account i𝑖i to account j𝑗j (i.e. the weight on the oriented edge from i𝑖i to j𝑗j, for any nodes i𝑖i, j𝑗j, and setting that weight to 0 when the nodes are not connected), n𝑛n get a new embedding vector: en,1:=∑m∈Nem,0⋅wm→nassignsubscript𝑒𝑛1subscript𝑚𝑁⋅subscript𝑒𝑚0subscript𝑤→𝑚𝑛e_{n,1}:=\\sum_{m\\in N}e_{m,0}\\cdot w_{m\\to n} (and respectively, for the outgoing transaction embeddings: en,1:=∑m∈Nem,0⋅wn→massignsubscript𝑒𝑛1subscript𝑚𝑁⋅subscript𝑒𝑚0subscript𝑤→𝑛𝑚e_{n,1}:=\\sum_{m\\in N}e_{m,0}\\cdot w_{n\\to m}). The vectors for the previous step are then normalized; each node n𝑛n in the subgraph gets the embedding vector: en,3:=en,2‖en,2‖2assignsubscript𝑒𝑛3subscript𝑒𝑛2subscriptnormsubscript𝑒𝑛22e_{n,3}:=\\frac{e_{n,2}}{||e_{n,2}||_{2}}, where ||.||2||.||_{2} denotes the euclidian norm. This vector is then returned as the embedding vector en,𝗂𝗇subscript𝑒𝑛𝗂𝗇e_{n,\\mathsf{in}} (resp. en,𝗈𝗎𝗍subscript𝑒𝑛𝗈𝗎𝗍e_{n,\\mathsf{out}} for outgoing transactions). We then apply the inner-products and similarity calculations similar to literature   on these embedding vectors; to compare nodes n𝑛n from bank 1 and m𝑚m from bank 2, we compute: σ​(n,m)=⟨en,𝗂𝗇;em,𝗂𝗇⟩×⟨en,𝗈𝗎𝗍;em,𝗈𝗎𝗍⟩𝜎𝑛𝑚subscript𝑒𝑛𝗂𝗇subscript𝑒𝑚𝗂𝗇subscript𝑒𝑛𝗈𝗎𝗍subscript𝑒𝑚𝗈𝗎𝗍\\sigma(n,m)=\\langle e_{n,\\mathsf{in}};e_{m,\\mathsf{in}}\\rangle\\times\\langle e_{n,\\mathsf{out}};e_{m,\\mathsf{out}}\\rangle, and deem that nodes with high similarity values should be labeled as suspicious accounts which might be part of the same money-laundering network, having the bulk of their transactions from and to the same neighbors.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: also increase difficulty across cryptocurrency types.
