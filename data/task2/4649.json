      "content": "Paper Title: DM2S2: Deep Multimodal Sequence Sets with Hierarchical Modality Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn general, DNN-based multimodal models include multiple streams of networks for modalities .\nThe models often have a component for fusing the features [ref]15 [ref]6  to make a prediction based on intermediate features from the streams.\nHence, by considering the fusion stage in the model architecture, multimodal architectures can be categorized into early fusion [ref]15, mid-fusion  [ref]16 [ref]6 , and late fusion  . The early fusion approach integrates the features of different modalities as inputs and uses a unified feature for the downstream task [ref]15.\nThe mid-fusion approach involves the concatenation of features that are encoded from the raw data of each modality into a single feature  [ref]16 [ref]6 .\nTypical multimodal architectures rely on the mid-fusion approach to combine multimodal information.\nHowever, mid-fusion may suffer from the increased dimensionality of concatenated features and the impractical assumption of complete modality information for each sample.\nThe late fusion approach combines the prediction scores of different predictors for multiple modalities  .\nThe late fusion method often exhibits sub-optimality of the trained models owing to the dependency between modalities being ignored. To solve this problem of mid-fusion architecture, which is the most common architecture in multimodal models, Reiter et al.  proposed the DMMS, which is a set-aware model based on Deep Sets  that represents a collection of features as an unordered set rather than an increasing fixed-size vector.\nThe DMMS can deal with the set input by pooling an arbitrary number of modality features into a constant-size vector without dependence on the number of modalities.\nNevertheless, the DMMS may ignore the importance of signals in a single modality by compressing the modality information through the leading encoder.\nSeveral mid-fusion models in the earlier stage of architecture introduced techniques to capture the higher-order interactions between modalities to construct each modality representation  .\nOwing to the set-aware architecture, the DMMS can handle an arbitrary number of modality features without any unnatural workarounds (e.g., padding for missing modalities). This study presents an architecture for retaining the fine-grained signals in each modality while capturing the importance between the modalities.\nOur proposed mid-fusion architecture operates similarly to models in the class of Deep Sets with modality-level granularity as in the DMMS while leveraging the hierarchical structure of multimodal data, namely, sets of sequences.\nAs recent BERT-based encoders output a sequence of embeddings rather than a single representation for an input sequence, we leverage it as a rich modality representation through our two-step attention mechanism.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: In general, DNN-based multimodal models include multiple streams of networks for modalities .\nThe models often have a component for fusing the features [ref]15 [ref]6  to make a prediction based on intermediate features from the streams.\nHence, by considering the fusion stage in the model architecture, multimodal architectures can be categorized\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
