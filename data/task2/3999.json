      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Deep GNNs: Rethinking Residual Connection in GNNs from a Path Decomposition Perspective for Preventing the Over-smoothing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOversmooth Analysis. Recently, several works have attempted to understand and alleviate over-smoothing in GNNs [ref]5     1.\nThe Markov process of simplified GNNs without weight matrices was studied in [ref]5  2, which theorized that the stacking propagation matrix would converge to the eigenvectors associated with degree information. According to [ref]5, the residual connection without weight matrices replicates a lazy random walk, converges to a stationary state, and leads to over-smoothing.\nFurthermore, the subspace theorem for the graph convolution with weight matrix was proposed and showed that the node representation would exponentially converge to the subspace, and the residual connection only plays the role of slowing the convergence rate  1. Other works propose Dirichlet energy-based analysis  8 and obtain a similar result to the subspace theorem. However, those analyses mainly focus on the forward behavior of GNNs and do not well explain the reason why the residual connection fails for DeepGNNs. Decouple GNNs.\nMost literature reports that the speed of degeneration of GCN is faster than SGC 0 without weight matrix and hypothesizes that the entanglement of transformation and propagation significantly compromises the performance of DeepGNNs .\nHence, the decouple GNNs are proposed to separate the propagation and transformation    , allowing for broader propagation. However, they are not real deep models but only enhance the nodes’ perceptual field by multiple hops. In addition, those designs are not easily compatible with standard graph convolutions. Skip connection in GNNs.\nSeveral works apply skip connections to relieve the over-smoothing issue, including: 1) residual connection with dilated-conv or message normalization  , 2) dense or JK connection to combine all previous layers’ representations 2 , and 3) initial connection with the initial node embedding  [ref]5 .\nHowever, directly introducing plain residual connections without regularization does not work for DeepGNNs, and the dense-like connection requires large memory usage. Instead, the initial connection is widely used in the design of GNNs to alleviate over-smoothing.\nTherefore, by investigating the difference in behavior between the initial and residual in a fundamental way, we propose a novel DRIVE connection for DeepGNNs without modifying the GraphConv kernel or applying normalization and regularization techniques designed for graphs. Regularization in GNNs.\nSeveral works propose training regularization techniques for graphs to alleviate over-smoothing. On the one hand, analogous to BatchNorm , the PairNorm 6, NodeNorm 9, MessageNorm , and GroupNorm 7 adjust the statistics over graphs to slow down the over-smoothing. On the other hand, borrowing the idea of dropout 6, DropEdge 5, DropNode , and SkipNode  introduce the randomly dropped techniques into graphs to alleviate over-smoothing.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Oversmooth Analysis.
