      "content": "Paper Title: Guided Depth Super-Resolution by Deep Anisotropic Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly work on guided super-resolution consisted mostly of optimization methods. Several such methods    employ random field models to solve this problem.\nOther traditional methods rely on filters, such as the bilateral filter , the guided filter [ref]11, the weighted median filter , the weighted mode filter , or the Static-Dynamic filter . Liu et al.  showed an early, learning-free application of anisotropic diffusion for guided depth enhancement. De Lutio et al.  fit a pixel-wise MLP to map the guide to the target and obtain excellent results when compared to other learning-free methods, whereas Uezato et al. [ref]42 adapt Deep Image Prior  to fuse the guide and the source images.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: mostly of optimization methods. Several such methods    employ random field models to solve this problem.\nOther traditional methods rely on filters, such as the bilateral filter , the guided filter [ref]11, the weighted median filter , the weighted mode filter , or the Static-Dynamic filter .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
