      "content": "Paper Title: Sample-Level Weighting for Multi-Task Learning with Auxiliary Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo address the challenge of balancing task contributions, dynamic task weighting algorithms have been proposed. In deep MTL, a neural network is typically trained using a linearly weighted combination of individual task losses, i.e., the composite loss. Setting a single uniform weight for each task loss in the composite loss throughout the training of the network has been shown to lead to poor performance . Furthermore, a particular task may help learn a useful base representation initially but interfere with fine-tuning later on. Consequently, task weights are often designed to be dynamic, i.e., change during training, or highly dynamic, i.e., set independently of the previous update  [ref]1. Various highly dynamic task weighting strategies exist, each adapting the loss weights or the gradients of the different tasks. Strategies include weighting based on inverse validation loss [ref]1, geometric loss , and uncertainty . For a complete overview, we refer to  and . A task is said to be negatively interfering when its learning signal negatively impacts learning the main task. Reasons could be that the gradient magnitudes are imbalanced [ref]5 [ref]17  or that the gradient directions of the updates simply do not align with a direction increasing generalization performance . To avoid task gradients with low gradient magnitudes being overshadowed by tasks with large gradients, gradient magnitudes can be normalized throughout training with respect to one main or several tasks [ref]5 [ref]17. Many different approaches to deal with harmful or conflicting gradient directions exist, e.g., dropping contributions with negative cosine similarity with the average direction , projecting gradients to either the normal plane of the other task  or an optimized vector  . All of these strategies, however, treat tasks as atomic units, with the exception of . An important research question is thus: \\sayhow to account for differences in task usefulness beyond the task level in MTL?, as we know from the literature that some samples matter more than others.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: but interfere with fine-tuning later on.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
