      "content": "Paper Title: On Classifying Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConstraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a wide class of computational decision problems.\nIn order to give a formal definition, we first introduce several other terms. A signature is a set of symbols\ntogether with arities ℓ∈ℕℓℕ\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}.\nEach symbol has exactly one arity attached to it. Often the signature distinguishes between function symbols and\nrelation symbols.\nWe will only use relation symbols.\nWe will only use signatures of finite size, to avoid dealing with issues of description complexity.\nFor finite signatures, we can simply assume that each symbol has constant description complexity. A structure consists of a set U𝑈U, called the domain,\na signature τ𝜏\\tau\nand an interpretation of each symbol.\nIf α∈τ𝛼𝜏\\alpha\\in\\tau is a symbol of arity ℓℓ\\ell, then\nthe interpretation is a set α⊆Uℓ𝛼superscript𝑈ℓ\\alpha\\subseteq U^{\\ell}. In the literature, the term template is also used as a synonym for structure.\nTo make this more tangible, consider the following example.\nWe define the domain as U={0,1}𝑈01U=\\{0,1\\}, the symbol +2subscript2+_{2} of arity 333\nand the symbol 𝟏1\\mathbf{1} of arity 111.\nWe interpret +2subscript2+_{2} as {(x,y,z)∈U3|x+y≡z​(mod​ 2)}conditional-set𝑥𝑦𝑧superscript𝑈3𝑥𝑦𝑧mod2\\left\\{(x,y,z)\\in U^{3}\\,\\middle|\\,x+y\\equiv z\\left(\\mathrm{mod}\\;2\\right)\\right\\},\nand 𝟏1\\mathbf{1} as {x∈U|x=1}conditional-set𝑥𝑈𝑥1\\left\\{x\\in U\\,\\middle|\\,x=1\\right\\}.\nThis defines a structure S1=⟨U,+2,𝟏⟩subscript𝑆1𝑈subscript21S_{1}=\\langle U,+_{2},\\mathbf{1}\\rangle.\nNote that it is common to use a symbol and its interpretation interchangeably.\nSpecifically, many symbols are used in the literature with their common interpretation,\ne.g., ≤\\leq is interpreted as {(x,y)∈U|x≤y}conditional-set𝑥𝑦𝑈𝑥𝑦\\left\\{(x,y)\\in U\\,\\middle|\\,x\\leq y\\right\\} and\n++ is interpreted as {(x,y,z)∈U3|x+y=z}conditional-set𝑥𝑦𝑧superscript𝑈3𝑥𝑦𝑧\\left\\{(x,y,z)\\in U^{3}\\,\\middle|\\,x+y=z\\right\\}.\nWe refer to the symbols and interpretations of a structure merely as constraints.\nWe will usually denote these constraints by the equation that they enforce.\nFor example, we write x2=ysuperscript𝑥2𝑦x^{2}=y for the constraint c={(x,y)∈U2|x2=y}𝑐conditional-set𝑥𝑦superscript𝑈2superscript𝑥2𝑦c=\\left\\{(x,y)\\in U^{2}\\,\\middle|\\,x^{2}=y\\right\\}. Given a structure S=(U,τ)𝑆𝑈𝜏S=(U,\\tau) we define a constraint formula\nΦ:=Φ​(x1,…,xn)assignΦΦsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\Phi:=\\Phi(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}) to be a conjunction\nc1∧…∧cmsubscript𝑐1…subscript𝑐𝑚c_{1}\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge c_{m}\nfor m≥0𝑚0m\\geq 0, where each cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} is of the form c​(y1,…,yℓ)𝑐subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦ℓc(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{\\ell}) for some\nc∈τ𝑐𝜏c\\in\\tau and variables y1,…,yℓ∈{x1,…,xn}subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦ℓsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛y_{1},\\ldots,y_{\\ell}\\in\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}.\nWe also define V​(Φ)⊆Un𝑉Φsuperscript𝑈𝑛V(\\Phi)\\subseteq U^{n} as\nV​(Φ):={𝐱∈Un|Φ​(𝐱)}assign𝑉Φconditional-set𝐱superscript𝑈𝑛Φ𝐱V(\\Phi):=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}\\in U^{n}\\,\\middle|\\,\\Phi(\\mathbf{x})\\right\\}.\nIn the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with structure S𝑆S, we are given a constraint formula ΦΦ\\Phi, and are asked whether V​(Φ)≠∅𝑉ΦV(\\Phi)\\neq\\emptyset. Consider the constraint formula Φ=(x1+x2≡x4​(mod​ 2))∧(x2+x3≡x4​(mod​ 2))∧(x2=1)Φsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥4mod2subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3subscript𝑥4mod2subscript𝑥21\\Phi=(x_{1}+x_{2}\\equiv x_{4}\\left(\\mathrm{mod}\\;2\\right))\\land(x_{2}+x_{3}\\equiv x_{4}\\left(\\mathrm{mod}\\;2\\right))\\land(x_{2}=1). This\ngives an instance of a CSP with structure S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} as above.\nNote that\n(0,1,0,1)∈V​(Φ)0101𝑉Φ(0,1,0,1)\\in V(\\Phi).\nIt can be interesting whether the CSP with structure S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} is polynomial time solvable. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the reals as domain, i.e., U=ℝ𝑈ℝU=\\mathbb{R}\nand denote them as continuous constraint satisfaction problems (CCSPs). We are mainly interested in CCSPs where the constraints are semi-algebraic over the integers (see Section 1.2 for a formal definition).\nThere are some constraints that are not semi-algebraic, in other words, not computable on the real RAM .\nFor example, constraints involving sin,cos,exp,log\\sin,\\cos,\\exp,\\log or testing if a number is an integer.\nWe do not want to forbid those types of constraints in the general definition, as it might be interesting to study some of them.\nSome of our hardness results actually apply to non-computable functions.\nThere are constraints that limit us to finite domains.\nFor example, x​(x−1)=0𝑥𝑥10x(x-1)=0.\nAlthough they are not truly continuous, they are indeed semi-algebraic and thus we have to deal with them as well\nin the general definition.\nFor our results, we use both discrete constraints, e.g. x=1𝑥1x=1, and truly continuous constraints, e.g. f​(x)=y𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x)=y with f𝑓f three times differentiable. Constraint satisfaction problems have a long history\nin algorithmic studies  [ref]19  [ref]63  .\nThere are two application-driven motivations to study them.\nOn the one hand, it is possible to easily encode many fundamental\nalgorithmic problems directly as a CSP.\nThen, given an efficient algorithm for those types of CSPs,\nwe have immediately also solved those other algorithmic problems.\nOn the other hand, if we can encode CSPs into algorithmic problems,\nthen any hardness result for the CSP immediately carries over to the algorithmic problem.\nNext to an application-driven motivation, it is fair to\nsay that they deserve a study in their own right\nas fundamental mathematical objects.\nCSPs form a very versatile language\nand often allow for a complete classification by their\ncomputational complexity.\nSpecifically, the dichotomy conjecture states that every class of CSP with a finite domain\nis either NP-complete or polynomial-time solvable.\nSchaefer showed the conjecture for domains of size two .\nRecently, Bulatov and Zhuk could confirm the conjecture independently  [ref]63\nfor any finite domain.\nNote that one can also try to find a classification from the parameterized complexity\nperspective \nor the approximative counting perspective . In this paper, we focus on CSPs with ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} as domain\nand we are interested in the class of CSPs that are ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete.\nWe want to point out that there is also a large body of research\nthat deals with infinite domains     .\nMost relevant for us is the work by Bodirsky, Jonsson and von Oertzen , who also studied CSPs over the reals and showed that a host of them are NP-hard to decide.\nSpecifically, they defined a subset S𝑆S of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} as essentially convex if for all a,b∈S𝑎𝑏𝑆a,b\\in S, the straight\nline segment intersects the complement S¯¯𝑆\\overline{S} of S𝑆S in finitely many points.\nThey show that CSPs that contain x=1𝑥1x=1, x>0𝑥0x>0, x≤y𝑥𝑦x\\leq y, x+y=z𝑥𝑦𝑧x+y=z, and at least one constraint that is not essentially convex\nare NP-hard.\nHowever, their techniques do not imply ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-hardness.\nSee also  for an overview of results for the real domain.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: constraints, e.g. x=1𝑥1x=1, and truly continuous constraints, e.g. f​(x)=y𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x)=y with f𝑓f three times differentiable.
