      "content": "Paper Title: Fractional-Order Structural Stability: Formulation and Application to the Critical Load of Slender Structures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we compare the effects of the nonlocal interactions on the critical load when accounted for by either fractional-order or integer-order theories of nonlocal elasticity. For this purpose, we begin with the two-phase (i.e. local/nonlocal) integral model proposed in . This choice is motivated by several studies in the literature that are based on this theory  or on simplified models derived from it     to study nonlocal effects on the critical load. The nonlocal constitutive relations take the form of a Fredholm equation of the second kind: where ϵbold-italic-ϵ\\bm{\\epsilon} is the local strain evaluated using the classical integer-order strain-displacement relations. Also, δ​(X,𝝃)𝛿X𝝃\\delta(\\textbf{X},\\bm{\\xi}) is the Dirac-delta defined at X, 𝒜¯​(X,𝝃)¯𝒜X𝝃\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}(\\textbf{X},\\bm{\\xi}) is the attenuation function, χ1subscript𝜒1\\chi_{1} and χ2subscript𝜒2\\chi_{2} are positive material constants that satisfy: χ1+χ2=1subscript𝜒1subscript𝜒21\\chi_{1}+\\chi_{2}=1.\nEringen’s integral nonlocal model, corresponding to a Fredholm equation of the first kind, can be obtained for appropriate choices of χ1subscript𝜒1\\chi_{1} and χ2subscript𝜒2\\chi_{2}. A detailed discussion on the comparison of the constitutive laws for the fractional-order and integer-order models of linear nonlocal elasticity is provided in [ref]31. In [ref]31, the linear fractional-order continuum theory was obtained from the integral Eringen model assuming suitable choices of the attenuation function and the domain of influence. However, this equivalence holds only for the linear kinematic relations. For the geometrically nonlinear models of nonlocal elasticity, the constitutive models that follow the fractional-order kinematic relations in Eq. (1) cannot be deduced from Eringen’s model in an analogous manner. This observation is relevant to understand the differences in critical load observed when using the fractional-order and the classical integer-order theories of nonlocal elasticity    . To elaborate further, we focus on the case of the nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam. The weak statement for the transverse equilibrium equation for the fractional-order nonlocal beam, that follows from Eq. (22), is given by: where [Kb]delimited-[]superscript𝐾𝑏[K^{b}] and [Gb]delimited-[]superscript𝐺𝑏[G^{b}] are the material and geometric stiffness matrices. Similarly, the expressions for these matrices derived following the integer-order nonlocal constitutive relations given in Eq. (39) would be : Appropriate choices for the material constants χ1subscript𝜒1\\chi_{1} and χ2subscript𝜒2\\chi_{2} can reduce this model to the single-phase Eringen’s model. For the sake of comparison, we provide below the expressions for the stiffness matrices evaluated assuming local elasticity : We note that the material and geometric stiffness matrices for the fractional-order theory of nonlocal elasticity given in Eq. (41) include fractional derivatives. The fractional derivatives within the definition of these stiffness terms capture the nonlocal interactions across the domain. An increase in the degree of nonlocality (either by reducing the fractional-order α𝛼\\alpha or by increasing the length scale lfsubscript𝑙𝑓l_{f}) reduces the numerical value of the fractional-order derivatives, and hence of the corresponding stiffness term. This softening effect is evident from the results of the parametric studies in Tables 3, 4, 8 and 9. In the case of Eringen’s integral models, the stiffness matrix [Kb]delimited-[]superscript𝐾𝑏[K^{b}] in Eq. (42) includes nonlocal interactions across the domain and undergoes reduction with increasing degree of nonlocality. However, the geometric stiffness [Gb]delimited-[]superscript𝐺𝑏[G^{b}] in this equation, remains identical to its local form in Eq. (43), as also observed in .\nThe decreasing values of stiffness [Kb]delimited-[]superscript𝐾𝑏[K^{b}] with increasing degree of nonlocality, while [Gb]delimited-[]superscript𝐺𝑏[G^{b}] remains constant, explains the lower critical load for nonlocal solids predicted by Eringen’s theory . This observation is akin to our parametric studies on fractional-order beams and plates over material nonlocality (see Eq. (36a)).\nTherefore, we conclude that fractional-order continuum theories differ from the Eringen’s integral nonlocal models primarily in their formulation of the geometric stiffness. Unlike the integer-order theory, the geometric stiffness matrix for the fractional-order solid is also modified by the presence of fractional-order derivatives. The corresponding reduction in geometric stiffness [Gb]delimited-[]superscript𝐺𝑏[G^{b}] due to nonlocal interactions is evident from the parametric studies conducted from Eq. (36b). The simultaneous reduction in both material and geometric stiffness terms has competing effects on the critical load. For the sake of completeness, we also compare the fractional-order model with the Eringen’s differential model of nonlocal elasticity. The nonlocal stiffness terms evaluated for a Euler-Bernoulli beam using the differential model of nonlocal elasticity are: where lesubscript𝑙𝑒l_{e} is the characteristic length scale . Comparing the above expressions with Eq. (43), it is clear that the differential model predicts a modification in the geometric stiffness caused by the nonlocal interactions. However, the material stiffness is identical to the classical local elasticity case given in Eq. (43). Therefore, the nonlocal effects on the critical load are realized only by a modification of the geometric stiffness matrix. This observation is also in contrast to the effect of nonlocal elasticity being realized on both the stiffness matrices following fractional-order continuum theories (see Eq. (41)). From Eq. (44), we note increasing values of stiffness [Gb]delimited-[]superscript𝐺𝑏[G^{b}] with increasing degree of nonlocality, while [Kb]delimited-[]superscript𝐾𝑏[K^{b}] remains constant. This explains the lower critical load for nonlocal solids predicted by Eringen’s differential models . Note that similar observation was noted above from our parametric study on fractional-order beams and plates for isolated case of geometric nonlocality (see Eq. (36b)).\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: and χ2subscript𝜒2\\chi_{2}.
