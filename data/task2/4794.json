      "content": "Paper Title: Pruning Adversarially Robust Neural Networks without Adversarial Examples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial Robustness. Popular adversarial attack methods include projected gradient descent (PGD) , fast gradient sign method (FGSM) [ref]2, CW attack , and AutoAttack (AA) ; see also 0 for a comprehensive review.\nAdversarially robust models are typically obtained via adversarial training 1, by augmenting the training set with adversarial examples, generated by the aforementioned adversarial attacks. Madry et al.  generate adversarial examples via PGD. TRADES  and MART  extend adversarial training by incorporating additional penalty terms. LBGAT 2 guide adversarial training by a natural classifier boundary to improve robustness. However, generating adversarial examples is computationally expensive and time consuming. Several recent works observe that information-bottleneck penalties enhance robustness. Fischer 3 considers a conditional entropy bottleneck (CEB), while Alemi et al. 4 suggest a variational information bottleneck (VIB); both lead to improved robustness properties. Ma et al.  and Wang et al. [ref]29 use a penalty based on the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), termed HSIC bottleneck as a regularizer (HBaR). Wang et al. show that HBaR enhances adversarial robustness even without generating adversarial examples [ref]29. For this reason, we incorporate HBaR into our unified robust pruning framework as a means of exploiting adversarial robustness merely from natural examples during the pruning process, without further adversarial training. We are the first to study HBaR under a pruning context; our ablation study (Section VI-B) indicates HBaR indeed contributes to enhancing robustness in our setting. Adversarial Pruning.\nWeight pruning is one of the prominent compression techniques to reduce model size with acceptable accuracy degradation. While extensively explored for efficiency and compression purposes      , only a few recent works study pruning in the context of adversarial robustness. Several works 5 6 theoretically discuss the relationship between adversarial robustness and pruning, but do not provide any active defense techniques. Ye et al.  and Gui et al.  propose AdvPrune to combine the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) pruning framework with adversarial training.\nLee et al. 7 propose APD to use knowledge distillation for adversarial pruning optimized by a proximal gradient method. Sehwag et al.  propose HYDRA, which uses a robust training objective to learn a sparsity mask. However, all these methods rely on adversarial training. HYDRA further requires training additional sparsity masks, which hampers training efficiency. In contrast, we distill from a pre-trained adversarially robust model while pruning without generating adversarial examples. Our compressed model can preserve high adversarial robustness with considerable training speedup compared to these methods, as we report in Section VI-C.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Adversarial Robustness.
