      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Linear Span Network for Object Skeleton Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly skeleton detection methods were usually performed on binary images by geometric modeling, e.g.formulae-sequence𝑒𝑔e.g., morphological image operations. One approach is to treat object skeleton as line subsets which connect super-pixels’ center points. Such line subsets were explored from the super-pixels and extract skeleton paths using a sequence of disc models . The smoothness of the skeleton can be enforced with spatial filters, e.g.formulae-sequence𝑒𝑔e.g., a particle filter, which link local skeleton segments into continuous curves .\nWhen being applied on color images, an image segmentation procedure for contour extraction was first performed as pre-processing. The segmentation procedure tended to produce multi-scale super-pixels, which are converted to skeleton pixels using geometric models. In the deep learning era, object skeleton detection has been formulated as an pixel-wise binary classification problem with multi-scale feature integration. For clarity, the characters of several typical methods are summarized in Table I. The HED  developed parallel multiple side-outputs to produce edges, which can be also used for skeleton detection. Fusing scale-associated deep side-outputs (FSDS) [ref]7 learned skeleton representations with specific scales across multiple network stage given scale-associated ground-truth. Side-output residual network (SRN) [ref]8 leveraged the side-output residual units to build short connections between adjacent side-output branches for complementary feature utilization. In this way, SRN progressively expand the feature space to fit the errors between the object skeleton/symmetry ground-truth and the multiple side-outputs. To take full use of richer scale-aware features, RCF [ref]14, RSRN , and HiFi  establish dense side-output branches for smooth multi-scale feature integration. In the linear span view , the feature integration actually aims at spanning larger feature spaces for complementary feature extraction and fusion. With this aim, DeepFlux  utilize the ASPP module  to enrich the semantic level and scale granularity of the feature space. Further, DeepFlux  contributed a novel strategy by training a network to predict a vector field, which corresponded each image pixel a skeleton/background pixel, in the fashion of flux-based skeletonization. This flux-based skeletonization explicitly encodes the skeletion pixel positions to contextually meaningful entities. Share the same network architecture, GeoSkelNet  also used the region-based vector field to model object parts at multiple scales. By designing Hausdorff distance inspired objective function, both global and local contours were detected through an end-to-end network. The conventional hand-designed skeleton networks, although incorporating rich prior knowledge, have obvious limitations. With elaborately designed feature integration mechanisms, they are somewhat competent to capture rich representation but still experience difficulty when configuring representation for objects/parts in different scale granularity.
