      "content": "Paper Title: MizAR 60 for Mizar 50\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSaturation Provers: State-of-the-art automated theorem provers, like E Prover \nand Vampire [ref]37, perform the search for a contradiction, first\ntranslating the input first-order logic problem into a refutationally\nequivalent set of clauses.\nThen the prover operates the proof search using the given clause algorithm.\nIn this algorithm, the proof state is split into two subsets, the set P𝑃P of\nprocessed clauses, and the set U𝑈U of unprocessed clauses. Clauses in\nU𝑈U are ordered by a heuristic evaluation function. In each iteration of the\nmain loop, the (heuristically) best clause in U𝑈U is picked. This given\nclause g𝑔g is then simplified with respect to all clauses in P𝑃P. If it is not\nredundant, it is used in turn to simplify all clauses in P𝑃P. After that, all\ngenerating inferences between g𝑔g and the remaining clauses in P𝑃P are\nperformed. Both the newly generated clauses and the simplified clauses from P𝑃P\nare then completely simplified with respect to P𝑃P, heuristically evaluated,\nand added to U𝑈U. This process continues until the empty clause emerges (or\nuntil the system runs out of resources). Training Data: As of E 1.8 , E maintains an internal proof\nobject [ref]51 which allows it to\ninspect all proof clauses and designate all clauses that have been selected\nfor processing and are part of the proof, as positive training\nexamples. All clauses that have been selected for processing, but not\ncontributed to the proof, are designated as negative training\nexamples. Clauses that have not been processed at all are neither\npositive nor negative, reducing the total number of training examples\nto typically thousands of processed clauses, as opposed to millions of\nclauses generated.\nE allows the user to request the actual proof object, or to provide\nany combination of positive and negative training examples. Examples\nare provided in separate batches and are also annotated as positive\nor negative for easy processing. ML-Based Selection: Selection of the right given clause is critical in E, and an\nobvious point for the use of machine learning (ML). The positive and negative examples\nare extracted from previous successful proof searches,\nand a machine learning model is trained to score the generated clauses or to classify them as useful (⊞⊞\\boxplus) or useless\n(⊟⊟\\boxminus). E Prover selects the given clause from a priority queue, where the unprocessed\nclauses are sorted by various heuristics.\nENIGMA extends E Prover with an additional queue where clauses positively\nclassified by the ML model are prioritized.\nThe ENIGMA queue is used together with the standard E selection mechanisms,\ntypically in a cooperative way where roughly half of the clauses are selected by\nENIGMA.\nThis approach proved to be the most efficient in practice. Parental Guidance: Later ENIGMA [ref]20 introduced\nlearning-based parental guidance, which addresses the quadratic\nfactor when doing all possible inferences among the processed\nclauses in classical saturation-based provers. Instead, an ML model is trained to prevent inferences\nbetween the parent clauses that are unlikely to meaningfully interact.\nWhen such an inference is recognized by the model as useless with a\nhigh degree of confidence, the child clause is not inserted into the set of\nunprocessed clauses U𝑈U but its processing is postponed.\nTo maintain completeness, the clause can not be directly discarded\nsince the ML model might be mistaken.\nInstead, the clause is put into a “freezer” from which it can be retrieved in\nthe case the prover runs out of unprocessed clauses.\nAs opposed to the above clause selection models, this method affects the\nstandard E selection mechanism because the clause is not inserted into any\nqueue.\nENIGMA clause selection models and parental (generation) models can be successfully\ncombined.\nThis is schematically illustrated in Figure 1 (left). Multi-Phase ENIGMA: ML-based multi-phase clause selection was introduced in [ref]20\nto deal with computationally expensive (slow) ML models, like graph neural networks (GNNs).\nIn a two-phase selection model, a faster model is used for\npreliminary clause filtering, and only the clauses that pass are evaluated by the\nslower model.\nThe fast model is expected to over-approximate on positive classes so that\nonly clauses classified with high confidence as negatives are rejected. When parental guidance is added to the mix,\nthis leads to a three-phase ENIGMA.\nThis is schematically illustrated in Figure 1 (middle).\nAggressive forward subsumption is an additional logic-complete pruning method\nbased on efficient subsumption indexing in E .\nWe use it to eliminate many redundant generated clauses\nbefore calling more expensive ML methods (GNN) for clause evaluation. For the effect of such methods, see some of the 3-phase ENIGMA examples in Section 7. Training: Strong ENIGMAs are typically developed in many prove-learn feedback loops  that proceed as follows.\n(1) The training data 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} are curated from (previous) successful proof searches.\n(2) A model ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} is trained on data\n𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} to distinguish positive from negative clauses.\n(3) The model ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} is run with the ATP (E), usually in cooperation\nwith the strategy used to obtain the training data.\nThen we go to step (1) with the new data obtained in step (3).\nThe loop, illustrated in Figure 1 (right),\ncan be repeated as long as new problems are proved. We run this loop for several months in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Saturation Provers: State-of-the-art automated theorem provers, like E Prover \nand Vampire [ref]37, perform the search for a contradiction, first\ntranslating the input first-order logic problem into a refutationally\nequivalent set of clauses.\nThen the prover operates the proof search using\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
