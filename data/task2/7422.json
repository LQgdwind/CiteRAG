      "content": "Paper Title: Retrosynthesis Prediction via Search in (Hyper) Graph\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe retrosynthesis prediction aims to discern the appropriate reactants necessary for synthesizing a designated product molecule. It was initially formalized by  and has since evolved into a foundational issue within the realm of organic chemistry. The challenge lies in the vastness of the search space, encompassing a multitude of potential transformations, as noted by . Thus, there has been a quest for a range of computer algorithms aimed at supporting seasoned chemists in their endeavors. Among them, machine learning based methods have played a vital role and achieved significant progress in this area recently [ref]3. The template-based and template-free methods have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. The template-based methodologies [ref]3     tackle retrosynthesis prediction as a template retrieval problem. Following template retrieval, these approaches utilize cheminformatics tools like RDKit  to construct full reactions. Despite their high interpretability and assurance of molecule validity, they cannot predict reactions outside the template library. In contrast, the template-free approaches leverage deep generative models to produce reactants based on a given product directly. Since molecules can be represented using both graphs and SMILES sequences, existing techniques reframe retrosynthesis as either a sequence-to-sequence problem  0 1 2 3 or a graph-to-sequence problem 4. Although these generative methods facilitate chemical reasoning within a more expansive reaction space, they lack interpretability. The semi-template approaches effectively leverage the advantages inherent in generative models along with established chemical knowledge to enhance their methodology. Typical frameworks 5 6 7 8 9 within this category adhere to a common strategy: they first pinpoint the reaction center and convert the product into synthons. Then, a separate model completes the transformation of these synthons into reactants. These methods offer competitive accuracy and maintain interpretability due to their stage-wise nature. Nonetheless, they continue to face challenges in predicting reactions with multiple reaction center and fail in the scenario where the same leaving group is attached to more than one atom in a molecular graph. This paper refers to the reaction center comprised of multiple bonds or atoms as multiple raction center. Fig. 1 shows a reaction with multiple reaction center and attaching the same leaving group to more than one atom. Recently, some methodologies 0 1 have framed retrosynthesis prediction as the task of editing the product molecular graph to the reactant molecular graph. In this paper, we refer to this type of method as the graph edit sequence conditional generative model. The edit operations encompass actions such as Delete-bond, Change-bond, Change-atom, Attach-leaving-group, etc. These techniques extract edit sequences from ground-truth reaction data and then model the conditional probability distribution over these sequences given one product molecular graph. Despite its mitigation of some template-based method limitations, the graph edit sequence conditional generative model remains challenged. It cannot handle attaching the same leaving group to more than one atom in a molecular graph and also underutilizes the prior of chemical rules. Motivated by the aforementioned constraints, we introduce the RetroSiG (Retrosynthesis via Search in (Hyper) Graph) framework (Fig. 1)—a semi-template-based approach—aimed at facilitating single-step retrosynthesis prediction. There are two phases in our RetroSiG, i.e., (a) search in the product molecular graph and (b) search in the leaving group hypergraph. (a) (Fig. 1a): We regard the reaction center identification as the search in the product molecular graph. A crucial observation dictates that the single or multiple reaction center should constitute a node-induced subgraph within the molecular product graph 2. Therefore, RetroSiG utilizes a reinforcement learning agent with the graph encoder to explore the appropriate node-induced subgraph in the specific product molecular graph, identifying it as the predicted reaction center. At each stage, it contemplates the selection of one node within the molecular product graph as an action, incorporating it into the explored node-induced subgraph. As the reaction center graph maintains connectivity, we implement a one-hop constraint to streamline the search space and optimize the overall performance. (b) (Fig. 1b): We regard the leaving group completion as the search in the leaving group hypergraph. Since the unique leaving group patterns derived from the training dataset can cover 99.7% of the test set 7, it is feasible to predict leaving group patterns from the training leaving group corpus. Implicit dependencies exist among various leaving groups. Naturally, we can model these dependencies by creating a leaving group hypergraph. Each node denotes one unique leaving group pattern, while a hyperedge connects the corresponding leaving groups that co-occur within a template (reaction). Therefore, RetroSiG also utilizes a reinforcement learning agent with the hypergraph encoder to explore the appropriate node-induced subgraph in the leaving group hypergraph, selecting it as the resulting leaving groups. At each step, it contemplates the selection of one node within the leaving group hypergraph as an action, incorporating it into the explored node-induced subgraph. In the evaluation set, we observe that 98.9% of the leaving groups that co-occur within a template are contained within the same hyperedges. Thus, we make full use of the prior and impose a one-hop constraint to reduce the search space. Finally, we convert two predicted node-induced subgraphs into reaction center SMARTS and leaving groups SMARTS, subsequently merging them to derive one retrosynthesis template. We obtain the reactants by applying the retrosynthesis template to the given product 2. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RetroSiG achieves a competitive result. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to show the capability of RetroSiG in predicting complex reactions. Ablation experiments confirm the efficacy of specific elements, such as the one-hop constraint and the leaving group hypergraph. In summary, we outline our primary contributions as follows: We propose, a semi-template-based method, the RetroSiG framework to conduct single-step retrosynthesis prediction. It has the capability to predicting reactions with multiple reaction center and attaching the same leaving group to more than one atom. The key novelty of RetroSiG is viewing the reaction center identification and leaving group completion as the search in the product molecular graph and the leaving group hypergraph respectively. The hypergraph effectively represents the implicit dependencies among leaving groups, and the search in the graph makes full use of the prior, i.e., one-hop constraint. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RetroSiG achieves a competitive result. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to show the capability of RetroSiG in predicting complex reactions. Ablation experiments confirm the efficacy of specific elements.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: algorithms aimed at supporting seasoned chemists in their endeavors.
