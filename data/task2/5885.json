      "content": "Paper Title: SynthVSR: Scaling Up Visual Speech Recognition With Synthetic Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use several public datasets in this work. (1) Audio-visual datasets: LRS3 [ref]2, AVSpeech [ref]14 and VoxCeleb2 ; (2) Speech datasets: Librispeech [ref]33, TED-LIUM 3 , Common Voice ; (3) Facial dataset: CelebA . LRS3. We conduct experiments on the LRS3 [ref]2 dataset, which is the largest public benchmark for English VSR containing 438.9 hours of video clips from TED talks (408, 30, and 0.9 hours in the pre-training, training-validation, and test set, respectively). AVSpeech & VoxCeleb2.\nA recent work  uses public language classifier 6 and ASR models  to filter for English content and obtain pseudo-transcriptions for two multilingual audio-visual datasets: AVSpeech [ref]14 and VoxCeleb2 , containing 1,323 hours from AVSpeech and 1,307 hours from VoxCeleb2. We follow the same data setting for our high-resource setting. Furthermore, we filter out AVSpeech videos with large jitter resulting in 933 hours of videos overall for speech-driven lip animation training. Datasets for Speech-Driven Lip Animation Training.\nThe lip animation model is trained on a combination of LRS3 (pre-training and training-validation splits) and the English subset (933 hours) of AVSpeech datasets. Datasets for Synthetic Data Generation.\nWe use Librispeech [ref]33, TED-LIUM 3 , Common Voice (English split)  datasets as the speech sources. We split Librispeech audio clips into segments of less than 6 seconds based on the provided silence annotations. For TED-LIUM 3 and Common Voice, we filter out the audio clips which are longer than 20s. As a result, 944 hours, 465 hours, and 2,243 hours of speech data are obtained for Librispeech, TED-LIUM 3, and Common Voice, respectively. We use the CelebA  dataset as a source of lip images, which has 202,599 face images and 10,177 identities. For each speech clip, we randomly sample one image from CelebA to generate one synthetic video. We use a static rotation matrix in the generation process. In total, 3,652 hours of synthetic video clips are generated for scaling up VSR training.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: We use several public datasets in this work. (1) Audio-visual datasets: LRS3 [ref]2, AVSpeech [ref]14 and VoxCeleb2 ; (2) Speech datasets: Librispeech [ref]33, TED-LIUM 3 , Common Voice ; (3) Facial dataset: CelebA . LRS3. We conduct experiments on the LRS3 [ref]2 dataset,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
