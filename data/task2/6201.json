      "content": "Paper Title: From Latent Graph to Latent Topology Inference: Differentiable Cell Complex Module\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a versatile tool exploited in a wide range of fields, such as computational chemistry ¬†, physics simulations , and social networks , just to name a few. GNNs have shown remarkable performance in learning tasks where data are represented over a graph domain, due to their ability to combine the flexibility of neural networks with prior knowledge about data relationships, expressed in terms of the underlying graph topology. The literature on GNNs is extensive and encompasses various techniques, typically categorized into spectral ¬† and non-spectral ¬†[ref]5 methods. The basic idea behind GNNs is to learn node (and/or) edge attributes representations using local aggregation based on the graph topology, i.e. message passing networks in their most general form [ref]6. By leveraging this feature, GNNs have achieved outstanding results in several tasks, including node and graph classification ¬†, link prediction ¬†, and more specialized tasks such as protein folding ¬† and neural algorithmic reasoning ¬†0. The majority of GNNs assume the graph topology to be fixed (and optimal) for the task at hand, therefore the focus is usually on designing more sophisticated architectures with the aim of improving the message passing process. Very recently, a series of works 1 2 3 started to investigate techniques for Latent Graph Inference (LGI), where the intuition is that data can have some underlying but unknown (latent) graph structure, mainly in cases where only a point cloud of data is available but also when the given graph is suboptimal for the downstream task. At the same time, the field of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) 4 5 started to gain interest, motivated by the fact that many systems are characterized by higher-order interactions that cannot be captured by the intrinsically pairwise structure of graphs. Topological Neural Networks exploit tools and objects from (algebraic) topology to encode these multi-way relationships, e.g. simplicial ¬†6 7, cell 8, or combinatorial complexes 5. However, TDL techniques usually incorporate graphs in higher-order complexes by means of deterministic lifting maps, assigning higher-order cells to cliques or induced cycles of the graph, thus implicitly assuming that these (task-agnostic, deterministic) complexes are optimal for the downstream task. In addition, whenever an input graph is not available, these strategies scale poorly in the size of the input set by requiring an exhaustive (combinatorial) search over all possible cells, making them unfeasible for even medium-sized sets of data-points. Contribution. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Latent Topology Inference (LTI) by generalizing LGI to higher-order complexes. The goal of LTI is not (only) learning a graph structure describing pairwise interactions but rather learning a higher-order complex describing multi-way interactions among data points. As a first instance of LTI, we introduce the Differentiable Cell Complex Module (DCM), a novel deep learning architecture that dynamically learns a cell complex to improve the downstream task. The DCM implements a two-step inference procedure to alleviate the computational burden: first, learning the 111-skeleton of the complex (i.e., a graph) via a novel improved version of the Differentiable Graph Module (DGM) 1, and then learning which higher-order cells (polygons) should be included in the complex. Both steps leverage message passing (at node and edge levels) and a sparse sampling technique based on the Œ±ùõº\\alpha-entmax class of functions, which allows overcoming the limitation of the original DGM, capable of learning only regular graph topologies. We generalize the training procedure of the DGM 1 to train the DCM in a end-to-end fashion. The DCM is tested on several homophilic and heterophilic datasets and it is shown to outperform other state-of-the-art techniques, offering significant improvements\nboth when the input graph is provided or not.\nIn particular, accuracy gains on heterophilic benchmarks with provided input graphs indicate that the DCM leads to robust performance even when the input graph does not fit the data well.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: relationships, expressed in terms of the underlying graph topology.
