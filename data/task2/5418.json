      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical learning, forecasting coherent spatio-temporal individual and aggregated building loads\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPredominant reconciliation techniques comprise traditional bottom-up and top-down approaches, trace minimization, optimal combinations, and recently developed machine-learning methods. Bottom-up hierarchical forecasting consists in generating base forecasts at the very bottom level of the hierarchy and enforce coherency through their direct aggregation across the tree .\nThe greatest advantage of this approach is that it can draw information from the most disaggregated levels of the tree, consequently avoiding any information loss from aggregation . However, series located at tree leaves tend to possess low signal-to-noise ratios making them more difficult to predict. This is particularly true when dealing with smart-meter electrical demands which are notoriously volatile. Consumption peaks are indeed driven by often highly stochastic occupant behaviors that are close to intractable, consequently making bottom-up aggregation unlikely to provide accurate forecasts across the upper levels of the tree . Top-down hierarchical forecasting on the other hand only generates forecasts for the top level of the hierarchy (tree-root) and proceeds to disaggregate and distribute it down the hierarchy from either historical  or forecasted  proportions of the data. The approach commonly favors higher aggregation levels of the tree with more accurate predictions and is notably valuable for low-count data. However, aggregation is not without a large loss of information as temporal dynamics and other individual series characteristics cannot be exploited . Additionally, as the success of this approach depends solely on one top-level model, it possesses a higher degree of risk from model misspecifications or inaccuracies .\nGiven both bottom-up and top-down approaches inadequate to profit from the richness of information across a given hierarchy, optimal combination techniques emerged. Linearly reconciling base forecasts towards coherency, these approaches allowed interactions between different levels of the hierarchy, leveraging in particular correlations and covariances present in such structures . However, estimating the covariance structure of a hierarchy from base forecasts is challenging. Indeed, Wickramasuriya et al.  declared that the covariance matrix of the coherency errors is ”impossible to estimate in practice due to identifiability conditions” such that even with high-frequency data available, assumptions on its form must be made .\nThe ordinary least-square (OLS) estimator was particularly developed by Hyndman et al.  and Athanasopoulos et al.  to avoid this problem. Their approach demonstrated improved results compared to other commonly adopted techniques.\nA weighted least squares (WLS) approach, considering variances from the variance-covariance matrix diagonal but ignoring the off-diagonal covariance elements, was put forward by Hyndman et al. . Wickramasuriya et al.  later provided the theoretical justification for estimating variances from base forecast error variances. They proposed a generalized least-squares (GLS) estimator and found the incorporation of correlation information into the reconciliation process to benefit forecasting accuracy, with resulting reconciled forecasts guaranteed to be, in mean or in sample, at least, as good as their base forecasts, given a particular covariance structure. Finally, in recent years, machine learning approaches have made their way into hierarchical forecasting. Relying on powerful statistical regressors and the availability of larger and richer data sets, machine learning emerges as an appealing and suitable tool for estimating the persistently challenging covariance matrix.\nSpiliotis et al.  put forward such an approach employing a bottom-up method to reconcile predictions from Random Forest and XGBoost regressors. Taking as input the base forecasts of all the series of the hierarchy, the reconciled tree is then obtained from bottom-up aggregation. It allows non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, extending conventional linear approaches thanks to its machine-learning nature.\nSagheer et al. [ref]27 proceeded to obtain coherent hierarchies from deep long-short term memory (DLSTM) recurrent neural networks by applying transfer learning across their hierarchies in a bottom-up fashion. They evaluated their approach on national-scale Brazilian electrical power production as well as Australian domestic tourism data.\nIn another work, Mancuso et al.  proposed a method to unify the two prevailing processes that are forecasting and reconciliation. By including hierarchical information in the forecasting process through a customized loss function, they allow the network to train towards reconciled forecasts using a top-down disaggregation process. None of these approaches, however, include the general formulation of hierarchical forecasting within their learning framework. This limits their reconciliation approaches to encompass solely traditional approaches, i.e., bottom-up or top-down, which, as has been mentioned, only exploit a fraction of the available information of hierarchical structures.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: is then obtained from bottom-up aggregation.
