      "content": "Paper Title: Dissecting Distribution Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral defenses against distribution inference have been proposed, but most of them (except differential privacy , which has shortcomings as we discuss later) have not been actually evaluated. Like most defenses designed to limit privacy leakage, these defenses involve adding noise in some parts of the training process. This can include the data itself  or model parameters  .\nOne notable exception is work by Hartmann et. al. , where the authors study causes of leakage in distribution inference attacks, and evaluate mitigation strategies based on causal learning (IRM ), correcting inductive biases, and increasing the amount of training data, for synthetic datasets.\nWe evaluate some of these noise-based defenses in Section V-A, and find that they seem unlikely to successfully mitigate distribution inference risks. Our exploration of inference risk with model generalization reveals interesting trends and a potential trade-off between learning and inference risk\n(Section V-B). Section V-C introduces and evaluates a simple defense based on data re-sampling, which can prevent distribution inference in settings where the model trainer knows which distributional property to hide. Prior Work.\nUnlike membership inference where differentially private training can provide a guaranteed bound on inference risk, there are no defenses against distribution inference from trained models with theoretical guarantees. Chen and Ohrimenko  recently proposed a defense mechanism that builds upon formal notions of distributional privacy 4 to protect against property inference attacks on statistical queries. This is the first known theoretically-grounded defense against distribution inference, but it does not apply to protecting machine-learning models. The only previous defense that has demonstrated meaningful protection against distribution inference attacks on machine learning models is NoSnoop [ref]22, proposed for a collaborative learning setting. In their threat model, the adversary seeks to infer sensitive information about exact training batches and has access to intermediate model losses from clients. The defense works utilize a discriminator-generator setup, where gradient updates are used to minimize property leakage while preserving task-based utility.\nAlthough this defense is highly effective, it defends against a very narrow type of configuration, including properties limited to the presence/absence of sensitive data. Recent work by Stock et al.  proposes a defense against distribution inference based on gradient updates from meta-classifiers. The victim, being aware of two distributions that an adversary may test for, trains multiple copies of its models with these training distributions. Then, it trains a meta-classifier and computes gradient updates for its own local models such that inference risk is minimized.\nThis method requires the victim to train hundreds and thousands of models locally for the meta-classifier, leads to large drops in task performance, and does not generalize to settings where the victim and adversary use different kinds of meta-classifiers. Other proposed defenses include removing sensitive attributes from features 5, using node-multiplicative transforms, or encoding arbitrary information into the models . Since black-box attacks only utilize relationships between inputs and model outputs, they are unaffected by such changes as long as model functionality remains unaffected. Additionally, the Permutation-Invariant Network architecture can be modified to have some form of scale-invariance as well, which in turn can also bypass such multiplicative defenses. Further, these defenses seem unlikely to diminish black-box attacks, which our experiments have shown to be more effective than known white-box attacks, hence we do not evaluate them here.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: not apply to protecting machine-learning models.
