      "content": "Paper Title: Time Series as Images: Vision Transformer for Irregularly Sampled Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime series data are ubiquitous in a wide range of domains, including healthcare, finance, traffic, and climate science. With the advances in deep learning architectures such as LSTM [ref]13, Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) [ref]18, and Transformer 8, numerous algorithms have been developed for time series modeling.\nHowever, these methods typically assume fully observed data at regular intervals and fixed-size numerical inputs. Consequently, these methods encounter difficulties when faced with irregularly sampled time series, which consist of a sequence of samples with irregular intervals between their observation times.\nTo address this challenge, highly specialized models have been developed, which require substantial prior knowledge and efforts in model architecture selection and algorithm design      4 . In parallel, pre-trained transformer-based vision models, most notably vision transformers,111In this paper, we use the term “vision transformers” to denote a category of pre-trained transformer-based vision models, such as ViT , Swin Transformer , DeiT 6, etc. have emerged and demonstrated strong abilities in various vision tasks such as image classification and object detection, nearly approaching human-level performance.\nMotivated by the flexible and effective manner in which humans analyze complex numerical time series data through visualization, we raise the question: Can these powerful pre-trained vision transformers capture temporal patterns in visualized time series data, similar to how humans do? To investigate this question, we propose a minimalist approach called ViTST (Vision Time Series Transformer), which involves transforming irregularly sampled multivariate time series into line graphs, organizing them into a standard RGB image format, and finetuning a pre-trained vision transformer for classification using the resulting image as input, as illustrated in Figure 1. Line graphs serve as an effective and efficient visualization technique for time series data, regardless of irregularity, structures, and scales. They can capture crucial patterns, such as the temporal dynamics represented within individual line graphs and interrelations between variables throughout separate graphs. Such a visualization technique benefits our approach because it is both simple and intuitively comprehensible to humans, enabling straightforward decisions for time series-to-image transformations. Leveraging vision models for time series modeling in this manner mirrors the concept of prompt engineering, wherein individuals can intuitively comprehend and craft prompts to potentially enhance the processing efficiency of language models. We conduct a comprehensive investigation and validation of the proposed approach, ViTST, which has demonstrated its superior performance over state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods specifically designed for irregularly sampled time series. Specifically, ViTST exceeded prior SoTA by 2.2% and 0.7% in absolute AUROC points, and 1.3% and 2.9% in absolute AUPRC points for healthcare datasets P19  and P12 , respectively. For the human activity dataset, PAM , we observed improvements of 7.3% in accuracy, 6.3% in precision, 6.2% in recall, and 6.7% in F1 score (absolute points) over existing SoTA methods.\nOur approach also exhibits strong robustness to missing observations, surpassing previous leading solutions by a notable 42.8% in absolute F1 score points under the leave-sensors-out scenario, where half of the variables in the test set are masked during testing.\nFurthermore, when tested on regular time series data including those with varying numbers of variables and extended sequence lengths, ViTST still achieves excellent results comparable to the specialized algorithms designed for regular time series modeling. This underscores the versatility of our approach, as traditional methods designed for regularly sampled time series often struggle with irregularly sampled data, and vice versa. In summary, the contributions of this work are three-fold: (1) We propose a simple yet highly effective approach for multivariate irregularly sampled time series classification. Despite its simplicity, our approach achieves strong results against the highly specialized SoTA methods.\n(2) Our approach demonstrates excellent results on both irregular and regular time series data, showcasing its versatility and potential as a general-purpose framework for time series modeling. It offers a robust solution capable of handling diverse time series datasets with varying characteristics.\n(3) Our work demonstrates the successful transfer of knowledge from vision transformers pre-trained on natural images to synthetic visualized time series line graph images. We anticipate that this will facilitate the utilization of fast-evolving and well-studied computer vision techniques in the time series domains, such as better model architecture , data augmentation 2, interpretability , and self-supervised pre-training .\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Time series data are ubiquitous in a wide range of domains, including healthcare, finance, traffic, and climate science.
