      "content": "Paper Title: Bypassing Logits Bias in Online Class-Incremental Learning with a Generative Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrent CL methods can be roughly divided into three categories: which are regularization, parameter isolation and replay-based respectively . Regularization methods retain the learned knowledge by imposing penalty constraints on model’s parameters [ref]8 or outputs [ref]9 when learning new data. They work well in TIL setting but poor in CIL setting . Parameter isolation methods assign a specific subset of model parameters, such as network weights  and sub-networks  to each task to avoid knowledge interference and thus the network may keep growing. This type of method is mainly designed for TIL as task identity is usually necessary during test. The mainstream of Replay-based methods is ER-like , which stores a subset of old data and retrains it when learning new data to prevent forgetting of old knowledge. In addition, generative replay method trains a generator to replay old data approximately . In the field of online CL, most of methods are on the basis of ER.  first explored ER in online CL settings with different memory update strategies. Authors suggested ER method should be regarded as an important baseline as in this setting it is more effective than several existing CL methods, such as A-GEM . GSS  designs a new memory update strategy by encouraging the divergence of gradients of samples in memory. MIR  is proposed to select the maximally interfered samples from memory for replay. GMED 0 edits the replay samples with gradient information to obtain samples likely to be forgotten, which can benefit the replay in the future.  focus on online CIL setting and adopt the notion of Shapley Value to improve the replay memory update and sampling. All of the above methods are replay-based with softmax classifier. A contemporary work 1 proposes CoPE, which is somewhat similar to our method. CoPE replaces softmax classifier with a prototype-based classifier which is non-parametric and updated using features of data samples. However, the loss function of CoPE is still discriminative and the way to classify is analogous to softmax classifier. Apart from the above ER based methods, 2 propose an online regularization method, however it performs very badly in online CL settings 0.  propose a parameter isolation method in which the network is dynamically expanded and a memory for storing data is still required. Therefore, the memory usage is not fixed and potentially unbounded. A recent work 3 proposes SDC, a CIL method based on DML and NCM classifier. However, SDC requires an extra phase to correct semantic drift after training each task. This phase depends on task boundaries and the accumulated data of a task, which is not applicable for online CIL. In contrast, our method is based on ER and classifies with replay memory and thus need not correct the drift.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: categories: which are regularization, parameter isolation and replay-based respectively .
