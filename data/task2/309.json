      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Image Classification with Evidence Counterfactual\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe use of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques for image classification has known substantial progress over the past years.\nPredictive performance has significantly improved, mainly due to the use of deep learning .\nHowever, this increased performance comes at a cost of increased model complexity and opacity.\nAs a result, state-of-the-art image classification models are used in a black-box way, without being able to explain model decisions. The need for explainability has become an important topic, often referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)   [ref]4 .\nOften cited motivations are increased trust in the model, compliance with regulations and laws, derivation of insights and guidance for model debugging  [ref]6.\nA lack of explainability is considered a major barrier for the adoption of automated decision making by companies [ref]7  .\nRecent governmental initiatives point at the importance of explainability 0 .\nIn the European Union, XAI has become an integral part of recent legal and ethical frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 0 and the guidelines on ethics in artificial intelligence 1.\nWe especially refer to the “right to explanation\", which is defined as the formal right to get an explanation for decisions that affect them in a legal or financial way.\nIt is argued that this right is part of GDPR 0, although this view is much debated 2.\nApart from regulatory pressure, companies face the increased awareness of consumers regarding privacy and automated decision-making. In general, an explanation provides an answer to the question why an event occurred.\nIn classification tasks, the event corresponds to an instance being assigned to a specific class.\nClosely related to explainability is the concept of interpretability, which can be defined as the property of being understandable for humans.\nThe terms explainability and interpretability are often used interchangeably, although some authors differentiate between them 3 4.\nIn line with Lipton 3, we follow the reasoning that a good explanation leads to post-hoc interpretability. As image classification for critical decisions is gaining ground, explainability is also becoming important in that context.\nWe can think of applications such as medical image diagnosis 5 or damage assessment in insurance 6, for which patients or consumers obviously demand an explanation.\nExplainability becomes even more important when severe misclassifications occur 7 8.\nBesides physical and/or reputational damage caused by the misclassification itself, companies should be able to explain what went wrong, at least to prevent this from happening in the future and to restore trust. For image classification, it can be argued that a good explanation allows to reveal an understandable pattern that led to the classification.\nIf the pattern of a correct classification is true in the real world, this contributes to trust in the model and insight in the decision.\nFurthermore, a good explanation should show for misclassifications why the error was made and provide input for model improvement.\nThird, an explanation can also reveal that a correct classification has occurred for wrong reasons, which cannot be derived from the black-box prediction itself.\nExamples can be found where bias in the data was learned during model training 9.\nAlso here, the discovered pattern is insightful en can be used for model improvement. Multiple explanation methods for (image) classification have been proposed in the literature.\nA distinction can be made between global explanations, which apply to a model in general, and instance-level explanations, which focus on isolated model predictions 0.\nFurthermore, methods to generate explanations can be model-specific (i.e., specific for the type of model, also called decompositional) or model-agnostic (i.e., applicable to different types of models, also called pedagogical).\nAlthough model-specific explanation methods can be more accurate and efficient, the main advantage of model-agnostic methods is their flexibility 1. Popular instance-level explanation methods for image classification such as LIME 2, SHAP 3 and LRP 4, typically create feature importance rankings.\nAlthough insightful, these methods have clear drawbacks: they do not determine the optimal explanation size, they do not account for feature dependence, and they are related to only one prediction class. In general, counterfactual explanations are considered promising to generate interpretable instance-level explanations of complex models 0 5.\nAdvantages are the contrastive nature 6, possible compliance with regulations 5, no constraints on model type and model complexity, and no need for model disclosure .\nBuilding on previous work, we apply counterfactual reasoning to explain individual image classifications. The contributions of this paper are threefold.\nFirst, we introduce novel model-agnostic methods, SEDC and SEDC-T, to generate instance-level explanations for image classification.\nThe visual and counterfactual nature of these explanations is strongly believed to increase interpretability.\nSecond, we argue how this method addresses limitations of existing explanation methods.\nThird, we show with concrete examples and experiments how this method is promising for both increasing trust and insight, and improving models.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: used in a black-box way, without being able to explain model decisions.
