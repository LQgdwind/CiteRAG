Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Since we follow the same experimental settings as in [ref]13 , we reuse the results of baselines from [ref]13 [ref]21, except EIGNN .\nFor the network architectures used in MGNNI for graph classification, we use three-layer MLP followed the ReLU function as input feature transformation f‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëì‚ãÖf(\\cdot).\nAfter the multiscale propagation with attention mechanism, we use the sum-pooling aggregator to obtain the graph representations. A linear map is used as the output transformation function (i.e., fo‚Äã(Xg)=W‚ÄãXgsubscriptùëìùëúsubscriptùëãùëîùëäsubscriptùëãùëîf_{o}(X_{g})=WX_{g}).\nWe set the number of hidden state as 32, y=0.8ùë¶0.8y=0.8 for all scale modules. The search space for the other hyperparameters is set as follows: multiscale set MùëÄM {{1,2}, {1,3}}, weight decay {0, 5e-6}, and learning rate {0.001, 0.01}. The Adam optimizer  is used for optimization.\nFor EIGNN, after their implicit layer, we use a 3-layer MLP with ReLU activation followed the sum-pooling layer to obtain the graph representations. A 2-layer MLP is used for generating the final predictions. Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma is set to 0.8 and other hyperparameters (learning rate and weight decay) are tuned over the same search space.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: with several representative baselines, including several explicit GNNs: Graph Convolution Network (GCN) , Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) , Fast and Deep Graph Neural Network (FDGNN) [ref]10, and Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) , and two other implicit GNNs: Implicit Graph Neural Network (IGNN) [ref]13 and Convergent Graph Solver (CGS) [ref]21.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
