      "content": "Paper Title: Diversity-Enriched Option-Critic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to solve very large problems efficiently depends on building and leveraging knowledge that can be re-used in many circumstances. One type of such knowledge comes in the form of\noptions  , temporally extended actions that can be viewed as specialized skills which can improve learning and planning efficiency  . The option-critic framework  proposed a formulation to learn option policies as well as the termination conditions end-to-end, through gradient descent, just from the agent’s experience and rewards. However, this can lead to the option set collapsing in various ways  , for example options becoming primitive actions, one option learning to solve the entire task and dominating the others, or several options becoming very similar. These degeneracies not only negatively impact the agent’s ability to re-use the learned option set in new situations, they often hurt performance. Furthermore, learning options in a model-free setting is often accompanied with increased sample and computational complexity over primitive action policies, without the desired performance improvements. This raises the fundamental question of why temporal abstraction is needed, especially when a primitive action policy achieves comparable results.\nThere have been attempts to tackle the problem of options collapsing onto multiple copies of the optimal policy   as well as ensuring that options do not shrink too much over time . However, finding a solution that can easily generalize over a wide range of tasks with minimal human supervision is still an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we tackle the problem by constructing a diverse set of options, which can be beneficial to increase exploration as well as for robustness in learning challenging tasks [ref]11 [ref]10 .\nA common approach for encouraging diversity in a policy is entropy regularization 7 , but it does not capture the idea of the set of options itself containing skills that differ from each other. Unlike in the case of primitive action policies where each action is significantly distinct, options often learn similar skills reducing the effectiveness of entropy regularization. To address this issue, we use intrinsic motivation. Augmenting the standard maximum reward objective with auxiliary bonus have encouraging results in promoting good exploration and performance  0 . We introduce an auxiliary reward which, when combined with the task reward, encourages diversity in the policies of the options. We empirically show how this diversity can help options explore better on several standard continuous control tasks.\nWe then focus on option termination. The termination objective used in option-critic  increases the likelihood of an option to terminate if the value of the current option is sub-optimal with respect to another. Though logical, this objective tends to suppress the worse option quickly without adequate exploration, often resulting in a single option dominating over the entire task   . To overcome this, we also propose a novel termination objective which produces diverse, robust and task relevant options. Our approach suggests that instead of having options compete for selection, adequate exploration of available options should be encouraged so long as they exhibit diverse behavior. Upon testing this new objective quantitatively and qualitatively in a classic tabular setting as well as several standard discrete and continuous control tasks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in robustness, interpretibility and reusability of specialized options in transfer learning.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: challenge.
