      "content": "Paper Title: GSA-Forecaster: Forecasting Graph-Based Time-Dependent Data with Graph Sequence Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo encode spatial dependency, there are two key problems to be solved: (1) determining the graph that represents spatial dependency when the graph is implicit or not provided;\n(2) leveraging the graph for prediction. Determining graph. The statistical model of Gaussian Markov random fields  is adopted to learn the spatial dependency graph from data. This way, we can infer spatial dependency based on the variation of the data at each node. This is usually better than estimating spatial dependency based on ad-hoc metrics or heuristics. For instance, in the example shown in Fig. 6, using a physical distance metric to estimate spatial dependency (i.e., assuming that nodes that are physically adjacent to each other are dependent) may mistakenly consider the taxi demand at New York Penn Station and the Empire State Building as spatially dependent because they are physically adjacent, and may mistakenly neglect the spatial dependency between the taxi demand at New York Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal just because of the longer distance between them. For this example, by exploiting the statistical correlation between time series, the theory of Gaussian Markov random fields successfully discovers the spatial dependency between the taxi demand at New York Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal . Gaussian Markov random fields model a graph signal 𝐱tsubscript𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{x}_{t} that consists of\nthe data xtisuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖x_{t}^{i} at each node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} at a certain time t𝑡t, i.e., 𝐱t=[xt1,⋯,xtN]⊤subscript𝐱𝑡superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡1⋯superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑁top\\mathbf{x}_{t}=\\left[{x_{t}^{1}},\\cdots,{x_{t}^{N}}\\right]^{\\top}, as a random vector drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The probability density function of 𝐱tsubscript𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{x}_{t} is: where 𝝁𝝁\\bm{\\mu} and Q𝑄Q are the mean and precision matrix\nof the distribution. The precision matrix Q𝑄Q characterizes the relations between data at different nodes. It can be estimated by solving graphical lasso , a sparse-penalized maximum likelihood estimator. After estimating the precision matrix Q𝑄Q, Forecaster uses it to calculate the conditional correlation between the data of every two nodes [ref]34 . A conditional correlation with large absolute value reveals the spatial dependency between two nodes and hence an edge is introduced to connect them. Leveraging graph. Forecaster embeds graph structure into the architecture of Transformer, enabling the modified Transformer to encode spatial dependency. To do this, Forecaster proposes sparse linear layers (neural layers that are sparse and represent graph structure) and uses them as substitutes for the fully-connected layers within Transformer (while keeping the nonlinear activation functions and other components). Fig. 9 shows an example of a graph with three nodes v1subscript𝑣1v_{1}, v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}, and v3subscript𝑣3v_{3} and two sparse linear layers (lthsuperscript𝑙th{l}^{\\textrm{th}} and l+1th𝑙superscript1th{l+1}^{\\textrm{th}} layers) designed based on this graph.888Different sparse linear layers can be designed based on this graph, e.g., by changing the number of neurons assigned to different nodes. This is a user choice. To design a sparse linear layer, Forecaster first assigns neurons to the nodes of the graph for encoding their data. In Fig. 9b,\nas an example, one neuron of the lthsuperscript𝑙thl^{\\textrm{th}} layer and two neurons of the l+1th𝑙superscript1th{l+1}^{\\textrm{th}} layer are assigned to each node in Fig. 9a. Then, Forecaster connects the neurons assigned to the same node or graph-dependent nodes, enabling the learnable weight on each connection to encode the impact of spatial dependency. In Fig. 9b, Forecaster connects the neurons assigned to nodes v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} and v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} (and connects the neurons assigned to nodes v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} and v3subscript𝑣3v_{3}) as these nodes are strongly dependent. However, as nodes v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} and v3subscript𝑣3v_{3} are not dependent, their neurons are not connected. In this way, the encoding for the data at a node is only impacted by its own encoding and the encoding of its dependent nodes, which captures the spatial dependency between nodes. Sparse linear layers are a type of graph convolutional network similar to GCN  and TAGCN  . All of these networks enrich the encodings of a node by the encodings of its adjacent nodes. The only major difference is, instead of treating adjacent nodes equally, sparse linear layers learn different weights for different adjacent nodes, considering that a node may depend with different strengths on its different adjacent nodes.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: lasso , a sparse-penalized maximum likelihood estimator.
