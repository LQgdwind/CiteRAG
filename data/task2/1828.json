Beyond purely academic literature, ML models are increasingly being applied as decision-makers alongside (or even in lieu of) humans. Many of these models are used in applications with a social impact. For example, models have been deployed to determine optimal coinsurance rates and tax rates , efficiently allocate health inspectors in cities , decide which patients receive medical interventions based on predicted risk of heart failure , assess risk in numerous criminal justice decisions , and much more. However, when ML models make such sensitive decisions, problems can arise. Specifically, predictive models may introduce or reinforce biases implicit in the data. When these models are indiscriminately deployed, they can have major impacts on individuals . As these models become more complex and the data more abundant, accuracy increases but transparency often decreases [ref]6. Accordingly, questions of fairness in machine learning – such as how to measure it and how to improve it – become all the more important. The contributions of this review are threefold. First, to our knowledge, this review is the first to focus specifically on gender bias in ML. We detail several examples of ML models that are gender biased to motivate further research in this area, formalize notions of fairness in ML, and survey a number of algorithms for mitigating gender bias. These algorithms can be broadly categorized into three groups based on when during training they are executed: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Second, we present a novel fusion of these methods to create an end-to-end bias mitigation framework for increasing fairness, which we test on a gender-biased dataset. Third, while the pre-, in-, and post-processing algorithms that comprise our end-to-end approach were applied to statistical models  [ref]8 [ref]9, we extend these algorithms to a deep learning setting to analyze the success of these techniques in complex domains. We close with a discussion of future directions of the field along with open-source packages that make fairness research broadly accessible.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: models are indiscriminately deployed, they can have major impacts on individuals .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
