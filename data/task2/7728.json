      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Repetitiveness Measures for Two-Dimensional Strings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the latest decades, the amount of data generated in the world has become massive. Nevertheless, in many fields, most of this data is highly repetitive. Repetitiveness has been showed to be an exploitable source of compressibility. In fact, compressors exploiting repetitiveness can perform much better on repetitive datasets like genome collections, compared to classic compressors approaching empirical entropy. Two-dimensional data, ranging from images to matrices, often contains inherent redundancy, wherein identical or similar substructures recur throughout the dataset. This great source of redundancy can be exploited for compression. Very recently, Brisaboa et al. introduced the 2D Block Trees to compress images, graphs, and maps [ref]3.\nOn the theoretical side, while in the one-dimensional case much attention has been given to the study and analysis of measures of repetitiveness to assess the performance of compressed indexing data structures [ref]14, in the two-dimensional context, since the data are more complex, there is still no systematic study of measures that can effectively capture repetitiveness.\nIt must also be said that in the one-dimensional case, an important role is played by the δ𝛿\\delta measure, which computes the maximum number of substrings of the same length that occur in a text, and γ𝛾\\gamma measure, which represents the smallest number of positions (string attractors) in the text at which all substrings can be found.\nThese measures, although unreachable or unknown to be reachable, lower-bound all other repetitiveness measures based on copy-paste mechanisms.\nFurthermore, the optimal space to represent a text can be expressed as a function of δ𝛿\\delta .\nIn the two-dimensional case, an important approach in this direction has been made by Carfagna and Manzini in , where the repetitiveness measures δ𝛿\\delta and γ𝛾\\gamma are extended to square two-dimensional strings, by exploring square substructures within the data. They have shown that some properties that hold for one-dimensional strings are still preserved in the two-dimensional case, and the space used by a two-dimensional block tree has been bounded in terms of the extension of δ𝛿\\delta. In this paper, we propose extensions of repetitiveness measures to generic two-dimensional strings. First of all, we introduce the measures δ2​Dsubscript𝛿2𝐷\\delta_{2D} and γ2​Dsubscript𝛾2𝐷\\gamma_{2D}, which differently from the measures defined in , use rectangular substrings, instead of square, in their definition. We show that our measures, while retaining many of the properties valid in one-dimensional case, can exhibit a significant gap when compared to those defined using the strategy proposed in , even if applied to one-dimensional strings. Furthermore, we generalize straight-line programs (SLPs) and run-length straight-line programs (RLSLPs). In particular, we introduce a new repetitiveness measure g2​Dsubscript𝑔2𝐷g_{2D} based on SLP and we show that, although it is NP-hard to compute, it is possible to access to an arbitrary position of the 2D strings in O​(gr​l2​D)𝑂subscript𝑔𝑟subscript𝑙2𝐷O(g_{{rl}_{2D}}) space and O​(h)𝑂ℎO(h) time, where hℎh is the length of the parse tree of the 2D-SLP. Note that the time to access any cell can become logarithmic in the size of the 2D string when a balancing procedure is applied . An analogous result can be obtained when 2D-RLSLP and the correspondent repetitiveness measure gr​l2​Dsubscript𝑔𝑟subscript𝑙2𝐷g_{{rl}_{2D}} are considered. Finally, we introduce macro schemes for 2D strings that generalize bidirectional macro schemes. We show that the mutual relationship among g2​Dsubscript𝑔2𝐷g_{2D}, gr​l2​Dsubscript𝑔𝑟subscript𝑙2𝐷g_{{rl}_{2D}} and the size b2​Dsubscript𝑏2𝐷b_{2D} of the smallest valid 2D macro scheme are the same as for one-dimensional strings. However, we show that some relevant relationship between δ𝛿\\delta, γ𝛾\\gamma and the other repetitiveness measures are lost when they are extended to the 2D setting. For instance, it is well known that for 1D strings the relationship δ≤γ≤b≤gr​l≤g𝛿𝛾𝑏subscript𝑔𝑟𝑙𝑔\\delta\\leq\\gamma\\leq b\\leq g_{rl}\\leq g holds. On the other hand, in the 2D setting, it can happen that δ2​D=Ω​(g2​D​N4/log⁡N)subscript𝛿2𝐷Ωsubscript𝑔2𝐷4𝑁𝑁\\delta_{2D}=\\Omega(g_{2D}\\sqrt{N}/\\log N) for some 2D string families, where N𝑁N is the size of the 2D strings. This bound is still valid also when the strategy proposed in  is used. For space reasons, in this paper we focus only on 2D strings. Note that the repetitiveness measure defined and studied in this paper can be naturally extended when d𝑑d-dimensional strings with d>2𝑑2d>2 are considered. In this context, all the results provided in the paper are still valid. More extensive and detailed results on higher dimensional strings are deferred to the full paper.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: recur throughout the dataset.
