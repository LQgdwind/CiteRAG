      "content": "Paper Title: A Probabilistic Framework for Lifelong Test-Time Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning models exhibit excellent performance in settings where the model is evaluated on data from the same distribution as the training data.\nHowever, the performance of such models degrades drastically when the distribution of the test inputs at inference time is different from the distribution of the train data (source) [ref]12  .\nThus, there is a need to robustify the network to handle such scenarios. A particularly challenging setting is when we do not have any labeled target domain data to finetune the source model, and unsupervised adaptation must happen at test time when the unlabeled test inputs arrive. This problem is known as test-time adaptation (TTA) 9 [ref]29 .\nMoreover, due to the difficulty of training a single model to be robust to all potential distribution changes at test time, standard fine-tuning is infeasible, and TTA becomes necessary. Another challenge in TTA is that the source domain training data may no longer be available due to privacy/storage requirements, and we only have access to the source pre-trained model. Current approaches addressing the problem of TTA 9 [ref]29   are based on techniques like self-training based pseudo-labeling or entropy minimization in order to enhance performance under distribution shift during testing.\nOne crucial challenge faced by existing TTA methods is that real-world machine learning systems work in non-stationary and continually changing environments.\nEven though the self-training based approaches perform well when test inputs are from a different domain but all still i.i.d., it has been found that the performance is unstable when target test inputs come from a continually changing environment . Thus, it becomes necessary to perform test-time adaptation in a continual manner. Such a setting is challenging because the continual adaptation of the model in the long term makes it more difficult to preserve knowledge about the source domain.\nContinually changing test distribution causes pseudo-labels to become noisier and miscalibrated  over time, leading to error accumulation  which is more likely to occur if early predictions are incorrect.\nWhen adapting to new test input, the model tends to forget source domain knowledge, triggering catastrophic forgetting  4 2.\nMoreover, existing TTA methods do not account for model/predictive uncertainty, which can result in miscalibrated predictions. Recently,  proposed CoTTA, an approach to address the continual/lifelong TTA setting using a stochastic parameter reset mechanism to prevent forgetting. Their reset mechanism however is based on randomly choosing a subset of weights to reset and is not data-driven. Moreover, their method does not take into account model/predictive uncertainty and is therefore susceptible to overconfident and miscalibrated predictions. To improve upon these challenges of continual/lifelong TTA, we propose a principled, probabilistic framework for lifelong TTA. Our framework (shown in Fig. 1 (Right)) constructs a posterior distribution over the source model weights and a data-dependent prior which results in a self-training based cross-entropy loss, with a regularizer term in the learning objective.\nThis regularizer arises from terms corresponding to the posterior, which incorporates knowledge of source (training) domain data. Moreover, our framework also offers a probabilistic perspective and justification to the recently proposed CoTTA   approach, which arises as a special case of our probabilistic framework. In particular, only considering the data-driven prior in our approach without the regularizer term, corresponds to the student-teacher based cross-entropy loss used in CoTTA.\nFurther, to improve upon the stochastic restore used by , we present a data-driven parameter restoration based on Fisher Information Matrix (FIM).\nIn terms of improving accuracy and enhancing calibration during distribution shift, our approach surpasses existing approaches in various benchmarks.\n\nMain Contributions From a probabilistic perspective, we arrive at the student-teacher training framework in our proposed Probabilistic lifElong Test-time Adaptation with seLf-training prior (PETAL) approach.\nInspired from the self-training framework  , the teacher model is the exponential moving average of the student model, as depicted in Fig. 1 (Right). The student-teacher cross-entropy loss with a regularizer term corresponding to posterior of source domain data naturally emerges in the probabilistic formulation. We propose a data-driven parameter restoration based on Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to handle error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: training data.\nHowever, the performance of such models degrades drastically when the distribution of the test inputs at inference time is different from the distribution of the train data (source) [ref]12  .\nThus, there is a need to robustify the network to handle such scenarios.
