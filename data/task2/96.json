      "content": "Paper Title: A Set of Distinct Facial Traits Learned by Machines Is Not Predictive of Appearance Bias in the Wild\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe construct a transfer learning model to leverage face representations extracted from a pre-trained, state-of-the-art face recognition model (Figure 2). Since we are testing whether standard industry methods are capable of learning trait inferences, we use popular industry techniques for pre-processing and modeling. First, according to the state-of-the-art, we crop and align every face with pose estimation to ensure the faces have similar size, shape, and rotation . By cropping out the bald head, we also make the computer-generated images seem more gender-neutral. Then, from the final layer of FaceNet, a popular open-source Inception-ResNet-V1 deep learning architecture, we extract a standard 128-dimensional feature vector from the pixels of each transformed image . For thousands of images, extraction takes minutes. Rather than train FaceNet from scratch, we utilize a model with weights pre-trained on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset, a common face recognition benchmark , downloaded from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet. We chose this transfer learning approach to mitigate the fact that our dataset is entirely computer-generated: by using a model pre-trained on real faces, we can extract features more similar to features from images in the wild. MS-Celeb-1M contains 10 million images of one million celebrities and was one of the largest publicly available face recognition benchmark datasets, making it a popular choice for transfer learning face recognition models, before Microsoft took it down in 2019 [ref]32. Notably, MS-Celeb-1M was reportedly used to train controversial mass surveillance algorithms in China 8. By using a pre-trained model for feature extraction, we imitate feature processing techniques used commonly in black box industry models. The FaceNet model (over 10 thousand stars on Github), and similar architectures such as OpenFace (over 13 thousand stars on Github), are used by software developers, researchers, and industry groups  . After feature extraction, we train six random forest regression models555We also tested an SVM model (with RBF kernel) and a logistic regression model (l2 penalty, C=1.0ùê∂1.0C=1.0). The SVM performed about 3 points worse in cross validation than the logistic regression or random forest models. We chose the random forest model because 1) with bootstrap aggregating and random feature selection it tends not to overfit , and 2) parallelization for quicker execution. to predict appearance bias for each of the six traits measured: attractiveness, competence, dominance, extroversion, likeability, and trustworthiness.\nThe human participants‚Äô trait scores, multiplied by 100 for readability, serve as the ground-truth labels. The random forest includes 100 weak learners with no maximum depth, a minimum split size of two, and mean-squared-error split criterion. Data and code used to produce the figures, tables, and pre-trained model (Figure¬†2) in this work are available at https://github.com/ryansteed/learning-appearance-bias .\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: and was one of the largest publicly available face recognition benchmark datasets, making it a popular choice for transfer learning face recognition models, before Microsoft took it down in 2019 [ref]32.
