      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Scan Multi-Sensor Multi-Object State Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInstead of the state or trajectory of a single object, multi-object\nstate estimation is concerned with the joint estimation of the number\nof objects and their trajectories , ,\n. This problem has a wide range of application areas\nfrom aerospace , computer vision\n[ref]5, [ref]6, , to cell\nbiology . Multi-object state\nestimation is challenging because we have to address the unknown and\ntime-varying number of objects, false negatives/positives, and data\nassociation uncertainty, which altogether incur a combinatorial complexity.\nThe three main approaches to multi-object estimation in the literature\nare Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) , Joint\nProbabilistic Data Association (JPDA) 0, and\nRandom Finite Set (RFS)  . Apart from\nthe number of objects and their trajectories, the RFS approach also\nprovides statistical characterization of the entire ensemble of objects\n1. In general, employing multiple sensors in state estimation enhances\ndetection capability and spatial coverage, reliability, observability,\nand reduces uncertainty 2, 3. There\nare many applications that fundamentally require multiple sensors\nbecause a single sensor is simply not adequate, see e.g., 4 5.\nMoreover, given the proliferation of inexpensive sensors, effective\nmultiple sensor solutions are imperative for exploiting their intended\ncapabilities. The benefits of multiple sensors are even more significant\nin multi-object estimation, where there is inherent additional uncertainty. In multi-object estimation, the benefits of multiple sensors come\nwith additional challenges due to the NP-hard multi-dimensional\ndata association problem that arises from the matching of objects\nto measurements across multiple sensors , 3,\n6, 7. Several approximate multi-sensor\nmulti-object estimation solutions have been developed. Centralized\narchitecture solutions include the multi-sensor Probability Hypothesis\nDensity (PHD) and Cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filters ,\n8 multi-sensor JPDA filter 9, multi-Sensor\nmulti-Bernoulli filter 0, and multi-sensor Generalized\nLabeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter 1. The latter\nincurs a linear complexity in the total number of measurements across\nthe sensors, without significantly compromising optimality. Decentralized\nsolutions have also been developed for the PHD, CPHD filters 2,\n3, 4 multi-Bernoulli filter\n5, 6, 7, LMB and\nmarginalized GLMB filters 8. Whereas filtering only considers the current timestep, the multi-scan\napproach considers the history of the multi-object states over a time\nwindow, thereby allowing the correction of previous errors 9,\n, 0. MHT forms hypotheses by associating\nmeasurements to tracks across a time window 1, and\ndelays making estimates until further information becomes available.\nIn 2, a fixed lag smoother was integrated to\nthe JPDA filter 0, where it was shown that a\nsignificant improvement in tracking accuracy over filtering can be\nachieved with small window of sizes two and three. The first RFS multi-scan\nmulti-object filter was developed in 0, where all statistical\ninformation pertinent to the multi-object system over the time window\nis encapsulated in the multi-object posterior, including statistics\non the ensemble of trajectories. Computing this posterior, however,\nalso requires solving NP-hard multi-dimensional ranked assignment\nproblems. Recently, an efficient numerical algorithm with polynomial\ncomplexity was developed for propagating the so-called (multi-scan)\nGLMB posterior, where multi-dimensional ranked assignment problems\nare solved using Gibbs sampling 1. Ideally, if computational tractability were not an issue, to inherit\nall the benefits from both multi-sensor and multi-scan solutions we\nshould make use of measurements from all sensors across multiple scans.\nHowever, keeping in mind that the multi-scan problem itself requires\nsolving NP-hard multi-dimensional ranked assignment problems, and\nditto for the multi-sensor problem, the joint multi-scan multi-sensor\nproblem is far more computationally demanding. Consequently, research\non multi-scan multi-sensor multi-object estimation is very limited.\nTo the best of our knowledge, only a two-scan two-sensor demonstration\nwith four objects, using an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) JPDA filter,\nhas been reported 3. This article addresses multi-scan multi-sensor multi-object estimation\nvia the labeled RFS formulation, which translates to computing a labeled\nmulti-object posterior consisting of an intractably large weighted\nsum of set functions. Approximating this so-called GLMB posterior\nby retaining the highest weighted terms minimizes the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1}-norm\napproximation error 1, and requires solving far more\nchallenging multi-dimensional assignment problems than those for multi-scan\n(with single-sensor) or multi-sensor (with single-scan). Indeed, the\nposterior truncation problem for V sensors across K\nscans is a (KV)-dimensional assignment problem, and existing\ntechniques are not adequate for K and V greater\nthan two, even with only four objects. We propose an efficient multi-dimensional assignment solution with\npolynomial complexity using Gibbs sampling, together with convergence\nanalysis. This solution generalizes those for multi-sensor (with single-scan)\nand multi-scan (with single-sensor) in 1, 1.\nThe resultant multi-object estimation algorithm can be used offline\nin one batch or recursively at each measurement update, i.e., smoothing-while-filtering.\nThe efficacy and utility of the proposed solution are demonstrated\nin numerical experiments. For the purposes of establishing the theoretical\nfoundation and scalability for the algorithm, we focus on the (labeled)\nmulti-object posterior, which involves a growing window of scans.\nWhile such a growing window results in a complexity per time step\nthat grows with time, the algorithm can be easily adapted to a fixed-length\nmoving window, so that the complexity per time step is fixed. Note\nthat filtering is a special case of the moving window approach with\na window length of one. A formulation that produces trajectories with\na fixed complexity per time step is only possible with labels, see\ne.g., 4, 5 for further discussion.\nWithout labels, the only way to obtain trajectories is by using a\ngrowing window which incur a complexity per time step that grows exponentially\nwith time. Such an approach is impractical even for the simplest case\nof single object state estimation with a single sensor 6. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section II\nsummarizes relevant concepts in multi-object estimation, and Section\nIII presents the implementation details\nof the multi-sensor GLMB posterior recursion. Section IV\npresents the numerical studies, and Section V\nconcludes the paper. Mathematical proofs are given in the supplementary\nmaterials.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: estimation is concerned with the joint estimation of the number\nof objects and their trajectories , ,\n.
