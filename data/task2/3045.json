      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised GAN Detector\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBased on the recent enhancement of the generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [ref]1, it has become easy to obtain high-quality fake images generated by deep-learning models  .\nMany recent generative models can even transform the target images to include the specific properties of the users’ choices   [ref]6  .\nHowever, as technology progresses, the danger of intentionally misusing the fake images for purposes like fraud, defamation, and fake news grows   .\nTo prevent such cases, it is important to distinguish between the real images and the generated images by GANs [ref]12. Previous image forgery detection techniques tended to focus on unnatural features in human faces  , but many recent models have evolved to uncover distinctive features produced during the image generation process [ref]12.\nFor example, the fingerprints generated during the upsampling estimation of the generator can be successfully detected in the frequency domain    .\nUnfortunately, the frequency-level fingerprints differ between generative models and object categories, causing GAN detectors to be data-dependent.\nAs a result, when the GAN detectors are tested with the generated images of the unseen GAN models or object categories, they experience a performance reduction .\nAlthough 0 1 tried to overcome these limitations by using transfer learning with a little amount of data, it is unreasonable to expect to be able to get training data for the unknown GAN models employed by the abusers 2.\nFor the generalization of GAN detectors, it is far more efficient to use unsupervised or self-supervised training. Therefore, we suggest a novel self-supervised framework composed of the artificial fingerprint generator and the GAN detector.\nThe artificial fingerprint generator is trained only with the real images to reconstruct the diverse artificial fingerprints of the generated images by GANs.\nBased on the well-known analysis that the upconvolution layers produce the artifacts  3 4, we build our artificial fingerprint generator to be composed of multiple autoencoders effectively reproducing the diverse artificial fingerprints of GAN models.\nTo further consider the GAN models where the upconvolution layers are removed 5 [ref]6, we also utilize the additional autoencoder designed to reconstruct the input image without any upsampling operation.\nThen, the GAN detector is trained to distinguish the real images and the reconstructed images from the artificial fingerprint generator, so we can ignore the fake images of the training datasets in the overall training processes.\nUnlike unsupervised GAN networks [ref]1, which generate images of varying quality based on learning the data distributions of real images, autoencoders can reconstruct high-quality images that are nearly identical to the original real images while effectively avoiding data dependency due to a specific GAN dataset.\nOur method is tested with various real-world scenarios to validate the state-of-the-art generalization ability of our model to detect the unseen GAN models and object categories.\nIn addition, our additional experiments reveal that when extra target fake images are included in the GAN detector’s training, our approach shows reasonable improvements compared to the previous studies. We can summarize our contributions as follows: Unlike the previous GAN detectors dependent on the generated images by GAN models, our model utilizes the self-supervised training method to obtain generalized detection ability and avoid data dependency. We build the artificial fingerprint generator that replicates the generation of artifacts from the various GAN models independent of their upconvolution layer composition, allowing the GAN detector to be trained robustly across different GAN models and categories. Our method shows robust performance compared to the previous GAN detectors even without training the fake images generated by GAN models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Based on the recent enhancement of the generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [ref]1, it has become easy to obtain high-quality fake images generated by deep-learning models  .\nMany recent generative models can even transform the target images to include the specific\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
