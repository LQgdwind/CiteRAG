      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Representations of Bi-level Knowledge Graphs for Reasoning beyond Link Prediction1footnote 11footnote 1Published in the Proceedings of the 37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2023).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSome knowledge graph completion methods use multi-hop paths between distant entities  [ref]25 [ref]18 [ref]24  and rule-based or logic-based methods identify frequently observed patterns      . The main difference between these methods and BiVE is that the existing methods only consider the relationships between entities, whereas BiVE considers not only the relationships between entities but also the relationships between triplets. Also, the way of expressing the relationships between entities or triplets in BiVE is not restricted to the first-order-logic-like expression. For example, the rule-based methods consider the relationships between connected entities, e.g., ∀x,y,z:(x,r1,y)∧(y,r2,z)⇒(x,r3,z):for-all𝑥𝑦𝑧⇒𝑥subscript𝑟1𝑦𝑦subscript𝑟2𝑧𝑥subscript𝑟3𝑧\\forall x,y,z:(x,r_{1},y)\\wedge(y,r_{2},z)\\Rightarrow(x,r_{3},z) where there should exist a path connecting x𝑥x, y𝑦y, and z𝑧z in the knowledge graph. On the other hand, BiVE represents relationships like (x,r1,y)⇒r^(p,r2,q)^𝑟⇒𝑥subscript𝑟1𝑦𝑝subscript𝑟2𝑞(x,r_{1},y)\\xRightarrow{\\widehat{r}}(p,r_{2},q) where x𝑥x, y𝑦y and p𝑝p, q𝑞q are not necessarily connected by the base-level triplets, and also r1subscript𝑟1r_{1}, r2subscript𝑟2r_{2}, and ⇒r^^𝑟⇒\\xRightarrow{\\widehat{r}} can be any relation not restricted to the first-order-logic-like relation. Even though there have been many attempts to discover meaningful patterns in a knowledge graph and utilize them to complete missing links , such attempts have rarely been studied in the context of data augmentation. Recently, rule-based data augmentation for knowledge graph embedding has been proposed We could not include this method as a baseline in our experiments because the authors of  could not provide their source codes due to some confidentiality restrictions.. While this method uses logical rules using the base-level triplets, our data augmentation employs random walks on a bi-level knowledge graph. To exploit enriched information about triplets, some knowledge graph embedding methods utilize attributes of entities or ontological concepts . TransEA  considers numeric attributes of entities, and LiteralE  considers information from literals. HINGE  has been proposed to represent hyper-relational facts where a triplet has additional key-value pairs to present extra information about each triplet. Even though these methods consider enriched information about triplets, they do not consider the relationships between triplets. In information retrieval, a neural fact contextualization method has been proposed to rank a set of candidate facts for a given triplet . Also, a way of representing a triplet in an embedding space is studied by considering the concept of a line graph . Recently, ATOMIC  has been proposed to provide commonsense knowledge for if-then reasoning, whereas ASER  has been proposed to construct an eventuality knowledge graph. Although these methods consider triplet-level operations, the goal of their methods is different from ours and none of these considers the bi-level knowledge graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Some knowledge graph completion methods use multi-hop paths between distant entities  [ref]25 [ref]18 [ref]24  and rule-based or logic-based methods identify frequently observed patterns      .
