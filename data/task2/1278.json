      "content": "Paper Title: What Makes a “Good” Data Augmentation in Knowledge Distillation – A Statistical Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Distillation (KD). The general idea of knowledge distillation is to guide the training of a student model through a (stronger) teacher model (or an ensemble of models). It was pioneered by Buciluǎ et al. [ref]4 and later refined by Hinton et al. , who coined the term. Since its debut, KD has seen extensive application in vision and language tasks [ref]6    . Many variants have been proposed regarding the central question in KD, that is, how to define the knowledge transferred from the teacher to the student. Examples of such knowledge definitions include feature distance , feature map attention , feature distribution , activation boundary , inter-sample distance relationship    , and mutual information . Several works    investigate the connection between label smoothing and knowledge distillation. Another line of works (e.g., ) attempts to understand KD more theoretically. Over the past several years, the progress has been made primarily for intermediate feature maps and network outputs (i.e., through a better loss function). In contrast, our goal is to improve the KD performance at the input end with the help of data augmentation. We will show this path is as effective and also has much potential for future research. Data Augmentation (DA). Deep neural networks are prone to overfitting, i.e., building input-target mappings using undesirable or irrelevant features (like noise) in the data. Data augmentation is a prevailing technique to curb overfitting . In classification tasks, data augmentation aims to explicitly provide data with label-invariant transformations (such as random crop, horizontal flip, color jittering, Cutout ) during training so that the model can learn representations robust to those nuisance factors. Recently, more advanced data augmentation methods were proposed, which not only transform the input, but also transform the target. For example, Mixup 4 linearly mixes two images with the labels mixed by the same linear interpolation. Manifold Mixup  is similar to Mixup but conducts the mix operation in the feature level instead of pixel level; CutMix 1 pastes a patch cut from an image onto another image with the label decided by the area ratio of the two parts. AutoAugment  is a strong DA method that finds an optimal augmentation policy from a large search space via reinforcement learning. When both the input and target are transformed simultaneously, the key is to maintain a semantic correspondence between the new input and new target. Unlike these methods, which focus on general classification using the cross-entropy loss, our work investigates the interplay between data augmentation and knowledge distillation loss and proposes new data augmentation specifically for knowledge distillation. Some recent KD works also involve the utilization of DA in KD, such as [ref]2 . Especially, [ref]2 also employs Mixup and prolonged training to enhance the student performance in KD, akin to ours. Yet it is worthwhile to note that our paper is substantially different from theirs, in that we are seeking the theoretical reason explaining how to define a better DA in KD to deliver better performance; these works mainly investigate in an empirical fashion, with no theoretical results presented. Meanwhile, our work is not limited to one specific DA (see Sec. 5). We target a general theoretical understanding which can apply to a broad scope of DA schemes (fortunately, as our experiments show, the proposed theory and the derived DA “goodness” measure indeed capture it). The fact that [ref]2 utilizes Mixup 4 and prolonged training to deliver 82.8% top-1 accuracy with resnet50  on ImageNet  can be a direct proof that the principle proposed in this work can bring us very promising practical benefits. One recent work  also conducts empirical studies of the impact of DA on KD. They first apply DA (e.g., Mixup/CutMix) to the teacher training then conduct the KD step as usual (no extra DA in this step). Our investigation is the exact opposite to their setup: We train the teacher as usual (no Mixup/CutMix), then in the KD step we employ a more advanced DA (e.g., Mixup/CutMix). Interestingly, they conclude that the teacher trained with Mixup/CutMix hurts the student’s generalization ability, while we consistently see student performance boost via a stronger DA. Another recent work  utilizes KD to re-label mixed samples in Mixup to fix the inaccurate labelling problem of Mixup. Their work shows that KD can be used to make Mixup more generally useful, which is orthogonal to the topic of this work. The work of  presents a statistical perspective to understand how the softened probabilities in KD are better than the one-hot hard labels. Our work is inspired by their Bayes teacher notion. This said, our work is different from theirs in that we focus on explaining how data augmentation plays a role in KD and answer what characterizes a good DA, while they attempt to answer why the knowledge distillation loss is better than the standard cross-entropy loss.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: (KD).
