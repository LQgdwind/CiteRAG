      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness of equations over finite solvable groups under the exponential time hypothesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn [ref]6, Barrington, Straubing and Thérien conjectured that, if G𝐺G is finite and solvable, every G𝐺G-program computing the n𝑛n-input  and requires length exponential in n𝑛n. This is called the  and -weakness conjecture. Unfortunately, the term “exponential” seems to be a source of a possible misunderstanding: while often it means 2Ω​(n)superscript2Ω𝑛2^{\\Omega(n)}, in other occasions it is used for 2nΩ​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛Ω12^{n^{\\Omega(1)}}.\nIndeed, in  , the conjecture is restated as its strong version: “every G𝐺G-program over a solvable group G𝐺G for the n𝑛n-input  and requires length 2Ω​(n)superscript2Ω𝑛2^{\\Omega(n)}.” However, already in the earlier paper , it is remarked that the n𝑛n-input  and can be computed by depth-k𝑘k 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0} circuits of size 2𝒪​(n1/(k−1))superscript2𝒪superscript𝑛1𝑘12^{\\mathcal{O}(n^{1/(k-1)})} for every k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 (a 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0} circuit is a circuit consisting only of MODmsubscriptMOD𝑚\\mathrm{MOD}_{m} gates for some m∈ℕ𝑚ℕm\\in\\mathbb{N}) – thus, disproving the strong version of the  and -weakness conjecture.\nFor a recent discussion about the topic also referencing the cases where the conjecture actually is proved, we refer to . In this section we provide a more detailed upper bound on the length of G𝐺G-programs for the  and function in terms of the Fitting length of G𝐺G. We can view our upper bound as a refined version of the 2𝒪​(n1/(k−1))superscript2𝒪superscript𝑛1𝑘12^{\\mathcal{O}(n^{1/(k-1)})} upper bound for depth-k𝑘k 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0} circuits. This is because, by [35, Theorem 2.8], for every depth-k𝑘k 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0} circuit family there is a fixed group G𝐺G of Fitting length k𝑘k (indeed, of derived length k𝑘k) such that the n𝑛n-input circuit can be transformed into a\nG𝐺G-program of length polynomial in n𝑛n. The easiest variant to disprove the strong version of the  and -weakness conjecture is a divide-and-conquer approach: Assume we can compute the n𝑛n-input  and by a 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0}-circuit of size 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} and depth 222 (which is true by ). Since we can decompose the n𝑛n-input  and as n𝑛\\sqrt{n}-input  and of n𝑛\\sqrt{n} many n𝑛\\sqrt{n}-input  and s, we obtain a 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0} circuit of depth 444 and size roughly 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{\\sqrt{n}} – or, more generally, a 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0} circuit of depth 2​k2𝑘2k and size roughly 2nksuperscript2𝑘𝑛2^{\\sqrt[k]{n}}. The proof of Proposition 3.1 uses a similar divide-and-conquer approach: Let G𝐺G be a finite solvable group and consider a strictly ascending series 1=H0⊲H1⊲⋯⊲Hm=G1subscript𝐻0subgroup-ofsubscript𝐻1subgroup-of⋯subgroup-ofsubscript𝐻𝑚𝐺1=H_{0}\\mathrel{\\lhd}H_{1}\\mathrel{\\lhd}\\cdots\\mathrel{\\lhd}H_{m}=G of normal subgroups where Hi=γki​(Hi+1)subscript𝐻𝑖subscript𝛾subscript𝑘𝑖subscript𝐻𝑖1H_{i}=\\gamma_{k_{i}}(H_{i+1}) with ki∈ℕ∪{∞}subscript𝑘𝑖ℕinfinityk_{i}\\in\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\left\\{\\,\\mathinner{\\infty}\\,\\right\\} for i∈[1..m−1]i\\in[\\mathinner{1}..\\mathinner{m-1}] and k0=∞subscript𝑘0k_{0}=\\infty. Denote c=|{i∈[1..m−1]|ki=∞}|c=\\left|\\mathinner{\\left\\{\\,\\mathinner{i\\in[\\mathinner{1}..\\mathinner{m-1}]}\\vphantom{k_{i}=\\infty}\\>\\left|\\>\\vphantom{i\\in[\\mathinner{1}..\\mathinner{m-1}]}\\mathinner{k_{i}=\\infty}\\right.\\,\\right\\}}\\right| and C=∏ki<∞(ki+1)𝐶subscriptproductsubscript𝑘𝑖subscript𝑘𝑖1C=\\prod_{k_{i}<\\infty}(k_{i}+1). Then the n𝑛n-input  and function can be computed by a G𝐺G-program of length 𝒪​(2D​n1/c)𝒪superscript2𝐷superscript𝑛1𝑐\\mathcal{O}(2^{Dn^{1/c}}) where D=cC1/c𝐷𝑐superscript𝐶1𝑐D=\\frac{c}{C^{1/c}}. More precisely, for every n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N} there is some 1≠g∈G1𝑔𝐺1\\neq g\\in G and a G𝐺G-program Qnsubscript𝑄𝑛Q_{n} of length 𝒪​(2D​n1/c)𝒪superscript2𝐷superscript𝑛1𝑐\\mathcal{O}(2^{Dn^{1/c}}) such that Clearly we have c≤d−1𝑐𝑑1c\\leq d-1 if d𝑑d is the Fitting length of G𝐺G. The lower Fitting series is the special example of such a series where Hi=ℒd−i​Gsubscript𝐻𝑖subscriptℒ𝑑𝑖𝐺H_{i}=\\mathcal{L}_{d-i}G and ki=∞subscript𝑘𝑖k_{i}=\\infty for all i∈{0,…,d}𝑖0…𝑑i\\in\\left\\{\\,\\mathinner{0,\\dots,d}\\,\\right\\}. Thus, we get the following corollary: Let G𝐺G be a finite solvable group of Fitting length d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2. Then the n𝑛n-input  and function can be computed by a G𝐺G-program of length 2𝒪​(n1/(d−1))superscript2𝒪superscript𝑛1𝑑12^{\\mathcal{O}(n^{1/(d-1)})}. The symmetric group on four elements S4subscript𝑆4S_{4} has Fitting length 3 with S4≥A4≥C2×C2≥1subscript𝑆4subscript𝐴4subscript𝐶2subscript𝐶21S_{4}\\geq A_{4}\\geq C_{2}\\times C_{2}\\geq 1 being both the upper and lower Fitting series. Therefore, we obtain a length-𝒪​(22n))\\mathcal{O}(2^{2\\sqrt{n})}) program for the n𝑛n-input  and by Proposition 3.1. In particular, the strong version of the  and -weakness conjecture does not hold for the group S4subscript𝑆4S_{4}. Note that according to [ref]6, S4subscript𝑆4S_{4} is the smallest group for which the 2Ω​(n)superscript2Ω𝑛2^{\\Omega(n)} lower bound from [ref]6 does not apply. On the other hand, consider the group G=(C3×C3)⋊D4𝐺right-normal-factor-semidirect-productsubscript𝐶3subscript𝐶3subscript𝐷4G=(C_{3}\\times C_{3})\\rtimes D_{4} where D4subscript𝐷4D_{4} (the dihedral group of order eight) acts faithfully on C3×C3subscript𝐶3subscript𝐶3C_{3}\\times C_{3}222This group can be found in the GAP small group library under the index  07240 0. It has been suggested as an example by Barrington (private communication).. It has Fitting length two. Moreover, its derived subgroup G′=(C3×C3)⋊C2superscript𝐺′right-normal-factor-semidirect-productsubscript𝐶3subscript𝐶3subscript𝐶2G^{\\prime}=(C_{3}\\times C_{3})\\rtimes C_{2} still has Fitting length two. Hence, we have a series H3=Gsubscript𝐻3𝐺H_{3}=G, H2=G′=γ1​Gsubscript𝐻2superscript𝐺′subscript𝛾1𝐺H_{2}=G^{\\prime}=\\gamma_{1}G, H1=γ∞​G′=C3×C3subscript𝐻1subscript𝛾superscript𝐺′subscript𝐶3subscript𝐶3\\,H_{1}=\\gamma_{\\infty}G^{\\prime}=C_{3}\\times C_{3}, and H0=1subscript𝐻01H_{0}=1. Therefore, we get an upper bound of 𝒪​(2n/2)𝒪superscript2𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(2^{n/2}) for the length of a program for the n𝑛n-input  and . We choose K=(n/C)1/c𝐾superscript𝑛𝐶1𝑐K=(n/C)^{1/c}. For simplicity, let us first assume that K𝐾K is an integer. Moreover, we assume that K𝐾K is large enough such that Hi=[Hi+1K]subscript𝐻𝑖delimited-[]subscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖1𝐾H_{i}=\\left[{}_{K}\\,\\kern 1.00006pt{H_{i+1}}\\right] holds whenever ki=∞subscript𝑘𝑖k_{i}=\\infty and that K≥ki+1𝐾subscript𝑘𝑖1K\\geq k_{i}+1 for all ki<∞subscript𝑘𝑖k_{i}<\\infty. We define sets Ai⊆Gsubscript𝐴𝑖𝐺A_{i}\\subseteq G inductively by Am=Gsubscript𝐴𝑚𝐺A_{m}=G and Ai=[Ai+1K]setsubscript𝐴𝑖subscriptdelimited-[]subscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖1𝐾setA_{i}=\\left[{}_{K}\\,\\kern 1.00006pt{A_{i+1}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{set}} if ki=∞subscript𝑘𝑖k_{i}=\\infty and Ai=[Ai+1ki+1]setsubscript𝐴𝑖subscriptdelimited-[]subscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖1subscript𝑘𝑖1setA_{i}=\\left[{}_{k_{i}+1}\\,\\kern 1.00006pt{A_{i+1}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{set}} if ki<∞subscript𝑘𝑖k_{i}<\\infty.\nBy Lemma 2.1 and induction it follows that Hi=⟨Ai⟩subscript𝐻𝑖delimited-⟨⟩subscript𝐴𝑖H_{i}=\\left<\\mathinner{A_{i}}\\right> for all i∈0,…,m𝑖0…𝑚i\\in{0,\\dots,m}. Since H1≠1subscript𝐻11H_{1}\\neq 1, we find a non-trivial element g∈A1𝑔subscript𝐴1g\\in A_{1}. We can decompose g𝑔g recursively. For this, we need some more notation: for ℓ∈[1..m]\\ell\\in[\\mathinner{1}..\\mathinner{m}] consider the set of words We have |Vm|=C⋅Kc=nsubscript𝑉𝑚⋅𝐶superscript𝐾𝑐𝑛\\left|\\mathinner{V_{m}}\\right|=C\\cdot K^{c}=n, so we can fix a bijection κ:Vm→[1..n]\\kappa\\colon V_{m}\\to[\\mathinner{1}..\\mathinner{n}]. Now, we can describe the recursive decomposition of g=gϵ𝑔subscript𝑔italic-ϵg=g_{\\epsilon}: gv=[gv​1,…,gv​K]subscript𝑔𝑣subscript𝑔𝑣1…subscript𝑔𝑣𝐾g_{v}=[g_{v1},\\dots,g_{vK}] for v∈Vℓ𝑣subscript𝑉ℓv\\in V_{\\ell} with kℓ=∞subscript𝑘ℓk_{\\ell}=\\infty, and gv=[gv​1,…,gv​(kℓ+1)]subscript𝑔𝑣subscript𝑔𝑣1…subscript𝑔𝑣subscript𝑘ℓ1g_{v}=[g_{v1},\\dots,g_{v(k_{\\ell}+1)}] for v∈Vℓ𝑣subscript𝑉ℓv\\in V_{\\ell} with kℓ<∞subscript𝑘ℓk_{\\ell}<\\infty. This, in particular, we can view gϵsubscript𝑔italic-ϵg_{\\epsilon} as a word over the gvsubscript𝑔𝑣g_{v} for v∈Vm𝑣subscript𝑉𝑚v\\in V_{m}. For v∈Vℓ𝑣subscript𝑉ℓv\\in V_{\\ell} we have |gv|≤∑i=1K2K+1−i​|gv​i|≤2K+1​maxi⁡|gv​i|subscript𝑔𝑣superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝐾superscript2𝐾1𝑖subscript𝑔𝑣𝑖superscript2𝐾1subscript𝑖subscript𝑔𝑣𝑖\\left|\\mathinner{g_{v}}\\right|\\leq\\sum_{i=1}^{K}2^{K+1-i}\\left|\\mathinner{g_{vi}}\\right|\\leq 2^{K+1}\\max_{i}\\left|\\mathinner{g_{vi}}\\right| whenever kℓ=∞subscript𝑘ℓk_{\\ell}=\\infty and |gv|≤2kℓ+2​maxi⁡|gv​i|subscript𝑔𝑣superscript2subscript𝑘ℓ2subscript𝑖subscript𝑔𝑣𝑖\\left|\\mathinner{g_{v}}\\right|\\leq 2^{k_{\\ell}+2}\\max_{i}\\left|\\mathinner{g_{vi}}\\right| if kℓ<∞subscript𝑘ℓk_{\\ell}<\\infty. Therefore, setting D=cC1/c𝐷𝑐superscript𝐶1𝑐D=\\frac{c}{C^{1/c}} we obtain by induction In order to obtain a G𝐺G-program for the n𝑛n-input  and , we define G𝐺G-programs Pvsubscript𝑃𝑣P_{v} for v∈⋃ℓ≤mVℓ𝑣subscriptℓ𝑚subscript𝑉ℓv\\in\\bigcup_{\\ell\\leq m}V_{\\ell}. In the commutators we need also programs for inverses: for a G𝐺G-program P=⟨Bi1,a1,b1⟩​⟨Bi2,a2,b2⟩​⋯​⟨Biℓ,aℓ,bℓ⟩𝑃subscript𝐵subscript𝑖1subscript𝑎1subscript𝑏1subscript𝐵subscript𝑖2subscript𝑎2subscript𝑏2⋯subscript𝐵subscript𝑖ℓsubscript𝑎ℓsubscript𝑏ℓP=\\langle B_{i_{1}},a_{1},b_{1}\\rangle\\langle B_{i_{2}},a_{2},b_{2}\\rangle\\cdots\\langle B_{i_{\\ell}},a_{\\ell},b_{\\ell}\\rangle we set P−1=⟨Biℓ,aℓ−1,bℓ−1⟩​⋯​⟨Bi1,a1−1,b1−1⟩superscript𝑃1subscript𝐵subscript𝑖ℓsuperscriptsubscript𝑎ℓ1superscriptsubscript𝑏ℓ1⋯subscript𝐵subscript𝑖1superscriptsubscript𝑎11superscriptsubscript𝑏11P^{-1}=\\langle B_{i_{\\ell}},a_{\\ell}^{-1},b_{\\ell}^{-1}\\rangle\\cdots\\langle B_{i_{1}},a_{1}^{-1},b_{1}^{-1}\\rangle. Clearly (σ​(P))−1=σ​(P−1)superscript𝜎𝑃1𝜎superscript𝑃1(\\sigma(P))^{-1}=\\sigma(P^{-1}) for all assignments σ𝜎\\sigma. for v∈Vm𝑣subscript𝑉𝑚v\\in V_{m} we set Pv=⟨Bκ​(v),1,gv⟩subscript𝑃𝑣subscript𝐵𝜅𝑣1subscript𝑔𝑣P_{v}=\\langle B_{\\kappa(v)},1,g_{v}\\rangle, for v∈Vℓ𝑣subscript𝑉ℓv\\in V_{\\ell} with 1≤ℓ<m1ℓ𝑚1\\leq\\ell<m we set Pv=[Pv​1,…,Pv​K]subscript𝑃𝑣subscript𝑃𝑣1…subscript𝑃𝑣𝐾P_{v}=[P_{v1},\\dots,P_{vK}] if kℓ=∞subscript𝑘ℓk_{\\ell}=\\infty, and for v∈Vℓ𝑣subscript𝑉ℓv\\in V_{\\ell} with 1≤ℓ<m1ℓ𝑚1\\leq\\ell<m we set Pv=[Pv​1,…,Pv​(kℓ+1)]subscript𝑃𝑣subscript𝑃𝑣1…subscript𝑃𝑣subscript𝑘ℓ1P_{v}=[P_{v1},\\dots,P_{v(k_{\\ell}+1)}] if kℓ<∞subscript𝑘ℓk_{\\ell}<\\infty. For v∈Vℓ𝑣subscript𝑉ℓv\\in V_{\\ell} let V​(v)𝑉𝑣V(v) denote the set of those words w∈Vm𝑤subscript𝑉𝑚w\\in V_{m} having v𝑣v as a prefix.\nBy induction we see that This shows the correctness of our construction. It remains to consider the case that (n/C)1/csuperscript𝑛𝐶1𝑐(n/C)^{1/c} is not an integer. Then we set K=⌈(n/C)1/c⌉𝐾superscript𝑛𝐶1𝑐K=\\left\\lceil\\mathinner{(n/C)^{1/c}}\\right\\rceil. It follows that |Vm|=C⋅Kc≥nsubscript𝑉𝑚⋅𝐶superscript𝐾𝑐𝑛\\left|\\mathinner{V_{m}}\\right|=C\\cdot K^{c}\\geq n, so we can fix a bijection κ:U→[1..n]\\kappa\\colon U\\to[\\mathinner{1}..\\mathinner{n}] for some subset U⊆Vm𝑈subscript𝑉𝑚U\\subseteq V_{m}.

This concludes the proof of Proposition 3.1. In the light of Proposition 3.1 it is natural to ask for a refined version of the  and -weakness conjecture. A natural candidate would be to conjecture that every G𝐺G-program for the n𝑛n-input  and has length 2Ω​(n1/(d−1))superscript2Ωsuperscript𝑛1𝑑12^{\\Omega(n^{1/(d-1)})} where d𝑑d is the Fitting length of G𝐺G. However, this also weaker version of the  and -weakness conjecture is wrong!\nIndeed, in [4, Section 2.4] Barrington, Beigel and Rudich show that the n𝑛n-input  and can be computed by circuits using only MODmsubscriptMOD𝑚\\mathrm{MOD}_{m} gates of depth 3 and size 2𝒪​(n1/r​log⁡n)superscript2𝒪superscript𝑛1𝑟𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(n^{1/r}\\log n)} where r𝑟r is the number of different prime factors of m𝑚m. Translating the circuit into a G𝐺G-program yields a group G𝐺G of Fitting length 3. Since there is no bound on r𝑟r, we see that there is no lower bound on the exponent δ𝛿\\delta such that there are G𝐺G-programs of length 2𝒪​(nδ)superscript2𝒪superscript𝑛𝛿2^{\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\delta})} for the n𝑛n-input  and in groups of Fitting length 3.\nWhile this does not yield smaller 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0} circuits or shorter G𝐺G-programs than the approach of Proposition 3.1 allows, it shows that the divide-and-conquer technique on which Proposition 3.1 relies is not always the best way for constructing small programs for  and . In  it is shown that the  and function can be computed by probabilistic 𝖢𝖢0superscript𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{CC}^{0} circuits using only a logarithmic number of random bits, which “may be viewed as evidence contrary to the conjecture” .\nIn the light of this, we do not feel confident to judge which form of the  and -weakness conjecture might be true. The following version seems possible. Let G𝐺G be finite solvable. Then every G𝐺G-program for the n𝑛n-input  and has length 2nΩ​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛Ω12^{n^{\\Omega(1)}}. Notice that [5, Theorem 2] (if G𝐺G is  and -weak, ProgramSAT over G𝐺G can be decided in quasi-polynomial time) still holds with this version of the  and -weakness conjecture.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: In [ref]6, Barrington, Straubing and Thérien conjectured that, if G𝐺G is finite and solvable, every G𝐺G-program computing the n𝑛n-input  and requires length exponential in n𝑛n.
