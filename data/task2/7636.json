The KG-TOSA task-oriented sampling aims to prune the search space by identifying the minimal subgraph s‚Äãgùë†ùëîsg in a KG, where s‚Äãgùë†ùëîsg is related to the task at hand. Unlike our approach, IBMB¬†[ref]25 introduced\nPersonalized Pagerank (PPR) to calculate the influenced scores in homogeneous graphs to sample a representative graph that could be used to train different tasks. IBMB does not support KGs and task-oriented HGNNs training. There is a growing effort to develop systems for training GNNs on large graphs at scale. These systems aim to (i) distribute the training across multiple GPUs or CPUs in a single machine (scale-up)¬† [ref]43, or (ii) distribute the training across a cluster of machines with multiple GPUs or CPUs per machine (scale-out)¬†   [ref]47 . KG-TOSA can be used with scale-out and scale-up systems to optimize the use of existing resources.\nAll the used GNN methods in our evaluation are based on scale-up frameworks, such as the PYG¬†. NeuGraph¬† leverages multi-GPU in single-machine to improve training performance.\nMarius¬† optimizes graph embedding learning by using partition caching and buffer-aware data ordering.\nThere are several scale-out GNN frameworks, as follows. DistDGL¬† uses partitioning with load balancing to achieve high scalability.\nSANCUS¬† reduces communication overhead using a powerful parallel algorithm and abstracting GNN processing as sequential matrix multiplication.\nAliGraph¬†[ref]47 also uses static cache but only supports CPU servers.\nDGL-Dist supports RGCN and different sampling techniques.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: The KG-TOSA task-oriented sampling aims to prune the search space by identifying the minimal subgraph s‚Äãgùë†ùëîsg in a KG, where s‚Äãgùë†ùëîsg is related to the task at hand.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
