To solve (1) approximately, the induction principle of empirical risk minimization suggests to optimize an objective that averages the loss function on the training sets {𝒟k}k∈𝒦subscriptsubscript𝒟𝑘𝑘𝒦\\{\\mathcal{D}_{k}\\}_{k\\in\\mathcal{K}} instead . Mathematically, federated learning algorithms aim to solve the following\n(Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)) problem [ref]3: where Fk​(𝒘)subscript𝐹𝑘𝒘F_{k}(\\boldsymbol{w}) is the agent k𝑘k’s local empirical risk (loss), given by One can anticipate that the optimal solution 𝒘osuperscript𝒘𝑜\\boldsymbol{w}^{o} to (3) approximates the solution to (1).444Throughout this work, we use empirical risk functions (e.g., {Fk}subscript𝐹𝑘\\{F_{k}\\}) in the objectives of federated learning problems and agents’ payments, while we use expected risk functions (e.g., {Ek}subscript𝐸𝑘\\{E_{k}\\}) for risk bound analysis. \nTo quantify such a risk bound, we first\nadopt the following standard assumptions on the per-sample loss function ℓ​(⋅,⋅,⋅)ℓ⋅⋅⋅\\ell(\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot)\nthroughout this paper (as in, e.g.,   [ref]9): The gradients of the per-sample loss function ∇𝐰ℓ​(𝐰,𝐱,y)subscript∇𝐰ℓ𝐰𝐱𝑦\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{w}}\\ell(\\boldsymbol{w},\\boldsymbol{x},y) are well-defined and continuous such that\nthere exists a constant Lgsubscript𝐿𝑔L_{g} satisfying for any 𝐰1,𝐰2∈ℝdsubscript𝐰1subscript𝐰2superscriptℝ𝑑\\boldsymbol{w}_{1},\\boldsymbol{w}_{2}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} and (𝐱,y)∈(𝒳,𝒴)𝐱𝑦𝒳𝒴(\\boldsymbol{x},{y})\\in(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y}). The per-sample loss function ℓ​(𝐰,𝐱,y)ℓ𝐰𝐱𝑦\\ell(\\boldsymbol{w},\\boldsymbol{x},y) is μ𝜇\\mu-strongly convex in 𝐰𝐰\\boldsymbol{w} for all (𝐱,y)∈(𝒳,𝒴)𝐱𝑦𝒳𝒴(\\boldsymbol{x},{y})\\in(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y}), i.e., for any 𝐰1,𝐰2∈ℝd,(𝐱,y)∈(𝒳,𝒴)formulae-sequencesubscript𝐰1subscript𝐰2superscriptℝ𝑑𝐱𝑦𝒳𝒴\\boldsymbol{w}_{1},\\boldsymbol{w}_{2}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d},(\\boldsymbol{x},{y})\\in(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y}), Typical examples that satisfy these assumptions include ridge regression, l​2𝑙2l2-norm regularized logistic regression, and softmax classifiers.\nWe further use Lℓsubscript𝐿ℓL_{\\ell} denote the maximal norm of the gradient of the per-sample loss at 𝒘osuperscript𝒘𝑜\\boldsymbol{w}^{o}: We can now characterize the risk bound in the following: The following inequality is true with a probability of 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta: where 𝐰osuperscript𝐰𝑜\\boldsymbol{w}^{o} is the optimal solution to the federated learning problem in (3), d𝑑d is the dimension of 𝐰𝐰\\boldsymbol{w}. The proof of Proposition 1 involves bounding ∇𝒘E​(𝒘o)subscript∇𝒘𝐸superscript𝒘𝑜\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{w}}E(\\boldsymbol{w}^{o}) by the Hoeffding’s inequality and leveraging the strong convexity of E​(⋅)𝐸⋅E(\\cdot).\nIn the case of the FedAvg algorithm in [ref]3, which selects pk=nk/nsubscript𝑝𝑘subscript𝑛𝑘𝑛p_{k}={n_{k}}/{n} for all k∈𝒦𝑘𝒦k\\in\\mathcal{K}, the right hand side of (8) becomes Lℓ2​d​log⁡(2​d/δ)4​μ​nsuperscriptsubscript𝐿ℓ2𝑑2𝑑𝛿4𝜇𝑛\\frac{L_{\\ell}^{2}d\\log(2d/\\delta)}{4\\mu n}, which implies that the bound in this case converges to 00 as n→∞→𝑛n\\rightarrow\\infty.
