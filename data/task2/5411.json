In particular, a famous historical celebrated mathematical model is the\nGeneral Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) model, introduced by Shanon in 1941 in , as a\nmodel for the Differential Analyzer , a mechanical programmable\nmachine, on which he worked\nas an operator. It is known that functions computed by a GPAC correspond\nto a (component of the) solution of a system of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODE) with polynomial right-hand side (also called pODE) , . Relating the computational power of this model to classical models such as the Turing machines, at the complexity level, is not a trivial task. In short, contrarily to discrete models of computation, continuous time models of computation (not only the GPAC, but many others) may exhibit the so-called ‚ÄúZeno phenomena‚Äù, where time can be arbitrarily contracted in a continuous system, thus allowing an arbitrary speed-up of the computation. This forbids to take the naive approach of using the time variable of the ODE as a well-defined measure of time complexity: see   for discussions. A celebrated recent breakthrough has been obtained in  , where it has been proved that a key idea to solve this issue is, when using pODEs (in principle this idea can also be used for others continuous models of computation) to compute a given function fùëìf,\nthe cost should be measured as a function of the length of the solution curve of the polynomial initial value computing the function fùëìf.\nAs ODEs is a kind of universal language in experimental sciences, this breakthrough led to solve several open problems in various other contexts.\nThis includes the proof of the existence of a universal (in the sense of Rubel) ODE [ref]9; proof of the strong Turing-completeness of biochemical reactions , or statements about the completeness of reachability problems (e.g. PTIMEPTIME\\operatorname{PTIME}-completeness of bounded reachability) for ODEs . While it is now known that time should be measured by length, the question on how space should be measured is unclear. How should be measure the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù used by some ordinary differential equation? Can we provide a characterization of PSPACEPSPACE\\operatorname{PSPACE} using ODEs similar to the characterization of PTIMEPTIME\\operatorname{PTIME} obtained in ? If time corresponds to length, what space corresponds to? We give some arguments to state that basically, over a compact domain space corresponds to precision, while it corresponds to the log of the size of some graph for systems over more general domains.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: language in experimental sciences, this breakthrough led to solve several open problems in various other contexts.\nThis includes the proof of the existence of a universal (in the sense of Rubel) ODE [ref]9; proof of the strong Turing-completeness of biochemical reactions , or statements about the completeness of reachability problems (e.g. PTIMEPTIME\\operatorname{PTIME}-completeness of bounded\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
