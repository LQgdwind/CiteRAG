      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-Adaptation Priors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine-Learning (ML) at production often requires constant model updating which can have huge financial and environmental costs  [ref]44. The production pipeline is continuously evolving, where new data are regularly pooled and labeled and old data become irrelevant. Regular tuning of hyperparameters is required to handle drifts , and sometimes even the model class/architecture may need to change.\nDue to this, the model is frequently retrained, retested, and redeployed, which can be extremely costly, especially when the data and model sizes are large.\nThe cost can be reduced if, instead of repeated retraining, the system can quickly adapt to incremental changes. Humans and animals can naturally use their prior knowledge to handle a wide-variety of changes in their surroundings, but such quick, wide, and accurate adaptation has been difficult to achieve in ML. In theory, this should be possible within a Bayesian framework where the posterior is used as the prior for the future, but exact Bayes is computationally challenging and the design of generic Bayesian priors has its own challenges  .\nIn ML, simpler mechanisms are more popular, for example, in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for adding/removing data   , and in deep learning for model compression .\nWeight-priors are used in online learning , and more recently for continual learning     , but they are not suited for many other tasks, such as model compression. In some settings, they also perform worse, for example, in continual learning when compared to memory-based strategies   [ref]45 [ref]9.\nAll these previous works apply to narrow, specific settings, and designing generic adaptation-mechanisms remains an open challenge. We present Knowledge-adaptation priors (K-priors) for the design of generic adaptation-mechanisms. The general principle of adaptation is to combine the weight and function-space divergences to faithfully reconstruct the gradient of the past.\nK-priors can handle a wide variety of adaptation tasks (Fig. 1, left) and work for a range of models, such as generalized linear models, deep networks, and their Bayesian\nextensions.\nThe principle unifies and generalizes many seemingly-unrelated existing works, for example, weight-priors , knowledge distillation , SVMs   , online Gaussian Processes , and continual learning  [ref]45 [ref]9.\nIt leads to natural adaptation-mechanisms where models’ predictions need to be readjusted only at a handful of past experiences (Fig. 1, middle). This is quick and easy to train with first-order optimization methods and, by choosing a sufficiently large memory, we obtain results similar to retraining-from-scratch (Fig. 1, right).\nCode is available at https://github.com/team-approx-bayes/kpriors.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: Machine-Learning (ML) at production often requires constant model updating which can have huge financial and environmental costs  [ref]44.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
