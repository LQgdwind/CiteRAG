      "content": "Paper Title: Developing Future Human-Centered Smart Cities: Critical Analysis of Smart City Security, Data Management, and Ethical Challenges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn a smart city, sensors are deployed at various places to gather data about different aspects of the city—e.g., data related to transportation, healthcare, and environment—which is then sent to a central server for analysis or processed locally at the edge devices to obtain useful insights using AI techniques. Thanks to the recent advancement in technology, government authorities can now gather real-time data, combined with the capabilities of AI, can manage public services in cities more efficiently and effectively. For instance, having enough information about roads condition, traffic volume, and people’s commute means in a city, authorities can eliminate the bottlenecks which can, in turn, reduce city traffic, crowd, and pollution, leading to a more optimized, sustainable, and clean services and environment. Some of the currently available key applications of AI in smart cities are illustrated in\nFigure 1 and described next. Healthcare: The basic motivation of ML applications in healthcare lies in its ability to automatically analyze, identify hidden patterns, and extract meaningful clinical insights from large volumes of data, which is beyond the scope of human capabilities. The automatically extracted insights are generally efficient, and help medical staff in planning and treatment, ultimately leading to effective and low-cost treatment with increased patient satisfaction . In recent years, AI has been heavily deployed in healthcare, and proved very effective, thanks to the recent advancement in deep learning. For instance, a solution proposed by Google  outperformed human doctors (i.e., by around 16% accuracy) in the identification of breast cancer in mammograms. Similarly, AI solutions proposed in  , have been proved very effective in the diagnosis of skin and lung cancer, respectively. Transportation and Autonomous Cars: Transportation can benefit from AI in several ways. For instance, its predictive capabilities can help in traffic volume and congestion estimation for route optimization . AI algorithms can also be jointly used with multimedia processing techniques for road safety , driver distraction , and accident events detection  and road passability analysis 6 . However, AI can be considered as a backbone of autonomous cars where one of the key responsibilities of the AI module is continuous monitoring of the surrounding environment and the prediction of different events, which generally involves the detection and recognition of various objects such as pedestrians, vehicles, and roadside objects . Education: AI brings several advantages in education by contributing to several tasks, such as automatic grading and evaluation, students’ retention and dropout prediction, personalized learning, and intelligent tutoring systems . AI predictive capabilities could also help in predicting students’ career paths by applying AI techniques on students’ data covering different aspects, such as interests and performances in different subjects. Crime Detection/prediction and Tracking: It is another interesting smart city application where AI has shown its potential. AI is transforming the way law enforcement agencies operate to prevent, detect, and deal with crimes. In the modern world, law enforcement agencies are heavily relying on predictive analysis to track crimes and identify the most vulnerable areas of a city, where additional force and patrolling teams could be deployed. One example of such tools is PredPol, which relies on AI techniques to predict “hot spot” crime neighborhoods . Clean and Sustainable Environment: AI also helps in monitoring and maintaining a clean and sustainable environment. Thanks to the recent advancement in deep learning and satellite technologies, environment monitoring and enforcement are more efficient than ever [ref]40. AI techniques have been widely deployed in analyzing remotely sensed data for environmental changes. Moreover, AI techniques have also been demonstrated to be very effective in disaster detection , water management , and waste classification .  Smart Building: Smart building represents an automatic structure/system to control the building’s operations such as lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and security. AI has been widely exploited for various tasks in smart systems as elaborated upon in . Tourism, Culture, Services, and Entertainment: Tourism and entertainment industries are also benefited big time by AI and social media [ref]45. For instance, AI-based recommendation systems are widely used by travelers in the decisions of their holidays’ destinations considering different variables, such as transportation and accommodation facilities, cost, food, and historical points. In addition, AI-based applications could help travelers in fraud detection, cost optimization, and identification of entertainment venues and transportation facilities at the destination. Apart from the recommendation systems, which is one of the main applications of AI in the sector, AI enabled visual sentiment analysis tools could be used to search or extract scenes from long TV show videos based on sentiment analysis . Despite the outstanding performances and success, AI also brings challenges in the form of privacy and unintentional bias in public services. For instance, to analyze people’s commute patterns, the administration needs to collect and process a lot of people’s data, including their movements risking people’s personal information to be leaked. The intentional and unintentional bias in decisions of AI is even more dangerous, which might endanger citizens’ lives in healthcare or law enforcement applications. For instance, an AI-based software used for future criminals predictions was found biased against blacks . Similarly, the smart system used to predict the health care needs of about 70 million patients in the US was assigning higher risks (scores) to black patient compared to white patients with the same medical conditions . It must be noted that the algorithms do not learn the bias on their own rather it comes from the data used to train the algorithms, which reflects the social and institutional biases of the society practiced over the years . Moreover, being a product of humans, AI algorithms reflect the beliefs, objectives, priorities, and design choices of humans (i.e., developers). For instance, to make accurate predictions, AI algorithms need the training data to be properly annotated and must contain sufficient representation for each class. An over-representation of a class may develop a tendency towards the class in predictions. A trade-off between false positives and false negatives is also very crucial for AI predictions. These limitations of AI hinder its way of overcoming social and political biases to achieve smart cities’ true objectives. According to Green , AI algorithms in smart city applications are mostly influenced by the social and political choices of the society and authorities. Therefore, to ensure privacy and reduce bias of AI algorithms in human-centric applications, we need to discuss the need, goals, and potential impact of their decisions on society before deploying them. Moreover, there are several security threats to AI models in smart city applications, for instance, attackers can launch adversarial attacks on AI models to bias the decisions by disturbing their prediction capabilities. For example, an adversarial attacker might turn off an autonomous car on a high way, and ask for money to restart it. A more serious situation could be stopping a train on the platform just before the arrival of the next train . Another challenge is the lack of interpretability—which results in humans being unable to understand the causes of an AI model’s decision. To deal with such risks involved in deploying AI in smart city applications, the concept of explainability and ethics in AI has been introduced. In the next sections, we provide a detailed overview and analysis of the potential security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to AI in smart city applications.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: and maintaining a clean and sustainable environment.
