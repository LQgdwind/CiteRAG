Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Similar to the usage in decision trees, we add just one selection network below the SPN instead of selecting one variable per leaf.\nThat is, the variable input of the secure leaf computation (see below) is the outcome of the selection network, which selects the variables Xϕ​(1),…,Xϕ​(m)subscript𝑋italic-ϕ1…subscript𝑋italic-ϕ𝑚X_{\\phi(1)},\\ldots,X_{\\phi(m)} for the m𝑚m leaves in the SPN from the n𝑛n client inputs according to a server input ϕ:[m]↦[n]:italic-ϕmaps-todelimited-[]𝑚delimited-[]𝑛\\phi\\colon[m]\\mapsto[n] denoting which leaf i≤m𝑖𝑚i\\leq m uses Xϕ​(i)subscript𝑋italic-ϕ𝑖X_{\\phi(i)}.\nIf m≥n𝑚𝑛m\\geq n (which we assume is true since RVs are usually used more than once), the complexity of such a selection network is : beating the trivial solution of O​(n​m)𝑂𝑛𝑚O(nm).\nThis requires |X|​κ​(n+2​Cn,msel)𝑋𝜅𝑛2subscriptsuperscript𝐶sel𝑛𝑚|X|\\kappa(n+2C^{\\text{sel}}_{n,m}) bits of setup communication and |X|​n​(2​κ+1)𝑋𝑛2𝜅1|X|n(2\\kappa+1) bits online .\nHereby, one can hide the scope of any SPN, including ones learned through other methods  (although the topology is still leaked).\nWe propose to use this approach to increase privacy in cases where leaking the topology is deemed acceptable, or where re-learning the structure of an already existing SPN is infeasible.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: to an oblivious array access in each leaf, where an array can be accessed without revealing the accessed location j𝑗j.\nThere exist efficient methods to do this based on homomorphic encryption [ref]6 or secure evaluation of selection networks  via SMPC.\nA recent study of private decision tree evaluation  shows that selection networks outperform selection based on HE in both total and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
