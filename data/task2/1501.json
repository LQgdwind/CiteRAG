      "content": "Paper Title: ExpFinder: An Ensemble Expert Finding Model Integrating 𝑁-gram Vector Space Model and \\hits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFinding experts in a particular domain is key to accelerate rapid formation of teams to respond to new opportunities, as well as undertake and address new frontiers in research innovations. Further, accurately identified experts can significantly contribute to enhancing the research capabilities of an organisation leading to higher quality research outcomes. In general, an expert is defined as a person who has sufficient knowledge and skills in a given field . Such knowledge and skills are called expertise. While digitally available data (e.g. scientific publications) describing expertise of experts is rapidly growing, manually collating such information to find experts seems impractical and expensive. Thus, often in a large research organisation with diverse disciplines, finding experts in a field that one does not know or has limited knowledge is particularly very challenging. Information retrieval techniques have been widely used to aid retrieval task for finding experts from digitally available expertise data (we collectively term these as documents in this paper)\nsuch as scientific publications .\nBased on the literature , there are two specific tasks for expert retrieval: (1) expert finding - identifying experts given a topic from available documents and rank them based on their expertise level, and (2) expert profiling - identifying the areas of expertise given an expert.\nIn this paper we focus on the first task (i.e. expert finding) and propose an ensemble model for it from unstructured documents. We use the term topic to represent a field of expertise. Most existing approaches for expert finding are based on vector space models (VSM), document language models (DLM), or graph-based models (GM).\nIn VSM, expert finding is often solved by modeling the weights of topics, associated with the documents produced by experts, using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) or its variation  .\nIn DLM, expert finding is achieved by estimating the probability that a topic would be observed in the documents of an expert  [ref]7 .\nIn GM, a graph is used to represent associations among experts, documents and/or topics. The strengths of the associations are inferred to estimate the expertise degree of an expert given a topic using various graph analytics such as expert-document-term association paths , Hyper-Induced Topic Search (HITS) 0 1, or social network based link analysis methods 2 3 4. Although various models in these approaches aforementioned have been proposed, integrating VSM and GM for expert finding has been little studied in the literature. In this work, we propose an ensemble model for expert finding, ExpFinder111ExpFinder’s source code is publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/Yongbinkang/ExpFinder, that integrates a novel N𝑁N-gram VSM, denoted as n𝑛nVSM, with a GM using an expert collaboration graph (ECG). We develop n𝑛nVSM for estimating the expertise degree (or weight) of an expert given a topic by leveraging the recent Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) weighting 5 for N𝑁N-gram words (simply N𝑁N-grams) composed of two or more terms (for N>>1). This method demonstrated a higher robustness and effectiveness in measuring the IDF weights of N𝑁N-grams.\nWe also build an ECG in the form of an expert-document bipartite graph to represent the associations between experts and documents based on the co-authorship information.\nTo estimate the weight of an expert given a topic on the ECG, we propose the GM, \\hits, that is formed by applying two variation schemes to the generalised CO-HITS 6 algorithm. This paper makes three main contributions. First, to our best knowledge, ExpFinder is the first attempt to introduce n𝑛nVSM for expert finding.\nSecond, we propose ExpFinder an ensemble model that combines n𝑛nVSM and the GM using \\hitsto create a stronger model for expert finding that achieves better performance than a single one. ExpFinder incorporates the weights of experts estimated by n𝑛nVSM into an ECG and uses \\hitson the ECG to better estimate the weights of experts for a given topic. Third, we conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations to measure the effectiveness of ExpFinder using four different datasets (LExR 7 and three DBLP datasets 8) in academic domains and compare the results with six different expert finding models: the TFIDF-based VSM, two DLMs   and three GMs  9 6. This rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides related works in expert finding. Section 3 presents an overview of ExpFinder and Section 4 discusses in-depth steps for building ExpFinder.\nSection 5 presents thorough empirical evaluations of ExpFinder, followed by conclusion in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) or its variation  .\nIn DLM, expert finding is achieved by estimating the probability that a topic would be observed in the documents of an expert  [ref]7 .\nIn GM, a graph is used to represent associations among experts, documents and/or topics. The strengths of the associations are inferred to estimate the expertise degree of an expert given a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
