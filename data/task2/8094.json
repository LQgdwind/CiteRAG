      "content": "Paper Title: On the parameterized complexity of computing good edge-labelings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe start with some basic definitions that will be used throughout the paper. We use standard graph-theoretic notation, and we refer the reader to  for any undefined terms.\nAll graphs we consider are finite and undirected, except in section 7 where we consider digraphs.\nA graph G𝐺G has vertex set V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) and edge set E​(G)𝐸𝐺E(G). An edge between two vertices u,v𝑢𝑣u,v is denoted by u​v𝑢𝑣uv. For a graph G𝐺G and a vertex set S⊆V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subseteq V(G), the graph G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] has vertex set S𝑆S and edge set {u​v∣u,v∈S​ and ​u​v∈E​(G)}conditional-set𝑢𝑣𝑢𝑣𝑆 and 𝑢𝑣𝐸𝐺\\{uv\\mid u,v\\in S\\text{ and }uv\\in E(G)\\}.\nWe use the shorthand G∖S𝐺𝑆G\\setminus S to denote G​[V​(G)∖S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑉𝐺𝑆G[V(G)\\setminus S]. For a single vertex v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), we use G∖v𝐺𝑣G\\setminus v as a shorthand for G∖{v}𝐺𝑣G\\setminus\\{v\\}. Similarly, for a set of edges F⊆E​(G)𝐹𝐸𝐺F\\subseteq E(G) we denote by G∖F𝐺𝐹G\\setminus F the graph on vertex set V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) with edge set E​(G)∖F𝐸𝐺𝐹E(G)\\setminus F. For two sets of vertices S1,S2⊆V​(G)subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2𝑉𝐺S_{1},S_{2}\\subseteq V(G), we denote by E​(S1,S2)𝐸subscript𝑆1subscript𝑆2E(S_{1},S_{2}) the subset of E​(G)𝐸𝐺E(G) containing all edges with one endpoint in S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} and the other one in S2subscript𝑆2S_{2}. A cycle on three vertices is called a triangle. For two positive integers i,j𝑖𝑗i,j with i≤j𝑖𝑗i\\leq j, we denote by [i,j]𝑖𝑗[i,j] the set of all integers ℓℓ\\ell such that i≤ℓ≤j𝑖ℓ𝑗i\\leq\\ell\\leq j, and by [i]delimited-[]𝑖[i] the set [1,i]1𝑖[1,i]. Given v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), we denote NG​(v)={u∣u​v∈E​(G)}subscript𝑁𝐺𝑣conditional-set𝑢𝑢𝑣𝐸𝐺N_{G}(v)=\\{u\\mid uv\\in E(G)\\}, dG​(v)=|NG​(v)|subscript𝑑𝐺𝑣subscript𝑁𝐺𝑣d_{G}(v)=|N_{G}(v)|\nand, given X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G), we denote NG​(X)=⋃v∈XNG​(v)∖Xsubscript𝑁𝐺𝑋subscript𝑣𝑋subscript𝑁𝐺𝑣𝑋N_{G}(X)=\\bigcup_{v\\in X}N_{G}(v)\\setminus X.\nGiven X,Y⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑌𝑉𝐺X,Y\\subseteq V(G), we denote by NGY​(X)=NG​(X)∩Ysuperscriptsubscript𝑁𝐺𝑌𝑋subscript𝑁𝐺𝑋𝑌N_{G}^{Y}(X)=N_{G}(X)\\cap Y. We may omit the subscript G𝐺G when it is clear from the context. A path from a vertex u𝑢u to a vertex v𝑣v is called a (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v)-path. Note that, when dealing with edge-labelings, a pair of consecutive labels in a path is increasing, decreasing, or equal depending on the direction in which the path is traversed.\nA subset S⊆V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subseteq V(G) is a clique (resp. independent set) if all its vertices are pairwise adjacent (resp. pairwise non-adjacent) in G𝐺G. A graph G𝐺G is complete if V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) is itself a clique. The complete graph (resp. cycle) on p𝑝p vertices is denoted by Kpsubscript𝐾𝑝K_{p} (resp. Cpsubscript𝐶𝑝C_{p}). A bipartite graph on parts A,B𝐴𝐵A,B is said to be complete bipartite if its edge set is equal to all edges between A𝐴A and B𝐵B. The complete bipartite graph with parts of sizes p𝑝p and q𝑞q is denoted by Kp,qsubscript𝐾𝑝𝑞K_{p,q}. A cut-vertex in a connected graph G𝐺G is a vertex v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G) such that G∖v𝐺𝑣G\\setminus v is disconnected. A separation of a graph G𝐺G is a pair (A,B)𝐴𝐵(A,B) such that A,B⊆V​(G)𝐴𝐵𝑉𝐺A,B\\subseteq V(G), A∪B=V​(G)𝐴𝐵𝑉𝐺A\\cup B=V(G), and there are no edges in G𝐺G between the sets A∖B𝐴𝐵A\\setminus B and B∖A𝐵𝐴B\\setminus A. The order of a separation (A,B)𝐴𝐵(A,B) is defined as |A∩B|𝐴𝐵|A\\cap B|. A matching in a graph G𝐺G is a set of pairwise disjoint edges. An edge cut in a graph G𝐺G is the set of edges between a set S⊆V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺S\\subseteq V(G) and its complement S¯¯𝑆\\bar{S}, assuming that there is at least one such edge, and it is denoted [S,S¯]𝑆¯𝑆[S,\\bar{S}]. An edge set F⊆E​(G)𝐹𝐸𝐺F\\subseteq E(G) is a matching cut if it is both a matching and an edge cut. A parameterized problem is a language L⊆Σ∗×ℕ𝐿superscriptΣℕL\\subseteq\\Sigma^{*}\\times\\mathbb{N}, for some finite alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma. For an instance (x,k)∈Σ∗×ℕ𝑥𝑘superscriptΣℕ(x,k)\\in\\Sigma^{*}\\times\\mathbb{N}, the value k𝑘k is called the parameter. For a computable function g:ℕ→ℕ:𝑔→ℕℕg\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}, a kernelization algorithm (or simply a kernel) for a parameterized problem L𝐿L of size g𝑔g is an algorithm A𝐴A that given any instance (x,k)𝑥𝑘(x,k) of L𝐿L, runs in polynomial time and returns an instance (x′,k′)superscript𝑥′superscript𝑘′(x^{\\prime},k^{\\prime}) such that (x,k)∈L⇔(x′,k′)∈L⇔𝑥𝑘𝐿superscript𝑥′superscript𝑘′𝐿(x,k)\\in L\\Leftrightarrow(x^{\\prime},k^{\\prime})\\in L with |x′|superscript𝑥′|x^{\\prime}|, k′≤g​(k)superscript𝑘′𝑔𝑘k^{\\prime}\\leq g(k). The function g​(k)𝑔𝑘g(k) is called the size of the kernel, and a kernel is polynomial (resp. linear, quadratic) if g​(k)𝑔𝑘g(k) is a polynomial (resp. linear, quadratic) function. Consult      for background on parameterized complexity. We proceed to define the graph parameters that will be considered in the polynomial kernels presented in section 4 and in the FPT algorithms presented in section 5 and section 6. A vertex set S𝑆S of a graph G𝐺G is a vertex cover (resp. feedback vertex set, star-forest modulator) if G∖S𝐺𝑆G\\setminus S is a graph with no edges (resp. forest, forest of stars). For a graph G𝐺G, we denote by 𝗏𝖼​(G)𝗏𝖼𝐺{\\sf vc}(G) (resp. 𝖿𝗏𝗌​(G)𝖿𝗏𝗌𝐺{\\sf fvs}(G), 𝗌𝖿𝗆​(G)𝗌𝖿𝗆𝐺{\\sf sfm}(G)) the minimum size of a vertex cover (resp. feedback vertex set, star-forest modulator) of G𝐺G. Clearly, for any graph G𝐺G it holds that 𝖿𝗏𝗌​(G)≤𝗌𝖿𝗆​(G)≤𝗏𝖼​(G)𝖿𝗏𝗌𝐺𝗌𝖿𝗆𝐺𝗏𝖼𝐺{\\sf fvs}(G)\\leq{\\sf sfm}(G)\\leq{\\sf vc}(G). Two vertices u,v𝑢𝑣u,v of a graph G𝐺G have the same type if N​(u)∖{v}=N​(v)∖{u}𝑁𝑢𝑣𝑁𝑣𝑢N(u)\\setminus\\{v\\}=N(v)\\setminus\\{u\\}. Two vertices with the same type are true twins (resp. false twins) if they are adjacent (resp. non-adjacent).\nThe neighborhood diversity of a graph G𝐺G, denoted by 𝗇𝖽​(G)𝗇𝖽𝐺{\\sf nd}(G), as defined by Lampis [ref]27, is the minimum integer w𝑤w such that V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) can be partitioned into w𝑤w sets such that all the vertices in each set have the same type.\nNote that the property of having the same type is an equivalence relation, and that all the vertices in a given type are either true or false twins, hence defining either a clique or an independent set.\nIt is worth mentioning that, as proved by Lampis [ref]27, the parameter 𝗇𝖽​(G)𝗇𝖽𝐺{\\sf nd}(G) can be computed in polynomial time. If a graph G𝐺G has a vertex cover S𝑆S of size k𝑘k, V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) can be easily partitioned into at most 2k+ksuperscript2𝑘𝑘2^{k}+k equivalence classes of types, thus implying that, for any graph G𝐺G, A tree decomposition of a graph G𝐺G is a pair (T,{Bt∣t∈V​(T)})𝑇conditional-setsubscript𝐵𝑡𝑡𝑉𝑇(T,\\{B_{t}\\mid t\\in V(T)\\}), where T𝑇T is a tree and each set Btsubscript𝐵𝑡B_{t}, called a bag, is a subset of V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G), satisfying the following properties: ⋃t∈V​(T)Bt=V​(G)subscript𝑡𝑉𝑇subscript𝐵𝑡𝑉𝐺\\bigcup_{t\\in V(T)}B_{t}=V(G), for every edge u​v∈E​(G)𝑢𝑣𝐸𝐺uv\\in E(G), there exists a bag Btsubscript𝐵𝑡B_{t} with u,v∈Bt𝑢𝑣subscript𝐵𝑡u,v\\in B_{t}, and for every vertex v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), the set {t∈V​(T)∣v∈Bt}conditional-set𝑡𝑉𝑇𝑣subscript𝐵𝑡\\{t\\in V(T)\\mid v\\in B_{t}\\} induces a connected subgraph of T𝑇T. The width of a tree decomposition (T,{Bt∣t∈V​(T)})𝑇conditional-setsubscript𝐵𝑡𝑡𝑉𝑇(T,\\{B_{t}\\mid t\\in V(T)\\}) is defined as maxt∈V​(T)⁡|Bt|−1subscript𝑡𝑉𝑇subscript𝐵𝑡1\\max_{t\\in V(T)}|B_{t}|-1, and the treewidth of a graph G𝐺G, denoted by 𝗍𝗐​(G)𝗍𝗐𝐺{\\sf tw}(G), is the minimum width of a tree decomposition of G𝐺G. Since any forest has treewidth at most one, for any graph G𝐺G it holds that 𝗍𝗐​(G)≤𝖿𝗏𝗌​(G)+1𝗍𝗐𝐺𝖿𝗏𝗌𝐺1{\\sf tw}(G)\\leq{\\sf fvs}(G)+1. A nice tree decomposition of a graph G𝐺G is a tree decomposition of G𝐺G with one special bag Brsubscript𝐵𝑟B_{r} called the root, and in which each other bag is of one of the following types: Leaf bag: a leaf x𝑥x of T𝑇T with Bx=∅subscript𝐵𝑥B_{x}=\\emptyset. Introduce bag: an internal vertex x𝑥x of T𝑇T with exactly one children y𝑦y such that Bx=By∪{v}subscript𝐵𝑥subscript𝐵𝑦𝑣B_{x}=B_{y}\\cup\\{v\\} for some v∉By𝑣subscript𝐵𝑦v\\notin B_{y}. Forget bag: an internal vertex x𝑥x of T𝑇T with exactly one children y𝑦y such that Bx=By∖{v}subscript𝐵𝑥subscript𝐵𝑦𝑣B_{x}=B_{y}\\setminus\\{v\\} for some v∈By𝑣subscript𝐵𝑦v\\in B_{y}. Join bag: an internal vertex x𝑥x of T𝑇T with exactly two children y1subscript𝑦1y_{1} and y2subscript𝑦2y_{2} such that Bx=By1∪By2subscript𝐵𝑥subscript𝐵subscript𝑦1subscript𝐵subscript𝑦2B_{x}=B_{y_{1}}\\cup B_{y_{2}}. Additionally, we can, and will, assume that Br=∅subscript𝐵𝑟B_{r}=\\emptyset.\nWe can easily do so by forgetting one by one each vertex of the root. Given x∈V​(T)𝑥𝑉𝑇x\\in V(T), we denote by Txsubscript𝑇𝑥T_{x} the subtree rooted at x𝑥x, and we set Vx:={v∈V​(G)∣∃y∈V​(Tx),v∈By∖Bx}assignsubscript𝑉𝑥conditional-set𝑣𝑉𝐺formulae-sequence𝑦𝑉subscript𝑇𝑥𝑣subscript𝐵𝑦subscript𝐵𝑥V_{x}:=\\{v\\in V(G)\\mid\\exists y\\in V(T_{x}),v\\in B_{y}\\setminus B_{x}\\} and Gx:=G​[Vx]assignsubscript𝐺𝑥𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑉𝑥G_{x}:=G[V_{x}].\nLet us stress that Gxsubscript𝐺𝑥G_{x} does not contain the vertices of Bxsubscript𝐵𝑥B_{x} here, contrary to commonly used notations. As discussed in , any given tree decomposition of a graph G𝐺G can be transformed in polynomial time into a nice tree decomposition of G𝐺G with the same width. Hence, we will assume in section 6 that we are given a nice tree decomposition of the input graph G𝐺G. We refer the reader to the recent results of Korhonen  for approximating optimal tree decompositions in FPT time. Summarizing the above discussion, for any graph G𝐺G it holds that while 𝗇𝖽𝗇𝖽{\\sf nd}, which satisfies 𝗇𝖽​(G)≤2𝗏𝖼​(G)+𝗏𝖼​(G)𝗇𝖽𝐺superscript2𝗏𝖼𝐺𝗏𝖼𝐺{\\sf nd}(G)\\leq 2^{{\\sf vc}(G)}+{\\sf vc}(G) (cf. Equation 1), is easily seen to be incomparable to any of 𝗍𝗐,𝖿𝗏𝗌𝗍𝗐𝖿𝗏𝗌{\\sf tw},{\\sf fvs}, or 𝗌𝖿𝗆𝗌𝖿𝗆{\\sf sfm} (cf. for instance 7). We now state several observations and preliminary results that will be used in the next sections. The following observations follow easily from the definitions of gel and c𝑐c-gel. [Araújo et al. ]\nA graph G𝐺G admits a gel if and only if it admits an injective gel, that is, a good edge-labeling λ:E​(G)→ℝ:𝜆→𝐸𝐺ℝ\\lambda:E(G)\\to\\mathds{R} that that for any two distinct edges e,f∈E​(G)𝑒𝑓𝐸𝐺e,f\\in E(G), λ​(e)≠λ​(f)𝜆𝑒𝜆𝑓\\lambda(e)\\neq\\lambda(f). If a graph G𝐺G admits a gel using at most c𝑐c distinct labels, then it admits a gel λ𝜆\\lambda such that λ:E​(G)→[c]:𝜆→𝐸𝐺delimited-[]𝑐\\lambda:E(G)\\to[c]. If graph G𝐺G admits a gel (resp. c𝑐c-gel) if and only if every connected component of G𝐺G admits a gel (resp. c𝑐c-gel). If a graph G𝐺G admits a gel (resp. c𝑐c-gel), then any subgraph of G𝐺G also admits a gel (resp. c𝑐c-gel). An edge-labeling of C4subscript𝐶4C_{4} with values in {1,2}12\\{1,2\\} is good if and only if its edges take alternatively values one and two in a cyclic order. The next two results come from [1, Lemma 7] and [1, Lemma 10], respectively. They were written for gels instead of c𝑐c-gels, but the statements below follow from the same proofs. Let G𝐺G be a graph, v𝑣v be a cut-vertex in G𝐺G, C1,…,Cpsubscript𝐶1…subscript𝐶𝑝C_{1},\\ldots,C_{p} the vertex sets of the connected components of G∖v𝐺𝑣G\\setminus v, and Gi=G​[Ci∪{v}]subscript𝐺𝑖𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝐶𝑖𝑣G_{i}=G[C_{i}\\cup\\{v\\}] for i∈[p]𝑖delimited-[]𝑝i\\in[p]. Then, for any non-negative integer c𝑐c, G𝐺G admits a c𝑐c-gel if and only each every Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i} admits a c𝑐c-gel for i∈[p]𝑖delimited-[]𝑝i\\in[p]. Let c∈ℕ𝑐ℕc\\in\\mathbb{N}, G𝐺G be a graph, λ𝜆\\lambda be a c𝑐c-edge-labeling of G𝐺G, and (A,B)𝐴𝐵(A,B) be a separation of G𝐺G of order two such that G​[A∩B]𝐺delimited-[]𝐴𝐵G[A\\cap B] is an edge.\nIf λ𝜆\\lambda restricted to G​[A]𝐺delimited-[]𝐴G[A] and λ𝜆\\lambda restricted to G​[B]𝐺delimited-[]𝐵G[B] are c𝑐c-gels, then λ𝜆\\lambda is a c𝑐c-gel of G𝐺G. Moreover, if both G​[A]𝐺delimited-[]𝐴G[A] and G​[B]𝐺delimited-[]𝐵G[B] are good, then G𝐺G is also good. The following result comes from [1, Lemma 11]. Again, it was proved for gels, but taking into account section 2 and the fact that, in the proof of [1, Lemma 11], a new large label is given to the edges of the matching cut while preserving the labels of both sides of the cut, the following holds. Let c∈ℕ𝑐ℕc\\in\\mathbb{N}.\nLet G𝐺G be a graph and [S,S¯]𝑆¯𝑆[S,\\bar{S}] be a matching cut in G𝐺G.\nIf both G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] and G​[S¯]𝐺delimited-[]¯𝑆G[\\bar{S}] admit a c𝑐c-gel, for some non-negative integer c𝑐c, then G𝐺G admits a (c+1)𝑐1(c+1)-gel. 2.3 motivates the following reduction rule. If a graph G𝐺G contains a matching cut [S,S¯]𝑆¯𝑆[S,\\bar{S}], delete all edges between S𝑆S and S¯¯𝑆\\bar{S}. The safeness of 2.1 for the sake of admitting a gel is justified by 2.3: G𝐺G admits a gel if and only if both G​[S]𝐺delimited-[]𝑆G[S] and G​[S¯]𝐺delimited-[]¯𝑆G[\\bar{S}] admit a gel. We now state a useful equivalence for verifying that an edge-labeling is good. Let G𝐺G be a graph and λ𝜆\\lambda be an edge-labeling of G𝐺G.\nLet C𝐶C be a cycle of G𝐺G. A local minimum (resp. local maximum) of C𝐶C, with respect to λ𝜆\\lambda, is a subpath P𝑃P of C𝐶C consisting of edges with the same label,\nsuch that the edges in E​(C)∖E​(P)𝐸𝐶𝐸𝑃E(C)\\setminus E(P) incident to the endpoints of P𝑃P have labels strictly larger (resp. smaller) than that of P𝑃P. [Bode et al. ]\nAn edge-labeling of a graph G𝐺G is good if and only if every cycle of G𝐺G admits at least two local minima, or at least two local maxima.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: with the same type are true twins (resp. false twins) if they are adjacent (resp. non-adjacent).\nThe neighborhood diversity of a graph G𝐺G, denoted by 𝗇𝖽​(G)𝗇𝖽𝐺{\\sf nd}(G), as defined by Lampis [ref]27, is the minimum integer w𝑤w such that V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) can be partitioned into w𝑤w sets such that all the vertices in each set have the same type.\nNote that the property of having the same type is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
