      "content": "Paper Title: Nonsmooth Implicit Differentiation for Machine Learning and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDetailed proof arguments for all considered models are given in Appendix C. Deep Equilibrium Networks (DEQs)  are specific neural network architectures including layers whose input-output relation is implicitly defined through a fixed point equation of the form where x∈ℝp𝑥superscriptℝ𝑝x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p} is a given input and z∈ℝm𝑧superscriptℝ𝑚z\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m} is the corresponding output. We may consider that the variable x𝑥x represents both the input layer and layer parameters. Assuming that, for each x∈ℝp𝑥superscriptℝ𝑝x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p}, there is a unique z∈ℝm𝑧superscriptℝ𝑚z\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m} satisfying the relation (3), this defines an input-output relation z:ℝp→ℝm:𝑧→superscriptℝ𝑝superscriptℝ𝑚z\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m}. Furthermore, if f𝑓f is path differentiable with convex-valued conservative Jacobian Jf:ℝm×ℝp⇉ℝm×(m+p):subscript𝐽𝑓⇉superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑝superscriptℝ𝑚𝑚𝑝J_{f}\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times(m+p)} whose projection on the first m𝑚m columns are all invertible, then the function z𝑧z itself admits a conservative Jacobian which can be computed from Theorem 2. We now focus on monotone operator implicit layers  for which assumptions are easily stated. Our method applies to other similar architectures, e.g., DEQs  or implicit graph neural networks .\nLet σ:ℝm→ℝm:𝜎→superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑚\\sigma\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m} be the proximal operator of a convex function and assume σ𝜎\\sigma is path differentiable with conservative Jacobian Jσ:ℝm⇉ℝm×m:subscript𝐽𝜎⇉superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑚𝑚J_{\\sigma}\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}, assumed to be convex-valued. This encompasses the majority of activation functions used in practice .\nLet W∈ℝm×m𝑊superscriptℝ𝑚𝑚W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m} be a matrix such that W+WT⪰2​θ​Isucceeds-or-equals𝑊superscript𝑊𝑇2𝜃𝐼W+W^{T}\\succeq 2\\theta I with θ>0𝜃0\\theta>0. Under these assumptions the implicit equation has a unique output z​(W,b)𝑧𝑊𝑏z(W,b) [50, Theorem 2]. The transformation (W,b)↦z​(W,b)maps-to𝑊𝑏𝑧𝑊𝑏(W,b)\\mapsto z(W,b) is a monotone implicit layer. The set-valued mapping obtained from Theorem 2 provides a conservative Jacobian for (W,z)↦z​(W,z)maps-to𝑊𝑧𝑧𝑊𝑧(W,z)\\mapsto z(W,z). A similar expression was described in [50, Theorem 2], without using conservativity and using the Clarke Jacobian formally as a classical Jacobian. The proposition below provides a full justification of this heuristic and ensures convergence of algorithmic differentiation based training. Assume that Jσsubscript𝐽𝜎J_{\\sigma} is convex-valued and that, for all J∈Jσ​(W​z​(W,b)+b)𝐽subscript𝐽𝜎𝑊𝑧𝑊𝑏𝑏J\\in J_{\\sigma}(Wz(W,b)+b), the matrix (Idm−J​W)subscriptId𝑚𝐽𝑊(\\mathrm{Id}_{m}-JW) is invertible.\nConsider a loss-like function ℓ:ℝm→ℝ:ℓ→superscriptℝ𝑚ℝ\\ell\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R} with conservative gradient Dℓ:ℝm⇉ℝm:subscript𝐷ℓ⇉superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑚D_{\\ell}\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{m}, then g:(W,z)↦ℓ​(z​(W,b)):𝑔maps-to𝑊𝑧ℓ𝑧𝑊𝑏g:(W,z)\\mapsto\\ell(z(W,b)) is path differentiable and has a conservative gradient Dgsubscript𝐷𝑔D_{g} defined through Convexity and invertibility assumptions are satisfied when Jσsubscript𝐽𝜎J_{\\sigma} is the Clarke Jacobian .\n Optimization layers in deep learning may take many forms; we consider here those based on conic programming 7 [ref]3  . We follow [ref]3, simplifying the analysis by ignoring infeasability certificates, which correspond to the absence of a primal-dual solution 7, in line with the implementation described in [2, Appendix B]. Consider a conic problem (P) and its dual (D): with primal variable x∈ℝn𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, dual variable y∈ℝm𝑦superscriptℝ𝑚y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}, and primal slack variable s∈ℝm𝑠superscriptℝ𝑚s\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}. The set 𝒦⊂ℝm𝒦superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{K}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{m} is a nonempty closed convex cone and 𝒦∗⊂ℝmsuperscript𝒦superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{K}^{*}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{m} is its dual cone. The problem parameters are the matrix A∈ℝm×n𝐴superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n} and the vectors b∈ℝm𝑏superscriptℝ𝑚b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m} and c∈ℝn𝑐superscriptℝ𝑛c\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}; the cone 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} is fixed. Under the assumption that there is a unique primal-dual solution (x,y,s)𝑥𝑦𝑠(x,y,s), we study the path differentiability of the solution mapping as a function of its parameters: For this, let us interpret the solution mapping as a composition mapping involving equation-like implicit formulations. Set N=n+m𝑁𝑛𝑚N=n+m, given A,b,c∈ℝm×n×ℝm×ℝn𝐴𝑏𝑐superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑛A,b,c\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n}, define Consider a vector z=(u,v)∈ℝn×ℝm𝑧𝑢𝑣superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚z=(u,v)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}, denote by ΠΠ\\Pi the projection onto ℝn×𝒦∗superscriptℝ𝑛superscript𝒦\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathcal{K}^{*} and define the residual map 𝒩:ℝN×ℝm×n×ℝm×ℝn→ℝN:𝒩→superscriptℝ𝑁superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑁\\mathcal{N}:\\mathbb{R}^{N}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{N} as The mapping 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} is a synthetic form of optimality measure for\n(P) and (D), capturing KKT conditions. To simplify the presentation, we ignore the extreme cases of infeasibility and unboundedness which correspond to an absence of solution in 7. Define the function ϕ:ℝN→ℝn×ℝm×ℝm:italic-ϕ→superscriptℝ𝑁superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑚\\phi:\\mathbb{R}^{N}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m} through\nϕ​(u,v):=(u,P𝒦∗​(v),P𝒦∗​(v)−v)assignitalic-ϕ𝑢𝑣𝑢subscript𝑃superscript𝒦𝑣subscript𝑃superscript𝒦𝑣𝑣\\displaystyle\\phi(u,v):=(u,P_{\\mathcal{K^{*}}}(v),P_{\\mathcal{K}^{*}}(v)-v). As shown in Appendix C.2, ϕ​(u,v)italic-ϕ𝑢𝑣\\phi(u,v) provides a primal-dual KKT solution of problems (P) and (D) if and only if 𝒩​(z,A,b,c)=0𝒩𝑧𝐴𝑏𝑐0\\mathcal{N}(z,A,b,c)=0.\nWhen we assume that, for fixed A,b,𝐴𝑏A,b, and c𝑐c, there is a unique z∈ℝN𝑧superscriptℝ𝑁z\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} such that 𝒩​(z,A,b,c)=0𝒩𝑧𝐴𝑏𝑐0\\mathcal{N}(z,A,b,c)=0, we have an implicitly defined a function z=ν​(A,b,c)𝑧𝜈𝐴𝑏𝑐z=\\nu(A,b,c), such that The following result extends the discussion in 7 [ref]3, limited to situations where ΠΠ\\Pi is differentiable at the proposed solution z𝑧z, to a fully nonsmooth setting; its proof is postponed to Appendix C.2. Assume that P𝒦∗subscript𝑃superscript𝒦P_{\\mathcal{K^{*}}}, 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} are path differentiable, denote respectively by JP𝒦∗subscript𝐽subscript𝑃superscript𝒦J_{P_{\\mathcal{K^{*}}}}, J𝒩subscript𝐽𝒩J_{\\mathcal{N}} corresponding convex-valued conservative Jacobians. Assume that, for all A,b,c∈ℝm×n×ℝm×ℝn𝐴𝑏𝑐superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝ𝑛A,b,c\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n}, z=ν​(A,b,c)∈ℝn×ℝm𝑧𝜈𝐴𝑏𝑐superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚z=\\nu(A,b,c)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m} is the unique solution to 𝒩​(z,A,b,c)=0𝒩𝑧𝐴𝑏𝑐0\\mathcal{N}(z,A,b,c)=0 and that all matrices formed from the N𝑁N first columns of J𝒩​(z,A,b,c)subscript𝐽𝒩𝑧𝐴𝑏𝑐J_{\\mathcal{N}}(z,A,b,c) are invertible.\nThen, ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, ν𝜈\\nu, and solsol\\mathrm{sol} are path differentiable functions with conservative Jacobians: In practice, the path differentiability of conic projections is pervasive since they are generally semialgebraic (orthant, second-order cone, PSD cone). See     for the computations of the corresponding Clarke Jacobians (which are conservative). Note that a conservative Jacobian for 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} may be obtained from JP𝒦∗subscript𝐽subscript𝑃superscript𝒦J_{P_{\\mathcal{K}^{*}}} using Proposition 2. Implicit differentiation can be used to tune hyperparameters via first-order methods optimizing some measure of task performance, see  and references therein. In a nonsmooth context, we recall the formulation in [ref]9 of the general hyperparameter optimization problem as a bi-level optimization problem: where C:ℝp→ℝ:𝐶→superscriptℝ𝑝ℝC:\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\to\\mathbb{R} is continuously differentiable (e.g., test loss) and ψ:ℝp×ℝm→ℝ:𝜓→superscriptℝ𝑝superscriptℝ𝑚ℝ\\psi\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R} is a possibly nonsmooth training loss, convex in β𝛽\\beta, with hyperparameter λ∈ℝm𝜆superscriptℝ𝑚\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}. We seek a subgradient type method for this problem with convergence guaranties; our nonsmooth implicit differentiation results can be used for this purpose. We demonstrate this approach on the Lasso problem 5 where y∈ℝn𝑦superscriptℝ𝑛y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} is the vector of observations, X=[X1,…,Xp]∈ℝn×p𝑋subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑝superscriptℝ𝑛𝑝X=[X_{1},\\ldots,X_{p}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p} is the design matrix with columns Xj∈ℝnsubscript𝑋𝑗superscriptℝ𝑛X_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, j∈{1,…​p}𝑗1…𝑝j\\in\\{1,\\ldots p\\}, and λ∈ℝ𝜆ℝ\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R} is the hyperparameter.\nDefine F:ℝ×ℝp→ℝp:𝐹→ℝsuperscriptℝ𝑝superscriptℝ𝑝F:\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{p} to be and recall that, for each i∈{1,…,p}𝑖1…𝑝i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,p\\}, [proxeλ∥⋅∥1​(β)]i=sign​(βi)​max⁡{|βi|−eλ,0}[\\mathrm{prox}_{e^{\\lambda}\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{1}}(\\beta)]_{i}=\\mathrm{sign}(\\beta_{i})\\max\\{|\\beta_{i}|-e^{\\lambda},0\\}. The function\nF​(λ,β)𝐹𝜆𝛽F(\\lambda,\\beta) is thus nonsmooth but locally Lipschitz on ℝ×ℝpℝsuperscriptℝ𝑝\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{p}. An optimal β^​(λ)^𝛽𝜆\\hat{\\beta}(\\lambda) for (7) must satisfy F​(λ,β^​(λ))=0𝐹𝜆^𝛽𝜆0F(\\lambda,\\hat{\\beta}(\\lambda))=0 [21, Prop. 3.1]. For a given solution β^​(λ)^𝛽𝜆\\hat{\\beta}(\\lambda), we introduce the equicorrelation set by ℰ:={j∈{1,…,p}:|XjT​(y−X​β^​(λ))|=eλ}assignℰconditional-set𝑗1…𝑝superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑗𝑇𝑦𝑋^𝛽𝜆superscript𝑒𝜆\\mathcal{E}:=\\{j\\in\\left\\{1,\\ldots,p\\right\\}:|X_{j}^{T}(y-X\\hat{\\beta}(\\lambda))|=e^{\\lambda}\\} which contains the support set supp​β^:={i∈{1,…,p}:β^i≠0}assignsupp^𝛽conditional-set𝑖1…𝑝subscript^𝛽𝑖0\\mathrm{supp}\\,\\hat{\\beta}:=\\{i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,p\\}:\\hat{\\beta}_{i}\\neq 0\\}. In fact, ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} does not depend on the choice of the solution β^^𝛽\\hat{\\beta}, see [46, Lemma 1]. The proof of the following result is given in Appendix C.3. For all λ∈ℝ𝜆ℝ\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}, assume XℰT​Xℰsuperscriptsubscript𝑋ℰ𝑇subscript𝑋ℰX_{\\mathcal{E}}^{T}X_{\\mathcal{E}} is invertible where Xℰsubscript𝑋ℰX_{\\mathcal{E}} is the submatrix of X𝑋X formed by taking the columns indexed by ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}. Then β^​(λ)^𝛽𝜆\\hat{\\beta}(\\lambda) is single-valued, path differentiable with conservative Jacobian, Jβ^​(λ)subscript𝐽^𝛽𝜆J_{\\hat{\\beta}}\\left(\\lambda\\right), given for all λ𝜆\\lambda as where ℳ​(λ)⊂ℝpℳ𝜆superscriptℝ𝑝\\mathcal{M}(\\lambda)\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{p} is the set of vectors q𝑞q such that qi=1subscript𝑞𝑖1q_{i}=1 if i∈supp​β^𝑖supp^𝛽i\\in\\mathrm{supp}\\,\\hat{\\beta}, qi=0subscript𝑞𝑖0q_{i}=0 if i∉ℰ𝑖ℰi\\not\\in\\mathcal{E} and qi∈ subscript𝑞𝑖01q_{i}\\in  if i∈ℰ∖supp​β^𝑖ℰsupp^𝛽i\\in\\mathcal{E}\\setminus\\mathrm{supp}\\,\\hat{\\beta}. Taking, in Proposition 5, qi=1subscript𝑞𝑖1q_{i}=1 for all i∈ℰ𝑖ℰi\\in\\mathcal{E} corresponds to the directional derivative given by LARS algorithm 7, see also . Alternatively, taking qi=0subscript𝑞𝑖0q_{i}=0 for i∉supp​β^𝑖supp^𝛽i\\not\\in\\mathrm{supp}\\,\\hat{\\beta} gives the weak derivative described by [ref]9. Both are particular selections in Jβ^subscript𝐽^𝛽J_{\\hat{\\beta}}, which is the underlying conservative field.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: assumptions are satisfied when Jσsubscript𝐽𝜎J_{\\sigma} is the Clarke Jacobian .\n Optimization layers in deep learning may take many forms; we consider here those based on conic programming 7 [ref]3  .
