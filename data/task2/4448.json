      "content": "Paper Title: Jacobian Norm with Selective Input Gradient Regularization for Improved and Interpretable Adversarial Defense\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo thoroughly evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we considered multiple powerful attacks. The white-box attacks include FGSM  and PGD . FGSM  is an efficient single-step adversarial attack scheme. Given a vectorized input 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and its target label 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}, FGSM  alters each element of 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} along the direction of its gradient with respect to the inference ∂Fθ​(𝐱)/∂𝐱subscript𝐹𝜃𝐱𝐱\\partial F_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})/\\partial\\mathbf{x}. The PGD attack , known as one of the strongest L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} adversarial example generation algorithms, is a multi-step variant of FGSM . The iterative update of crafted data 𝐱^^𝐱\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} in the t+1𝑡1t+1-th step can be expressed as 𝐱^t+1=∏𝐱+S(𝐱^t+ϵ⋅sgn​(∇𝐱(Fθ​(𝐱^t),𝐲)))superscript^𝐱𝑡1subscriptproduct𝐱𝑆superscript^𝐱𝑡⋅italic-ϵsgnsubscript∇𝐱subscript𝐹𝜃superscript^𝐱𝑡𝐲\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}^{t+1}=\\prod_{\\mathbf{x}+S}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}^{t}+\\epsilon\\cdot\\mbox{sgn}(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}(F_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}^{t}),\\mathbf{y}))), where ∏product\\prod is the projection space bounded by 𝐱±Splus-or-minus𝐱𝑆\\mathbf{x}\\pm S, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is the step size. For the PGD attack  on two datasets, S𝑆S is set to 0.3/1 and 8/255, and the number of iterations Ns​t​e​psubscript𝑁𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝N_{step} is set to 40 and 7, respectively. FGSM  adopts the same ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon setup as PGD . The attack configurations of PGD  and FGSM  were chosen identical to the setup in many adversarial defense methods  . To generate adversarial examples for JSMA 0, we used the Cleverhans adversarial example library 2. We also evaluated the proposed method against several state-of-the-art black-box transferred attacks: substitute , ZOO [ref]6 and transferable attacks [ref]44.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: examples for JSMA 0, we used the Cleverhans adversarial example library 2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
