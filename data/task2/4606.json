      "content": "Paper Title: Pushing the limits of fairness impossibility: Who’s the fairest of them all?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile investigating a solution to our nonconvex problem, we considered another global integer programming based approach known as spatial branch and branch (SBB), which relies on a combination of spatial partitioning and solving local partitions using McCormick relaxations ([ref]29, ) and other outer approximation variants (). In our testing, Gurobi’s nonconvex QCQP solver, which applies these SBB heuristics, worked remarkably well despite being relatively new and was sometimes able to beat both the interior point solution and the MIP solution. Open-source solver SCIP () also features a gender nonconvex SBB solver that works reasonably well. However, our main goal was to provide a widely accessible method of solving the problem to global optimality and as of writing, there are significantly more developed open-source MILP solvers, such as SCIP, HiGHS (), and CBC (), than SBB solvers. Another reason we opted for the MILP approach is that we saw more potential in the NMDT reformulation for taking advantage of our reformulation and bound tightening procedure. Nonetheless, our bound tightening procedure is theoretically beneficial for both methods and as other open-source algorithms/solvers for SBB become more developed, such as Couenne () and Alpine ([ref]31), we encourage a future re-evaluation of solution methods and comparisons. Finally, we note that we chose Gurobi in our experiments for its speed and effectiveness since we are repeatedly solving many problems. We acknowledge that Gurobi is a very powerful commercial solver and the results solved over 10 minutes may be worse with open source solvers such as HiGHS (). Nonetheless, the important fact is that all MIP solvers target the global optimum and hence even less powerful solvers can yield strong solutions given more time.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: global integer programming based approach known as spatial branch and branch (SBB), which relies on a combination of spatial partitioning and solving local partitions using McCormick relaxations ([ref]29, ) and other outer approximation variants ().
