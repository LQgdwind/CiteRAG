      "content": "Paper Title: MIP-GAF: A MLLM-annotated Benchmark for Most Important Person Localization and Group Context Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting Benchmarks. The MS Dataset includes 2,310 images (training: 924, validation: 232, testing: 1,154) with person-specific importance labels and face bounding boxes across six scene types. The NCAA Dataset has 9,736 basketball images with person-level bounding boxes and importance annotations. The Extended MS (EMS) Dataset contains 10,687 images (training: 8,607 with 690 labeled, validation: 230 labeled, testing: 1,390 labeled). The Extended NCAA (ENCAA) Dataset includes 19,062 sports images (training: 2,825 labeled, validation: 941 labeled, testing: 5,970 labeled). Experimental Protocols.\nWe compared our model with several baseline models outlined in the literature below: 1. Most-Center: the person closest to the image center. 2. Max-Scale: the person with the largest area in the image 3. Max-Face: person with the largest visible face. 4. Max-Saliency: We investigate the correlation between the salient regions in an image concerning the MIP. 5. POINT: POINT¬†7 is a deep relation-based framework that learns to build the interpersonal relationship modeling with feature learning for MIP localization. 6. Semi-POINT: Semi-POINT¬† framework aims to assign pseudo-labels to individuals in un-annotated images. Upon assigning pseudo labels, the model learns to update the MIP localization model based on both labels and pseudo-labels. 7. CLIP: We fine-tuned the CLIP¬† model using MIP-GAF images and their corresponding descriptions. Additionally, we utilize the vision encoder to extract features and incorporate an MLP module consisting of two dense layers with sizes 512 and 256, followed by an output layer with four neurons to localize the MIP coordinates. 8. Zero-shot MLLM: We use off-the-shelf multimodal large language models such as CogVLM¬†1  and QwenVL¬† to see the performance in zero shot inference. Level of Supervision. For benchmarking and evaluation, we use four levels of supervision: Zero-shot learning adapts pre-trained weights of large language models (CogVLM and QwenVL) directly to the MIP-GAF test set. Fully supervised learning involves training models on the train set and evaluating them on validation and test sets, applied to most-center, max-scale, max-face, max-saliency, and POINT protocols. Semi-supervised learning uses 33% and 66% labeled data from the training partition, following¬†7, for training and evaluates on validation and test sets. Self-supervised learning employs vision-language self-supervision, pre-training with MIP-GAF images and descriptions, followed by downstream adaptation. Evaluation Metrics.\nWe follow the standard evaluation protocol from prior works¬†7. Mean Average Precision (mAP) is used to measure MIP Localization performance. Following the POINT framework¬†7, we also report the cumulative matching characteristics (CMC) curve to show the top k-rank important persons. Implementation details.\nWe implemented the experimental protocols on PyTorch¬†[ref]24 with Nvidia A100 40GB GPU. We tried our best to incorporate the off-the-shelf methods from the GitHub repositories.\nWe trained both the POINT¬†7 and semi-POINT¬† model for 200 epochs with early stopping having patience value as 5. We adopt the same settings as the public GitHub repository for hyperparameters. We observed that both the models have relatively the same configuration setup where the hyper-parameters are tuned on the validation set of the data¬†7 .\nDuring the pre-training process of the CLIP model¬†, our model‚Äôs weight was initialized with CLIP‚Äôs default weight. We pre-train the CLIP model on the training partition of MIP-GAF by Adam optimizer¬†4 with a learning rate of 5‚Äãe‚àí55ùëí55e-5, where Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta value ranges in (0.90.90.9, 0.980.980.98). To prevent the condition of division by zero, the œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon value is set to 1‚Äãe‚àí61ùëí61e-6 along with a weight decay of 0.20.20.2. The model is trained for 20 epochs for downstream linear probing. To incorporate the most important person localization aspect, we have employed the ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} loss function in the prediction stage with the ReLU activation function. To train the proposed MIP-CLIP method, stage 1 uses classification and contrastive losses, while stage 2 employs binary cross-entropy loss with the Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 0.0005. The model is trained for 30 epochs with early stopping (patience of 3), and the best model is used for further evaluation. In all the above cases, we use the standard evaluation metric from¬†8 7 , reporting mean average precision to measure performance. We also include a CMC graph to show the ranking process (see Figure¬†7).\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: framework¬†7, we also report the cumulative matching characteristics (CMC) curve to show the top k-rank important persons.
