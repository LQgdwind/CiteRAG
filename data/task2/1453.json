      "content": "Paper Title: DeepPoison: Feature Transfer Based Stealthy Poisoning Attack for DNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPlatform:\nWe conduct experiments on a server equipped with\nintel XEON 6240 2.6GHz x 18C (CPU),\nTesla V100 32GiB (GPU),\n16GiB DDR4-RECC 2666 (Memory),\nUbuntu 16.04 (OS),\nPython 3.6,\nTensorflow-GPU-1.3, and\nTflearn-0.3.2 Datasets:\nWe evaluate the attack efficiency of DeepPoison on the MNIST , CIFAR10 , LFW , and CASIA [ref]15. DNNs:\nWe adopted a variety of classifiers on several benchmark datasets.\nWe train LeNet5 for MNIST . We adopted the AlexNet for\nCIFAR10 , and FaceNet [ref]16 for LFW  and CASIA [ref]15. DeepPoison: We first construct poisoned training sample datasets for MNIST  and CIFAR10  : First, we use the complete dataset to train a feature extractor, and use the feature extractor to train DeepPoison. In the MNIST , perturbations with features of the digit \"9\" are added to the samples of the digit \"4\". In the CIFAR10 , we have the feature perturbation of the \"trunk\" category in the \"airplane\" category. We then construct poisoned training sample datasets for LFW  and CASIA [ref]15. We use FaceNet [ref]16 as a feature extractor, in the LFW dataset, add the features of the \"Ted Williams\" sample to the \"Abdulaziz Kamilov\" sample. In the CASIA dataset, we add the feature disturbance of \"Teri Hatcher\" to the \"Patricia Arquette\" class sample. Attack Baselines:\nWe have used the following methods as the attack baselines: BadNets [ref]9. To make the trigger even less noticeable and keep the ASR, we limit the size of the trigger to roughly 1% of the entire image, i.e.formulae-sequence𝑖𝑒i.e. we will put a 2×\\times4 patch on the target class that needs a poisoning attack in MNIST. AIS . We added a glasses patch of size 70×\\times30 to the eyes of the face images in the poisoned dataset(7×\\times3 for MNIST  and CIFAR10 ). BIS . We poison by adding an image watermark in the center of the face images in the dataset. The size of the watermark is 110×\\times160 (11×\\times16 for MNIST  and CIFAR10 ). PoisonFrog . We set opacity=30% to experiment. In our experiment, we set the the centroid of the feature space as the optimization goal. IPA . We set the population size as 50, crossover probability as 0.7, mutation probability as 0.1 to experiment. FSA . We change the last fully connected layer with L2subscript𝐿2{{L}_{2}} based attack to experiment.\n Hidden Trigger attack . We will put a 2×\\times4 patch on the trigger class and use the last fully connected layer to optimize the poisoned sample. Defense Methods:\nWe use two defense methods: autodecoder defense , cluster detection . The autodecoder carries out sample reconstruction for MNIST  and CIFAR10  datasets and detect the abnormal samples by the loss of comparing the input and output. However, the face dataset has too many pixels, so it is difficult to train the autodecoder and the reconstruction effect is poor. Besides improving the poisoning attack’s effectiveness on the face classification model, the attacker will embed the poisoned backdoor near the face. Therefore, we used Dlib for face feature extraction and DBSCAN for clustering for the face classification model’s backdoor attack defense. Cluster detection defense is carried out for face dataset by DBSCAN clustering algorithm, cluster the hidden layer features of the training set samples, and find out the abnormal samples. We do not use NC  and ABS  because neither of these attack methods can work against a feature-based attack . Evaluation Metrics:\nThe metrics used in the experiments are defined as follows: Recognition accuracy (acc): a​c​c=Nc​o​r​r​e​c​t/Nt​o​t​a​l𝑎𝑐𝑐subscript𝑁𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡subscript𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙acc={N_{correct}}/{N_{total}}, where Nc​o​r​r​e​c​tsubscript𝑁𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡N_{correct} is the number of benign samples correctly classified by the target model, Nt​o​t​a​lsubscript𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙N_{total} is the number of all samples. Attack success rate (ASR): A​S​R=Na​t​t/Nc​o​r​r​e​c​t𝐴𝑆𝑅subscript𝑁𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝑁𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡ASR={N_{att}}/{N_{correct}}, where Na​t​tsubscript𝑁𝑎𝑡𝑡N_{att} is the number of trigger samples misclassified as target label by the target model after the attack.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: DDR4-RECC 2666 (Memory),\nUbuntu 16.04 (OS),\nPython 3.6,\nTensorflow-GPU-1.3, and\nTflearn-0.3.2 Datasets:\nWe evaluate the attack efficiency of DeepPoison on the MNIST , CIFAR10 , LFW , and CASIA [ref]15.
