      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Detection of Backdoor Attacks via Density-based Clustering and Centroids Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely utilised in many areas such as image classification, natural language processing, and pattern recognition, due to their outstanding performance over a wide range of domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to both attacks carried out at test time, like the creation of adversarial examples  and training time [ref]2.\nThese vulnerabilities limit the application of DNNs in security-sensitive scenarios, like autonomous vehicle, medical diagnosis, anomaly detection, video-surveillance and many others. One of the most serious threats comes from backdoor attacks  [ref]4  , according to which a portion of the training dataset is poisoned to induce the model to learn a malevolent behaviour. At test time, the backdoored model works as expected on normal data, however, the hidden backdoor and the malevolent behaviour are activated when the network is fed with an input containing a so-called triggering signal, only known to the attacker. Backdoor attacks can be categorised into two classes: corrupted-label and clean-label attacks [ref]7.\nIn the first case, the attacker can modify the labels of the poisoned samples, while in the latter case, the attacker does not have this capability. Hence, in a clean-label backdoor attack, the poisoned samples are correctly labelled, i.e., the content of a poisoned sample is consistent with its label. For this reason, clean-label attacks   are more stealthy and harder to be-detected than corrupted-label attacks. Many methods have been proposed to defend against backdoor attacks. Following the taxonomy introduced in [ref]7, the defences can be categorised into three different classes based on the knowledge available to the defender and the level at which they operate: sample-level, model-level, and training-dataset-level defences.\nSample-level defences are applied after the model has been deployed in an operative environment, and rely on the inspection of the input sample to reveal the possible presence of a triggering signal. With model-level defences, instead, the network is inspected before its deployment to detect the possible presence of a backdoor.\nFinally, defences working at the training-dataset-level assume that the defender\ncan access and inspect the dataset used to train the network to look for suspicious (poisoned) samples. The CCA-UD defence introduced in this paper belongs to this last category.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: due to their outstanding performance over a wide range of domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to both attacks carried out at test time, like the creation of adversarial examples  and training time [ref]2.\nThese vulnerabilities limit the application of DNNs in security-sensitive scenarios, like autonomous vehicle, medical diagnosis, anomaly detection, video-surveillance and many others.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
