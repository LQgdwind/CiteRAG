      "content": "Paper Title: PFB-Diff: Progressive Feature Blending Diffusion for Text-driven Image Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion Models (DM) have garnered significant attention by enabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a given text prompt  . Recently introduced large-scale training of diffusion models, such as DALL⋅⋅\\cdotE2, Imagen , GLIDE , and Stable Diffusion , have further improved the quality and demonstrated unprecedented semantic generation. Large-scale text-to-image models are trained on enormous amounts of image-caption pairs, resulting in a high capacity for both textual semantic understanding and image synthesis. Given a corresponding text description, they can generate realistic images that match the text description. Such success inspires subsequent efforts to leverage large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for real image editing. However, extending pre-trained text-to-image frameworks for personalized editing (e.g. manipulating a specific object in an image) remains a challenging task due to the limited ability to describe desired objects through text. In fact, even the most detailed textual description of an object may yield instances with different appearances. Besides, the editing process should meet the requirements of high accuracy (or image-text alignment), image consistency, irrelevance preservation, and image fidelity.\nImage consistency measures whether newly generated content in a target region exhibits contextual coherence both semantically and textually. For instance, when adding a teddy bear to a tree branch, it should align with the environment, such as adopting a tree climbing pose (semantic consistency), and seamlessly blend with the original image (texture consistency). To achieve personalized editing, some pioneering works   [ref]34 proposed to learn a unique word to represent the given object and fine-tune pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models on several images containing the same object. By inserting its unique word in various text contexts, they can synthesize the object in diverse scenes and manipulate the object with text guidance. These methods can typically generate high-fidelity images, but sometimes they drastically alter the content of the original image. Besides, these methods cannot fully leverage the generalization ability of the pre-trained model due to the over-fitting issues  or language drift problem [ref]34, i.e., the model slowly forgets how to generate subjects of the same class as the target object after fine-tuning. Moreover, the above methods introduce a per-image optimization process, which cannot satisfy the requirement of high efficiency in practical applications. In contrast, the optimization-free methods [ref]9 [ref]5   perform image editing based on a frozen pre-trained diffusion model and require no optimization or fine-tuning. To seamlessly fuse newly generated content with the original image, they generally apply the diffusion process first on the input image and then conduct the denoising procedure conditioned on both the input image and the text guidance. Throughout the denoising procedure, previous methods spatially blend noised versions of the input image with the text-guided diffusion latent variables at each time step, using either a user-provided mask [ref]5   or a self-predicted mask [ref]9. Without any fine-tuning or optimization process, the above methods can avoid the language drift problem [ref]34 and run in real time.\nAdditionally, employing the original image and mask for iterative refinement can aid in preserving visual details. However, the above methods often rely on editing intermediate noisy images [ref]9 [ref]5  , which lacks the necessary semantics to preserve the image consistency, resulting in degraded results. Moreover, the newly generated content is not always guaranteed to appear appropriately within predefined regions especially when the given mask conflicts with the text description (e.g., attempting to generate a rabbit within a giraffe-shaped region), leading to both image-text misalignment and poor image quality. In this paper, we propose PFB-Diff, a framework adapting pre-trained text-to-image models for text-driven image editing. As an optimization-free method, our method inherits its advantages of efficiency and the ability to fully utilize the pre-trained model’s generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, we propose several novel techniques to overcome the existing issues in previous optimization-free methods, such as image inconsistency and image-text misalignment. We summarize them as follows. Progressive feature blending. Instead of editing intermediate noisy images, we propose to edit their deep feature maps in the prediction network. Deep features contain rich semantics and thus feature-level editing can ensure semantic and texture consistency in the edited images. The editing is progressively performed from high to low feature levels via multi-scale masks. This approach helps to seamlessly integrate the newly generated content into the original image, resulting in more natural and coherent synthesis results. Masking the word’s attention map. To restrict the influence of specific words in predefined regions, we propose to mask their attention maps. For example, when editing an image from “a dog sitting on a beach” to “a dog sitting on the snow,” we mask the background area in the attention map of the word “dog.” This ensures that the “dog” does not affect the background area, thereby preserving the original image’s overall layout and avoiding the generation of another dog in the background. With the above techniques, our approach can simultaneously meet the requirements of image fidelity, image-text alignment, and faithfulness to the original image. As shown in Figure 1, our approach can effectively tackle various editing tasks, such as object/background replacement, secondary object editing, and changing object properties.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: such as adopting a tree climbing pose (semantic consistency), and seamlessly blend with the original image (texture consistency).
