Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Large Language Models and Hierarchical Frameworks for Classification of Large Unstructured Legal Documents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe chose the legal datasets having large documents with a nonuniform structure throughout and without any structural annotations. The ILDC dataset  includes highly unstructured 39898 English-language case transcripts from the Supreme Court of India (SCI), where the final decisions have been removed from the document. Upon analyzing the documents from their sources and the dataset we found that they are highly unstructured and noisy. The initial decision between ”rejected” and ”accepted” made by the SCI judge(s) is used to classify each document and serves as their decision label. The LexGLUE dataset  comprises a set of seven datasets from the European Union and US court case setting, for uniformly assessing model performance across a range of legal NLP tasks, from which we choose ECtHR (Task A), ECtHR (Task B), and SCOTUS as they are classification tasks involving long unstructured legal documents. ECtHR (A and B) are court cases from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) for articles that were violated or allegedly violated. The dataset contains factual paragraphs from the description of the cases. SCOTUS consists of court cases from the highest federal court in the United States of America, with metadata from SCDB 888http://scdb.wustl.edu/. The details of the number of labels, the document lengths (in tokens), task description, and class distribution can be found in Table 3 and Table 3. The tokenization Table 3 is done using the tokenizer of GPT-J. For performance comparison on LexGLUE, we used the SOTA benchmark of Chalkidis et al. , Condevaux et al.’s LSG [ref]11, Chalkidis et al.’s HAT  and for ILDC we used its benchmark from  and of Shounak et al. ’s experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: in Table 3 and Table 3. The tokenization Table 3 is done using the tokenizer of GPT-J. For performance comparison on LexGLUE, we used the SOTA benchmark of Chalkidis et al. , Condevaux et al.’s LSG [ref]11, Chalkidis et al.’s HAT  and for ILDC we used its benchmark from  and of Shounak et al. ’s experiments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.

Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
