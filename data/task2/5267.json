      "content": "Paper Title: Cognitive Accident Prediction in Driving Scenes: A Multimodality Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the proposed method with several state-of-the-art approaches in performance comparison. They are DSA-RNN , AdaLEA , UncertaintyTA , and DRIVE [ref]19 with the available source code. The results on the MINI-Test of these methods are taken from DRIVE [ref]19, and we re-implement DRIVE on FULL-Test by training DRIVE on the FULL-Train set with 50 epochs, where the driver attention map of each frame is also obtained by MLNet . The number in the bold brackets in each column represent the ego-car involved accident category index. The categories here are (5) ego-car hits a crossing motorbike, (6) ego-car hits a motorbike, (8) ego-car hits a truck, (10) ego-car hits a crossing car, (11) ego-car hits a car, (12) ego-car is overtaken by a car, (13) ego-car hits large roadblocks, and (14) ego-car hits a curb. On MINI-Test:\nThe evaluation of the MINI-Test is shown in Table. VII. It can be observed that our method achieve a significant performance improvement. The time length of all testing samples in MINI-Test is 5 seconds (5s), where the predicted TTA0.5 exceeds 4 seconds (4s) in our method and mTTA achieves 4.497 seconds, which has a large gap over the best method DRIVE [ref]19. Because DSA-RNN , AdaLEA , and UncertaintyTA  need to pre-detect the participants, where the detection error may influence the accident prediction, the AUC scores are not good as compared with DRIVE and our method. Notably, CAP-Text+Att+3-Text+Att+3{}_{\\text{-Text+Att+3}} is a little better than CAP+Text+Att+3+Text+Att+3{}_{\\text{+Text+Att+3}} here, which means the text information is leveraged to the vision information. Different from DRIVE which obtains the driver attention map offline, our method can obtain a significant improvement on the AUC value by jointly optimizing the driver attention map reconstruction and accident prediction. On FULL-Test:\nBased on the testing evaluation for FULL-Test, we check the performance on the cases of 5s, 4s, and 2s prediction of accidents. Here, we take DRIVE [ref]19 as a baseline because it has the same consideration of the driver attention. From Table. VII, we can see that 5s and 4s predictions show promising AP values and exceed 0.85 for all cases, while 2s prediction has relatively lower AP value. The underlying reason is that owning to the video length restriction, we have about 1313\\frac{1}{3} negative samples in all testing set for 2s prediction case, while 5s and 4s predictions only have about 110110\\frac{1}{10} negative samples (see Table. III). Therefore, the ratio of negative samples has an influence for the AP value. As for the AUC values, our method can obtain a relatively stable performance for all prediction cases. In particular, DRIVE seems to be vulnerable to the ratio of negative samples, where the AUC value degrades to 0.67 for the 2s prediction case. As for TTA metrics, our method still shows a better performance than that of DRIVE. With the increase of testing samples from 5s to 2s predictions, the TTA0.5 gap between our method and DRIVE increases from 0.60.60.6s to 0.850.850.85s, and mTTA gap increases from about 0.20.20.2s to 1.021.021.02s. Hence, from this phenomenon, the ratio of negative samples and the number of testing samples have an impact on the TTA metrics and AP score. In addition, based on the Text-to-Image Shift Fusion layer (T2I-SFLayer), CAP-Text+Att+3-Text+Att+3{}_{\\text{-Text+Att+3}} shows comparable performance with CAP+Text+Att+3+Text+Att+3{}_{\\text{+Text+Att+3}}.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: We compare the proposed method with several state-of-the-art approaches in performance comparison.
