      "content": "Paper Title: Intrinsically motivated option learning: a comparative study of recent methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm, the agents select actions at each time step, which are then enacted within an environment. The agents are then given feedback in the form of the next state and the reward . The option framework   represents an extension to the standard RL paradigm, allowing for reasoning across multiple time-scales. Here, the agents select temporally extended courses of actions, which are called options. Empowerment  roughly translates into the agent’s ability to cover large parts of the state space and reliably infer which sequence of actions has lead them to a particular state. It was introduced to the option framework by [ref]5, equipping the agents with intrinsic motivation and independence from the environment-based reward structure. While Gregor et al. [ref]5 reported excellent results on Grid World examples, they had trouble translating the concept to continuous state and action space domains when non-linear function approximators had to be utilized. Some recent papers [ref]6  successfully applied modified versions of both the empowerment principle and the option framework to challenging continuous control domains , but had to significantly reframe the original problem. Certain studies [ref]9 0, however, call into question the effectiveness of the solutions proposed by [ref]6 . In this paper we aim to test claims made by [ref]9 0, and offer a comparative study of [ref]5 [ref]6  through the lens of the original empowerment principle. We first present a theoretical comparison of [ref]5 [ref]6  in Section II. We then outline the critique of [ref]6  as reported in [ref]9 0 in Section III, and detail the purpose of this paper. We present the results of our experiments with [ref]6 in Section IV, and discuss them with respect to both [ref]9 0, and the original empowerment principle  [ref]5 in Section V. We conclude this paper with promising approaches for future study in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: into the agent’s ability to cover large parts of the state space and reliably infer which sequence of actions has lead them to a particular state.
