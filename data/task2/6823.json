      "content": "Paper Title: SSMG: Spatial-Semantic Map Guided Diffusion Model for Free-form Layout-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLayout-to-image generation with given bounding boxes can be viewed as\na reverse process of object detection.\nEarly GAN-based methods adopt the encoder-decoder architecture to transform boxes into images. LAMA [ref]15, LostGANs , and Context L2I  encoded the layout of boxes as a style feature, subsequently feeding this into an adaptive normalization layer. Adding to these GAN-based methods, Taming  and TwFA  encode layout information as inputs to a transformer. They then employed an auto-regressive (AR) approach to predict the latent visual codes. Recently, diffusion-based methods [ref]9  [ref]27 show promising results in L2I. LDM [ref]27 employed a T2I model for box-to-image transfer, encoding layouts using a BERT model. Beyond that,    tokenized bounding boxes into embeddings by Fourier embedding  or new trainable layers. These embeddings are then injected into pre-trained T2I models, facilitating the generation of scene images with positional information. Note that existing L2I methods are limited to dealing with the form of bounding boxes. Other forms of layout, e.g., key points, semantic masks in Figure 6, require specialized methods    .\nIn contrast, this paper introduces a novel map-guided approach that transforms given layout info into feature maps, which subsequently guide the model’s learning process. Crucially, our approach is versatile and can be applied to a variety of forms of layout. Deep diffusion-based generative models [ref]9   have showcased their exceptional ability to generate high-quality and diverse samples. Building upon these works, LDM [ref]27 utilized VQ-VAE  to encode images into latent codes of smaller resolution, thereby reducing the computational overhead required for training a diffusion model. LDM also achieved impressive results in T2I generation by encoding text inputs into latent vectors, similar to approaches, GLIDE , DALL-E 2 , and Imagen . Beyond text-guided generation, ControlNet  enabled additional image-guided conditions into frozen T2I diffusion models, e.g., sketch, segmentation masks, canny edge, etc. It duplicates the weights of a large diffusion model into a “trainable copy” and a “locked copy” and the trainable copy is trained to learn these conditional signals.\nWhile ControlNet has demonstrated a commendable ability to control the shape or position of generated objects, it falls short in providing detailed semantic descriptions for individual instances, thereby failing to address L2I effectively.\nTo overcome this, we introduce a novel map-guided approach that incorporates robust semantic and spatial awareness to enhance the model’s controllability.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: generation with given bounding boxes can be viewed as\na reverse process of object detection.\nEarly GAN-based methods adopt the encoder-decoder architecture to transform boxes into images.
