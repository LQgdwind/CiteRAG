      "content": "Paper Title: POPO: Pessimistic Offline Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe optimization goal of RL is to get an optimal policy by interacting with its environment in discrete timesteps. We formalize the standard RL paradigm as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by a tuple (𝒮,𝒜,ℛ,p,ρ0,γ)𝒮𝒜ℛ𝑝subscript𝜌0𝛾(\\mathcal{S,A,R,}p,\\rho_{0},\\gamma) with state space 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, action space 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, reward function ℛ:𝒮×𝒜×𝒮→ℝ:ℛ→𝒮𝒜𝒮ℝ\\mathcal{R:S\\times A\\times S}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, transition probability function p​(s′,r|s,a)𝑝superscript𝑠′conditional𝑟𝑠𝑎p(s^{\\prime},r|s,a), initial state distribution ρ0subscript𝜌0\\rho_{0}, and discount factor γ∈[0,1)𝛾01\\gamma\\in[0,1). At each time step t𝑡\\mathit{t}, the agent receives a state s∈𝒮𝑠𝒮\\mathit{s}\\in\\mathcal{S} and selects an action a∈𝒜𝑎𝒜\\mathit{a}\\in\\mathcal{A} with respect to its policy π:𝒮→𝒜:𝜋→𝒮𝒜\\pi:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A}, then receiving a reward signal r𝑟\\mathit{r} and a new state s′superscript𝑠′\\mathit{s^{\\prime}} from its environment. A four-element tuple (s,a,r,s′)𝑠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑠′(s,a,r,s^{\\prime}) is named transition. The optimization problem in RL is to maximize the cumulative discounted reward, defined as Rt=∑i=tγi−t​r​(si,ai)subscript𝑅𝑡subscript𝑖𝑡superscript𝛾𝑖𝑡𝑟subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖R_{t}=\\sum_{i=t}\\gamma^{i-t}r(s_{i},a_{i}) with γ𝛾\\gamma determining the priority of recent rewards. Here the return depends on the actions, thus on the policy π𝜋\\pi, deterministic or stochastic. Typically, the action-value function, a.k.a. Q-function, critic, is defined as Q​(s,a)=𝔼p,π​[Rt|s0=s,a0=a]𝑄𝑠𝑎subscript𝔼𝑝𝜋delimited-[]formulae-sequenceconditionalsubscript𝑅𝑡subscript𝑠0𝑠subscript𝑎0𝑎Q(s,a)=\\mathbb{E}_{p,\\pi}[R_{t}|s_{0}=s,a_{0}=a] which measures the quality of an action a𝑎a given a state s𝑠s. State-value function, a.k.a value function, V𝑉V-function, is defined as V​(s)=𝔼p,π​[Rt|s0=s]𝑉𝑠subscript𝔼𝑝𝜋delimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝑅𝑡subscript𝑠0𝑠V(s)=\\mathbb{E}_{p,\\pi}[R_{t}|s_{0}=s] measuring the quality of an individual state s𝑠s. Both Q𝑄Q-function and V𝑉V-function can be applied to evaluate the policy and further guide the agent to learn a higher quality value, i.e., a better policy. For a given policy π𝜋\\pi, the Q𝑄Q-function can be estimated recursively by Bellman backup operator : where a′∼π​(s′)similar-tosuperscript𝑎′𝜋superscript𝑠′a^{\\prime}\\sim\\pi(s^{\\prime}). The Bellman operator is gamma-contraction when γ∈[0,1)𝛾01\\gamma\\in[0,1) with a unique fixed point Qπ​(s,a)superscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎Q^{\\pi}(s,a). We can recover the optimal policy through the corresponding optimal value function Q∗​(s,a)=maxπ⁡Qπ​(s,a)superscript𝑄𝑠𝑎subscript𝜋superscript𝑄𝜋𝑠𝑎Q^{*}(s,a)=\\max_{\\pi}Q^{\\pi}(s,a) in discrete action space. When we apply RL to large state space or continuous state space, the value function can be approximated by neural networks, which is called Deep Q𝑄Q-networks . The Q𝑄Q-function is updated by r+γ​Q​(s′,π​(s′);θ′)𝑟𝛾𝑄superscript𝑠′𝜋superscript𝑠′superscript𝜃′r+\\gamma Q(s^{\\prime},\\pi(s^{\\prime});\\theta^{\\prime}), where π​(s′)=arg⁡maxa′⁡Q​(s′,a′;θ′)𝜋superscript𝑠′subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑄superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′superscript𝜃′\\pi(s^{\\prime})=\\arg\\max_{a^{\\prime}}Q(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime};\\theta^{\\prime}) and θ′superscript𝜃′\\theta^{\\prime} is a delayed copy of θ𝜃\\theta. Generally, we sample mini-batch transitions from replay buffer ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} 9 and feed the data into the deep Q𝑄Q-networks. In offline policy optimization setting, we consider the buffer ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} static and no further data can be added into itself and call it datasets 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. A vitally significant improvement of DQN is soft update. When updating the network, we freeze a target network Q​(⋯;θ′)𝑄⋯superscript𝜃′Q(\\cdots;\\theta^{\\prime}) to stabilize the learning processing further. The frozen network are updated by θ′=η​θ+(1−η)​θ′superscript𝜃′𝜂𝜃1𝜂superscript𝜃′\\theta^{\\prime}=\\eta\\theta+(1-\\eta)\\theta^{\\prime} every specific time steps t𝑡t, where the η𝜂\\eta is a small scalar .\nIn continuous action space, the arg⁡max\\arg\\max operator in Equation 1 is intractable. Thus Sutton et al.  introduced policy gradient method. Combined with aforementioned value-based method, actor-critic method was introduced, which is widely used in the field of deep RL. When we train an actor-critic agent, the action selection is performed through a policy network π​(⋅;ϕ)𝜋⋅italic-ϕ\\pi(\\cdot;\\phi), a.k.a. actor, and updated w.r.t. a value network . Silver et al. [ref]41 proposed deterministic policy gradient theorem to optimize policy: which corresponds to optimizing the Q𝑄Q-function Qπ​(⋅,⋅;θ)superscript𝑄𝜋⋅⋅𝜃Q^{\\pi}(\\cdot,\\cdot;\\theta) by the chain rule. When combined with tricks in DQN , this algorithm is referred to as deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) [ref]10.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: RL.
