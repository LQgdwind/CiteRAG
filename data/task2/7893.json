      "content": "Paper Title: RDF Surfaces: Enabling Classical Negation on the Semantic Web\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA significant body of research on defining the requirements for Web logic with negation is available with possible extensions to FOL expressivity. Table¬†4 presents an overview of the three main requirements we seek for a Web logic, i.e.¬† enabling classical negation, providing the full expressivity of FOL (including universal quantification), and building upon the RDF data & syntax to attain portability, and compares them against the solutions discussed in the following paragraphs in more detail. It can be concluded from this table that none of the available solutions fit all the requirements, hence the motivation for RDF Surfaces. In the early 1990s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other funding agencies started the development of the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) as a machine-readable interchange format of knowledge among disparate programs with an expressivity near equivalent to FOL predicate calculus including classical negation¬†. KIF‚Äôs Lisp-based syntax predates the Semantic Web and was, in the 1990s, the de facto exchange format in the research community. Common Logic continued the work of KIF and has since been developed and published as the ISO standard \"ISO/IEC 24707:2018\" as a framework for a family of logic-based languages¬†. Common Logic can process RDF data but the syntax relies on Lisp like S-expressions. Common Logic is highly relevant for the BLOGIC vision as it includes Piercian graphical logic in the Appendix B of the ISO standard. Our paper applies this logic to the Semantic Web using an RDF syntax, ensuring compatibility with all existing RDF resources. With RDF Surfaces, we strive not to separate data and logic. No separate syntax and semantics are required to negate a set of RDF triples. In 2000, Berners-Lee called for developing a unifying language for classical logic as an extension, or even the modification, of the RDF model. His SWeLL proposal was imaged to ‚Äúallow any Web software to read and manipulate data published by any other Web software‚Äù¬†. For all logical relations to be expressed, the SWeLL project proposal advocated negation and explicit quantification as an extension to RDF. The work on SWeLL influenced the development of N3Logic¬† as an extension of RDF so that the same language can be used for transporting logic and data. N3Logic provides negation in the form of scoped negation as failure (SNAF), i.e.¬†the monotonic version of NAF. Both NAF and SNAF are logical operations to reason about information missing from a knowledge graph, but cannot be used (or in a very limited form) to express negative information that classic negation requires explicitly. Both NAF and SNAF do not have all the desired properties of classical negation. In N3Logic, SNAF can only be used as part of an implication and not as part of the data. It is possible to create a negated statements and negated graphs by setting the consequent of an implication \"false\" G‚Üífalse‚Üíùê∫falseG\\rightarrow\\texttt{false}, but this negated graph does not have the properties of a classic negation. A double negated graph cannot be interpreted as \"true\". In 2001, the FIPA RDF Content Language Specification¬†1 was created to specify how RDF can be used as a message content language in the communication acts of FIPA-compliant agents. It proposes a method to express negated RDF facts by adding a believe or disbelieve in the facts. The FIPA proposal adds a fipa:Proposition and relies on reification of RDF triples. A fipa:believe predicate can be added to the reified triple to express a boolean trust. Using this mechanism a single triple can be interpreted as \"false\", but it is not a classical negation for the same reason as N3Logic \"false\" is not a classical negation. Related developments were made in 2004 with the Web Ontology Language (OWL) as an extension of RDF. The newest version, OWL 2¬†, has several profiles, of which OWL 2 DL is based on fragments of FOL. In all OWL 2 DL profiles, negation is available in the form of owl:complementOf and owl:NegativePropertyAssertion, but these negations are restricted to specific cases in the profiles to prevent the halting problem and ensure the language remains decidable.\nAs an example, using the owl:NegativePropertyAssertion it is possible to state that two individual do not have the relation :hasParent, From these statements it follows that :John :hasParent :Mary is \"false\", which makes it a negation of one triple. However, this negation does not have the properties of a full classical negation. The construction only works for a single triple (and not arbitrary collections of triples), and the double negation properties of classical negation are unavailable (which would lead to full FOL expressivity). As for N3Logic, a \"false\" is available but in a limited form. These types \"false\" statements can be used as constraints in an ontology, but do not have the properties of a proper classical negation. There is even a more subtle difference between this type of negation and classical negation. The John and Mary example does not state that it is impossible that John has a parent Mary, only that it is not modelled in a particular ontology. Universal quantification is available in OWL 2 DL, but in a restricted form. The ObjectAllValuesFrom and DataAllValuesFrom predicates require a set of all individuals to choose from in an quantification. This restricted quantification differs from classical universal quantification, which permits an arbitrary (unlimited) number of individuals. The Rule Interchange Format (RIF)¬† was an activity started in 2009 within the W3C to develop Web standards for the interchange of rules among disparate systems, especially on the Semantic Web. RIF is a collection of extensible languages and dialects serialized as XML documents. Two types of languages are available: logic-based dialects and dialects for rules with actions. The logic-based dialects include languages based on FOL and various non-FOL semantics, but do not allow negation in the rule head or body (the Horn subset). As far as we know, no RDF syntax was provided for RIF. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)¬† is a W3C membership submission that extends the OWL Web Ontology Language with the Rule Interchange Format (RIF). The proposed language extends OWL axioms to include Horn clauses for OWL descriptions and properties and a limited set of built-in functions. This form supports neither the disjunction nor the classical negation of clauses. Also, to guarantee decidability, rules are restricted to only include named individuals (and not existentially introduced individuals). The language allows for explicit quantification, but introducing variables goes beyond RDF semantics¬†. The Semantic Web Services Language (SWSL)¬† is a language for specifying the formal characterizations of Web service concepts and descriptions of individual Web services. The language consists of two sublanguages: SWSL-FOL, a full FOL language, and SWSL-Rules, a rule-based sublanguage with non-monotonic semantics. However, the authors of SWSL did not envision the need for full FOL reasoners based on SWSL-FOL as its main use case is creating Web service ontologies. The syntax of SWL is inspired by F-Logic and is not based on RDF. Several papers by De Bruijn, Tsarkov and Tammet demonstrate the embedding of RDF in FOL using frameworks, such as F-Logic, Vampire and JSON-LD. The advantage of FOL lies in its well-established nature and the ability to define its mappings, as demonstrated by these papers. However, our project aims to achieve the expressivity of FOL within the Web language itself, specifically in the RDF model, from the ground up. The papers start from the opposite direction and try incorporating RDF semantics into a framework with FOL semantics. For similar reasons, plain FOL, such as the TPTP language333https://tptp.org/Proposals/TPILanguage.html, is excluded. Datalog knows some extensions which aim to incorporate negation into the rule language, most notably semi-positive Datalog and stratified Datalog¬†. Including negative atoms in rule bodies allows negation to be contained. This inclusion allows for introducing disjunctive and negative statements through a back door. Nonetheless, as is the case for SWRL considered above, Datalog‚Äôs variants do not allow for existential variables, only to reason over existing ones¬†[ref]1. Furthermore, many Datalog variants are restricted to safe rules, where all variables of a rule must occur in a positive atom of the rule body, which further restricts the free use of negative statements. Answer Set Programming (ASP)¬† provides classical \"strong\" negation and NAF, and even first-order extensions can be written¬†1. Eiter et al.¬† provides an extension of ASP with description logic for the Semantic Web. However, using Datalog, ASP, and even Prolog as Web logic creates a dichotomy between the world of data (RDF) and the world of logic (the computer program). In the rationale of RDF Surfaces, it should be possible to negate information in RDF and transport logic/reasoning in a portable way (using RDF). RDF Surfaces could be the language, the syntactic sugar, to transport RDF data with FOL expressivity to an ASP, Datalog, or Prolog program. We do not deny the expressivity of any of these programming languages. Our argument reverses the conventional perspective: Web logics that follow the requirements of the computing agent (decidable, tractable). RDF Surfaces advocates for Web logic for the human agent, emphasizing sharing information and logic in a portable way. SPARQL can use classical negation and first-order expressivity in filters that can be used to query an RDF data set (that has not FOL expressivity). Three types of negation are supported: (a) the Boolean NOT operator that can be used in filters; (b) the negation as failure operators MINUS and NOT-EXISTS; and (c) a combination of OPTIONAL with the BOUND operator¬†. Additionally, SPARQL provides an RDF serialization through SPARQL-SPIN¬†. However, we regard SPARQL primarily as a query language rather than a Web logic language.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: and negative statements through a back door.
