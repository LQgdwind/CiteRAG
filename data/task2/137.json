      "content": "Paper Title: PUGeo-Net: A Geometry-centric Network for 3D Point Cloud Upsampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThree-dimensional (3D) point clouds, as the raw representation of 3D data, are used in a wide range of applications, such as 3D immersive telepresence ,\n3D city reconstruction , , cultural heritage reconstruction , , geophysical information systems , [ref]8, autonomous driving , , simultaneous localization and mapping , , and virtual/augmented reality , , just to name a few. Though recent years have witnessed great progress on the 3D sensing technology , [ref]16, it is still costly and time-consuming to obtain dense and highly detailed point clouds, which are beneficial to the subsequent applications. Therefore, amendment is required to speed up the deployment of such data modality. In this paper, instead\nof relying on the development of hardware, we are interested in the problem of computational based point cloud upsampling: given a sparse, low-resolution point cloud, generate a uniform and dense point cloud with a typical computational method to faithfully represent the underlying surface. Since the problem is the 3D counterpart of image super-resolution [ref]17, , a typical idea is to borrow the powerful techniques from the image processing community. However, due to the unordered and irregular nature of point clouds, such an extension is far from trivial, especially when the underlying surface has complex geometry. The existing methods for point cloud upsampling can be roughly classified into two categories: optimization-based methods and deep learning based methods.\nThe optimization methods , 0, 1, 2, 3 usually fit local geometry and work well for smooth surfaces with less features. However, these methods struggle with multi-scale structure preservation. The deep learning methods can effectively learn structures from data. Representative methods are PU-Net 4, EC-Net 5 and MPU 6. PU-Net extracts multi-scale features using point cloud convolution 7 and then expands the features by replication. With additional edge and surface annotations, EC-Net improves PU-Net by restoring sharp features. Inspired by image super-resolution, MPU upsamples points in a progressive manner, where each step focuses on a different level of detail. PU-Net, EC-Net and MPU operate on patch level, therefore, they can handle high-resolution point sets. Though the deep learning methods produce better results than the optimization based methods, they are heavily motivated by the techniques in the image domain and takes little consideration of the geometries of the input shape. As a result, various artifacts can be observed in their results. It is also worth noting that all the existing deep learning methods generate points only, none of them is able to estimate the normals of the original and generated points. In this paper, we propose a novel network, called PUGeo-Net, to overcome the limitations in the existing deep learning methods. Our method learns a local parameterization for each point and its normal direction. In contrast to the existing neural network based methods that generate new points in the abstract feature space and map the samples to the surface using decoder, PUGeo-Net performs the sampling operations in a pure geometric way. Specifically, it first generates the samples in the 2D parametric domain and then lifts them to 3D space using a linear transformation. Finally, it projects the points on the tangent plane onto the curved surface by computing a normal displacement for each generated point via the learned second fundamental form. Through extensive evaluation on commonly used as well as new metrics, we show that PUGeo-Net consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and efficiency for upsampling factors 4∼16×4\\sim 16\\times. It is also worth noting that PUGeo-Net is the first neural network that can generate dense point clouds with accurate normals, which are highly desired by the existing surface reconstruction algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of PUGeo-Net on both CAD models with sharp features and scanned models with rich geometric details and complex topologies.\nFig. 1 demonstrates the effectiveness of PUGeo-Net on the Retheur Statue model. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. We propose PUGeo-Net, a novel geometric-centric neural network, which carries out a sequence of geometric operations, such as computing the first-order approximation of local parameterization, adaptive sampling in the parametric domain, lifting the samples to the tangent plane, and projection to the curved surface. PUGeo-Net is the first upsampling network that can jointly generate coordinates and normals for the densified point clouds. The normals benefit many downstream applications, such as surface reconstruction and shape analysis. We interpret PUGeo-Net using the local theory of surfaces in differential geometry. Quantitative verification confirms our interpretation. We evaluate PUGeo-Net on both synthetic and real-world models and show that PUGeo-Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency for all upsampling factors. PUGeo-Net can handle noisy and non-uniformly distributed point clouds as well as the real scanned data by the LiDAR sensor very well, validating its robustness and practicality.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of 3D data, are used in a wide range of applications, such as 3D immersive telepresence ,\n3D city reconstruction , , cultural heritage reconstruction , , geophysical information systems , [ref]8, autonomous driving , , simultaneous localization and mapping , , and virtual/augmented reality , , just to name a few.
