Here, we consider replacing it with MLP-Mixer , which may boost the performance of Pathformer on queries involving intersection operators since MLP-Mixer performs better than MLP on average on these query structures according to [ref]14. MLP2Vector: Following the MLP method [ref]14, in order to increase the robustness of the encoder, we use two separate MLPs to calculate the fork query embedding separately and then average their outputs as the final fork query embedding. For both the main experiments and the model variant experiments,\nour path query encoder uses a six-layer transformer encoder.\nFor a fair comparison, we follow previous works [ref]14  [ref]13 and set our embedding dimension d=800ùëë800d=800, and retrain some baselines with different embedding dimensions so that the embedding dimension dùëëd of all methods is 800800800.\nFor GammaE, its union network has parameters that need to be learned, and the query structures involving the union operator in the experiments are all zero-shot queries.\nTherefore, to be fair, we use DNF treatment to compare union operators.\nIn addition, BIQE only evaluates conjunctive queries and does not evaluate 2‚Äãu2ùë¢2u and u‚Äãpùë¢ùëùup, so we reimplement it on FB237-Q2B and NELL-Q2B for comparison.\nFor more experimental details, please refer to Supplementary Material VII-B.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: We consider several competitive neural methods for CLQA tasks as our baselines to compare:\nGQE [ref]12, Q2B , BetaE [ref]13,\nBIQE ,\nQuery2particles (Q2P) ,\nConE , MLP [ref]14, MLP-Mixer [ref]14, FuzzQE , and GammaE ,\nwhere GQE, Q2B, BIQE, and MLP-Mixer can only handle EPFO queries, while other\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
