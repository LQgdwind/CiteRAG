      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised Matting-specific Portrait Enhancement and Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional image matting can be categorized into sampling-based and affinity-based approaches. Sampling-based approaches [ref]18 [ref]21  [ref]45 assume that the alpha values for two neighboring pixels are similar if their colors are similar. Affinity-based approaches    propagate alpha values from the known regions into unknown ones by the affinities of neighboring pixels. Several deep learning-based approaches are proposed for image matting to leverage the powerful representation learning ability. Xu et al.  propose a large scale dataset and the first attempt to apply a neural network for nature image matting. Li et al. 0 present the Guided Contextual Attention to propagate high-level opacity information based on the learned low-level affinity. Lu et al. 5 develop an IndexNet to generate the indices on the feature map adaptively. SampleNet  estimates the background and foreground colors of pixels in unknown regions using deep neural networks prior. Cai et al.  aim to refine the trimap by an adaptation module in the matting network. However, these works rely heavily on the user-designed trimap. When the trimap is unavailable, a typical solution is to predict the trimap by a semantic segmentation model  . However, compared with the user-designed trimap, the predicted trimap is insufficiently accurate. Background matting 9 1  can extract alpha mattes without the need of trimap, but it requires an additional input of clean background image, which confines the flexibility. Unlike previous approaches, we propose an alternative solution for automatic portrait matting that focuses on how an input image affects the output alpha matte by exploring the latent space of GAN models.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Traditional image matting can be categorized into sampling-based and affinity-based approaches.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
