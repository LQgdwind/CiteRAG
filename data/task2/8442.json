      "content": "Paper Title: SizeGS: Size-aware Compression of 3D Gaussians with Hierarchical Mixed Precision Quantization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)  has revolutionized 3D scene representation and has been widely adopted in a variety of applications 1 1   . By re-parameterizing point clouds into 3D Gaussian functions, 3DGS has achieved unprecedented reconstruction quality. Moreover, with efficient CUDA implementation, real-time rendering is enabled. Despite its success, 3DGS still faces limitations in storage efficiency. To address this, various 3DGS compression methods have been proposed . However, these methods primarily aim to improve compression quality, often overlooking requirements arising from applications such as volumetric video streaming 1 8 7 and remote teleoperation 1. These applications frequently encounter fluctuating network bandwidth , leading to jitter and blurriness that significantly impact user experience 4 . Consequently, compressing 3DGS to accommodate varying network conditions is essential for enhancing the quality of service in these applications. We define this requirement as the task of efficiently identifying a set of hyperparameters that compresses 3DGS to a specified size while maximizing visual quality. Achieving this goal involves two primary challenges: 1) How to generate hyperparameters based on the size budget, which requires establishing a precise mapping between size and hyperparameters. 2) Given multiple sets of hyperparameters that meet the size budget, how to effectively select the one that can maximize visual quality. This step requires quickly estimating the highest achievable quality for each set of hyperparameters. To this end, we propose SizeGS, which incorporates a size estimator to enable size-constrained hyperparameter generation and introduces a hierarchical mixed precision quantization scheme to identify the optimal configuration within the size budget.\nFirst, to generate hyperparameters based on the size budget, the key lies in constructing a compression framework that ensures a simple relationship between hyperparameters and size. Current compression frameworks fall into two categories: offline 4   [ref]33 and online 0   [ref]33 2 3 5  6.\nOffline methods perform compression without additional training, ensuring time efficiency while also supporting fine-tuning for improved visual quality. In contrast, online methods require training during file compression. This is because some components of the compressed model, such as the learnable mask  0  or context model  2, must be trained from scratch. This dependency makes it difficult to predict the final size of the compressed model, complicating the relationship between hyperparameters and model size.\nTherefore, we choose an offline method, MesonGS 4.\nBased on this model, we define size as a multivariable function of hyperparameters, including octree depth, reserve ratio, and the number of blocks. Thus, generating hyperparameters within a given size budget becomes an indeterminate equation. To simplify solving this equation, we fix the hyperparameters for octree depth and the number of blocks, focusing only on solving for the reserve ratio. Second, to maximize compression quality, enhancing the marginal compression performance of the chosen framework is the primary consideration. We choose ScaffoldGS 8 as the base model and upgrade the uniform block quantization in MesonGS to hierarchical mixed-precision quantization (H-MPQ). This method divides each channel of the attribute matrix into multiple blocks, requiring bit-width settings for each channel and length settings for each block, thus introducing additional hyperparameters. To efficiently determine these MPQ settings, we use the mean square error between the original and restored data to measure information loss during compression. By minimizing this information loss and setting the size budget as a constraint, we formulate bit-width searching as a combinatorial optimization problem and effectively solve it with 0-1 linear programming. For block-length settings, we use dynamic programming based on information loss. Based on the size estimator and H-MPQ, we finally design a calibrated searching algorithm to find a hyperparameter set that can fulfill the size budget while maximizing quality. In summary, our contributions are as follows: 1) We define the task of compressing 3DGS to a target size and introduce an estimator to predict the compressed size, enabling efficient hyperparameter search within the size budget.\n2) We propose a size-aware hierarchical mixed-precision quantization scheme. At the inter-attribute level, bit-width selection is formulated as a 0-1 ILP problem, while at the intra-attribute level, a dynamic programming algorithm partitions attribute channels into variable-length blocks.\n3) We design a calibrated algorithm that identifies size-constrained hyperparameter settings within 10 minutes, achieving 1.69×\\times faster performance than state-of-the-art methods, with comparable or superior results across multiple datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: budget, the key lies in constructing a compression framework that ensures a simple relationship between hyperparameters and size.
