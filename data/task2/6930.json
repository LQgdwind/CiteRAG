      "content": "Paper Title: YaRN: Efficient Context Window Extension of Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer-based Large Language Models[ref]40 (LLMs) have become the near-ubiquitous choice for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks where long-range abilities such as in-context learning (ICL) has been crucial.\nIn performing the NLP tasks, the maximal length of the sequences (the context window) determined by its training processes has been one of the major limits of a pretrained LLM. Being able to dynamically extend the context window via a small amount of fine-tuning (or without fine-tuning) has become more and more desirable. To this end, the position encodings of transformers are the center of the discussions. The original Transformer architecture used an absolute sinusoidal position encoding, which was later improved to a learnable absolute position encoding .\nSince then, relative positional encoding schemes  have further increased the performance of Transformers.\nCurrently, the most popular relative positional encodings are T5 Relative Bias [ref]30, RoPE [ref]34, XPos , and ALiBi . One reoccurring limitation with positional encodings is the inability to generalize past the context window seen during training.\nWhile some methods such as ALiBi are able to do limited generalization, none are able to generalize to sequences significantly longer than their pre-trained length . Some works have been done to overcome such limitation.  and concurrently  proposed to extend the context length by slightly modifying RoPE via Position Interpolation (PI) and fine-tuning on a small amount of data. As an alternative,  proposed the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation by taking the loss of high frequency into account. Since then, two improvements of the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation have been proposed, with different emphasis: the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation method  for pre-trained models without fine-tuning. the \"NTK-by-parts\" interpolation method  which performs the best when fine-tuned on a small amount of longer-context data. The \"NTK-aware\" interpolation and the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation have already seen their presence in the open-source models such as Code Llama  (using \"NTK-aware\" interpolation) and Qwen 7B  (using \"Dynamic NTK\"). In this paper, in addition to making a complete account of the previous unpublished works on the \"NTK-aware\", the \"Dynamic NTK\" and the \"NTK-by-part\" interpolations, we present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), an improved method to efficiently extend the context window of models trained with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) including the LLaMA , the GPT-NeoX , and the PaLM  families of models. YaRN reaches state-of-the-art performances in context window extensions after fine-tuning on less than ∼similar-to\\sim0.1% of the original pre-training data. In the meantime, by combining with the inference-time technique called Dynamic Scaling, the Dynamic-YaRN allows for more than 2x context window extension without any fine-tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Transformer-based Large Language Models[ref]40 (LLMs) have become the near-ubiquitous choice for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks where long-range abilities such as in-context learning (ICL) has been crucial.\nIn performing the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
