      "content": "Paper Title: Malla: Demystifying Real-world Large Language Model Integrated Malicious Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo identify Malla services, our study collected 13,353 listings from nine underground marketplaces and forums (i.e., Abacus Market, Kerberos Market, Kingdom Market, WeTheNorth Market, MGM Grand Market, Hack Forums, XSS.is, BreachForums, and BlackHatWorld) from November 30, 2022 to October 12, 2023. Note that we focus on underground marketplaces of malware and other cyber products/services, instead of illegal drugs in our research. Specifically, to recognize the listings involving Malla services, we crafted a collection of 145 keywords related to ‚Äúlarge language model‚Äù using a search keyword generation tool of WordStream¬†, and then searched those keywords on underground marketplaces and forums.\nFor four forums (i.e., Hack Forums, XSS.is, BreachForums, and BlackHatWorld), we built our scrapers on the top of Selenium¬† to conduct site crawling and content parsing.\nRegarding five Tor-based marketplaces (i.e., Abacus Market, Kerberos Market, Kingdom Market, WeTheNorth Market, and MGM Grand Market), we implemented the scrapers based on the Tor browser¬†[ref]33 and Selenium¬†.\nIn our study, we ensured a complete data scraping by manually checking a range of measures, including real-time monitoring of HTTP status codes and returned page sizes, vigilant session management to address session expiration issues, and the use of CAPTCHA-solving mechanisms when confronted with unsuccessful access attempts. Datasets. In this way, we collected the following datasets related to commercial Malla services, also shown in Table¬†2: ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Malla listing dataset (Lssubscriptùêøùë†L_{s}).\nThis dataset consists of 25 Malla listings from five underground marketplaces and forums.\nThe length of these listings ranges from 41 words to 730 words, with an average of 216.75 words.\nA typical Malla listing consists of various artifacts, including the service name, pricing information, functionality (e.g., malware generation), demo screenshots featuring prompts and responses associated with malicious functionality, contact information, and links to the storefront website.\nGiven the limited number of Malla listings, we opted for a manual extraction process to recognize those artifacts. This hands-on approach ensured that we documented these artifacts with accuracy and thoroughness. We elaborated on those artifacts in ¬ß¬†4.\nFrom these Malla listings, we identified 14 Malla services as listed in Table¬†1. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Samples of Malla services (Dssubscriptùê∑ùë†D_{s}).\nOut of the 14 Malla services, we collected nine Malla samples to investigate their behaviors. Note that two samples are provided as complimentary copies (a.k.a., voucher copies), while the remaining seven samples were obtained through purchasing Malla services.\nWe elaborate on the ethical discussion related to Malla service purchase in ¬ß¬†3.3.\nImportantly, we always initiated our purchase attempts by requesting a voucher copy from Malla providers. If a Malla provider furnished us with such a complimentary copy, we refrained from making any further purchases.\nNote that not all of our purchase attempts yielded successful results; some encountered difficulties due to suspicions on the part of the sellers that we might be acting in a ‚Äúwhite hat‚Äù capacity. One notable instance involved a purchase attempt with the DarkBERT vendor. In this transaction, the vendor became alarmed when we inquired about DarkBERT‚Äôs capabilities and performance. Ultimately, our attempt was declined.\nIn other instances, despite the websites for WormGPT¬†, FraudGPT¬†[ref]12, and BLACKHATGPT¬† indicating that access would be automatically emailed to the customer upon confirmation of Bitcoin payment, we never received such access after making the payment. Several other individuals reported similar experiences with WormGPT on underground forums¬† .\nLikewise, users have highlighted scams associated with DarkBERT and DarkBARD¬†[ref]39. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Backend LLM abused by Malla services (MssubscriptùëÄùë†M_{s}).\nIn our research, we studied the backend LLMs driving the Malla services based on the Malla samples (Dssubscriptùê∑ùë†D_{s}).\nFor samples provided as source code, such as Evil-GPT and WolfGPT, we inspected the LLM models or APIs within the code.\nFor Mallas hosted on websites like BadGPT, EscapeGPT, DarkGPT, and FreedomGPT, we monitored network traffic and examined their headers, payloads, and responses.\nFor those hosted on LLMA hosting platforms, such as XXXGPT, we extracted backend LLM information by parsing their hosting pages. From our investigations, we discerned that both BadGPT and XXXGPT utilize OpenAI GPT-3.5 as their backend LLM, while Evil-GPT and WolfGPT employ the APIs of OpenAI Davinci-003 and OpenAI Davinci-002, respectively. While our efforts to determine the backend LLMs for DarkGPT, EscapeGPT, and FreedomGPT were inconclusive, we did uncover some telling clues. For example, DarkGPT purports to be powered by Davinci-003, a claim we found on its chat interface. During our traffic monitoring for EscapeGPT, we observed the ‚Äúmodel=gpt-3.5-turbo‚Äù and ‚Äújailbreak=gpt-evil‚Äù in its payload text. FreedomGPT also mentioned its use of an uncensored model named Liberty¬† and, in its repository, provided the download URL of Liberty‚Äôs offline model¬†, directing users to the repository of the ‚ÄúLuna AI Llama2 Uncensored‚Äù model¬†.\nHowever, as the vendors of these Malla services employ either self-owned servers without recognizing backend LLMs or APIs, determining the exact backend LLMs remains challenging.\nTo infer the backend LLMs of these Malla services, we propose a reverse-engineering approach detailed in ¬ß¬†5.1. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet Malicious prompt dataset (PmsubscriptùëÉùëöP_{m}).\nTo showcase their functionalities in the listings, Malla services typically include screenshots featuring prompt-response pairs related to their malicious capabilities.\nIn our study, we gathered 45 of these prompts, referred to as ‚Äúmalicious prompts,‚Äù extracted directly from the screenshots.\nAmong this collection, we identified 35 prompts associated with malware generation, five prompts tailored for phishing email creation, and five prompts designed for phishing site creation.\nParticularly, of prompts associated with malware generation, 26 specify the required programming languages: 11 for Python, 10 for C/C++, 2 for C#, etc.\nThis collection of prompts offers valuable insights into the prompts employed by miscreants for malware generation and phishing email/site creation.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: parsing.\nRegarding five Tor-based marketplaces (i.e., Abacus Market, Kerberos Market, Kingdom Market, WeTheNorth Market, and MGM Grand Market), we implemented the scrapers based on the Tor browser¬†[ref]33 and Selenium¬†.\nIn our study, we ensured a complete data scraping by manually checking a range of measures, including real-time monitoring of HTTP status codes and returned page sizes,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
