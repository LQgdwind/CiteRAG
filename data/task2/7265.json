      "content": "Paper Title: Tiny Multi-Agent DRL for Twins Migration in UAV Metaverses: A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the Stackelberg equilibrium, the leaders (i.e., the RSUs) cannot increase profits by changing bandwidth prices, and the followers (i.e., the UAVs) are incapable of augmenting their utilities by adjustments in bandwidth demands.\nIn the context of the framework involving RSUs and UAVs, engaged in a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, the definition of the Stackelberg equilibrium unfolds as follows. (Stackelberg equilibrium): Let (bij)∗(b_{i}^{j})* and (pij)∗superscriptsuperscriptsubscriptpij(p_{i}^{j})^{*} denote the optimal bandwidth demand of UAV iii to RSU jjj, and the optimal bandwidth price of RSU jjj to UAV iii, respectively. Therefore, ((bij)∗,(pij)∗,∀i∈ℐ,∀j∈𝒥)\\big{(}(b_{i}^{j})*,(p_{i}^{j})^{*},\\>\\forall i\\in{\\mathcal{I}},\\>\\forall j\\in{\\mathcal{J}}\\big{)} is the Stackelberg equilibrium within the context of the Stackelberg game involving RSUs and UAVs is contingent upon strict satisfying the following two conditions : There exists a subgame among the RSUs, which strictly compete for bandwidth prices in a non-cooperative fashion. The Nash equilibrium of the subgame is achieved, i.e., (pij)∗superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗({p}_{i}^{j})^{*} is a Nash equilibrium for RSUs, if the following condition is satisfying, Under the pricing strategy denoted by 𝒑i∗superscriptsubscript𝒑𝑖\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}^{*}, the optimal reaction elicited from the utility function of UAV i𝑖i is represented by 𝒃i∗superscriptsubscript𝒃𝑖\\boldsymbol{b}_{i}^{*}. This optimal response, 𝒃i∗superscriptsubscript𝒃𝑖\\boldsymbol{b}_{i}^{*}, serves as the exclusive solution that maximizes the utility function Ui​(𝒃i,𝒑i∗)subscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝒃𝑖superscriptsubscript𝒑𝑖U_{i}(\\boldsymbol{b}_{i},\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}^{*}), conditioned upon the pricing strategy 𝒑i∗superscriptsubscript𝒑𝑖\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}^{*}. For the ease of representation, we represent ln⁡(S​S​I​MijS​S​I​Mit​h)𝑆𝑆𝐼superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑗𝑆𝑆𝐼superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑡ℎ\\ln\\Big{(}\\frac{SSIM_{i}^{j}}{SSIM_{i}^{th}}\\Big{)} as Sijsuperscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖𝑗S_{i}^{j} in the following. The UAVs determine the profit-maximizing optimal bandwidth purchase strategies in Stage II by considering the published bandwidth price policy vector from the RSUs. For any given RSU j𝑗j with the bandwidth selling price pijsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗p_{i}^{j}, the optimization problem of UAV i𝑖i is inherently convex. The optimal strategy dictating the bandwidth demand to be procured by UAV i𝑖i can be formulated as where bˇijsuperscriptsubscriptˇ𝑏𝑖𝑗\\check{b}_{i}^{j} and b^ijsuperscriptsubscript^𝑏𝑖𝑗\\hat{b}_{i}^{j} represent the optimal strategy of UAV i𝑖i to RSU j𝑗j if the second constraint in Eq. (12) is inactive and active, respectively, which are expressed as The derivatives of the utility function Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} with respect to the bandwidth demand strategy bijsuperscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b_{i}^{j} up to the first and second orders are provided as The utility function Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} demonstrates a singular point at which its first-order derivative equals zero. Furthermore, the negative second-order derivative indicates the strict concavity of the utility function Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} to the bandwidth demand strategy bijsuperscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b_{i}^{j} employed by UAV i𝑖i. Thus, the optimization problem for UAV i𝑖i is a convex optimization problem . To determine the optimal response policy bˇijsuperscriptsubscriptˇ𝑏𝑖𝑗\\check{b}_{i}^{j} of UAV i𝑖i with respect to RSU j𝑗j, we equate the first-order derivative of Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} to zero. We can obtain the best response policy bˇijsuperscriptsubscriptˇ𝑏𝑖𝑗\\check{b}_{i}^{j} shown as However, if δi​qj​Sij≤pijsubscript𝛿𝑖superscript𝑞𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗\\delta_{i}q^{j}S_{i}^{j}\\leq{p_{i}^{j}}, UAV i𝑖i will not purchase bandwidth resources from RSU j𝑗j, and then bij=0superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗0b_{i}^{j}=0. Therefore, if the second constraint in Eq. (10) is inactive, the best response policy of UAV i𝑖i for RSU j𝑗j is If the second constraint of Eq. (10) is active, we have ∑i∈ℐpij​bij≥Risubscript𝑖ℐsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗subscript𝑅𝑖\\sum_{i\\in{\\mathcal{I}}}p_{i}^{j}b_{i}^{j}\\geq R_{i}. Then, the Lagrangian function can be utilized to find the optimal strategies for UAV i𝑖i, given by where λisubscript𝜆𝑖\\lambda_{i} represents the Lagrangian multiplier . The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for problem Eq. (10) is given by By solving Eq. (20), we can obtain the optimal strategies of UAV i𝑖i for RSU j𝑗j, which is expressed as The substitution of Eq. (23) into Eq. (22) yields the following expression By substituting Equation (25) into Equation (23), the optimal strategy for UAV i𝑖i can be obtained by We denote ∑j∈𝒥Sijsubscript𝑗𝒥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖𝑗\\sum_{j\\in{\\mathcal{J}}}{S_{i}^{j}} and ∑∀k∈𝒥\\jpkqksubscriptfor-all𝑘\\𝒥𝑗superscript𝑝𝑘superscript𝑞𝑘\\sum_{\\forall k\\in\\mathcal{J}\\backslash j}\\frac{p^{k}}{q^{k}} as A𝐴A and B𝐵B, respectively. Therefore, we can achieve the optimal strategy of UAV i𝑖i to RSU j𝑗j as If Sij​qj​(Ri+∑∀k∈𝒥\\jpkqk)∑j∈𝒥Sij≤pijsuperscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖𝑗superscript𝑞𝑗subscript𝑅𝑖subscriptfor-all𝑘\\𝒥𝑗superscript𝑝𝑘superscript𝑞𝑘subscript𝑗𝒥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗\\frac{S_{i}^{j}q^{j}\\big{(}R_{i}+\\sum_{\\forall k\\in\\mathcal{J}\\backslash j}\\frac{p^{k}}{q^{k}}\\big{)}}{\\sum_{j\\in{\\mathcal{J}}}S_{i}^{j}}\\leq{p_{i}^{j}}, UAV i𝑖i will not purchase bandwidth from RSU j𝑗j. Therefore, the optimal strategy of UAV i𝑖i to RSU j𝑗j is expressed as ∎ The above results indicate that the higher the bandwidth price set by RSU j𝑗j, the less amount of bandwidth is purchased by UAV i𝑖i.\nGiven the aforementioned analysis, the UAVs can adapt their optimal bandwidth purchase strategies in response to the bandwidth selling price offered by RSUs, as shown in Algorithm 1 . By predicting the optimal bandwidth purchase policies of UAVs, RSUs take the role of leaders in Stage I, wherein they aim to optimize their utilities. Non-cooperative games place a strong emphasis on individual rationality and the pursuit of optimal decisions by each player. In the context of RSU decision-making, each RSU participating in UT migration acts in a self-interested and rational manner, making strategic choices with the primary goal of maximizing its utility. Consequently, we formulate the competitive dynamics among RSUs as a non-cooperative game, and the sought-after solution to this game is the Nash equilibrium . The existence of Nash equilibrium in a non-cooperative game can be guaranteed when the following three conditions are met [ref]38: The player set is characterized by finiteness. Both strategy sets are delineated by closure and boundedness, demonstrating convexity. The utility functions exhibit continuity and quasi-concavity within the confines of the strategy space. There exists a Nash equilibrium in the non-cooperative game among RSUs . When the second constraint of Eq. (10) is active, the optimal strategies of UAV i𝑖i (as given in Eq. (27)) are substituted into the utility function of RSU j𝑗j as By computing the first and second-order derivative of Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} with respect to pijsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗p_{i}^{j}, the following expressions are derived, i.e., Then, by setting the first-order derivative of Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} as 00, we can obtain the optimal strategy of RSU j𝑗j to UAV i𝑖i expressed as where 𝒑=∑∀k∈𝒥\\jpik𝒑subscriptfor-all𝑘\\𝒥𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑘\\boldsymbol{p}=\\sum_{\\forall k\\in\\mathcal{J}\\backslash j}p_{i}^{k} represents the strategies of RSUs expect RSU j𝑗j, which indicates that RSU j𝑗j determines its strategy considering the strategies of other RSUs. In the case where the second constraint of Eq. (10) is inactive, we substitute the optimal strategies of UAV i𝑖i (as specified in Eq. (17)) to the utility function of RSU j𝑗j as The expressions for the first-order and second-order derivatives of Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} with respect to pijsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗p_{i}^{j} are given by Similarly, equating the first-order derivative of Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} to 00, the optimal strategy of RSU j𝑗j to UAV i𝑖i is expressed as Note that the second-order derivative of the utility function Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} for RSU j𝑗j is negative, indicating its concavity. Furthermore, the strategy sets for the RSUs meet the essential criteria of being closed, bounded, and convex. Additionally, considering the finite nature of the RSU set and the continuity of their utility functions, the Nash equilibrium among the RSUs exists and is unique according to Lemma 1. ∎ A Stackelberg equilibrium is present in the multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game between RSUs and UAVs . The existence of the Nash equilibrium among RSUs has been formally established, as evidenced by Theorem 1 . Moreover, in Section III-B3, it has been demonstrated that UAVs possess the capability to select optimal strategies, maximizing their utilities for the given pricing strategies of all RSUs. Consequently, by considering the outcomes, it can be deduced that the Stackelberg game between RSUs and UAVs attains a Stackelberg equilibrium.\n∎ A Stackelberg equilibrium is guaranteed to be unique if the following three properties are satisfied : Positivity: ϕij​(𝒑)>0superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝒑0\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p})>0. Monotonicity: If 𝒑′>𝒑superscript𝒑′𝒑\\boldsymbol{p}^{\\prime}>\\boldsymbol{p}, then ϕij​(𝒑′)>ϕij​(𝒑)superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗superscript𝒑′superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝒑\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p}^{\\prime})>\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p}). Scalability: For ∀χ>1for-all𝜒1\\forall\\chi>1, then χ​ϕij​(𝒑)>ϕij​(χ​𝒑)𝜒superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝒑superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝜒𝒑\\chi\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p})>\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\chi\\boldsymbol{p}). where ϕij​(𝐩)superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝐩\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p}) represents the optimal strategy of RSU j𝑗j. The Stackelberg equilibrium among RSUs and UAVs is unique. Based on Eq. (32), it is clear that ϕij​(𝒑)>0superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝒑0\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p})>0 is satisfied. Moreover, ϕij​(𝒑)superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝒑\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p}) is an increasing function for ∑∀k∈𝒥\\jpiksubscriptfor-all𝑘\\𝒥𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑘\\sum_{\\forall k\\in\\mathcal{J}\\backslash j}p_{i}^{k}, i.e., ϕij​(𝒑)superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝒑\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p}) increases as 𝒑𝒑\\boldsymbol{p} increases. Therefore, when 𝒑′>𝒑superscript𝒑′𝒑\\boldsymbol{p}^{\\prime}>\\boldsymbol{p}, i.e., ∑∀k∈𝒥\\jpik′>∑∀k∈𝒥\\jpiksubscriptfor-all𝑘\\𝒥𝑗superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑘′subscriptfor-all𝑘\\𝒥𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑘\\sum_{\\forall k\\in\\mathcal{J}\\backslash j}{p_{i}^{k}}^{\\prime}>\\sum_{\\forall k\\in\\mathcal{J}\\backslash j}p_{i}^{k}, we can get ϕij​(𝒑′)>ϕij​(𝒑)superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗superscript𝒑′superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖𝑗𝒑\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p}^{\\prime})>\\phi_{i}^{j}(\\boldsymbol{p}). Finally, since χ>1𝜒1\\chi>1, then χ2>χsuperscript𝜒2𝜒\\chi^{2}>\\chi. Therefore, for ∀χ>1for-all𝜒1\\forall\\chi>1, we have Based on the above analysis, it has been demonstrated that the best response function of RSU j𝑗j in this case has a unique optimal point.\n∎ In the case that this Stackelberg game has a Stackelberg equilibrium, each RSU independently determines its optimal strategy, and no RSU can improve its revenue by unilaterally altering its chosen strategy. Once all RSUs have declared their pricing strategies, the UAVs proceed to determine their optimal bandwidth demands to maximize their utilities. However, obtaining the private information of UAVs in advance poses practical challenges for RSUs in real-world scenarios, primarily due to legitimate concerns regarding privacy protection. Therefore, the development of a privacy-preserving algorithm becomes imperative for the RSUs to derive their optimal policies under such circumstances.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: game, and the sought-after solution to this game is the Nash equilibrium .
