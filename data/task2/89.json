      "content": "Paper Title: Coherent and Archimedean choice in general Banach spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper deals with rational decision making under uncertainty using choice functions, along the lines established by Teddy Seidenfeld and colleagues .\nWhat are the underlying ideas?\nA subject is to choose between options u𝑢u, which are typically uncertain rewards, and which live in a so-called option space 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V}.\nHer choices are typically represented using a rejection function R𝑅R or a choice function C𝐶C.\nFor any finite set A𝐴A of options, the subset R​(A)⊆A𝑅𝐴𝐴R(A)\\subseteq A contains those options that our subject rejects from the option set A𝐴A, and the remaining options in C​(A)≔A∖R​(A)≔𝐶𝐴𝐴𝑅𝐴C(A)\\coloneqq A\\setminus R(A) are the ones that are then still being considered.\nIt is important to stress here that C​(A)𝐶𝐴C(A) is not necessarily a singleton, so this approach allows for indecision and indifference.\nAlso, the binary choices are the ones where A𝐴A has only two elements, and I won’t be assuming that these binary choices completely determine the behaviour of the functions R𝑅R or C𝐶C on option sets with more than two elements: I’ll be considering choice behaviour that is not necessarily binary in nature. My aim here is to present a theory of coherent and Archimedean choice (functions) that is quite general in that it allows for indecision, allows choice to be non-binary, and works with very general option spaces: general Banach spaces that needn’t have constants.\nThis theory comes with a notion of conservative inference, which allows us start with simple assessments and use the coherence axioms to check their internal consistency and to infer what they imply.111I will use ‘I’ and ‘me’ whenever I feel that what is being described is a result of personal choice or inclination. The editorial ‘we’ and ‘us’ will be used to refer to you and me in the common endeavour of working ourselves through this paper.\nIt also comes with powerful representation results, which show how this type of choice behaviour can be captured in terms of simpler, binary choice models. For the basic theory of coherent choice (functions) on general linear option spaces but without Archimedeanity, I’ll rely fairly heavily on earlier work by Jasper De Bock and myself    , where we show how to provide such general—but not necessarily Archimedean—choice models with an interpretation that leads to simple coherence (or rationality) axioms, conservative inference, and representation results.\nThe present paper expands that work to include a discussion of a novel notion of Archimedeanity.\nSince this more involved approach needs a notion of closeness, I’ll need to focus on option spaces that are Banach, but I still want to keep the treatment general enough so as to avoid the need for including constant options. Archimedeanity is typically introduced as some (or other) simplifying assumption for choice models, and its aim is to make sure that the real number scale in some way suffices for representing the complexity of the choice behaviour that they represent.\nIt typically leads to choice models that involve real functionals of some kind.\nHere, I’ll introduce and study a version of Archimedeanity that will allow both binary and more general choice models to be represented through the intervention of (super)linear bounded real functionals on the option space. The manifold reasons for working with option spaces that are general linear spaces were discussed at length in earlier papers  .\nThe ideas behind this we first explored by Van Camp [ref]23.\nIn summary, doing so allows us to deal with options that are gambles, i.e. bounded real-valued maps on some set of possible states 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, which are considered as uncertain rewards  .\nThese maps constitute a linear space 𝒢​(𝒳)𝒢𝒳\\mathcal{G}(\\mathcal{X}), closed under point-wise addition and point-wise multiplication with real numbers.\nBut working with general linear option spaces also brings in, in one fell swoop, vector-valued gambles  [ref]23, polynomial gambles to deal with exchangeability  [ref]24, equivalence classes of gambles to deal with indifference , and abstract gambles defined without an underlying possibility space .\nAll these examples come with their own particular version of a natural, or background ordering between options that is always present, even in the absence of any real preferences or beliefs on the part of the subject.\nIn all these cases, the space of options essentially includes all real constants—or constant gambles.\nBut there are interesting cases where we also want to consider option spaces that don’t include all real constants. Let me give two examples to indicate why we should want that.\nFirst of all, in the case of horse lottery options, we consider a finite set ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} of rewards, a set of possible states 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, and the set ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} of all state-dependent probability mass functions H:𝒳×ℛ→ℝ:𝐻→𝒳ℛℝH\\colon\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{R}\\to\\mathbb{R} on rewards, also called horse lotteries, where Horse lotteries are often considered as options between which preferences can be expressed  8   [ref]23, but they’re rather cumbersome to work with, because the set ℋ⊆𝒢​(𝒳×ℛ)ℋ𝒢𝒳ℛ\\mathcal{H}\\subseteq\\mathcal{G}(\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{R}) of all horse lotteries with state space 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} and reward set ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} doesn’t constitute a linear space, but is only closed under convex mixtures.\nThere are a number of ways to circumvent this problem, which consist in ‘embedding’ the horse lotteries, and the preferences between them, into a suitably chosen linear space of gambles, without adding or losing preference information. One such approach was suggested by Zaffalon and Miranda  for binary preferences, and extended to more general, possibly non-binary, preferences by Van Camp [ref]23.\nWhile mathematically sound, it appears to me to have a slight disadvantage: it requires singling out one reward ⊥bottom\\bot in the reward set ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} as special, to reduce the reward set to ℛ⊥≔ℛ∖{⊥}≔subscriptℛbottomℛbottom\\mathcal{R}_{\\bot}\\coloneqq\\mathcal{R}\\setminus\\{\\bot\\}, and to work with the linear space of gambles 𝒢​(𝒳×ℛ⊥)𝒢𝒳subscriptℛbottom\\mathcal{G}(\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{R}_{\\bot}) as an option space. It turns out we can get rid of this arguably somewhat arbitrary choice by focusing on another linear subspace of 𝒢​(𝒳×ℛ)𝒢𝒳ℛ\\mathcal{G}(\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{R}): For more context and details, I refer to the running example further on, as well as the relevant discussion in Arthur Van Camp’s PhD thesis [ref]23.\nFor now, it is enough to notice that, since ∑r∈ℛα​[H​(∙,r)−G​(∙,r)]=α​(1−1)=0subscript𝑟ℛ𝛼delimited-[]𝐻∙𝑟𝐺∙𝑟𝛼110\\sum_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}\\alpha[H(\\vbox{\\hbox{\\scalebox{0.8}{$\\bullet$}}},r)-G(\\vbox{\\hbox{\\scalebox{0.8}{$\\bullet$}}},r)]=\\alpha(1-1)=0, 00 is the only ‘real constant’ that this linear space of gambles 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} contains.\nThis indicates why, in order to build a theory general enough to incorporate the horse lottery approach without too many restrictions and arbitrary choices, it will help to also pay attention to linear option spaces that don’t necessarily include (all) real constants. A second example is drawn from recent discussions of decision-theoretic uncertainty modelling in quantum mechanics, by Benavoli et al. [ref]3.\nIn that context, the options are the measurements, which correspond to Hermitian operators on a complex n𝑛n-dimensional Hilbert space, and constitute an n2superscript𝑛2n^{2}-dimensional real linear space without ‘real constants’.\nThe background ordering is related to the notion of positive definiteness for such Hermitian operators.\nIt turns out that we can meaningfully single out one operator—such as the identity operator—as somehow special, call it the unit constant, and in this way embed the real numbers, or real constants, into the option space as all real multiples of this unit constant.\nThis simple idea, suitably generalised, will play an instrumental part further on in the discussion. In order to keep the length of this paper manageable, I’ve decided to focus on the mathematical developments, and to keep the discussion fairly abstract.\nFor a detailed exposition of the motivation for and the interpretation of the choice models discussed below, I refer to earlier joint papers by Jasper De Bock and myself    .\nI also recommend Jasper De Bock’s most recent paper on Archimedeanity , as it contains a persuasive motivation for the new Archimedeanity condition I am about to discuss, in the more restrictive and concrete context where options are gambles. How do I plan to proceed?\nI briefly introduce binary choice models on abstract option spaces in Section 2, and extend the discussion to general—not necessarily binary—choice in Section 3.\nI rely on results in earlier papers to provide an axiomatisation and a conservative inference framework for these choice models, and recall that there are general theorems that allow for representation of general models in terms of binary ones.\nAfter these introductory sections, I focus on adding Archimedeanity to the picture.\nThe basic representation tools that will turn out to be useful in this more restricted context, namely linear and superlinear bounded real functionals, are discussed in Section 4.\nThe more classical approach to Archimedeanity  for binary choice—which I’ll call essential Archimedeanity—is given an abstract treatment in Section 5.\nI discuss the simple trick that allows us to deal elegantly with option spaces without constants—namely proclaiming some option to be constant as far as representation is concerned—in Section 6.\nSections 7 and 8 then deal with the new notion of Archimedeanity in the cases of binary, and general, preferences, and discuss conservative inference and the representation of general Archimedean choice models in terms of binary essentially Archimedean ones.\nI conclude in Section 9 by stressing the relevance of my findings: they show that the axioms presented here allow for a complete characterisation of several decision methods in the literature, amongst which Levi’s E-admissibility 4 and Walley–Sen maximality .\nThe axiomatic characterisation of E-admissibility that I present here as an interesting special case, seems to generalise the one given by Seidenfeld et al.  from horse lotteries to options that live in general Banach spaces, but I believe the axioms and representation results used here have the advantage of being more elegant, transparent and easily interpretable. Where convenient, and in order to anchor the discussion somewhat, I’ll use a simple running example to shed more concrete light on the more abstract ideas and constructions in the main text.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: the option space.
