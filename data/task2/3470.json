      "content": "Paper Title: Grammar-Based Grounded Lexicon Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLexicalist theories.\nThe lexicalist theories of syntax    propose that 1) the key syntactic principles by which words and phrases combine are extremely simple and general, and 2) nearly all of the complexity in syntax can be attributed to rich and detailed lexical entries for the words in the language.\nFor example, whereas the relationship between the active and passive voice, e.g., “Kim saw a balloon” versus “A balloon was seen by Kim”, was treated in pre-lexicalist theories as a special syntactic rule converting between the sentences, in lexicalist theories this relationship derives simply from the knowledge that the passive participle for the verb “see” is “seen,” which interacts with knowledge of other words to make both the active and passive forms of the sentence possible.\nIn lexicalist theories, the problem for the language learner thus becomes a problem of learning the words in the language, not a problem of learning numerous abstract rule schemas. The combinatory categorial grammar [CCG;  38] framework we use is a well-established example of a lexicalist theory: there is a universal inventory of just three combinatory rules (Fig. 1a), but those rules can only be applied once richly specified lexical entries are learned for the words in a sentence. We believe that this lexicalist-theory approach is a particularly good fit to the problem of grounded language learning: the visual context provides clues to the word’s meaning, and the word’s grammatical behavior is tied closely to this meaning, making learning efficient. Compositional generalization in NLP.\nImproving the compositional generalization of natrual langauge processing (NLP) systems have drawn great attention in recent years . Most of the recent approaches towards this goal are mostly built on deep learning-based models. There are two representative approaches: building structured neural networks with explicit phrase-based structures or segments    ; and using data augmentation techniques  7 . However, these approaches either rely on additional annotation or pretrained models for phrase structure inference or require domain-specific heuristics in data augmentation. In contrast to both approaches, we propose to use combinatory grammar rules to constrain the learning of word meanings and how they compose. Neural latent trees. CKY-E2 is in spirit related to recent work using CKY-style modules for inducing latent trees. However, our model is fundamentally different from works on unsupervised constituency parsing 5 6 which use the CKY algorithm for inference over scalar span scores and those compute span representation vectors with CKY-style algorithms [29, 12, inter alia]. Our key contribution is to introduce the expected execution mechanism, where each span is associated with weighted, compressed programs. Beyond enumerating all possible parsing trees as in 9, G2L2 considers all possible programs associated with each span. Our expected execution procedure works for different types (object set, integer, etc.) and even functor types. This makes our approximation exact for linear cases and has polynomial complexity. Grammar-based grounded language learning.\nThere have also been approaches for learning grammatical structures from grounded texts 5  2 [ref]7 3 . However, these approaches either rely on pre-defined lexicon entries [ref]7, or only focus on inducing syntactic structures such as phrase-structure grammar 5. Different from them, G2L2 jointly learns the syntactic types, semantic programs, and concept grounding, only based on a small set of combinatory grammar rules. Grammar-based and grounded language learning have also been studied in linguistics, with related work to ours studying on how humans use grammar as constraints in learning meaning  and how learning syntactic rules and semantic meanings in language bootstrap each other . However, most previous computational models have focused only on explaining small-scale lab experiments and do not address grounding in visual perception 4 6. In contrast, G2L2 is a neuro-symbolic model that integrates the combinatory categorial grammar formalism 8 with joint perceptual learning and concept learning, to directly learn meanings from images and texts. Neuro-symbolic models for language grounding. Integrating symbolic structures such as programs and neural networks has shown success in modeling compositional queries in various domains, including image and video reasoning 0 1, knowledge base query , and robotic planning . In this paper, we use symbolic domain-specific languages with neural network embeddings for visual reasoning in images and navigation sequence generation, following NS-CL 0. However, in contrasts to using neural network-based semantic parser as in the aforementioned papers, our model G2L2 focuses on learning grammar-based lexicon for compositional generalization in linguistic structures, such as novel word composition.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: exact for linear cases and has polynomial complexity.
