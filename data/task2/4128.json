      "content": "Paper Title: EnergyMatch: Energy-based Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our approach on two SSL settings: (1) the imbalanced setting with long-tailed class distributions, which we believe reflects many real-world scenarios; and (2) the standard class-balanced setting, which assumes a balanced distribution of classes. Our evaluation follows standard protocols as in  0. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze important design choices of our method. Datasets. We evaluate on several SSL image classification benchmarks. For the imbalanced setting, we use CIFAR10-LT and CIFAR100-LT [ref]17, which are long-tailed variants of the original CIFAR datasets. We follow prior work in long-tail SSL  [ref]21, and use an exponential imbalance function  to create the long-tailed version of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. We select 10% and 30% data from each class as the labeled set for CIFAR10-LT and CIFAR100-LT, respectively. We experiment with imbalance ratio from 50 to 200 for CIFAR10-LT and from 50 to 100 for CIFAR100-LT.\nDetails of constructing these datasets can be found in Appendix A.2. For the standard SSL evaluation, we use balanced CIFAR10/100 [ref]17, whose labeled and unlabeled sets are constructed in a balanced fashion, SVHN , and STL-10  using the standard train and test splits. Baselines. We compare to the latest methods developed for long-tailed SSL (DARP , CReST , and ABC [ref]21) and for balanced SSL (UDA , UPS , FixMatch , and FlexMatch 0). All methods except UPS use the strong-weak data augmentation paradigm and our implementation makes the data augmentation operation consistent across different methods. FixMatch and UDA use fixed confidence thresholding with hard pseudo-labels and soft pseudo-labels, respestively. FlexMatch dynamically adjusts thresholds for different classes to (roughly) balance the pseudo-labeled samples per class. UPS adopts an uncertainty metric through MC-Dropout  by running forward pass 10 times and computing the standard deviation of outputs. This practice is very time consuming in modern SSL frameworks as the pseudo-labels are produced on-the-fly at each iteration. Therefore, for the balanced SSL setting, we report the CIFAR results from the original paper. For the imbalanced setting, we incorporate UPS into FixMatch (denoted as FixMatch-UPS) and only evaluate it on CIFAR10-LT due to its high computation cost. For SSL-LT baselines, DARP refines pseudo-labels via convex optimization designed for the imbalance scenario. CReST tries to alleviate the imbalance via moving unlabeled samples to labeled sets with probabilities inversely proportional to class frequency and restart training. ABC, in contrast, implicitly balances the classifier by introducing an auxiliary classifier trained with balanced sampling.\nWe implement our energy-based pseudo-labeling in the framework of FixMatch for its simplicity and denote our method as EnergyMatch. Implementation Details. We implement our method in the open-source SSL codebase TorchSSL 0 and conduct each experiment with three runs using different random seeds. For a fair comparison, unless otherwise specified, the baseline results and our results are generated with the same codebase, same random seeds, same data splits, and same network architecture.\nFollowing prior work  0, we use Wide ResNet-28-2  with 1.5M parameters for Cifar10 and SVHN, WRN-28-8 for CIFAR-100, and WRN-37-2 for STL-10. All methods are trained with SGD with momentum of 0.9. For the balanced datasets, we use an initial learning rate of 0.03 and the total training iterations is set to 220superscript2202^{20} with a cosine learning rate schedule of 716716\\frac{7}{16} cycle. We use a constant learning rate for long-tailed datsets as we found using cosine decay leads to worse performance for all methods. To be consistent with our baselines  0 , we use a batch size of 64 for labeled data, 7x larger batch size for unlabeled data, exponential moving average with a momentum of 0.999 for inference, random horizontal flip for weak augmentation and RandAugment  and CutOut  for strong augmentation. Our code will be made publicly available. More training details for each experiment, hyper-parameter choices, and an anonymous link to our code base can be found in Appendix A.1.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: studies to analyze important design choices of our method.
