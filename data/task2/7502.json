      "content": "Paper Title: Linear Dynamics-embedded Neural Network for Long-Sequence Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSequence modeling with long-range dependency is a crucial and challenging problem in many application fields of machine learning, e.g., natural language processing (NLP) , computer vision (CV) , and time series forecasting . Extensive research has been conducted to mitigate this problem. Among various works, deep learning has shown its compelling ability in sequence modeling. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) employ a recursive architecture with a memory mechanism that compresses history information. Compared with standard feedforward neural networks, RNNs can make flexible inferences at any time length. The gradient vanishing and exploding problem make them challenging to train . Subsequent works, like LSTM  and bidirectional RNN [ref]6, have attempted to address these issues. However, the sequential nature of RNNs makes them unable to be trained efficiently in a parallel setting because of the backpropagation across the time chain. Transformer with attention mechanism avoids the problems in RNNs and realizes parallel computing [ref]7. Thereafter, it achieves remarkable success in NLP, CV, and time series [ref]8. However, the quadratic complexity of length prevents the Transformer from exhibiting efficient performance in modeling long sequences. Many efficient variants have been introduced with reduced complexity to tackle this issue, such as Informer , and Crossformer 0. Unfortunately, these efficient variants perform unsatisfying results on long-sequence modeling tasks, worse than the original Transformer 1. Recently, state space models (SSMs) based neural networks have made significant progress in long-sequence modeling. LSSL 2 incorporates the HiPPO theory 3 and outperforms the Transformer family models in many sequence tasks. Hereafter, some variants of SSMs are proposed, like S4 4, DSS 5, S4D 6 and so on. They all show remarkable abilities in modeling long sequences on various tasks, including time series forecasting, speech recognition, and image classification. However, there still exist some research gaps to be addressed. Existing models are based on single-input and single-output (SISO) SSMs stacked parallel for modeling multi-variate sequences. An additional linear layer is needed to mix features from different SISO SSMs. However, multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) SSMs lack exploration. The parameterization and initialization are found to be heavily sensitive. Some parameters are set as unlearnable for training. Moreover, the system matrix Aùê¥A has to be initialized as a ‚ÄúHiPPO matrix‚Äù to ensure good performance. S4 and its variants are delicate but difficult to understand and implement because of complex matrix transformation. In this work, we introduce Linear Dynamics-embedded Neural Network (LDNN) based on MIMO SSMs, designed to solve the abovementioned issues. We model the linear dynamics using continuous MIMO SSMs, which have the properties of fewer parameters than discrete neural networks (NN). Thus, we can model the multi-variate sequences directly. Then, a discrete representation can be obtained through mature discretization technology. The discrete SSMs are recurrent models that can make flexible inferences as RNNs. Furthermore, to train the proposed model efficiently, we derive its convolutional representations, which enables the training process to be more efficient with parallel computing. We reduce the number of model parameters and improve the computational efficiency of the model by diagonalization and Disentanglement then Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)‚Ä≤‚Ä≤superscriptsuperscriptDisentanglement then Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)‚Ä≤‚Ä≤{}^{\\prime}\\text{Disentanglement then Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)}^{\\prime} strategies. The diagonal SSMs in convolutional representations significantly reduce time and space complexity at the training phase. Afterwards, we disentangle and transform the original convolution operation between the state kernel and multi-variate input sequence equivalently. Then, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied for the disentangled convolution operation. We parameterize and initialize the proposed LDNN in a more general format than existing works. All parameters are optional to be learnable or not. The system matrix Aùê¥A can be initialized via the HiPPO, random or constant matrix. The ablation study suggests that any initialization strategy with a proper learning rate has a competitive accuracy. The linear SSMs used in this work are causal systems, which may limit their applications to non-causal cases, such as image classification. To fix this, we propose the non-causal variant with a bidirectional kernel. Besides, motivated by Multi-Head Attention [ref]7, we design the Multi-Head LDNN. The original input vector is split into multiple sub-vectors and then modeled by LDNN. Outputs of all LDNN are concatenated and mixed by a linear projection function. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of LDNN using the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark. LRA contains six long sequences of classification tasks over text, image, and mathematical operations. Our models outperform Transformer variants and match the performance of the state-of-the-art models. The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows. We design a new neural network, LDNN, for long-sequence modeling based on MIMO SSMs. LDNN has the characteristics of few parameters, flexible inference, and efficient training (Section III-A). We reduce the time complexity of convolution from O‚Äã(L‚ÄãN‚ÄãH‚Äãmax‚Å°{L,N})ùëÇùêøùëÅùêªùêøùëÅO(LNH\\max\\{L,N\\}) to O‚Äã(L‚ÄãN‚Äãmax‚Å°{H,log‚Å°L})ùëÇùêøùëÅùêªùêøO(LN\\max\\{H,\\log L\\}) by design diagonalization and Disentanglement then FFT‚Ä≤‚Ä≤superscriptsuperscriptDisentanglement then FFT‚Ä≤‚Ä≤{}^{\\prime}\\text{Disentanglement then FFT}^{\\prime} strategies. In convolutional representation, therefore, LDNN can be efficiently trained (Section III-B) (Section III-B). We propose two variants of LDNN: the Bidirectional LDNN and the Multi-Head LDNN for a wide range of complex applications such as non-causal modeling (Section III-C).\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: networks, RNNs can make flexible inferences at any time length.
