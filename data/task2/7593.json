      "content": "Paper Title: The Geometric Structure of Topic Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral methods to interpret topic models have been proposed. Some of\nthem represent the document-topic relation through a vector space\nmodels [ref]11 . This\nallows the reader to visually interpret this relation through\nproximity in two or three dimensional diagrams. Common methods for\nthis are multidimensional scaling [ref]23 or t-distributed\nstochastic neighborhood embedding . Other explanation approaches follow a more relational approach.\nA very simple method is to compute a relation based on topic-topic\ncorrelation. This is, for example, computed using cosine\nsimilarities between topics in a vector space model\n[ref]11.\nSome topic models, like the Correlation Topic Model (CTM)\n, allow for directly inferring this relation from the model\nand presented in a graph structure. These approaches allow for\none-to-one comparisons of topics. Extensions to allow for hierarchical\ninterpretation of this relation has been proposed based on clustering\ntechniques . With our work, we contribute to the explainability of topic models\nbased on relations that are defined on the data, i.e.,\ndocuments-topics and term-topics relations. These are often weighted\n and are scaled to binary relations\n. A basic investigation of the derived (binary)\nrelations are visualizations using bipartite graphs\n. Based on these graphs, simple (tree\nshaped) hierarchies can be inferred by applying hierarchical\nclustering methods [ref]30. A benefit of\nhierarchical interpretations is that one can infer topic-topic\nrelations of higher arity from them. On top of that, they allow for\nassessing the overall global structure of a data. However, tree\nstructures are very limited  in their\nexpressiveness. For instance, there is only a single path connection\ntwo nodes. A hierarchical structure that is not limited by this property can be\ncomputed using Formal Concept Analysis  (FCA). With\nFCA, we compute from the bipartite graph the set of all maximal\nbi-cliques. These exhibit a natural order relation which results in a\nlattice structure, called the concept lattice. An application\nof concept lattices on documents-topics and term-topics relations has\nbeen shown to be useful for organizing discussion forums in\neducational software . We further elaborate on this\nmethod after an introduction to FCA in Section 4.2.\nWith our work, we expand on FCA based methods by transferring new\nstate-of-the-art  \nexplanation approaches for concept lattice into the realm of topic\nmodeling. These allow for a novel global interpretation of the topic\nmodel structure. A different, yet related line of research is the computation of\nhierarchical topic models\n   . Multiple visualization\ntechniques have been proposed for their explanation\n.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Several methods to interpret topic models have been proposed.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
