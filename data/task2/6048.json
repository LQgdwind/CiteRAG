      "content": "Paper Title: Text-to-Audio Generation using Instruction-Tuned LLM and Latent Diffusion Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the success of automatic text-to-image (TTI) generation   3, many researchers have also succeeded in text-to-audio (TTA) generation  [ref]18  by employing similar techniques as the former. Such models may have strong potential use cases in the media production where the creators are always looking for novel sounds that fit their creations. This could be especially useful in prototyping or small-scale projects where producing the exact sound could be infeasible. Beyond this, these techniques also pave the path toward general-purpose multimodal AI that can simultaneously recognize and generate multiple modalities. To this end, the existing works use a large text encoder, such as, RoBERTa [ref]19 and T5 , to encode the textual description of the audio to be generated. Subsequently, a large transformer decoder or a diffusion model generates the audio prior, which is subsequently decoded by a pre-trained VAE, followed by a vocoder. We instead assume that replacing the text encoder with an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) would improve text understanding and overall audio generation without any fine-tuning, due to its recently discovered gradient-descent mimicking property . To augment training samples, the existing methods take a randomly generated combination of audio pairs, along with the concatenation of their descriptions. Such a mixture does not account for the overall pressure level of the source audios, potentially leading to a louder audio overwhelming the quieter one. Thus, we employ a pressure level-based mixing method, as suggested by Tokozume et al. . Our model (Tango) 111The acronym Tango stands for Text-to-Audio using iNstruction Guided diffusiOn and was suggested by ChatGPT. The word Tango is often associated with music 2 and dance 1. According to Wikipedia 1, “Tango is a partner dance and social dance that originated in the 1880s along the Río de la Plata, the natural border between Argentina and Uruguay.” The image above resembles the Tango dance form and was generated by prompting Dalle-V2 with ‘‘A couple dancing tango with musical notes in the background’’ is inspired by latent diffusion model (LDM) 3 and AudioLDM [ref]18 models. However, instead of using CLAP-based embeddings, we used a large language model (LLM) due to its powerful representational ability and fine-tuning mechanism, which can help learn complex concepts in the textual description. Our experimental results show that using an LLM greatly improves text-to-audio generation and outperforms state-of-the-art models, even when using a significantly smaller dataset. In the image generation literature, the effects of LLM has been studied before by Saharia et al. . However, they considered T5 as the text encoder which is not pre-trained on instruction-based datasets. Flan-T5  is initialized with a T5 checkpoint and fine-tuned on a dataset of 1.8K NLP tasks in terms of instructions and chain-of-thought reasoning. By leveraging instruction-based tuning, Flan-T5 has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, matching the performance of LLMs with billions of parameters. In Section 3, we empirically show that Tango outperforms AudioLDM and other baseline approaches on most of the metrics on AudioCaps test set under both objective and subjective evaluations, despite training the LDM on a 636363 times smaller dataset. We believe that if Tango is trained on a larger dataset such as AudioSet (as Liu et al. [ref]18 did), it would be able to provide even better results and improve its ability to recognize a wider range of sounds. The overall contribution of this paper is threefold: We do not use any joint text-audio encoder—such as CLAP—for guidance. Liu et al. [ref]18 claim that CLAP-based audio guidance is necessary during training for better performance. We instead use a frozen instruction-tuned pre-trained LLM Flan-T5 with strong text representation capacity for text guidance in both training and inference. AudioLDM needed to fine-tune RoBERTa [ref]19 text encoder to pre-train CLAP. We, however, keep Flan-T5 text encoder frozen during LDM training. Thus, we find that LDM itself is capable of learning text-to-audio concept mapping and composition from a 63 times smaller training set, as compared to AudioLDM, given an instruction-tuned LLM. To mix audio pairs for data augmentation, inspired by Tokozume et al. , we consider the pressure levels of the audio pairs, instead of taking a random combination as the prior works like AudioLDM. This ensures good representations of both source audios in the fused audio.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Following the success of automatic text-to-image (TTI) generation   3, many researchers have also succeeded in text-to-audio (TTA) generation  [ref]18  by employing similar techniques as the former.
