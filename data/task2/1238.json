      "content": "Paper Title: Doubly Stochastic Subspace Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlgorithms. We compare against several state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms, which are all affinity-based: SSC  , EnSC , LSR , LRSC , TSC , SSC-OMP , and S3COMP . For these methods, we run the experiments on our own common framework, and we note that the results we obtain are similar to those that have been reported previously in the literature on the same datasets for these methods. We report partial results from the paper of S3COMP , which is included as it is a recent well-performing model. Besides TSC, which uses an inner product similarity, these methods all compute an affinity based on some self-expressive loss. Although methods for clustering data in a union of subspaces are not directly comparable to subspace clustering neural networks , which cluster data supported in a union of non-linear manifolds, we still include some comparisons. In particular, we run experiments with DSC-Net  as a representative neural network based method and include further comparisons (that are qualitatively similar) to other neural networks   6  in the appendix. However, we note that recent work  has shown that DSC-Net (and many related works for network-based subspace clustering) are often fundamentally ill-posed, calling into question the validity of the results from these methods. Metrics.\nAs is standard in evaluations of clustering, we use clustering accuracy (ACC)  and normalized mutual information (NMI) [ref]21 metrics, where we take the denominator in NMI to be the arithmetic average of the entropies. Also, we consider a subspace-preserving error (SPE),\nwhich is given by 1n​∑i=1n∑j∉𝒮yi|𝐀i​j|/∥𝐀i∥11𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑗subscript𝒮subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝐀𝑖𝑗subscriptdelimited-∥∥subscript𝐀𝑖1\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j\\not\\in\\mathcal{S}_{y_{i}}}\\mathinner{\\!\\left\\lvert\\mathbf{A}_{ij}\\right\\rvert}/\\mathinner{\\!\\left\\lVert\\mathbf{A}_{i}\\right\\rVert}_{1}, where 𝒮yisubscript𝒮subscript𝑦𝑖\\mathcal{S}_{y_{i}} denotes the (subspace) cluster that point 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} belongs to, and 𝐀isubscript𝐀𝑖\\mathbf{A}_{i} is the ith column of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. This measures the proportion of mass in the affinity that is erroneously given to points in different (subspace) clusters, and is often used in evaluation of subspace clustering algorithms  . We report the sparsity of learned affinities by the average number of nonzeros per column (NNZ). Although sparse affinities are generally preferred, the sparsest affinity is not necessarily the best. Datasets. We test subspace clustering performance on the Extended Yale-B dataset 2, Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-40 and COIL-100) , UMIST face dataset 3, ORL face dataset , MNIST , and EMNIST-Letters .\nWe run experiments with the raw pixel data from the images of certain datasets; for COIL, UMIST, MNIST, and EMNIST we run separate experiments with features obtained from a scattering convolution network  reduced to dimension 500 by PCA . This has been used in previous subspace clustering works   to better embed the raw pixel data in a union of linear subspaces. We do not evaluate DSC-Net  on scattered features as the network architecture is only compatible with image data. For MNIST (n𝑛n=70,000) and EMNIST (n𝑛n=145,600), we can only run scalable methods, as neural networks and other methods that form dense n𝑛n-by-n𝑛n matrices have unmanageable memory and runtime costs. Clustering setup. For each baseline method we learn the 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} from that method, form the affinity as 𝐀^=(|𝐂|+|𝐂|⊤)/2^𝐀𝐂superscript𝐂top2{\\mathbf{\\hat{A}}=(\\mathinner{\\!\\left\\lvert\\mathbf{C}\\right\\rvert}+\\mathinner{\\!\\left\\lvert\\mathbf{C}\\right\\rvert}^{\\top})/2}, take the normalized Laplacian 𝐋=𝐈−𝐃−1/2​𝐀^​𝐃−1/2𝐋𝐈superscript𝐃12^𝐀superscript𝐃12{\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{\\hat{A}}\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}} (where 𝐃=diag​(𝐀^​𝟏)𝐃diag^𝐀1{\\mathbf{D}=\\mathrm{diag}(\\mathbf{\\hat{A}1}})), and then apply spectral clustering with the specified number of clusters k𝑘k . For our DSSC methods, we form 𝐀^=(𝐀+𝐀⊤)/2^𝐀𝐀superscript𝐀top2\\mathbf{\\hat{A}}={(\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{A}^{\\top})/2} and use 𝐋=𝐈−𝐀^𝐋𝐈^𝐀\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{I}-\\hat{\\mathbf{A}} directly for spectral clustering (recall our affinity is invariant to Laplacian normalization).\nFor the spectral clustering we take the k𝑘k eigenvectors corresponding to the k𝑘k smallest eigenvalues of 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L} as an embedding of the data (we take k+1𝑘1k+1 eigenvectors for MNIST as in , as well as for EMNIST for similar reasons).\nAfter normalizing these embeddings to have unit l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} norm, we obtain clusterings by random initializations of k𝑘k-means clustering, compute the accuracy and NMI for each clustering, then report the average accuracy and NMI as the final result. We emphasize that for each method we obtain a nonnegative, symmetric affinity by a shared postprocessing of 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} and/or 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} instead of using different ad-hoc postprocessing methods that may confound the comparisons. Since DSC-Net is highly reliant on its ad-hoc postprocessing , we also report results with its postprocessing strategy applied (shown as DSC-Net-PP). Parameter choices. As is often done in subspace clustering evaluation,\nwe choose hyperparameters for each method by searching over some set of parameters and\nreporting the results that give the highest clustering accuracy.\nFor DSC-Net, we use the suggested parameters in  where applicable,\nand search over hyperparameters for novel datasets.\nWe give details on model hyperparameters in the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: calling into question the validity of the results from these methods.
