      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-Efficient Robust Beamforming for Multi-Functional RIS-Aided Wireless Communication under Imperfect CSI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless network demands high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity to meet the exponential growth of wireless traffic . Various advanced technologies, including non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, have been exploited to support low latency, high data rates, and massive device access. Nevertheless, in most cases, achieving high spectrum efficiency often entails a significant increase in energy consumption . To balance between throughput performance and power consumption, energy efficiency (EE) has been recognized as an important performance metric to measure whether 6G communications meet green and sustainability requirements [ref]3. Therefore, innovative technologies to support spectrum- and energy-efficient communications are urgent. Benefiting from the fabrication of programmable meta-surfaces, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a significant and viable solution to boost the spectral efficiency, EE, and signal coverage in 6G networks. Generally, an RIS is a planar array of a large number of low-cost elements that can be dynamically adjusted to reconfigure electromagnetic waves . Thus, an RIS is capable of altering the amplitude and phase of incident signals by intelligently modulating the phase shift of each element, subsequently redirecting the signals towards the desired direction [ref]5. This capability enables RIS to tailor the wireless environment to fulfill specific network demands.\nSince the RIS only reflects the incident signals without involving the decoding and regeneration processes, it boasts significantly lower power consumption and hardware cost compared to relays . Therefore, the RIS has been recognized as a potential technology to tackle the problem of high energy consumption in wireless communications. However, since the single-functional RIS (SF-RIS) only reflects or refracts the impinging signals, the resulting geographical confinement limits the flexibility and performance improvement of the SF-RIS deployment.\nSpecifically, the SF-RIS provides services only for users located on the reflection side, resulting in a half-space coverage.\nTo overcome this limitation, the dual-functional RIS (DF-RIS), e.g., simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RIS [ref]7 or intelligent omni-surface (IOS)  has been proposed to support signal reflection and refraction simultaneously, thus building a full-space smart radio environment.\nNevertheless, the signals relayed by DF-RISs undergo the cascaded channel of the transmitter-RIS-receiver. The resulting double-fading attenuation seriously weakens the signal strength and degrades the advantages of RIS deployment in wireless networks . Although deploying a large RIS with numerous passive elements may compensate for the high path-loss, the corresponding high control overhead and power consumption are inevitable.\nTo alleviate the adverse effect faced by DF-RISs, active RISs with signal reflection and amplification are introduced to transcend the inherent physical limits of the double fading effect 0. Specifically, each element integrated with negative resistance components, e.g., tuning diodes, can convert the direct current (DC) bias power to radio frequency (RF) power, thus amplifying the received signal without significantly compromising the low power budget requirements 1. Therefore, the active RIS can alleviate the double-fading attenuation while ensuring low power consumption. Furthermore, to support full-space coverage and overcome the double-fading attenuation at the same time, we introduced the multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS) to reflect, refract, and amplify the incident signals simultaneously 2.\nHowever, existing works on MF-RIS are conducted in the case of perfect channel state information (CSI) case 3 4 5, which is challenging to obtain in practice. Moreover, due to the integration of amplifiers, both the received desired signal and thermal noise are amplified at MF-RIS 6, thus the cascaded CSI of the transmitter-RIS-receiver exploited in passive RISs can not be utilized for beamforming design at the MF-RIS 7. In addition, since MF-RISs lack RF chains, they can not perform channel estimation on two individual links. Therefore, it is essential to design robust beamforming strategies for MF-RIS assisted networks.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: performance and power consumption, energy efficiency (EE) has been recognized as an important performance metric to measure whether 6G communications meet green and sustainability requirements [ref]3.
