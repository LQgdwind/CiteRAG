      "content": "Paper Title: Digital Fingerprinting on Multimedia: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough learning-based methods can generate high-quality hash values, they are highly dependent on self-training or deep training, leading to high computational time costs, which limits their applicability in actual applications requiring rapid detection and classification . In addition, these methods typically require a large amount of raw images for training and still have shortcomings in resisting the diversity of transformations. The following introduces the use of several typical DNNs to realize deep hashing for image authentication. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based deep image hashing. CNNs  reduce memory usage and the number of parameters through convolutional structures, alleviate overfitting problems, and improve feature extraction performance. CNNs are widely used in fields such as object detection and image classification. CNN-based image hashing schemes use the trained network model to extract feature matrices, and then generate quantized hash sequences for image authentication. In 2014, Xia et al.  introduced convolutional neural network hashing (CNNH), the first method to use CNNs for simultaneous feature and hash function learning. It involves two stages: hash coding and hash function learning. While pioneering in using deep learning for perceptual hashing, this approach is not end-to-end, as the combination of multiple encoders and decoders is manually designed. In 2016, Liu et al.  developed a CNN architecture that learns compact binary codes by training on pairs of similar and dissimilar images, aiming to output discrete values (e.g., +1/-1). In 2018, Jiang et al.  proposed a perceptual image hashing scheme using deep CNNs, training an AlexNet model to extract image feature matrices. By 2020, Qin et al.  had introduced a multi-constrained CNN-based perceptual image hashing scheme, where the network learns feature extraction automatically to generate the final hash sequence, focusing on image authentication rather than countering malicious editing. In 2022, Sun et al.  proposed a CNN-based perceptual image hashing method using hash centers and classification, introducing center quantization to reduce the required training images while balancing perceptual robustness and discriminability for image copyright protection. Despite advancements in enhancing perceptual robustness, new approaches are still needed to address increasingly complex operations. In 2023, Zhou et al.  generated two new architectures called NASRes and NASCoNt, by designing a new dataset containing complex content-preserving operations and optimizing the ConvNeXt architecture using neural architecture search (NAS), significantly improving the robustness and discriminability of perceptual authentication hashing under complex operations. Meng et al.  proposed an improved perceptual hashing method based on machine learning for digital rights management systems. By generating an image set through image pre-processing, extracting image features using a CNN, and computing perceptual hash values through machine learning, this method can handle various image transformations. Based on , a CNN-based image group perceptual hashing scheme was proposed , which generates the same perceptual hash for all images in the group, making content management in actual applications easier. Compared to generating perceptual hashes separately for each image in the group, this method reduces the computational cost of fine-tuning the CNN. Convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based deep image hashing. The weight-sharing feature of CNNs makes them more robust to overfitting, while the CAE  achieves weight-sharing and two-dimensional spatial information preservation through local connections and convolutional operations. CAE integrates the strengths of both autoencoders and CNNs, enabling it to learn meaningful features from unlabeled data (or images) and produce a concise, effective representation (short-length array) of the input data. CAE-based image hashing schemes map the input image to low-dimensional hash codes through the trained encoder and then generate the image mapping through the decoder. By comparing the hash code mapping of the reference image and the received image, the tampered region in the image can be accurately located. In 2020, Li et al.  first trained a hierarchical denoising autoencoder (DAE)-based image fingerprint computation network to gradually improve its robustness to content-preserving distortions. In 2021, Paul et al.  proposed an image hashing technique based on a convolutional stacked denoising autoencoder (CSDAE) to solve the problem of composite rotation-scale-translation (RST) distortion and tampering in color images. Generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based deep image hashing. GANs [ref]175 can generate clear and realistic images without complex computations. GAN-based image hashing schemes use real images and various images synthesized by the generative model to expand the training samples, further improving the model’s generalization ability and learning compact binary hash values. GANs mainly consist of two parts: the generator and the discriminator. The generator, as a form of CAE, generates images by learning noisy inputs. The discriminator is a CNN-based discriminant network that is responsible for extracting data features to distinguish real images and GAN-synthesized images. Through the adversarial training between the two, the generator and discriminator compete and progress together, ultimately reaching a balanced state, thereby generating more realistic data for input. In 2018, Yarlagadda et al.  introduced a GAN-based method for detecting and localizing satellite image forgeries, which also aids in feature representation learning of raw satellite images. In 2019, Wang et al.  developed WeGAN, a deep image hashing method that uses a weighted GAN to generate hash codes, improving image retrieval performance by leveraging the uncertain relationship between images and labels. In 2019, Jin et al.  proposed a VAE-GAN-based hashing framework that combines variational autoencoder (VAE) and GANs to generate content-preserving images for pairwise hashing learning, for fast image retrieval. In 2022, Bin et al.  extracted key information about the perceptual image content through a bidirectional GAN, thereby improving the robustness and fragility of the perceptual hash codes for the same image.\n\nReference markers found: [175]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]175: autoencoder (CSDAE) to solve the problem of composite rotation-scale-translation (RST) distortion and tampering in color images.
