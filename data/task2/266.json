We use the implementation of SAD from the Voicebox toolkit . This was followed by cepstral mean variance normalization (CMVN) done over each utterance, followed by a sliding window CMVN over a sliding window of 333 sec. The number of UBM mixture components was set to C=2048ùê∂2048C=2048 and the dimension of the total variability space was fixed to be R=500ùëÖ500R=500.\nThe i-vectors are processed with within class covariance normalization (WCCN) technique¬† and length normalized. The dimension of the i-vectors is then reduced to 131313 and 555 for LRE17 and RATS datasets respectively using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and modeled using support vector machines (LDA-SVM). The i-vector SVM system implementation follows the recipe provided by the NIST LRE system . The x-vector baseline system is implemented using the TDNN model architecture described in [ref]19. The x-vector system consists of 555 layers of time delay neural network (TDNN) architecture followed by statistics (mean and std. dev.) pooling layer which converts frame level features to utterance level features. These segment level statistics are fed through two layers of feed forward network with 512512512 hidden dimensions. The x-vectors are the embeddings from the affine layer after the statistics pooling (output of layer 666 before the non-linearity with 512512512 dimensions). The target for the x-vector model are the language labels. We use the LRE2017 training data along with data augmentation to train the x-vector model.\nThe model used a five fold data augmentation procedure with room reverberation as well as the additive noises like music, noise and babble (MUSAN corpus¬†) at SNR values of 5,10,15,2051015205,10,15,20 dB. \nThe entire model is trained using the Kaldi recipe¬†. We report the results using x-vector features for the LRE2017 evaluation in Table¬†II. We also report the performance of the x-vector system directly using the posteriors from the trained network (denoted as x-post).\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: (LDA-SVM).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
