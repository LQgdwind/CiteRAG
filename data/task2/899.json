      "content": "Paper Title: Compressed Key Sort and Fast Index Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been extensive research on efficient index structures for database tables, where efficiency measures are index size, search time, concurrency control, etc. Especially the following work focused on reducing index sizes and/or search time: Bayer and Unterauer’s Prefix B-tree , Lehman and Carey’s T-tree , Ferguson’s Bit-tree , Bohannon et al.’s partial-key T-tree and partial-key B-tree , Rao and Ross’s CSS-tree  and CSB+ tree , Chen et al.’s pB+ tree  and fpB+ tree , Schlegel et al.’s k-ary search tree , Boehm et al.’s Generalized Prefix Tree , Kissinger et al.’s KISS-tree , and more recently Kim et al.’s Fast Architecture-Sensitive Tree (FAST) , Yamamuro et al.’s VAST-tree , Levandoski et al.’s Bw-tree , Leis et al.’s Adaptive Radix Tree (ART) , Zhang et al.’s SuRF ,\nBinna et al.’s HOT .\nSee Graefe and Larson  and Graefe  for surveys. Our work reduces the sizes of sort keys by compressing them, from which the speedups in sorting and index rebuilding are obtained. Hence our work is orthogonal to the previous work on efficient index structures, and it can be applied to many index structures. Compressing keys by distinction bits can also be applied to big data file formats. Popular self-described file formats such as ORC  and Parquet  adopt columnar storage structures to cope with read-heavy analytic workloads against large-scale distributed datasets. Compression by distinction bits can accelerate such common analytic tasks as sorting data and generating unique keys. Kim et al.’s FAST  proposed a key compression technique which extracts bits of index keys in the bit positions where the index keys are not the same (which are called variant bits).\nWe go one step further and use distinction bits to determine the sorted order of index keys correctly. There has been research on order-preserving compression     [ref]31 which\nmaps index keys into encoded values such that the order of index keys is the same as the order of encoded values. In order-preserving compression, index keys are replaced by encoded values. In our compression scheme, however, there is no encoding. We simply extract part of index keys (i.e., distinction bits) to speed up sorting and index building. The index tree built by our compression scheme will be a conventional B-tree index without any encoding of index keys. For sorting in multi-core CPUs, there have recently been many results exploiting SIMD parallelism   .\nIn our target applications which require a wide range of index key sizes, however, the size of index keys is too big to exploit SIMD parallelism. Thus we implemented our own parallel sorting algorithm called the row-column sort, which relies only on the operation of comparing two elements during sorting. The comparison operator is called a comparator. Therefore, the row-column sort works with any key sizes. (In contrast, sorting on SIMD needs quite different algorithmic techniques such as merging networks   .)\nIn our experiments we compared the row-column sort with GCC STL parallel sort ,\nwhich is an available parallel sort code on multi-core CPUs in which a custom comparator can be used.\nExperiments show that the row-column sort shows a better speedup than GCC STL sort, and\nit is 31.4% faster than GCC STL sort when the number of cores is 16.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: (which are called variant bits).\nWe go one step further and use distinction bits to determine the sorted order of index keys correctly. There has been research on order-preserving compression     [ref]31 which\nmaps index keys into encoded values such that the order of index keys is the same as the order of encoded values. In order-preserving compression, index keys are replaced by encoded\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
