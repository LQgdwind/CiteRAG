Modern SAT solvers are based on the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) approach , which is a (non-)chronological backtracking search process.\nThis paper is mainly associated with the branching and restart components of CDCL solvers. Overview of CDCL Branching\nModern CDCL branching heuristics aim to pick the variable likely to lead to high-quality conflicts, and the ranking score is usually saved in a heap or a priority queue.\nPopular branching heuristics include Variable State Independent Decaying Sum (VSIDS) , Learning-Rate Based Branching (LRB)  and Variable Move To Front (VMTF) .\nNote that the default order of all the solvers mentioned in this paper is sorted according to the index number of variables. Overview of CDCL Phasing\nThe phases of CDCL decide the assignment when branching on a variable. Modern CDCL solvers use the phase saving trick , which prefers to assign a variable the value it was last assigned.\nRecently, rephasing   is proposed to periodically reset the phases. There are studies proposing to stick to phases that maximize the assignment trail by extending promising assignments via a technique called target phases  or via a non-conflicting propagation and improved by local search . Overview of CDCL Restarting\nModern CDCL solvers implement multiple restarting methods, as frequent restarts greatly improve the performance of CDCL.\nWhen restating, CDCL solvers cancel the partial assignment of all variables, but preserve the previous order, phase, and learned clauses.\nThe restarting operations of modern SAT solvers are almost the same, but there are various heuristics that decide when to start.\nThe most implemented restarting heuristic in modern SAT solvers include Luby , the Glucose-style restart  and its EMA variants . Overview of Parallel SAT Solving\nThere are two main parallel paradigms: the cube-and-conquer paradigm , and the portfolio paradigm.\nThe first paradigm divides the search space into millions of little subspaces and solves each of them separately, which is successfully used to solve many mathematical problems [ref]20 .\nThe second paradigm simply runs different SAT solvers or different configurations of a single SAT solver for each thread, where the latter one is called diversity   9 2. Modern portfolio solvers usually use clause sharing 9\nto enhance the performance by avoiding searching the same search space.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: portfolio paradigm.\nThe first paradigm divides the search space into millions of little subspaces and solves each of them separately, which is successfully used to solve many mathematical problems [ref]20 .\nThe second paradigm simply runs different SAT solvers or different configurations of a single SAT solver for each thread, where the latter one is called diversity   9 2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
