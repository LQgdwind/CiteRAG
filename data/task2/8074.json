      "content": "Paper Title: Event Stream based Sign Language Translation: A High-Definition Benchmark Dataset and A New Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid development of deep learning, AI (Artificial Intelligence) for good has received widespread attention, among which, Sign Language Translation (SLT) [ref]40   is increasingly being emphasized. It aids communication between deaf individuals and non-sign language users by converting sign language videos into natural language text, significantly enhancing the social participation and quality of life for the deaf community. However, the performance of sign language translation is still limited due to the usage of RGB cameras, as it is easily influenced by limited frame rate, illumination, motion blur, etc. In addition, the deployment of RGB-based sign language recognition models may also pose potential ethical risks as it involves issues of human privacy. Recently, biologically inspired Event cameras (e.g., DVS346, Prophesee, CeleX) have drawn more and more attention due to their unique features in high dynamic range, low energy cost, sparse spatial but dense temporal resolution, and low latency, etc . For the imaging mechanism, each pixel within an Event camera operates independently and asynchronously, a distinct departure from RGB cameras that produce synchronized frame outputs. A binary pulse signal is recorded only when the change in brightness for each pixel exceeds a specific threshold. Some computer vision tasks have involved the Event camera for event-based or event-enhanced learning, such as object detection  tracking  , action recognition  , and also the sign language translation [ref]42 discussed in this paper. Although limited, there are already some research efforts that have begun to focus on event-based sign language translation, as shown in Fig. 1. Early models are typically developed based on simulated event data from existing RGB datasets, such as PHOENIX-2014  and CSL-Daily [ref]44. Obviously, the simulated data can’t fully reflect the key features of the real event stream. Recently, three real event datasets have been proposed, including SL-Animal-DVS , EV-ASL , EvSign [ref]42. However, the first two datasets have limited spatial resolution (128×128128128128\\times 128), and the EvSign [ref]42 crops the head regions of the actor for privacy-preserving. We believe this approach may corrupt the raw information of the event stream, significantly impacting the recognition and analysis of gestures involving the head area. In this paper, we propose a new sign language translation dataset, termed Event-CSL, which is the largest, high-definition (1280×72012807201280\\times 720) real-event dataset collected using the Prophesee EVK4-HD Event camera. It contains 14,827 videos, 14821 glosses, and 2,544 Chinese words in the text vocabulary. Our dataset is collected in a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes, encompassing multiple angles, light intensities, and camera movements. More importantly, we provide the most primitive event stream data, which lays the groundwork for accurately recognizing the meanings conveyed by gestures. In our experiments, we split these videos into training, validation, and testing subsets, which contain 12,602, 741, and 1,484 samples, respectively. To build a more comprehensive benchmark, we train and report 6 recently released SLT models for future works to compare. More details can be found in Section 4. On the basis of our newly proposed Event-CSL dataset, we also propose a new event-based sign language translation framework, as shown in Fig. 2. The key insight of our framework is that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features and have consistently been the dominant visual backbone networks for sign language translation tasks. Despite the impact of Transformer models , their lower complexity and higher precision have continued to be favored. Therefore, this paper employs a residual network, ResNet18 , to encode the input event streams. To further enhance its global modeling capabilities, we introduce Mamba layers  to fuse CNN feature maps along the temporal views, thereby strengthening its perception. This hybrid CNN-Mamba architecture can even achieve better sign language translation results than dense Transformer models. We input the event visual features into the decoder to translate and obtain the final Chinese descriptions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple existing SLT datasets and our newly proposed Event-CSL all validated the effectiveness of our framework. To sum up, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as the following three aspects: 1). We propose a new large-scale, high-definition event-based sign language translation dataset, termed Event-CSL. It contains 14,827 videos and 2,544 Chinese words recorded in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. 2). We propose a hybrid CNN-Mamba vision encoder for our sign language translation framework. The integration of CNN and Mamba layers makes our vision backbone well capture local and long-range global relations and retain low computational costs. 3). Extensive experiments conducted on four event-based SLT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our framework. In addition, we have evaluated multiple representative and state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLT algorithms on our newly proposed Event-CSL dataset and also two simulation datasets (PHOENIX-2014T-Event , CSL-Daily-Event [ref]44) hoping that these benchmarks can contribute to the advancement of the SLT field.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: With the rapid development of deep learning, AI (Artificial Intelligence) for good has received widespread attention, among which, Sign Language Translation (SLT) [ref]40   is increasingly being emphasized.
