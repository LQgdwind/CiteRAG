      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesizing the Unseen for Zero-shot Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nZero-shot Recognition:\nThe goal of Zero shot learning (ZSL) is to classify images of unseen classes given their textual semantics in the form of wordvecs [ref]8, text-descriptions   or human annotated attributes . This is commonly done by learning a joint embedding space where semantics and visual features can interact. The embeddings can be learnt to project from visual-to-semantic , or semantic-to-visual space [ref]8. Some methods also project both visual and semantic features into a common space . The existing methods which learn a projection or embedding space have multiple inherent limitations such as the hubness problem  caused by shrinked low dimensional semantic space with limited or no diversity to encompass variations in the visual image space. These methods are therefore prone to mis-classify unseen samples into seen due to non-existence of training samples for the unseen.\nRecently, generative approaches deploying variational auto-encoders (VAEs) or generative adverserial networks (GANs) have shown promises for ZSL    . These approaches model the underlying data distribution of visual feature space by training a generator and a discriminator network that compete in a minimax game, thereby synthesizing features for unseen classes conditioned on their semantic representations. Zero-shot Detection:\nThe existing literature on zero shot learning is dominated by zero shot classification (ZSC). Zero Shot Detection (ZSD), first introduced in [ref]2 , is significantly more challenging compared with ZSC, since it aims to simultaneously localize and classify an unseen object. [ref]2 maps visual features to a semantic space and enforces max-margin constraints along-with meta-class clustering to enhance inter-class discrimination. The authors in  incorporate an improved semantic mapping for the background in an iterative manner by first projecting the seen class visual features to their corresponding semantics and then the background bounding boxes to a set of diverse unseen semantic vectors.  learns an embedding space as a convex combination of training class wordvecs.  uses a Recurrent Neural Network to model natural language description of objects in the image. Unlike ZSC, synthetic feature generation for unseen classes is less investigated for ZSD and only [ref]18 augments features. Ours is a novel feature synthesis approach that has the following major differences from [ref]18 (i) For feature generation, we only train a single GAN model, in comparison to [ref]18 which trains three isolated models. Our unified GAN model is capable of generating diverse and distinct features for unseen classes. (ii) We propose to incorporate a semantics guided loss function, which improves feature generation capability of the generator module for unseen categories. (iii) To enhance diversification amongst the generated features, we incorporate a mode seeking regularization term. We further compare our method directly with [ref]18 and show that it outperforms [ref]18 by a significant margin, while using a single unified generation module.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Zero-shot Recognition:\nThe goal of Zero shot learning (ZSL) is to classify images of unseen classes given their textual semantics in the form of wordvecs [ref]8, text-descriptions   or human annotated attributes .
