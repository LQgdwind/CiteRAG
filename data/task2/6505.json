      "content": "Paper Title: DSTCGCN: Learning Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Cross Dependencies for Traffic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraffic forecasting is an essential part of an intelligent transportation system and a crucial technique for developing a smart city  [ref]2. Accurate traffic forecasting will provide reliable guidance for scheduling transportation resources, mitigating traffic congestion, raising early warnings for public safety, and offering suggestions to citizens for their daily commuting . Since traffic forecasting has a wide range of real-world applications, it has become a popular research focus in academic and industrial communities for decades. Traffic forecasting aims to accurately predict future traffic data, e.g., traffic flow and speed, given historical traffic data recorded by sensors on a road network. It is highly challenging due to complicated spatial and temporal dependencies within the road network. Spatially, traffic data collected by a sensor are influenced by nearby traffic conditions, as the traffic dynamics propagate along the road. Temporally, the current features of traffic data are influenced by historical features. Moreover, spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies are entangled and time-varying in real-world traffic systems. In the past decades, many works have been proposed for this challenging task, from using shallow machine learning   to applying recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning [ref]2   . Although these works make it possible to model temporal dependencies and grid-based spatial dependencies, they cannot capture graph-based spatial dependencies within an irregular road network in reality [ref]9. Towards this problem, graph neural network (GNN) based works have been proposed to leverage the graph structure of a road network effectively 0 1. Specifically, these works use a graph to define a road network, where each node represents a sensor, and each edge represents a spatial dependency between sensors. More recently, researchers have integrated GNNs to capture spatial dependencies with RNNs 2 [ref]9 3, CNNs 4 5, or Attentions 6 7 to model temporal dependencies. This type of network, known as spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), has shown the state-of-the-art performance for traffic forecasting [ref]2 1. Despite the success, the performance of many existing STGNNs is highly constrained by utilizing static dependencies. They usually construct static graphs, e.g., distance graphs 2 4 8 9, POI similarity graphs  , temporal similarity graphs [ref]22 , and static adaptive graphs 3  , to model spatial dependencies, which neglect the changing nature of the spatial dependencies within road networks. Some explorations have been conducted to model such dynamics. For example, a static graph and dynamic attribute based graphs are integrated to obtain time-varying structures , and attention mechanisms are exploited to construct structures changing with time . However, these works only focus on the dynamics of spatial dependencies and ignore dependencies crossing spatial and temporal dimensions, which may fail to extract some effective features carried by cross dependencies. The effectiveness of spatial-temporal cross dependencies has been empirically shown for traffic forecasting. These works  [ref]22  usually represent cross dependencies by a fused graph, e.g., a spatial-temporal synchronous graph  constructed by distance graphs and temporal connection graphs, and a spatial-temporal fusion graph [ref]22 constructed by distance graphs, time similarity graphs, and temporal connection graphs. However, these works still rely on static graphs, which cannot capture dynamic cross dependencies. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Cross Graph Convolution Network (DSTCGCN). To the best of our knowledge, DSTCGCN is the first work that learns dynamic spatial and temporal dependencies jointly via graphs to explore and utilize time-varying cross dependencies for traffic forecasting. The main contributions of our work are as follows: Introduce an FFT-based attentive selector to choose the relevant time steps for each time step based on real-world traffic data, which can model the dynamics of temporal dependencies. Moreover, it can limit the temporal neighbors of each time step to a small size and reduce the computational complexity. Introduce a dynamic cross graph construction module to fuse time-varying spatial graphs and temporal connection graphs in a directed and sparse way, which can model dynamic spatial-temporal cross dependencies without introducing over-fitting problems. Evaluate DSTCGCN on six real-world datasets for traffic flow and traffic speed forecasting. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DSTCGCN.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Traffic forecasting is an essential part of an intelligent transportation system and a crucial technique for developing a smart city  [ref]2.
