      "content": "Paper Title: Bounded strategic reasoning explains crisis emergence in multi-agent market games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe formation of crises in economic markets is a well-established phenomenon, dating back to at least the Dutch ‚Äútulip mania‚Äù of 1636 which abruptly burst overnight  . This boom and bust are often explained due to the irrationality of market participants . The importance of this irrationality was discussed by Keynes who explained price fluctuations with the beauty contest game¬†. Specifically, Keynes pointed out that ‚ÄúI-think-you-think-they-think‚Ä¶-type of regress‚Äù better represented investor behaviour, with pricing driven by investors‚Äô beliefs about other investors, rather than by the asset fundamentals. While this ‚ÄúI-think-you-think-they-think‚Ä¶-type of regress‚Äù has been identified as a natural representation for agent behaviour in market games , modelling these recursive beliefs becomes problematic becomes problematic due to the potential infinite reasoning . A recently introduced approach, based on the Quantal Hierarchy (QH) model , addressed limitations of this higher-order reasoning by ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù at various points of recursion, thus accounting for boundedly rational agents and preventing infinite regress. In this work, exemplified by a concise market configuration, the canonical El Farol Bar Problem, we extended the QH model to capture crisis emergence in market entrance games. Crucially, this analysis showed that bounded strategic reasoning can lead to higher probabilities of crises (i.e., fat-tails in attendance fluctuations), matching the dynamics of actual economic markets. Furthermore, we related the resulting volatility to the diversity of strategic reasoning resources across the agent population. Of course, convergence to a desirable market capacity, an ‚Äúequilibrium‚Äù, has been demonstrated for the El Farol bar problem before¬†   [ref]36. Moreover, it has been shown that even a large number (N‚Üí‚àû‚ÜíùëÅN\\to\\infty) of zero-intelligence agents can self-organise to the desired capacity under relatively general conditions, simply due to the law of large numbers¬†[ref]36. The model proposed in this work performed at least as good as these approaches, even in systems with relatively low number of heterogeneous agents (N=100ùëÅ100N=100), as long as the agents follow boundedly rational strategic reasoning. However, convergence to equilibrium is a necessary but not sufficient characteristic for an adequate model of actual markets, in which crises can endogenously form and volatility can cluster in time.\nHence, we systemically explored the formation of crises based on abrupt deviations from an equilibrium state. Specifically, we analysed the tail-indices of endogenously emerging crises, categorised by significant changes in attendance (3+‚ÄãœÉsuperscript3ùúé3^{+}\\sigma events), where the system can be seen as briefly being out-of-equilibrium. This analysis demonstrated that these fat tails are significantly heavier than one would expect under a rational expectations model without the arrival of any external news. We related these resultant tail indices to actual market data, showing that the fat tails produced by the BRATS approach decay at a realistic rate. Finally, we traced and examined the endogenous emergence of periods of volatility based on changes in agent beliefs, and related this to the agent learning process. A key stylised fact of economic markets ‚Äî clustered volatility ‚Äî was recreated using a concise learning update of agents‚Äô reasoning resources.\nImportantly, the change in the overall diversity of agent beliefs was predictive of the change in future volatility, indicating that the heterogeneity of agent beliefs is a crucial predictor of volatility. These findings strengthened the conjecture that the diversity of market participant beliefs is one of the ‚Äúmost important propagation mechanism[s] of economic volatility‚Äù¬†. A similar conclusion was reached by¬†, where periods of instabilities caused by the ratio of chartists and fundamentalists in the market were ‚Äúquickly brought to an end by stabilising tendencies‚Äù.\nYet, the diversity of strategies has not been fully explored in the context of the El Farol bar problem¬†. Here we offered a way to analyse the population diversity in terms of reasoning resources. In doing so, we quantified the market dynamics, confirming that during a period of high volatility, if agent beliefs are correlated, the volatility persists. As the agents attempt to alter their beliefs to recover market capacity, the correlation in the agent beliefs reduces over time ‚Äî due to the different agents‚Äô learning updates. Eventually, the system returns to a ‚Äúcalm‚Äù steadier state, with less volatility, supported by the increased diversity of beliefs. In summary, the proposed approach captured three key desirable characteristics for a model of economic markets. Specifically, we have shown how the BRATS agents can (i) converge to a good average outcome, i.e., equilibrium, on a macro scale, which is punctuated by the (ii) abrupt emergence of crises on a micro scale, categorised by spontaneous ‚Äúout-of-equilibria deviations‚Äù in accordance with actual market dynamics, and in addition, can (iii) recreate stylised facts of markets such as clustered volatility. Importantly, these emergent phenomena occur endogenously, without any external news to the system. The phenomena arise simply due to the interaction among heterogeneous BRATS agents. This work adds to the growing literature on the interacting agent hypothesis. There are various approaches which explore this hypothesis using relatively complex and fine-grained models. For example, heterogeneous agent beliefs can model observed market price dynamics and volatility in the S&P 500¬†. Likewise, booms and busts in various housing markets can be explained through heterogeneous expectations and beliefs¬†  .\nIn contrast, we aimed to capture complex market dynamics within a concise and intuitive model of agent reasoning in a general market setting. In doing so, we verified the hypothesis that the heterogeneity of interacting agents is a crucial factor behind the endogenous emergence of crisis and stylised facts in economic markets. Various approaches have been proposed to consider price changes as a result of attendance fluctuations   . For future work, it may be instructive to incorporate price changes into the analysis presented here, e.g., with the introduction of a market-maker. In addition, while we have examined entrance into a single market, it would be insightful to explore such findings in a generalised multiple market setting, where agents not only need to decide whether or not to enter, but also which market to enter (if any) in a congestion style game. In contrast to the long-standing belief that adaptive strategies provides an adequate solution to this class of market games, we have shown that bounded strategic reasoning can capture salient market dynamics more convincingly. This study highlights that bounded strategic reasoning (‚ÄúI-think-you-think-they-think‚Ä¶‚Äù) across heterogeneous agents can explain periods of volatility and abrupt crises emerging in economic markets, even without any external shocks.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: of strategic reasoning resources across the agent population.
