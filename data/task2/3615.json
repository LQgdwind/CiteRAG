      "content": "Paper Title: On Practical Nearest Sub-Trajectory Queries under the Fréchet Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe sub-trajectory nearest-neighbor search problem can be solved in 𝒪​(m​n​log⁡m​n)𝒪𝑚𝑛𝑚𝑛\\mathcal{O}(mn\\log mn) time, whereas the sub-trajectory range search can be computed in 𝒪​(m​n)𝒪𝑚𝑛\\mathcal{O}(mn) time, both based on simple modifications to Alt and Godau’s [ref]1 decision algorithm.\nUnlike this decision algorithm, recent versions with improved time bounds or improved practical behavior do not allow clear extensions to the sub-trajectory decision problem.\nTo our knowledge, there is also no available implementation of the (mildly) sub-quadratic decider , whose space bound matches its time bound on the pointer machine.\nThe practical, recursive decider in [ref]5 supports the basic decision problem and can be executed in linear space.\nHowever, extensions for the sub-trajectory setting are unclear and the time bound of the recursive method is super-quadratic (i.e. checking ‘simplicity’ of a box boundary [5, Algorithm 222] does not have an 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}(1) time bound). Two studies  [ref]17 give approximation algorithms for the counting version of the sub-trajectory range problem under the continuous Fréchet distance.\nDe Berg et al.  describe a multi-level partition tree that takes 𝒪​(n3​log⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛3𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}\\log n) time to construct and uses 𝒪​(s​polylog⁡n)𝒪𝑠polylog𝑛\\mathcal{O}(s\\operatorname{polylog}n) space, where n≤s≤n2𝑛𝑠superscript𝑛2n\\leq s\\leq n^{2}.\nThe data structure can only handle single segment queries in 222D that must be longer than 6​τ6𝜏6\\tau, where τ𝜏\\tau is the range input parameter.\nThe query time is 𝒪​(n/s​polylog⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑠polylog𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n/\\sqrt{s}\\operatorname{polylog}n), and it counts all sub-trajectories up to distance τ𝜏\\tau from Q𝑄Q, but the reported value may also contain those up to (2+3​2)​τ232𝜏(2+3\\sqrt{2})\\tau distance from Q𝑄Q.\nGudmundsson and Tridgell [ref]17 present two algorithms that improve on .\nThe first algorithm computes a 2​τ2𝜏2\\tau-maximally simplified curve from P𝑃P in quadratic time, and the query algorithm walks along the simplified curve to produce a result in 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) time.\nQ𝑄Q is restricted to have a constant complexity and each segment must have length of at least 8​τ8𝜏8\\tau, and the count may include sub-trajectories up to distance 3​τ3𝜏3\\tau from Q𝑄Q.\nThe second algorithm pre-computes a multi-level data structure in 𝒪​(n3​log⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛3𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}\\log n) time with 𝒪​(n​polylog⁡n)𝒪𝑛polylog𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\operatorname{polylog}n) space.\nIts query algorithm works for d𝑑d dimensional trajectories and takes 𝒪​(n1−1/d​polylog⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛11𝑑polylog𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{1-1/d}\\operatorname{polylog}n) with an error of 3​d​τ3𝑑𝜏3\\sqrt{d}\\tau.\nBoth studies above bound query times, at a cost of quadratic or larger pre-processing time, limitations to Q𝑄Q, and approximate results.\nThey also provide counts and do not report sub-trajectory start/end points. In , Buchin et al. study a data mining problem that detects similar 222D sub-trajectories in P𝑃P under the discrete and continuous Fréchet distance measures.\nOne result is an optimization algorithm that finds the maximum sub-trajectory length l¯¯𝑙\\bar{l} where there are at least c¯¯𝑐\\bar{c} sub-trajectories and the continuous Fréchet distances between them are at most τ𝜏\\tau.\nThe algorithm gives a 222-distance approximation and runs in 𝒪​(n2​l¯)𝒪superscript𝑛2¯𝑙\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\bar{l}) time and 𝒪​(n​l¯2)𝒪𝑛superscript¯𝑙2\\mathcal{O}(n\\bar{l}^{2}) space. Driemel and Har-Peled  describe a linear size data structure for P𝑃P, that takes a single segment Q𝑄Q and point indices x𝑥x and y𝑦y as input, and returns a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate Fréchet distance between Q𝑄Q and the sub-trajectory ⟨px,…,py⟩subscript𝑝𝑥…subscript𝑝𝑦\\langle p_{x},\\ldots,p_{y}\\rangle, in 𝒪​(log⁡n​log⁡log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log n\\log\\log n) time.\nThere is also work   on approximate nearest-neighbor searches under the discrete and continuous Fréchet distance measures that find the closest trajectory within an input set, however the methods do not search for sub-trajectories and have exponential data structure size.\nSee  for lower bounds for approximate range searching. The recent work  contributes a practical approach for exact proximity searches on sets of input trajectories based on clustering with strong quality guarantees and query algorithms that exploit potentially low ‘intrinsic dimensionality’   of the data sets for metric pruning.\nHowever, the method does not extend well to our problem since the data structure size is quadratic in the sub-trajectory setting.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: in 𝒪​(m​n​log⁡m​n)𝒪𝑚𝑛𝑚𝑛\\mathcal{O}(mn\\log mn) time, whereas the sub-trajectory range search can be computed in 𝒪​(m​n)𝒪𝑚𝑛\\mathcal{O}(mn) time, both based on simple modifications to Alt and Godau’s [ref]1 decision algorithm.\nUnlike this decision algorithm, recent versions with improved time bounds or improved practical behavior do not allow clear extensions to the sub-trajectory decision\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
