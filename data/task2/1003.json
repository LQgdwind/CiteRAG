      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Theoretically Understanding Why Sgd Generalizes Better Than Adam in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet 𝒖t=∇𝑭​(𝜽t)−∇f𝒮t​(𝜽t)subscript𝒖𝑡∇𝑭subscript𝜽𝑡∇subscript𝑓subscript𝒮𝑡subscript𝜽𝑡\\bm{u}_{t}\\!=\\!\\nabla\\bm{F}(\\bm{\\theta}_{t})\\!-\\!\\nabla\\!f_{\\mathcal{S}_{t}}(\\bm{\\theta}_{t}) denote gradient noise. From Sec. 3.1, we can formulate Sgd as follows To analyze behaviors of an algorithm, one effective approach is to obtain its SDE via making assumptions on 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t} and then analyze its SDE. For instance, to analyze Sgd, most works [ref]25  [ref]26  assume that 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t} obeys a Gaussian distribution 𝒩​(𝟎,𝚺t)𝒩0subscript𝚺𝑡\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{0},\\!\\bm{\\Sigma}_{t}) with covariance matrix However, both recent work  and Fig. 1 show that the gradient noise 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t} has heavy tails and can be better characterized by 𝒮​α​𝒮𝒮𝛼𝒮\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S} distribution . Moreover, the heavy-tail assumption can also better explain the behaviors of Sgd than Gaussian noise assumption. Concretely, for the SDE of Sgd on the one-dimensional problems, under Gaussian noise assumption its escaping time from a simple quadratic basin respectively exponentially and polynomially depends on the height and width of the basin , indicating that Sgd gets stuck at deeper minima as opposed to wider/flatter minima. This contradicts with the observations in  9   that Sgd often converges to flat minima. By contrast, on the same problem, for Lévy-driven SDE, both  and this work show that Sgd tends to converge to flat minima instead of deep minima, well explaining the convergence behaviors of Sgd. Following , we also assume 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t} obeys 𝒮​α​𝒮𝒮𝛼𝒮\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S} distribution but with a time-dependent covariance matrix 𝚺tsubscript𝚺𝑡\\bm{\\Sigma}_{t} to better characterize the underlying structure in the gradient noise 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t}. In this way, when the learning rate η𝜂\\eta is small and ε=η(α−1)/α𝜀superscript𝜂𝛼1𝛼\\varepsilon=\\eta^{(\\alpha-1)/\\alpha}, we can write the Lévy-driven SDE of Sgd as Here the Lévy motion Lt∈ℝdsubscript𝐿𝑡superscriptℝ𝑑L_{t}\\in{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} is a random vector and its i𝑖i-th entry Lt,isubscript𝐿𝑡𝑖L_{t,i} obeys the 𝒮​α​𝒮​(1)𝒮𝛼𝒮1\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S}(1) distribution which is defined through the characteristic function 𝔼​[exp⁡(i​ω​x)]=exp⁡(−σα​|ω|α)𝔼delimited-[]𝑖𝜔𝑥superscript𝜎𝛼superscript𝜔𝛼\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i\\omega x)]=\\exp(-\\sigma^{\\alpha}|\\omega|^{\\alpha}) if x∼𝒮​α​𝒮​(σ)similar-to𝑥𝒮𝛼𝒮𝜎x\\sim\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S}(\\sigma). Intuitively, the 𝒮​α​𝒮𝒮𝛼𝒮\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S} distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution with a decay density like 1/|x|1+α1superscript𝑥1𝛼1/|x|^{1+\\alpha}. When the tail index α𝛼\\alpha is 2, 𝒮​α​𝒮​(1)𝒮𝛼𝒮1\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S}(1) becomes a Gaussian distribution and thus has stronger data-fitting capacity over Gaussian distribution. In this sense, the SDE of Sgd in [ref]25  [ref]26   is actually a special case of the Lévy-driven SDE in this work. Moreover, Eqn. (4) extends the one-dimensional SDE of Sgd in . Note, Eqn. (4) differs from [ref]29, since it considers dynamic covariance matrix 𝚺tsubscript𝚺𝑡\\bm{\\Sigma}_{t} in gradient noise and shows great effects of its underlying structure to the escaping behaviors in both Adam and Sgd, while [ref]29 analyzed escaping behaviors of Sgd along several fixed directions. Similarly, we can derive the SDE of Adam. For brevity, we define 𝒎t′=β1​𝒎t−1′+(1−β1)​∇𝑭​(𝜽t)superscriptsubscript𝒎𝑡′subscript𝛽1superscriptsubscript𝒎𝑡1′1subscript𝛽1∇𝑭subscript𝜽𝑡\\bm{m}_{t}^{\\prime}\\!=\\!\\beta_{1}\\bm{m}_{t-1}^{\\prime}\\!+\\!(1-\\beta_{1})\\nabla\\bm{F}(\\bm{\\theta}_{t}) with 𝒎0′=𝟎superscriptsubscript𝒎0′0\\bm{m}_{0}^{\\prime}=\\bm{0}. Then by the definitions of 𝒎tsubscript𝒎𝑡\\bm{m}_{t} and 𝒎t′superscriptsubscript𝒎𝑡′\\bm{m}_{t}^{\\prime}, we can compute As noise 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t} has heavy tails, their exponential average should have similar behaviors, which is also illustrated by Fig. 1. So we also assume 11−β1t​(𝒎t′−𝒎t)11superscriptsubscript𝛽1𝑡superscriptsubscript𝒎𝑡′subscript𝒎𝑡{\\frac{1}{1-\\beta_{{\\scriptscriptstyle{1}}}^{t}}}(\\bm{m}_{t}^{\\prime}-\\bm{m}_{t}) obeys 𝒮​α​𝒮​(1)𝒮𝛼𝒮1\\mathcal{S}\\alpha\\mathcal{S}(1) distribution with covariance matrix 𝚺tsubscript𝚺𝑡\\bm{\\Sigma}_{t}.\nMeanwhile, we can write Adam as So we can derive the Lévy-driven SDE of Adam: where ε=η(α−1)/α𝜀superscript𝜂𝛼1𝛼\\varepsilon\\!=\\!\\eta^{(\\alpha-1)/\\alpha}, 𝑸t=diag⁡(ωt​𝒗t+ϵ)subscript𝑸𝑡diagsubscript𝜔𝑡subscript𝒗𝑡italic-ϵ\\bm{Q}_{t}\\!=\\!\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega_{t}\\bm{v}_{t}}+\\epsilon\\right), μt=1/(1−e−β1​t)subscript𝜇𝑡11superscript𝑒subscript𝛽1𝑡\\mu_{t}\\!=\\!1/(1-e^{-\\beta_{1}t}) and ωt=1/(1−e−β2​t)subscript𝜔𝑡11superscript𝑒subscript𝛽2𝑡\\omega_{t}=1/(1-e^{-\\beta_{2}t}) are two constants to correct the bias in 𝒎tsubscript𝒎𝑡\\bm{m}_{t} and 𝒗tsubscript𝒗𝑡\\bm{v}_{t}. Note, here we replace 𝒎t′superscriptsubscript𝒎𝑡′\\bm{m}_{t}^{\\prime} with 𝒎tsubscript𝒎𝑡\\bm{m}_{t} for brevity. Appendix B provides more construction details, randomness discussion and shows the fitting capacity of this SDE to Adam. Subsequently, we will analyze escaping behaviors of the SDEs in Eqns. (4) and (5).\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: To analyze behaviors of an algorithm, one effective approach is to obtain its SDE via making assumptions on 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t} and then analyze its SDE.
