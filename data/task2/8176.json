      "content": "Paper Title: Blown up by an equilateral: Poncelet triangles about the incircle and their degeneracies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReferring to Figure 17, in several Poncelet families studied, the locus of X59subscript𝑋59X_{59}, the isogonal conjugate of X11subscript𝑋11X_{11}, is either an oval or a self-intersected curve, e.g., see [11, Fig.2] and [26, Fig.9]. Nevertheless, it collapses to a conic in the following two cases. Firstly: In Chapple’s porism, the locus of X59subscript𝑋59X_{59} is an ellipse with major axis on X1​X3subscript𝑋1subscript𝑋3X_{1}X_{3}, with semi-axis lengths given by: The isogonal conjugate g​(P)𝑔𝑃g(P) of a point P𝑃P with respect to a triangle T𝑇T is the point of concurrence of the cevians of P𝑃P reflected upon the angle bisectors . In  it is shown that the locus of g(Pg(P) over circle-inscribed Poncelet triangles is a circle. As above, let 𝒯gsubscript𝒯𝑔\\mathcal{T}_{g} be a family of Poncelet triangles interscribed between two generic conics ℰ,ℰcℰsubscriptℰ𝑐\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{E}_{c}. Referring to Figure 18, the following is proved in [ref]10: Over 𝒯gsubscript𝒯𝑔\\mathcal{T}_{g}, the locus of g​(P)𝑔𝑃g(P) is a conic.\nIf P𝑃P is on ℰcsubscriptℰ𝑐\\mathcal{E}_{c}\nthe locus is an ellipse interior to ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} and touching it at a point. If P𝑃P is on ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} the locus is the union of a straight line and the line at infinity (degenerate hyperbola). An alternative proof to\nProposition 17 is to based on the fact that X36subscript𝑋36X_{36} and X80subscript𝑋80X_{80} are isogonal conjugates : Over 𝒯∗superscript𝒯\\mathcal{T}^{*}, the locus of X36subscript𝑋36X_{36} is a line since X80subscript𝑋80X_{80} is stationary on ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}, Proposition 15. Secondly, referring to Figure 17 (bottom right) and Figure 19: Over 𝒯∗superscript𝒯\\mathcal{T}^{*}, the locus of X59subscript𝑋59X_{59} is an ellipse interior to ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} and touching it at a point. X59subscript𝑋59X_{59} is the isogonal conjugate of X11subscript𝑋11X_{11} , which is stationary on the incircle over 𝒯∗superscript𝒯\\mathcal{T}^{*}.\n∎ Furthermore, let I∗superscript𝐼I^{*} denote the touch-point between the elliptic locus of X59subscript𝑋59X_{59} (over 𝒯∗superscript𝒯\\mathcal{T}^{*}) and ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}. When the Poncelet triangle is an isosceles, i.e., one of its vertices is I∗superscript𝐼I^{*}, X59subscript𝑋59X_{59} is at I∗superscript𝐼I^{*}. When the Poncelet triangle is an equilateral, X59subscript𝑋59X_{59} ‘blows up’ at a major vertex of its locus.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: 𝒯gsubscript𝒯𝑔\\mathcal{T}_{g} be a family of Poncelet triangles interscribed between two generic conics ℰ,ℰcℰsubscriptℰ𝑐\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{E}_{c}.
