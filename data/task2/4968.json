      "content": "Paper Title: Layer-wise shared attention network on dynamical system perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the proposed DIA-LSTM and DIA-LSTM (Light) with seven existing self-attention modules, including SE¬†[ref]9, ECA¬†[ref]23, CBAM¬†[ref]10, SRM¬†, SPA¬†, SEM¬†, SPEM¬† on four datasets for image classification. These five datasets are CIFAR10¬†, CIFAR100¬†, STL-10¬† and miniImageNet¬†, and the details of these datasets are listed in Table V. For CIFAR10/100 and STL-10, ResNet164¬†, WRN52-4¬†, and ResNeXt101,8√ó\\times32¬† are used as the backbone models. The training settings of the experiments with respect to ResNet164 is the same as Table III. The settings of the other two backbones follow the settings in . In our experiments, we conduct the statistical test, i.e., the two-sample Student‚Äôs t-test, to test the difference between the accuracies of the DIA-LSTM and other models. The significance level Œ±ùõº\\alpha is set to 0.05. If the p-value is smaller than Œ±ùõº\\alpha, there is a statistically different performance between the tested model and DIA-LSTM. And if the accuracy of DIA-LSTM is larger than a self-attention module, then it means that our DIA-LSTM has a significant improvement. In Table IV, DIA-LSTM improves the testing accuracy significantly over the original networks and consistently compared with other existing self-attention modules for different datasets and backbone. Specifically, on the CIFAR10, DIA-LSTM achieves the classification accuracies at 95.03%, 96.18% and 96.44% for the backbone ResNet164, WRN52-4 and ResNeXt101,8√ó\\times32, respectively. Meanwhile, DIA-LSTM with different ‚ÄúOrg‚Äù\nmodels exceeds their baseline models, at about 1.63%, 0.49%,\n0.70% improvements, respectively.\nAlthough the performance improvement of WRN52-4 and ResNeXt101,8√ó\\times32 is not as much as that of ResNet164, their ‚ÄúOrg‚Äù can already achieve good performance on CIFAR10, so these improvements are also considerable.\nMoreover, on CIFAR100, DIA-LSTM achieves the classification accuracies at 77.09%, 81.02% and 82.60% for the backbone ResNet164, WRN52-4 and ResNeXt101,8√ó\\times32, respectively, which can achieve the best or second best performance among all model in Table IV. Since all the p-value in Table IV are smaller than 0.05, the results obtained by DIA-LSTM are all statistically significant. Furthermore, the lightweight version of DIA-LSTM, i.e., DIA-LSTM (Light), performs the competitive result with respect to DIA-LSTM and has much smaller parameters. Moreover, in our implementation on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, some self-attention modules sometimes suffer from performance degradation, which means these modules may not work in some settings. However, DIA-LSTM can achieve good enough performance under different backbones and datasets, which indicates our methods have the potential for consistent performance improvements across different settings. In Table IV, for STL-10 dataset, DIA-LSTM also obtained the best\nresults with ResNet164 and WRN52-4, which achieves the classification accuracies at 85.92% and 89.29%, respectively. Due to the high resolution of the images, the classification task on STL-10 is more difficult than that on CIFAR10/100. The experiments in Table IV show that DIA-LSTM can also achieve good performance on such tasks, which again illustrates the effectiveness of our method. In Table VII, we consider ResNet34, ResNet50,and ResNet18 as backbone. The experiments on the mini-ImageNet dataset are also verified 15 times with random seeds and\nthe mean value, the standard deviations of the classification\naccuracies and the p-values are reported. For mini-Imagenet dataset in Table VII, DIA-LSTM with the ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet18 models perform the best (or second best) and respectively achieve the top-1 accuracies of 79.84%, 81.37% and 78.88%. Compared with the corresponding ‚ÄúOrg‚Äù models, the models based on the proposed DIA-LSTM improve\nthe performance by a large margin. Moreover, from a statistical point of view, DIA-LSTM achieves significant performance improvement on the mini-ImageNet dataset, as the p-values in Table VII are all smaller than 0.05.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We compare the proposed DIA-LSTM and DIA-LSTM (Light) with seven existing self-attention modules, including SE¬†[ref]9, ECA¬†[ref]23, CBAM¬†[ref]10, SRM¬†, SPA¬†, SEM¬†, SPEM¬† on four datasets for image classification.
