      "content": "Paper Title: Analysis of Loss and Crosstalk Noise in MZI-based Coherent Silicon Photonic Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNonlinear activation functions are an integral part of deep neural networks due to the essential need for the realization of the complex nonlinear relationship between the inputs and outputs of the SP-NNs 4. NAUs are responsible to trigger a single activation at the end of each layer’s output and pass the output to the input of the next layer.\nNAUs can be implemented electronically , optoelectronically 4, or optically , each with different costs. High power consumption and latency as well as the need for lasers because of the need for multiple E-O and O-E conversions can be named as limitations related to electronically implemented NAUs. Moreover, very large waveguide lengths and high optical power must be used for optical NAUs due to the weak nonlinearity of photonic platforms 4 [ref]33.\nOptoelectronic NAUs presented in 4  show great promise as alternatives to electronic ones due to the ability to implement an arbitrary nonlinear response via self-intensity modulation (e.g., MZI-based electro-optical modulators) of the input optical signal. Note that research on optical NAUs is still ongoing. Therefore, in most cases, optoelectronic or electronic NAU are used in SP-NNs. The schematic diagram of the optoelectronic NAU considered in our work to realize ReLU-like activation response is shown in Fig. 5. The optical signal at each output of the OIU (OiNsubscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁O_{i_{N}}) will pass through a directional coupler with a cross-over coupling coefficient of α𝛼\\alpha (α=𝛼absent\\alpha= 0.1 in this paper, see Table I). The larger portion of the split power (1−α​OiN1𝛼subscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁\\sqrt{1-\\alpha}O_{i_{N}}) will go through an intensity modulation using an MZI-based electro-optical modulator (see Fig. 5). The remaining portion of the input optical power (α​OiN𝛼subscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁\\sqrt{\\alpha}O_{i_{N}}) is used to drive the MZI-based optical modulator used in the NAU 4, based on the following principle: the optical signal α​OiN𝛼subscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁\\sqrt{\\alpha}O_{i_{N}} routed in the upper branch enters a photodetector (PD) with the responsivity of ℜ\\Re (A/W)—ℜ×Pi​n=IP​Dsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑛subscript𝐼𝑃𝐷\\Re\\times P_{in}=I_{PD} for an ideal PD where IP​Dsubscript𝐼𝑃𝐷I_{PD} is the PD’s photocurrent—followed by a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a gain of GT​I​Asubscript𝐺𝑇𝐼𝐴G_{TIA}, to apply a gain to the output of the PD and convert the PD’s photocurrent to a voltage output. The output of the TIA will then goes through a signal conditioning unit (H(.)H(.)) to apply an arbitrary function to the output voltage of the TIA. In our analysis, we used the identity function H​(ℜ⁡GT​I​A​α​OiN)=ℜ⁡GT​I​A​α​OiN𝐻subscript𝐺𝑇𝐼𝐴𝛼subscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁subscript𝐺𝑇𝐼𝐴𝛼subscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁H(\\Re G_{TIA}\\sqrt{\\alpha}O_{i_{N}})=\\Re G_{TIA}\\sqrt{\\alpha}O_{i_{N}} for the sake of simplicity as the conditioning unit.\nFinally, an additional bias voltage (Vbsubscript𝑉𝑏V_{b}) and the output of the conditioning unit will be used to drive the MZI-based electro-optical intensity modulator in the lower branch. The ideal nonlienarity (f​(OiN)𝑓subscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁f(O_{i_{N}})) of the MZI-based optoelectronic NAU depicted in Fig. 5 can be mathematically modeled as  4: Here, Vπsubscript𝑉𝜋V_{\\pi} is the voltage that is required to impose a π𝜋\\pi phase shift in the MZI-based intensity modulator in the optoelectronic NAU. A ReLU-like nonlinear activation response can be realized by setting Vb=Vπsubscript𝑉𝑏subscript𝑉𝜋V_{b}=V_{\\pi} in the formulation proposed in (6). Note that in the activation function modeled in (6) and  4, the effect of optical loss and crosstalk noise from the OIU unit, PD’s sensitivity, shot noise, dark current (output current of the PD in the absence of any optical signal), and optical insertion loss of the DC and MZI in the NAU architecture are not considered. To update (6) for analyzing the effect of optical loss and crosstalk noise in SP-NNs when optoelectronic NAUs are used,\nwe can replace OiNsubscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁O_{i_{N}} in (6) with I​LO​I​U⋅G⋅(OiN+X​Pi​(θe​r​r))⋅𝐼subscript𝐿𝑂𝐼𝑈𝐺subscript𝑂subscript𝑖𝑁𝑋subscript𝑃𝑖subscript𝜃𝑒𝑟𝑟IL_{OIU}\\cdot G\\cdot(O_{i_{N}}+XP_{i}(\\theta_{err})). Note that in these formulations, G𝐺G and the loss values are considered in terms of power amplification and attenuation coefficient. Moreover, θe​r​rsubscript𝜃𝑒𝑟𝑟\\theta_{err} is taking into account the phase of the crosstalk noise at the output of the OIU unit. Using this approach, we can write the input of the optoelectronic NAU unit including the optical loss and crosstalk from OIU (OiN′subscriptsuperscript𝑂′subscript𝑖𝑁O^{\\prime}_{i_{N}}) as : The output photocurrent of the PD with a responsivity of ℜ\\Re and shot noise of Is​h​o​tsubscript𝐼𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑡I_{shot} and dark current of Id​a​r​ksubscript𝐼𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘I_{dark} can be modeled as: where Is​h​o​t=2​q​Ii​n2​ℜ⁡Bsubscript𝐼𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑡2𝑞superscriptsubscript𝐼𝑖𝑛2𝐵I_{shot}=\\sqrt{2qI_{in}^{2}\\Re B} in which B𝐵B is the PD’s bandwidth and q=1.60×10−19𝑞1.60superscript1019q=1.60\\times 10^{-19} C is the electronic charge . The output photocurrent then enters the TIA with the gain of GT​I​Asubscript𝐺𝑇𝐼𝐴G_{TIA} and will be converted to an amplified voltage VGsubscript𝑉𝐺V_{G} according to: Keeping the assumption of VH=H​(VGT​I​A)=VGT​I​Asubscript𝑉𝐻𝐻subscript𝑉subscript𝐺𝑇𝐼𝐴subscript𝑉subscript𝐺𝑇𝐼𝐴V_{H}=H(V_{G_{TIA}})=V_{G_{TIA}}, we can systematically model the activation function response using an MZI-based optoelectronic intensity modulator mentioned in  4 under optical loss and crosstalk noise from the OIU unit as: where Here, we also assumed that Vb=VHsubscript𝑉𝑏subscript𝑉𝐻V_{b}=V_{H} to realize ReLU-like activation response and the output photocurrent of the PD is considered to be zero (IP​D=0subscript𝐼𝑃𝐷0I_{PD}=0) for OiN2′≤SP​DO_{i_{N}}^{{}^{\\prime}2}\\leq S_{PD}, where SP​Dsubscript𝑆𝑃𝐷S_{PD} stands for PD sensitivity (the minimum detectable optical power by the PD). In (10), Xm​o​dsubscript𝑋𝑚𝑜𝑑X_{mod} is the optical crosstalk coefficient related to the MZI-based electro-optical modulator, Lm​o​dsubscript𝐿𝑚𝑜𝑑L_{mod} is its insertion loss, and θm​o​dsubscript𝜃𝑚𝑜𝑑\\theta_{mod} is\nthe phase of the optical crosstalk noise from the MZI in the intensity modulator in the optoelectronic NAU .\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: related to electronically implemented NAUs.
