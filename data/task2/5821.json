      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Learning and Explaining Indirect Causal Effects in Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning Structural Causal Models:\nLearning the structural causal model (SCM) is a core component of tasks in causal inference, including causal effect estimation¬†, and counterfactual generation¬†. In a work possibly closest to our work,¬† propose the learning of neural causal models (NCM) utilizing the underlying causal graph as an inductive bias, with a specific emphasis on identifying and learning ground truth causal effects. However, our objective in this effort is different from NCM; our focus lies in the causal effects pertaining to an NN model, primarily designed to enhance predictive accuracy. Our methodology remains applicable even when only partial knowledge of the underlying causal graph is accessible. Explainability: In addition to promoting transparency in decision-making processes, the elucidation of NN models serves several purposes, including the identification of concealed biases present in data¬†[ref]1, the revelation of fairness¬†, the debugging¬† and enhancement of models through explanation-based regularizers¬†  [ref]17. Numerous existing methods for explaining NN models quantify the impact of input features on model outputs using saliency maps¬†  , local model approximations¬†, approximations of output gradients with respect to inputs¬† , Shapley values¬†[ref]22 , among others.\nIn this work, we focus on the causal effects of input features on output in an NN model, which can be very useful in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, aerospace, law, and defense.\nSee Appendix ¬ßI to understand further why causal explanations are important through a real-world example. Causal Explanations:\nBy considering an NN as an SCM, assuming that input features are dùëëd-separated from each other,¬† proposed a post-hoc causal explanation method to find the average causal effects (ACE) in a trained NN. However, the assumption of independence among inputs limits their ability to consider indirect causal effects. Subsequent studies by¬†   7  have followed ACE as defined therein to quantify the learned causal effects. Other causal explanation methods utilize counterfactuals to analyze model behavior under semantically meaningful changes applied to inputs¬†    5  . However, these methods are commonly employed for qualitative analysis of the model rather than computing causal effects. Direct and Indirect Explanations:\nAmong existing efforts that explicitly investigate interactions among input variables while computing explanations for NN models, prominent methods are those based on Shapley values¬†[ref]22. For instance, in the context of handling missing features in Shapley explanations, it is discouraged to sample from the conditional distribution (rather than the marginal distribution) because the inputs are independent with respect to the causal graph of the NN¬†. While¬† considers both direct and indirect effects motivated by the direct and indirect pathways in the underlying causal graph, even if input neurons of the NN model being explained do not have causal connections, its focus is on providing Shapley values that may not necessarily be causal effects obtained from the adjustment formula (see Appendix ¬ßB). In this study, we consider input feature interactions while learning and explaining causal effects in NNs. Our approach explicitly estimates and preserves indirect causal effects in an NN model. While¬†[ref]17 discusses direct and total causal effects for NN model explanations, it does not focus on indirect causal effects. The work most closely related to ours is presented in¬†7, which examined both direct and indirect causal effects in Transformer-based language models for capturing gender bias. However, that study conducted a post-hoc analysis of such models for a different objective, whereas our proposed method represents an ante-hoc approach to learning and explaining both direct and indirect causal effects. Other related work, such as concept-based explanation methods, are discussed in Appendix ¬ßG.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In addition to promoting transparency in decision-making processes, the elucidation of NN models serves several purposes, including the identification of concealed biases present in data¬†[ref]1, the revelation of fairness¬†, the debugging¬† and enhancement of models through explanation-based regularizers¬†  [ref]17.
