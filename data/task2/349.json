      "content": "Paper Title: Data Engineering for Data Analytics: A Classification of the Issues, and Case Studies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe literature on data engineering is extensive with many works\naddressing general problems on the field, while others only focusing on a\nspecific data wrangling issue. We discuss here a number of other\nreview papers on general data engineering. The authors in  divide data cleaning problems into schema level\nand instance level. At the schema level the focus is on integrity\nconstraints (which fall under our anomaly detection heading), while\nthe instance level contains problems such as missing data,\ncanonicalization, data integration, data description, etc. Note that\nthese instance level issues are not systematically categorized in the\npaper, but only listed as examples (see e.g., their Table 2). The authors\nalso distinguish single-source and multi-source problems, although\nthe main new issue that they identify for multiple sources is that of\nrecord linkage. The CRISP-DM framework of  highlights two\nphases relating to data engineering, which they call data\nunderstanding and data preparation. Their data understanding phase\nincludes data description (similar to our data\ndictionary heading), and verification of\ndata quality (which relates to our headings of missing data and\nanomalies), as well as data collection and data exploration. Their\ndata preparation phase includes data selection and cleaning tasks\n(including the handling of missing data), data integration, and\ntasks we describe under feature engineering including\nthe formatting of data for modelling tools, and constructing\nderived features. Our descriptions in Section 3\nare more detailed than those provided in the CRISP-DM paper. A taxonomy of “dirty data” is provided in .\nAt the highest level this taxonomy is split between missing data (their\nclass 1), versus non-missing data (class 2). Class 2 is further broken\ndown into 2.1 “wrong data” (due e.g. to violation of integrity\nconstraints, and to failures of deduplication), and 2.2 “not wrong,\nbut unusable data” (which include issues of canonicalization and\nrecord linkage). In our view the choice of a top-level split on\nmissing/non-missing data creates a rather unbalanced taxonomy. Note\nalso that the authors do not provide much discussion of the topics\nfalling under our data organization heading. In [ref]48, the authors refined the notion of data readiness\nlevels introduced by , to provide levels C\n(conceive), B (believe) and A (analyze). Level C relates mainly to our\ndata organization issue, especially data parsing and data\nintegration. Their level B mainly covers topics falling under our data\nquality heading (missing data, canonicalization) along with data\ndictionary and data integration (deduplication) topics from data\norganization. Their level A includes mainly feature engineering\nissues, but also includes outlier detection (which we class under\nanomaly detection) and a semantic description of features (see our\ndata dictionary heading). Note also that our paper provides a\nfuller discussion of the issues; in [ref]48 the\ntopics mentioned under levels A, B and C get only one paragraph each. In , the authors survey the task of data profiling,\nwhich is defined (following ) as “the activity of\ncreating small but informative summaries of a database”. This is\nclearly related to our data dictionary task, but they also\ndiscuss detecting multivariate dependencies, which we\nmainly cover under the heading of anomaly detection. The identification of various problems as described above leads to the\nquestion of tools to help addressing them. We have pointed out various\ntools to address specific problems in Section 3. However,\nthere is also a need for systems that allow the integration of\nmultiple individual tools to guide data scientists during the\ndata engineering process.  provide a survey of\nintelligent assistants for data analysis. One prominent (commercial)\nsystem is Trifacta , which is based on preceding systems\nsuch as Wrangler . It provides a\nsystem for interactive data transformations that suggests applicable\ntransformations based on the current interaction with the\ndata .\nWrangler provides common data transformations such as mapping\noperations, fold operations, sorting or aggregations among\nothers. It also infers statistical data types and\nhigher-level semantic types. Another tool is Data Civiilzer\n which offers functionality including\nentity matching across multiple heterogeneous sources, handling missing\nvalues, and canonicalization.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: split on\nmissing/non-missing data creates a rather unbalanced taxonomy. Note\nalso that the authors do not provide much discussion of the topics\nfalling under our data organization heading.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
