      "content": "Paper Title: LoginMEA: Local-to-Global Interaction Network for Multi-modal Entity Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a prominent data structure for representing factual knowledge in the form of triples, i.e., <entity, relation, entity>, where two entities are connected through relations.\nMulti-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) further extend traditional KGs by introducing representative multi-modal information, such as visual images, attributes, and relational data [ref]21.\nAs a pivotal task for MMKG integration, multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities between two MMKGs.\nAs shown in Figure 1(a), the model requires to identify entity Oriental_Pearl_Tower in MMKG-1 is equivalent to Oriental_Pearl in MMKG-2, utilizing their multi-modal information.\nSuch a task can benefit several downstream applications , such as recommendation systems  and question answering . For MMEA, a crucial problem is how to exploit the consistency of equivalent entities between different MMKGs with their multi-modal information in relational graph structures [ref]21.\nTo this end, most methods   [ref]8 0 firstly encode uni-modal features, and then fuse them to obtain joint entity embedding for alignment.\nThey can be roughly manifested into two groups (shown in Figure 2): The first group of methods [ref]20   [ref]8, namely graph-as-modality, treat the graph structure as a special modality of entities, and separately encode entity uni-modal information (i.e., structures, images, attributes, relations).\nHowever, these methods cannot capture valuable relational associations between entity images without graph structures.\nAs shown in Figure 1(b), in the MMKG, entity Oriental_Pearl_Tower is located in Shanghai, and their images of entities reflect this LocatedIn relation.\nSeparately encoding the uni-modal features without graph structures would neglect these beneficial relational associations, which generates suboptimal uni-modal embeddings, and impedes the final joint multi-modal entity embeddings. Another group of methods  0, namely graph-upon-modality, firstly encode uni-modal information (including images, attributes and relations), and then refine these uni-modal information with graph structures.\nHowever, there also exist relations that cannot be reflected in the entity images.\nAs shown in Figure 1(c), the images of Elon_Musk and Tesla_Inc cannot reflect the CeoOf relation.\nDirectly building the relations between images would introduce unnecessary relational inductive bias , leading to unstable performance in MMEA. Therefore, a natural idea is to fuse multi-modal information firstly to obtain holistic entity semantics, and then refine them with relational graph structures (as Figure 2(c)).\nIn this sense, the uni-modal information (e.g., images) is adaptively fused and accordingly refined by relations.\nHowever, there are still two vital challenges requiring further design:\n(1) How to fuse local different modality information of an entity considering its multi-modal interactions?\nExisting multi-modal fusion mostly employs vector concatenation [ref]21   or weighted attention mechanism [ref]20    .\nNevertheless, these methods only considers the importance of modality features, lacking multifarious feature interactions in entity multi-modal information.\nFor instance, Oriental_Pearl_Tower has interactions between visual architectural cues and attribute details (e.g., height, function), ensuring its identification as a television tower.\n(2) How to build global relational interactions between entities, while enhancing relational consistency between MMKGs?\nConventional MMEA studies  [ref]8 mostly employ vanilla graph neural networks (GNNs) 3  that can hardly capture relations between entity embeddings.\nRelational GNNs  8 can be promising but may struggle in building relational consistency between different graph structures in the embedding space .\nSince structural information is reported  [ref]8 as pivotal information for MMEA results, it requires further design for learning relational graph structures. To this end, we propose a novel Local-to-global interaction network for Multi-modal Entity Alignment, termed as LoginMEA111Our code is available at https://github.com/sutaoyu/LoginMEA, and the Supplemental Materials is also available there..\nParticularly, it first fuses local multi-modal interactions to generate holistic entity semantics, then refines them with global relational interactions of entity neighbors.\nTo fully fuse different modality information, we propose a local multi-modal interactive fusion module, which designs entity-specific adaptive weights and low-rank interactive fusion.\nCompared to existing methods [ref]20   [ref]8, this module discerns diverse weight impacts of different entity modality information and captures multifarious element-level modality feature interactions, allowing capability for building relational associations of uni-modal information between entities.\nBesides, we propose a global multi-modal interactive aggregation module, which adopts relational reflection graph attention networks to refine entity embeddings with entity neighbors.\nCompared to vanilla GNN-based methods  [ref]8, this module fully utilizes relational interactions between entities in the MMKG, and can retain relational consistency between different MMKGs.\nFinally, we adopt a contrastive alignment loss to train the overall model, which ensures the consistency of equivalent entities from different MMKGs to achieve the MMEA task.\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We investigate the relational associations between entities in their multi-modal information, and we propose a novel MMEA framework, LoginMEA. To our knowledge, we are the first to build relational graph structures upon holistic entities to leverage relational associations of multi-modal information in MMEA studies. We develop the LoginMEA framework with local-to-global interaction networks, which builds multi-modal interactions of entity information with local multi-modal interactive fusion, and builds global relational interactions between joint multi-modal entity embeddings with global multi-modal interactive aggregation. Experimental results and extensive analyses confirm our significant improvements in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods on 5 benchmark datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: through relations.\nMulti-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) further extend traditional KGs by introducing representative multi-modal information, such as visual images, attributes, and relational data [ref]21.\nAs a pivotal task for MMKG integration, multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities between two MMKGs.\nAs shown in Figure 1(a), the model requires to identify\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
