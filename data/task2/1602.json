      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Automated Visual Fault Detection by Combining a Biologically Plausible Model of Visual Attention with Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral options exist how to couple a visual attention model with a CNN as delineated in the introduction of this work, e.g.      [ref]23.\nThe classical approach is that attention selects a spatial region (region of interest, ROI [ref]17),\nwhich is subsequently passed to a classifier for later recognition.\nThis idea came up at first with the saliency models in the late 1990s, which select a ROI for a later classifier [ref]17. The classifier can of course today also be a CNN. Variations of this approach are the glimpse approach from Google , where a more modern neural network selects regions very swiftly (glimpses), which are then fed into a CNN. Alternatives to the ROI approach would be other developments like proto-objects, where regions are formed like an object . They eliminate the drawback of the ROI approach that the region has always the shape of a rectangle, and hence may not fit a more naturally shaped object. Another alternative would be that visual attention modulates the neuronal response (amplify or suppress), which is closer to the processing in the brain .\nThis approach starts to be utilized in the deep learning community to a small degree (e.g. [ref]23).\nThe idea is to feed all area into the CNN, but enhance neuronal responses in the attended region, and suppress all neurons in other places. The approach has the advantage that it can shape the region more clearly. Additionally, the amplification and suppression is closer to the neuronal processing of the brain ( , original data e.g. ), because attention in the brain operates multiplicatively such as multiplicatively enhancing or suppressing neurons. We consider also to utilize this novel modulation approach, but finally decided against it: i) The modulation approach requires to feed entire images and not only the ROIs into the CNN. As the images are relatively large in our application (up to 1 000 pixels across), this would result in a large CNN and hence in a reduced processing speed, as well as, in a lot of free parameters and overfitting (we have only a few data here). On the other hand, the street-showing ROIs in our case have a resolution of only 400×6040060400\\times 60 pixels, which is many times smaller than the entire chip image. ii)\nThe advantage of the newer approach is that the region can be shaped more clearly and flexibly. However, this big gain is in our wafer application of not much benefit, as the most structures in our image material are anyway rectangles. iii)\nDespite the approach’s closer similarity to the brain’s functionality, the neuroscientific review literature also reveals that the effects of attention are much more complex than a simple ‘enhance attended’ or ‘suppress all others’  . As we aim for a strong biological plausibility, we would not like to ignore these effects lighthearted, and rather aim for a separate research publication investigating how a deep neuronal network can be integrated into an attention model or vice versa in a biologically plausible way. iv) Finally, we have a complicated task-instruction here. The workers’ instruction is to check the cuts for potential faults, which is of course realized by looking at the cuts (i.e. streets). Hence, we have applied attention to the streets here.\nHowever, not a street alone need to be checked for cracks, but rather also the close region next to it, ranging from the close surrounding of the street over the street-chip border towards the inside of the chip.\nTherefore, the workers’ task requires to transfer from the attended structure (streets) to another spatial area. As it is not really known how such task instructions are realized in the brain, we do not know how to implement this in the attention model. The region of interest approach instead solves this problem out-of-the-box. Therefore, we evaluate it is better to use the region of interest approach, which solves the problem nicely and has advantages in our case.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Several options exist how to couple a visual attention model with a CNN as delineated in the introduction of this work, e.g.      [ref]23.\nThe classical approach is that attention selects a spatial region (region of interest, ROI [ref]17),\nwhich is subsequently passed to a classifier for later recognition.\nThis idea came up at\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
