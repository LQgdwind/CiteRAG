      "content": "Paper Title: Seeking Subjectivity in Visual Emotion Distribution Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost of the earlier work in VEA focused on the design of emotional features, often inspired by the psychology and art theory    [ref]29.\nMachajdik et al.  extracted and combined specific image features, including color, texture, composition and content, from affective images to predict emotions.\nAdjective Noun Pairs (ANPs) was proposed by Borth et al. , where adjectives indicated emotions while nouns corresponded to detectable objects/scenes.\nTo explore the relationship between emotions and artistic principles, Zhao et al.  extracted a series of principle-of-art-based emotional features, i.e., balance, emphasis, harmony, variety, gradation, and movement.\nZhao et al. [ref]29 further proposed a multi-graph learning framework, which consisted of low-level features from elements-of-art, mid-level features from principles-of-art, as well as high-level semantic features from ANPs and facial expressions.\nThough these methods have proven effective on small-scale datasets, it is still tricky for hand-crafted features to cover all crucial features when encountering large-scale datasets. Recently, viewing the great success of deep learning networks, researchers in VEA have adopted Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict visual emotions, which also brought significant performance boost [ref]30 [ref]31       .\nChen et al. [ref]30 constructed DeepSentiBank based on their previous SentiBank , by replacing the traditional SVM classifier with a deep CNN.\nA novel progressive CNN architecture (PCNN) was proposed by You et al. [ref]31, which utilized half a million images with noisy labels from the web.\nRao et al.  proposed a multi-level deep representation network (MldrNet) to predict visual emotions from multi-level, including low-level, aesthetic and semantic features.\nAttention mechanism was first applied to VEA by You et al. , where emotion-relevant regions were discovered automatically.\nYang et al.  implemented off-the-shelf detection tools to find affective regions, serving as the local branch, which was further combined with the global branch to make the final prediction.\nMoreover, A weakly supervised coupled network (WSCNet)  was further constructed by Yang et al., where emotion regions were discovered through attention mechanism in an end-to-end network.\nBy combining content information together with style information, Zhang et al.  predicted visual emotions with discriminative representations.\nRecently, a stimuli-aware VEA network was proposed by Yang et al. , which considered the emotion evocation process in VEA for the first time.\nFurther, Yang et al.  constructed a novel Scene-Object interreLated Visual Emotion Reasoning network (SOLVER), aiming at inferring visual emotions from the interactions between objects and scenes.\nIn reality, since emotions are ambiguous and subjective, people’s emotional experiences towards one image may be different.\nBesides, each emotional experience may involve multiple emotions.\nTherefore, it is more reasonable to address VEA in a label distribution learning paradigm than a single label classification task.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Most of the earlier work in VEA focused on the design of emotional features, often inspired by the psychology and art theory    [ref]29.\nMachajdik et al.  extracted and combined specific image features, including color, texture, composition and content, from affective images to predict emotions.\nAdjective Noun Pairs (ANPs)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
