      "content": "Paper Title: SVDE: Scalable Value-Decomposition Exploration for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)  [ref]2 has made great progress such as in solving sparse rewards  , incorporating game theory and agent communication [ref]5 [ref]6 , and combining relationships between agents .\nHowever, there are two unsolvable problems in MARL.\nFirst is the data-efficiency problem under the framework of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) , which is mainly caused by poor sample generation and an unbalanced sample distribution in the replay buffer.\nThe learning of MARL requires large samples, which is time-consuming due to the high cost of interacting with the environment.\nThe replay buffer of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is always stuffed by trajectories of various qualities, the high quality sample can hardly be selected for training, which makes convergence slower.\nThere is also the exploration and exploitation problem 0 1 2 in MARL.\nAs the number of agents scales up, the dimensionality of the joint state-action space grows exponentially, which makes exploration more difficult3.\nAs a result, the agent will easily fall into local optima. There are many efficient exploration methods in single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL), such as environment reset and recording action paths in an archive 4.\nDue to the exponential growth of the state-action space, these methods cannot be simply migrated to MARL 5.\nDistributed training frameworks such as IMPALA 6 and SEED 7 only support SARL and are unsuitable for MARL.\nAlthough Ray 8 supports some specific MARL algorithms, it does not help the agent better explore the environment and efficiently use sample data. Value-decomposition is a popular method in MARL.\nBy decomposing the joint state-action space into local observation-action spaces, value-decomposition can significantly reduce the difficulty of multi-agent learning. For example,\nVDN 9 decomposes the joint action-value function into the sum of multiple independent agent action-value functions.\nQMIX  and WQMIX  relax the assumption to a nonlinear monotonic combination of local action-value functions, and are most related to our method.\nBut they can only perform passive exploration (such as ϵ−limit-fromitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy), and cannot effectively and actively explore the environment.\nSome recent work like QTRAN  and MAVEN  follows the way of value-decomposition and further improves the ability of multi-agent systems.\nHowever, these methods still cannot solve the above problems. We propose a scalable value-decomposition exploration (SVDE) algorithm that has a scalable training mechanism, intrinsic reward design, and explorative experience replay. First, the scalable training mechanism in SVDE adapts to cooperative MARL, which collects a large number of samples in a MapReduce manner .\nIt models the general MARL learning problem as three processes: rollout, serving, and training, and contains four main modules: replay buffer, actor, worker, and a centralized learner.\nThe scalability of workers and actors can make full use of computing resources, and such a function greatly expands the parallelization of sample generation.\nThrough the three processes and four modules, learning and training can be decoupled, which accelerates the convergence of the joint Q-function. Second, the intrinsic reward design enables the agent to perform effective exploration when the environment only returns a team reward, i.e., an individual agent does not receive its own reward.\nIt worth noting that we combine the intrinsic reward of curiosity with the value-decomposition method.\nCuriosity rewards encourage agents to generate diversified trajectories, which makes for better exploration behavior .\nBased on the value-decomposition method, each agent can calculate intrinsic rewards only based on its local observations, without considering the influence of the exploration behavior on the joint action of multi-agents. Third, SVDE uses explorative experience replay to make better use of training samples.\nWhen selecting samples from the replay buffer, different from other priority experience replay (PER) , explorative experience replay considers the “freshness” of samples as well as the priority.\nWe adopt an Upper Confidence Tree (UCT)-like method to filter and replace the outdated samples from the replay buffer in time, so as to further force the model to keep exploring all the time. In multiple maps of StarCraft II, SVDE has achieved the best experimental results compared with popular MARL algorithms, with an average win rate exceeding 90% on all maps.\nAnd the results from data-efficiency and sample distribution experiments fully demonstrate the acceleration of the scalable training mechanism for sample collection and policy convergence.\nMoreover, our ablation experiments show both the necessity of intrinsic reward design and explorative experience replay in order to explore comprehensively and learn better strategies.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)  [ref]2 has made great progress such as in solving sparse rewards  , incorporating game theory and agent communication [ref]5 [ref]6 , and combining relationships between agents .\nHowever, there are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
