The earliest works of heterogeneous NE study knowledge graphs. These methods, such as TransE [ref]37, train embeddings by learning a scoring function measuring how accurate embeddings representing the heterogeneous triplets. Later a number of methods extending previous proximity-preserving homogeneous NE methods. Metapath2vec  and HIN2vec  extend DeepWalk [ref]6 and preserve node proximity with random walks based on meta-paths. PTE [ref]49 and AspEm  extend LINE  by designing edge-type based and aspect-based proximities, respectively. Recently, deep-learning based methods have become the main branch of heterogeneous NE. For example, R-GCN  applies multiple GCNs  to learn the edge heterogeneity. HDGI , an unsupervised version of HAN on which the contrastive architecture of DGI  is grafted. It uses both meta-path based neighbor-level and semantic-level attention mechanisms to aggregate deep heterogeneous proximity information. HGT  uses a series of attention mechanisms to reconstruct the typed node pair in each triplet . HetSAGNN  designs a type-aware attention layer to aggregate the embeddings of different types of nodes locating in different space. It trains the embeddings through multi-task learning. To our best knowledge, exsiting heterogeneous\nNE methods except node2bits cannot capture the highly diverse heterostructures. Node2bits extracts structural features for each type of neighbors sampled by random walks and generate embeddings via hashing methods. Its design for efficiency leads to low fineness on capturing heterostructures.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: NE methods on heterogeneous network are mainly devised for capturing the node proximity .
