      "content": "Paper Title: Asynchronous Curriculum Experience Replay: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for UAV Autonomous Motion Control in Unknown Dynamic Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nER, a process of storing past sequential experiences and sampling them to reuse for updating policies, was first explored by Lin  in 1992 to speed up the training process. More recently, ER has seen widespread adoption, since it has been shown to be instrumental in the breakthrough success of DRL 7. This new area of intense research has attracted many studies to explore how ER can influence the performance of off-policy DRL algorithms [ref]36 [ref]37. ER is always a fixed-size experience pool that holds the most recent experiences collected by the agent. This first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer brings two advantages: 1) uniform sampling breaks the correlation between experiences to improve the stability of the policy; 2) the large-capacity buffer ensures the possibility of learning from long-term experiences, thereby avoiding ‚Äôcatastrophic forgetting‚Äô . In the ER of DQN, the uniform sampling policy results in all experiences having the same probability of being sampled, which ignores the importance of each experience. PER  differs from this and assigns the priority of the experience ùíÜisubscriptùíÜùëñ\\boldsymbol{e}_{i} in the experience pool according to its TD error: The sampling probability of ùíÜisubscriptùíÜùëñ\\boldsymbol{e}_{i} is defined as: where Dùê∑D is the capacity of the experience pool and Œ±‚àà ùõº01\\alpha\\in  is a constant to control the size of pjŒ±superscriptsubscriptùëùùëóùõºp_{j}^{\\alpha}. These ensure that the greater the TD error is, the higher the priority of the experience is and the greater the probability is that the experience can be sampled. To reduce the computational complexity of searching for experiences with higher priorities, PER adopts a ‚Äôsum-tree‚Äô structure to improve search efficiency and ensure the priority and diversity of the sampled experiences at the same time . Following the innovation of PER, Brittain  believed that the previous experiences leading to the important experiences with higher TD error should also be assigned higher priorities and proposed the prioritized sequence experience replay algorithm. In addition, some studies try to improve the PER algorithm from different perspectives. Some of them believed that TD error should not be the only criterion for measuring the importance of experience, and other indicators, such as reward  , difficulty  and the relevance between experiences and current state 2, should also be considered. Ren  first introduced CL into ER and proposed DCRL to use complexity and coverage penalties to control the experiences learned by the agent. These methods improved the convergence speed of PER to a certain extent, but they did not fundamentally overcome the limitations of the PER algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: to be instrumental in the breakthrough success of DRL 7.
