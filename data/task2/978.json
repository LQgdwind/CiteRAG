      "content": "Paper Title: Torch-Points3D: A Modular Multi-Task Framework for Reproducible Deep Learning on 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTorch-Points3D implements several convolution methods which present an interest in terms of performance or versatility: PointNet, RandLANet, KPConv, RS-CNN, and Minkowski Engine.\nThe PointNet-based architectures [ref]33  are the simplest point convolution methods, making them both easy to use and understand.\nThe convolution kernels for RandLANet  allows for efficient point clouds processing with a random sampling strategy. KPConv  proposes a kernel-based generalization of 2D convolution to 3D point clouds, and RS-CNN [ref]29 capture the complexity of local shapes by modeling spatial relationships between points. Minkowski Engine  relies on a fine-grained voxelization of point clouds, efficiently processed with sparse-convolutions. These convolution schemes can be integrated into a backbone network architecture for semantic segmentation or object classification for example. We propose several such backbone, from a simple U-Net, to a multi-scale architecture, and more modern ResNet-like architectures as proposed in  or . Finally, the framework also implements task-specific heads for object detection and Panoptic segmentation. In aprticular, VoteNet [ref]32 uses Hough voting to regress bounding boxes on 3D point clouds, and PointGroup  uses a clustering scheme to perform instance segmentation. While the compact configuration format described in the last section is designed to make U-Net-like networks easier, users can also easily define their own types of configuration file and model architectures in Torch-Points3D. For example, VoteNet and PointGroup use custom configurations. Our configuration system is meant to be flexible, and existing configurations serve more as guides for newcomers than rigid templates.\nAt the time of writing, superpoint-based   and multi-modal methods (eg. 3D points + images ) are not yet implemented. However, we plan to add both in the near-future.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: implements several convolution methods which present an interest in terms of performance or versatility: PointNet, RandLANet, KPConv, RS-CNN, and Minkowski Engine.\nThe PointNet-based architectures [ref]33  are the simplest point convolution methods, making them both easy to use and understand.\nThe convolution kernels for RandLANet  allows for efficient point clouds processing with a random\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
