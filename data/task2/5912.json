      "content": "Paper Title: How to choose your best allies for a transferable attack?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe threat analysis related to adversarial examples usually considers two scenarios: the white box assumption where the attacker knows the internals of the target model, and the black box assumption where he does not but has limited access to the target. White box attacks are now performing very well in terms of Attack Success Rate and distortion. We distinguish two kinds of attacks: 1) attacks constrained by a distortion budget like PGD [ref]16 whose performance is measured by the ASR, and 2) attacks yielding almost surely an adversarial example like DeepFool [ref]19 and CW  whose performance is measured by the distortion.\nThe trend is to make them speed efficient as well with fewer computations of the gradient of the neural network, like FMN  and BP 5. Our paper also considers so-called decision-based black box attacks like GeoDA , SurFree , and RayS , where the attacker only sees the class predicted by the model, but not the confidence score, neither the probit nor the logit. A decision-based black box attack typically needs thousands of queries to find an adversarial example with a relatively low distortion, yet, much higher than with a white box attack.\nThis is the price the attacker has to pay when he does not know the target model. The transferable attacks, which pertain to the black box scenario, disrupt this last statement.\nThe assumption is that attacker knows another model, called source, trained for the same classification problem as the target. Yet, leading a white box attack on the source model with the hope that this adversarial example will also fool the target yields poor results because the adversarial perturbation is too specific to the source.\nModern transferable attacks increase the ASR by avoiding the overfitting of examples on the source.\nInput transformations have been purposed by DI 2, TI  and Admix .\nPapers    stabilized the gradient while   6 9 focus on the importance of intermediate features.\nThe combination of several methods has also been investigated 0 [ref]9.\nFor instance, TAIG [ref]9 uses input transformation, integrated gradients, and attention reduction. Ensemble-model attacks make the assumption that the attacker leverages not a single source but several source models.\nPaper  averages the logits of several sources and leads a white box attack on this aggregation of models, whereas 3 reduces model variance.\nThe main obstacle to these methods is the computational complexity.\nTo counteract this drawback, some methods design a specific ensemble of sources like ghost networks  or pruned network . This amounts to creating several sources without the need to compute the gradient of each model. All this literature uses the ASR as the figure of merit for a given distortion while our paper draws the full operating characteristic of ASR vs. distortion. Moreover, the performance of the transferability is compared neither to the white box nor the decision-based black box attack.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: the target.
