Bespoke Approximation of Multiplication-Accumulation and Activation Targeting Printed Multilayer Perceptrons\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, the design of complex systems based on flexible technologies has gained vast research interest.\nBriefly, in 2020 Ozer et al., fabricated a processing system for odour detection on flexible electronics¬†.\nWeller et al., fabricated a neuromorphic circuit based on the flexible EGFET technology that operates at 111V¬†.\nSimilarly, in 2021, ARM fabricated the first 32-bit processor on a flexible plastic technology\n¬†[ref]19.\nIn 2023 PragmatIC fabricated ML classifiers with a low area and power footprint on polyamide substrate using the 0.8Œºùúá\\mum FlexIC TFT technology¬†.\nHowever, these works do not leverage the hardware-efficiency of approximate computing while¬† [ref]19  do not consider a printed technology. Design methodologies that aim to shrink the size of neural networks and deploy them on FPGAs at the deep edge are introduced in¬†  .\nAlthough FPGAs support bespoke designs, they feature orders of magnitude higher computing capabilities compared to PE.\nApproximating arithmetic blocks for Deep Neural Networks have also been suggested as candidate solutions for the generation of low-power DNNs¬†.\nNevertheless, those methodologies target conventional, non-bespoke implementations and therefore are not suitable for printed applications. Targeting specifically printed ML classifiers, the authors in¬†   [ref]9 [ref]8 consider bespoke implementations.\n[ref]8 does not leverage approximate computing while [ref]8 and¬† mainly consider simple classifiers.\n[ref]9 introduced approximate printed ML circuits but approximated only the multiplications and then applied a generic gate-level pruning approximation.\nIn¬† the authors extend¬†[ref]9 by applying also voltage over-scaling.\nThe authors in¬† evaluate the impact of neural compression on printed MLPs but they presented only preliminary results.\nFinally,¬† approximates both the multiplication and accumulation.\nHowever,¬† applied only coarse-grain truncation on the accumulators, limiting thus the potential gains.\nTable¬†I summarizes relevant works on printed MLP circuits.\nBesides approximate computing techniques, stochastic computing has been suggested as a candidate approach to mitigate the excessive area and power overhead¬†.\nAlthough the stochastic schemes can yield significant area and power gains, they may also result in a high degradation in the classifier‚Äôs accuracy¬† and potentially increased classification latency. Our work differentiates from the state of the art as it combines the bespoke design paradigm along with a holistic approximation approach that considers approximate multiplication, accumulation, and activation.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: al., fabricated a neuromorphic circuit based on the flexible EGFET technology that operates at 111V¬†.\nSimilarly, in 2021, ARM fabricated the first 32-bit processor on a flexible plastic technology\n¬†[ref]19.\nIn 2023 PragmatIC fabricated ML classifiers with a low area and power footprint on polyamide substrate using the 0.8Œºùúá\\mum FlexIC TFT technology¬†.\nHowever, these works do not leverage the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
