The IRL class of solutions assumes the following MDP∖REsubscript𝑅𝐸\\setminus R_{E}: A set of states 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, with a distribution over starting states p​(s0)𝑝subscript𝑠0p(s_{0}). A set of actions 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}.

A set of demonstrated trajectories \n𝒟={⟨(s0i,a0i),…,(sT−1i,aT−1i)⟩i=1N}𝒟superscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑠0𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑎0𝑖…superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑇1𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑇1𝑖𝑖1𝑁\\mathcal{D}=\\left\\{\\left<(s_{0}^{i},a_{0}^{i}),...,(s_{T-1}^{i},a_{T-1}^{i})\\right>_{i=1}^{N}\\right\\} from the observed agent or expert. A discount factor γ∈[ref]0 𝛾01\\gamma\\in[ref]0  may be used to discount future rewards. The goal of IRL then is to learn the reward function REsubscript𝑅𝐸R_{E} that best explains the expert demonstrations. It is assumed that the demonstrations are perfectly observed and that the expert follows an optimal policy. While learning reward functions from data is appealing, the IRL problem is ill-posed since there are many reward functions under which the observed expert behavior is optimal  . An instance is a reward function that assigns 0 (or any constant value) for all selected actions; in such a case, any policy is optimal. Other main challenges are accurate inference, generalizability, the correctness of prior knowledge, and computational cost with an increase in problem complexity. To this end, several IRL proposals exist in the literature to mitigate the IRL challenges mentioned above . In recent times, the entropy optimization class of IRL methods has been widely used by researchers due to the maximum entropy’s goal to obtain an unbiased distribution of potential reward [ref]33   [ref]24. The intuition is that the solution that maximizes entropy violates the optimization constraints least and hence, least wrong. In the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) formulation, the probability of the expert’s trajectory is proportional to the exponential of the total reward [ref]33, where R​(τ)=∑(s,a)∈τr​(s,a)𝑅𝜏subscript𝑠𝑎𝜏𝑟𝑠𝑎R(\\tau)=\\sum_{(s,a)\\in\\tau}r(s,a) and r​(s,a)𝑟𝑠𝑎r(s,a) gives the reward for taking action a𝑎a in state s𝑠s.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: from the observed agent or expert. A discount factor γ∈[ref]0 𝛾01\\gamma\\in[ref]0  may be used to discount future rewards. The goal of IRL then is to learn the reward function REsubscript𝑅𝐸R_{E} that best explains the expert demonstrations.
