      "content": "Paper Title: Analyzing Multifiltering Functions Using Multiparameter Discrete Morse Theory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we were able to extend results in   and answer to some open problems therein. Notably, we presented GenerateMDM, an algorithm which, in addition to producing a gradient field as its predecessors Matching  and ComputeDiscreteGradient , may take as input any multifiltering function and computes a compatible mdm function that approximates it. Furthermore, the concept of (discrete) Pareto set was defined and linked to the critical simplices produced by GenerateMDM in order to shed light on some experimental results in . Moreover, we showed how the idea of critical components introduced in  translates into practice and adapted their definition to the applied setting. Still, some questions remain open. From a theoretical perspective, as shown in smooth and continuous settings   , the Pareto set of a vector filtering function is strongly related to the homological changes in the associated multifiltration. Thus, analogous connections could seemingly be made in our discrete setting. This could be addressed algebraically, by analyzing how the simplices in the Pareto set of a discrete multifiltering function are related in the associated multiparameter persistence modules 5, or dynamically, by considering a partition of level sets as a combinatorial multivector field 1. Otherwise, by restraining the problem to the study of discrete vector functions induced by a component-wise injective vertex map, we could instead consider a piecewise linear approach, using the concepts defined in  or  as a starting point. Besides, there is room to improve some computational aspects of GenerateMDM. For instance, we could adapt the algorithm to multifiltering functions defined on a cubical complex (see ) so that it can be used to generate mdm functions on images. Also, we can verify that all mdm functions and gradient fields generated in Section 7, except those generated using f=0ùëì0f=0 as input, are perfect relatively to the input map. Hence, it would be of interest to find conditions on the input multifiltering function that guarantee the optimality of the output, as it was done in [ref]60 for the algorithm ComputeDiscreteGradient. Besides, for GenerateMDM to be used to reduce the size of a simplicial complex prior to multipersistent homology computations, it should be improved in terms of speed. Indeed, using the multi-chunk algorithm as seen in [ref]30  or a minimal presentation of the homology of the complex  1 7 seems more efficient for this task. Nonetheless, GenerateMDM could potentially be used in other applications related to either multipersistent homology or topological data analysis. We could, for example, adapt the concepts of Morse-Smale complex , Morse connections graph  or descending complex  to mdm functions. Also, mdm functions and their gradient fields could realistically be used to modelize fluid dynamics, similarly to PL vector functions , or to extend the application of grayscale image analysis techniques 4  to multispectral images.\n\nReference markers found: [60]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]60: input, are perfect relatively to the input map.
