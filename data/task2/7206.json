      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Efficient Private Neighbor Generation for Subgraph Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrivacy-preserving learning over graph data has been widely studied. Differential Privacy (DP) 0 is a widely applied privacy concept in this field, which describes the privacy of a method in protecting individual samples while preserving the analytical properties of the entire dataset.\nA prevalent approach in attaining a graph mining model with general DP is DPSGD , which injects designed noise into clipped gradients during model training. For centralized training scenarios, DPGGAN [ref]43 incorporates DPSGD to achieve DP for individual links on original graphs.\nIn FL systems, VFGNN  and FedGNN  leverage DPSGD and cryptology techniques to obtain rigorous privacy guarantees for federated graph learning. Meanwhile, to achieve general DP on graphs, there are some other noised-injecting based methods. Previous works of centralized learning    , FKGE 8 and FedGSL  for FL systems, guarantee their proposed techniques with general DP by applying noise perturbation. However, general DP does not depict the protections for sensitive node features, edges, or neighborhoods, on distributed graphs. Edge local DP and node local DP (edge-LDP and node-LDP) are two specific types of DP targeting local nodes’ neighbor lists 9. These novel DP definitions better fit the graph learning that learns from multiple neighbor lists, and match the privacy goal of protecting nodes’ local neighborhoods. As illustrated in Definition 2.2 in 9, edge-LDP defines how much a model tells for two neighborhoods that differ by one edge, while node-LDP promises a model’s max leakage for all possible neighborhoods. In contrast to node-LDP, which is much stronger and can severely hinder the graph model’s utility, edge-LDP precisely illustrates the local DP for local neighborhoods without overly constraining the model. There are several works analyzing edge-LDP over distributed graph data. Qin et al. 9 propose a decentralized social graphs generation technique with the edge-LDP. Imola et al. 5 analyze the edge-LDP of the proposed shuffle techniques in handling the triangle and 4-cycle counting for neighbor lists of distributed users. Lin et al. 0 propose Solitude, an edge-LDP collaborative training framework for distributed graphs, where each client shares its perturbed local graph for the training. However, different from our subgraph FL setting, its central server (data curator) has access to node identities and labels. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage edge-LDP in the FL setting.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: prevalent approach in attaining a graph mining model with general DP is DPSGD , which injects designed noise into clipped gradients during model training.
