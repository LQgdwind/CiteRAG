      "content": "Paper Title: Is Simple Uniform Sampling Effective for Center-Based Clustering with Outliers: When and Why?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClustering has many important applications in real world . An important type of clustering problems is called “center-based clustering”, such as the well-known k𝑘k-center/median/means clustering problems .\nIn general, a center-based clustering problem aims to find k𝑘k cluster centers so as to minimize the induced clustering cost.\nBut in practice our datasets often contain outliers which can seriously destroy the final clustering results .\nA key obstacle is that the outliers can be arbitrarily located in the space. Outlier removal is a topic that has been extensively studied before . The existing outlier removal methods (like DBSCAN  [ref]6) yet cannot simply replace the center-based clustering with outliers approaches, since we often need to use the obtained cluster centers to represent the data or perform other tasks, e.g., data compression and data selection for large-scale machine learning [ref]7 . Clustering with outliers can be viewed as a generalization of the vanilla clustering problems, however, the presence of arbitrary outliers makes the problems to be much more challenging. In particular, the problem of clustering with outliers is often a challenging combinatorial optimization problem  0.\nEven for their approximate solutions, most existing quality-guaranteed algorithms have super-linear time complexities.\nSo a number of sampling methods have been proposed for reducing their complexities. Namely, we take a small sample (uniformly or non-uniformly) from the input and run an existing approximation algorithm on the sample. A number of non-uniform sampling methods have been proposed, such as the k𝑘k-means++ seeding 0 1 2 3 and the successive sampling method 4. However, these non-uniform sampling approaches may suffer several drawbacks in practice. For instance, they need to read the input dataset in multiple passes with high computational complexities, and/or may have to discard more than z𝑧z outliers (z𝑧z is the pre-specified number of outliers). For example, the methods 0 1 need to run the k𝑘k-means++ seeding procedure Ω​(k+z)Ω𝑘𝑧\\Omega(k+z) rounds, and discard O​(k​z​log⁡n)𝑂𝑘𝑧𝑛O(kz\\log n) and O​(k​z)𝑂𝑘𝑧O(kz) outliers respectively. Compared with the non-uniform sampling methods, uniform sampling enjoys several significant advantages, e.g., it is very easy to implement in practice.\nWe need to emphasize that, beyond the clustering quality and asymptotic complexity, the simplicity of implementation is also a major concern in algorithm engineering, especially for dealing with big data 5.\nHowever, uniform sampling usually requires a large sample size depending\non n/z𝑛𝑧n/z and the dimensionality d𝑑d, which could be very high (e.g., d𝑑d could be high and z𝑧z could be much smaller than n𝑛n). For example, as the result proposed by Huang et al. 6, the sample size should be at least\nΩ​((nδ​z)2​k​d​log⁡k)Ωsuperscript𝑛𝛿𝑧2𝑘𝑑𝑘\\Omega\\big{(}(\\frac{n}{\\delta z})^{2}kd\\log k\\big{)}, if δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1) and we allow to discard (1+δ)​z1𝛿𝑧(1+\\delta)z outliers (which is slightly larger than the pre-specified number z𝑧z). If z=n𝑧𝑛z=\\sqrt{n}, their sample size will be even larger than n𝑛n. Actually, for the vanilla k𝑘k-median/means clustering (without outliers) problems,  Meyerson et al. [17, Section 4 and 5] considered using uniform sampling to solve the practical case that each optimal cluster is assumed to have size Ω​(ϵ​nk)Ωitalic-ϵ𝑛𝑘\\Omega(\\frac{\\epsilon n}{k}), where ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is a fixed parameter in (0,1)01(0,1). But unfortunately their result cannot be easily extended to the version with outliers. As studied in the same paper [17, Section 6], it was shown that the sample size relies on nz𝑛𝑧\\frac{n}{z}, and moreover, the solution has a large error on the number of discarded outliers (it needs to discard >16​zabsent16𝑧>16z outliers). Our contributions and key ideas. In this paper, we aim to provide the theoretical analysis to explain the effectiveness of uniform sampling in practice.\nOur algorithmic framework actually is very simple, where we just need to take a small sample uniformly at random from the input and run an existing approximation algorithm (as the black-box algorithm) on the sample. Our results are partly inspired by the work from Meyerson et al. 7, but as discussed above, we need to go deeper and develop significantly new ideas for analyzing the influence of outliers.\nWe briefly introduce our ideas and results below. Suppose {C1∗,C2∗,⋯,Ck∗}subscriptsuperscript𝐶1subscriptsuperscript𝐶2⋯subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑘\\{C^{*}_{1},C^{*}_{2},\\cdots,C^{*}_{k}\\} are the k𝑘k optimal clusters.\nWe consider the ratio between two values: the size of the smallest optimal cluster min1≤j≤k⁡|Cj∗|subscript1𝑗𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑗\\min_{1\\leq j\\leq k}|C^{*}_{j}|111|Cj∗|subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑗|C^{*}_{j}| indicates the number of points in Cj∗subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑗C^{*}_{j}. and the number of outliers z𝑧z.\nWe show this ratio actually plays a key role to the effectiveness of uniform sampling.\nIn real applications, a cluster usually represents a certain scale of population and it is rare to have a cluster with the size much smaller than the number of outliers.\nSo it is reasonable to assume that each cluster Cj∗subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑗C^{*}_{j} has a size at least comparable to z𝑧z, i.e., min1≤j≤k⁡|Cj∗|/z=Ω​(1)subscript1𝑗𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑗𝑧Ω1\\min_{1\\leq j\\leq k}|C^{*}_{j}|/z=\\Omega(1) (note this assumption allows the ratio to be a value smaller than 111, say 0.50.50.5). Under such a realistic assumption, our framework can output k+O​(log⁡k)𝑘𝑂𝑘k+O(\\log k) cluster centers that yield a 444-approximation for k𝑘k-center clustering with outliers.\nIn some scenarios, we may insist on returning exactly k𝑘k cluster centers. We prove that, if min1≤j≤k⁡|Cj∗|z>1subscript1𝑗𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑗𝑧1\\frac{\\min_{1\\leq j\\leq k}|C^{*}_{j}|}{z}>1, our framework can return exactly k𝑘k cluster centers that yield a (c+2)𝑐2(c+2)-approximate solution, through running an existing c𝑐c-approximation k𝑘k-center with outliers algorithm (with some c≥1𝑐1c\\geq 1) on the sample. The framework also yields similar results for k𝑘k-median/means clustering with outliers. We prove that the sample size can be independent of the ratio n/z𝑛𝑧n/z and the dimensionality d𝑑d, which is fundamentally different from the previous results on uniform sampling 8 6 9. Our sample size only depends on k𝑘k, min1≤j≤k⁡|Cj∗|subscript1𝑗𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑗\\min_{1\\leq j\\leq k}|C^{*}_{j}|, and several parameters controlling the clustering error and success probability.\nMoreover, different from the previous methods which often have the errors on the number of discarded outliers, our method allows to discard exactly z𝑧z outliers.\nAlso, if we only require to output the cluster centers, our uniform sampling approach has the sublinear time complexity that is independent of the input size. It is worth noting that Gupta 0 proposed a similar uniform sampling approach to solve k𝑘k-means clustering with outliers.\nHowever, the analysis and results of Gupta 0 are quite different from ours. Also the assumption in 0 is stronger: it requires that each optimal cluster has size roughly Ω​(zγ2​log⁡k)Ω𝑧superscript𝛾2𝑘\\Omega(\\frac{z}{\\gamma^{2}}\\log k) (i.e., min1≤j≤k⁡|Cj∗|z=Ω​(log⁡kγ2)subscript1𝑗𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑗𝑧Ω𝑘superscript𝛾2\\frac{\\min_{1\\leq j\\leq k}|C^{*}_{j}|}{z}=\\Omega(\\frac{\\log k}{\\gamma^{2}})) where γ𝛾\\gamma is a small parameter in (0,1)01(0,1).\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: key obstacle is that the outliers can be arbitrarily located in the space.
