      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Black-Box Attackers with Transferable Priors and Query Feedback\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has achieved remarkable success in numerous areas    . However, modern deep learning technology is proven vulnerable to adversarial examples for various data modalities   , which are visually similar examples (compared with natural samples) crafted to fool the deep models. It is important to ensure security of artificial intelligence system, as its increasing employment in high-stakes areas, e,g, autonomous driving  , healthcare   and criminal justice  , in both cloud and edge computing infrastructure. Research efforts have been made on the adversarial examples, in order to evaluate model robustness , improve the security , and contribute to model interpretability . Adversarial attack could be categorized into white-box and black-box attack. It appears that vision benchmark models Szegedy et al. , He et al. , Simonyan & Zisserman  are susceptible to white-box attacks , even equipped with defense strategies . On the other hand, it is still challenging to attack a victim model in a black-box setting, where only the classification confidence of the victim model is accessible. Prior arts either produce transferable gradients from a white-box surrogate model (i.e., transferability-based approaches [ref]13  ), or estimate gradients based on query feedback (i.e., query-based approaches [ref]19 [ref]24), while these methods still suffer from attack failure or query inefficiency. Even for state-of-the-art black-box attack method , it needs thousands of queries and suffers from failure cases, especially when attacking strong victim models with defense strategies. In this paper, we aim at an improved black-box attack. As reported in Sec. 4, we significantly improve the query efficiency while keeping higher success rates close to 100%. The performance boosting comes from 1) leveraging transferability-based and query-based approaches, and 2) a learnable surrogate model. In early research of query-based black-box attack   [ref]19, no transferability between vision models is considered. However, as illustrated in Supplementary Figure A1, it is unreasonable to ignore the high consistency between the vision models. By introducing surrogate models as transferable priors, previous methods   could improve the attack performance via prior-guided gradient estimation. Although effective, these approaches with fixed surrogate models do not leverage the advances in transferability-based attack [ref]13  . In this study,\nby combining both transferability-based attack (TIMI ) and query-based attack (SimBA [ref]19), we propose a surprisingly simple yet powerful baseline approach, named SimBA++. It not only improves the query efficiency and attack success rate over TIMI and SimBA, but also outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches [ref]24  . However, the query feedback is not well utilized in prior arts. It is expected that the query results divulge information from the victim model, which could potentially improve the attack performance as more queries are available. We update the surrogate model to approximate the victim model with the query feedback. Few prior research suggests a query-efficient update strategy in this scenario. It is possible to train another CNN to refine the gradient from surrogate model; whereas, we assume that it is easier to directly train the back-propagated gradient of surrogate model to be aligned with that of victim model, with the help of high-order gradient computation graph. The proposed update strategy is named High-Order Gradient Approximation (HOGA). As demonstrated in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5, HOGA not only leads to fewer queries, but also learns a transferable surrogate model on new attack data. Based on the above observation, combining the strong baseline approach SimBA++ with High-Order Gradient Approximation, we propose Learnable Black-Box Attack (LeBA). Extensive experiments on ImageNet dataset  validate the superiority of LeBA over previous state of the art and our baseline approaches, in terms of query efficiency and attack success rate, especially when attacking strong victim models with defense strategies. Our study highlights the importance of leveraging the query-based and transferability-based black-box attack, as well as the feasibility of learning surrogate models within limited queries.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: where only the classification confidence of the victim model is accessible.
