      "content": "Paper Title: S3VAADA: Submodular Subset Selection for Virtual Adversarial Active Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks have shown significant advances in image classification tasks by utilizing large amounts of labeled data. Despite their impressive performance, these networks produce spurious predictions hence suffer from performance degradation when used on images that come from a different domain [ref]31 (e.g., model trained on synthetic data (source domain) being used on real-world data (target domain)). Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DA)  [ref]21     approaches aim to utilize the labeled data from source domain along with the unlabeled data from the target domain to improve the model’s generalization on the target domain. However, it has been observed that the performance of Unsupervised DA models often falls short in comparison to the supervised methods , which leads to their reduced usage for performance critical applications. In such cases, it might be possible to label some of the target data to improve the performance of the model. In such a case, the dilemma is, “Which samples from the target dataset should be selected for labeling?”. Active Learning (AL)   approaches aim to provide techniques to select the maximally informative set for labeling, which is then used for training the model. However, these approaches do not effectively use the unlabeled data and labeled data present in various domains. This objective contrasts with Unsupervised DA objective that aims to use the unlabeled target data effectively. In practice, it has been found that just naively using AL and fine-tuning offers sub-optimal performance in presence of domain shift . Another question that follows sample selection (or sampling) is, “How to effectively use all the data available to improve model performance?”. Unsupervised DA approaches based on the idea of learning invariant features for both the source and target domain have been known to be ineffective in increasing performance when additional labeled data is present in target domain [ref]32. Semi-Supervised DA (SSDA) [ref]32  methods have been developed to mitigate the above issue, but we find their performance plateau’s as additional data is added (Sec. 9). This is likely due to the assumption in SSDA of only having a small amount of labeled data per-class (i.e., few shot) in target domain which is restrictive. The Active Domain Adaptation (Active DA) paradigm introduced by Rai et al.  aims to first effectively select the informative-samples, which are then used by a complementary DA procedure for improving model performance on target domain. The state-of-the-art work of AADA  aim to select samples with high value of pt​a​r​g​e​t​(x)/ps​o​u​r​c​e​(x)subscript𝑝𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑥subscript𝑝𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑥p_{target}(x)/p_{source}(x) from domain discriminator, multiplied by the entropy of classifier which is used by DANN  for adaptation. As the AADA criterion is a point-estimate, it is unaware of other selected samples; hence the samples selected can be redundant, as shown in Fig. 1. In this work, we introduce Submodular Subset Selection for Virtual Adversarial Active Domain Adaptation (S3VAADA) which proposes a set-based informative criterion that provides scores for each of the subset of samples rather than a point-based estimate for each sample. As the information criteria is aware of other samples in the subset, it tends to avoid redundancy. Hence, it is able to select diverse and uncertain samples (shown in Fig. 1). Our subset criterion is based on the cluster assumption, which has shown to be widely effective in DA   . The subset criterion is composed of a novel uncertainty score (Virtual Adversarial Pairwise (VAP)) which is based on the idea of the sensitivity of model to small adversarial perturbations. This is combined with a distance based metrics such that the criterion is submodular (defined in Sec. 3.1). The submodularity of the criterion allows usage of an efficient algorithm  to obtain the optimal subset of samples. After obtaining the labeled data, we use a cluster based domain adaption scheme based on VADA . Although VADA, when naively used is not able to effectively make use of the additional target labeled data , we mitigate this via two modifications (Sec. 4.2) which form our Virtual Active Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VAADA) procedure. \nIn summary, our contributions are: We propose a novel set-based information criterion which is aware of other samples in the set and aims to select uncertain, diverse and representative samples. For effective utilization of the selected samples, we propose a complementary DA procedure of VAADA which enhances VADA’s suitability for active DA. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art active DA results on diverse domain adaptation benchmarks of Office-31, Office-Home and VisDA-18.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: of labeled data.
