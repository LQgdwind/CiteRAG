      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced Pub/Sub Communications for Massive IoT Traffic with SARSA Reinforcement Learning Work supported by CAPES and Salvador University (UNIFACS)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSensors are being extensively deployed and are expected to expand at significant rates in\nthe coming years in the internet of things (IoT) application areas like smart city, intelligent\ntraffic systems (ITS), connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV), video analytics in public\nsafety (VAPS) and mobile e-health  , to mention some. Cloud, edge and fog computing are currently the most prevailing and competing used strategies to convey IoT data between producers and consumers. They use several different alternatives to decide where to process, how to distribute, and where to store IoT data . Nevertheless, cloud, edge, and fog-based solutions need to tackle the distribution of a high volume of IoT data efficiently. IoT data distribution, whatever data handling, processing, or storing strategy used, does require efficient network communications infrastructures. In fact, there is a research challenge on enhancing network communications and providing efficient resource allocation based on the fact that, in many applications like IoT, networks have limited and constrained resources . Machine learning and reinforcement learning with distinct algorithms like Q-Learning\n[ref]33, deep reinforcement learning 1, and SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)  are being applied to support an efficient allocation of resources in networks for application areas like 5G, cognitive radio, and mobile edge computing, to mention some  . The Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) paradigm is extensively used as an enabler for data distribution in various scenarios like information-centric networking, data-centric systems, smart grid, and other general group-based communications 5 0 . The Pub/Sub paradigm is an alternative for IoT data distribution between producers and consumers in general 0 2. This work addresses the issue of enhancing the utilization of a communication channel (MPLS label switched path - LSP, physical link, fiber optics slot, others) deployed in net- work infrastructures with limited resources (bandwidth) using the SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm. The target application area is the massive exchange of IoT data using the Pub/Sub paradigm. The framework integrating the SARSA module with the Pub/Sub message exchange deployment (PSIoT described in 2) is the PSIoTRL. Differently from other proposals for network infrastructure resource allocation and optimization that consider, for instance, the quality of service for the entire set of network nodes and Pub/Sub aggregators, the SARSA-based PSIoTRL framework provides a simple data ingress based solution. In fact, it controls the quality of Pub/Sub topics data distribution in an aggregator by keeping Pub/Sub buffer topics occupation below a defined threshold. This indirectly means that a certain amount of bandwidth is available for the Pub/Sub topic and, consequently, a level of quality is allocated for the communication channel. Since the Pub/Sub data transfers are dynamically requested, SARSA deploys a dynamic control of bandwidth allocation for buffer data flushing. The contribution of this work is multi-fold. Firstly, we modeled the SARSA agent communications with a generic buffer occupation metric. The adopted metric results in a limited amount of SARSA states to allow the allocation of bandwidth preserving Pub/Sub topic priorities without using extensive computational resources. Moreover, we demonstrate that Pub/Sub communications with SARSA can be enhanced by dynamically adjusting IoT aggregators queues occupation to Pub/Sub topics priority and network resources availability. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related work on IoT data processing deployments with cognitive communications approaches. Section 3 is a background section about reinforcement learning with SARSA. Sections 4 and 5 describe the basic PSIoT Pub/Sub framework, discuss the RL applicability for the constrained communication problem and present the PSIoTRL framework components including the intelligent orchestrator for IoT traffic management. In Section 6, we present a proof of concept for the PSIoTRL and evaluate how it enhances the IoT network resource management. Finally, section 7 concludes with an overview of the main highlights, contributions and future work.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: based on the fact that, in many applications like IoT, networks have limited and constrained resources .
