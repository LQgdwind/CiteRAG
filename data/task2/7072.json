      "content": "Paper Title: VeriDIP: Verifying Ownership of Deep Neural Networks through Privacy Leakage Fingerprints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOwnership testing (OT) techniques, also referred to as DNN fingerprinting techniques, are an emerging area of research that focuses on extracting the intrinsic characteristics of DNN models to track stolen copies. Currently, the research on OT is limited, with the majority of studies relying on two fingerprint characteristics: robustness    and overfitting . IPGuard  proposes using model robustness as fingerprints. The authors observe that stolen copies exhibit similar predictions to the victim model for most adversarial data points. While IPGuard can successfully identify white-box derivation attacks, such as fine-tuning, it is not effective against black-box extraction attacks, such as model extraction attack [ref]33, where the attacker retrains the model from scratch, resulting in a larger disparity in the decision surface compared to the victim model. To address this limitation, Lukas et al.  propose the use of transferable adversarial samples to extract DNN fingerprints. This approach successfully defends against white-box derivation attacks and most black-box extraction attacks, but it is vulnerable to transfer learning and adversarial training. More recently, Chen et al.  propose a testing framework for verifying ownership. Instead of relying on single metrics, they utilize multiple dimensions and combine the results to determine ownership. Their black-box metrics also use robustness as fingerprints, similar to IPGuard , making them susceptible to black-box extraction attacks. Their white-box metrics utilize the robustness of inner neuron outputs, requiring the defender to have knowledge of all parameters of stolen copies. Dataset inference (DI)  exploits the overfitting of DNN models to their training data as a means to demonstrate that stolen copies exhibit similar overfitting fingerprints to the victim models. They employ minimal adversarial noise that leads to model misclassification [ref]35 as fingerprints. DI is capable of identifying all white-box and black-box model variations . However, this approach has some limitations. Firstly, it cannot be directly applied to DNN models trained on tabular data since some of the features are categorical, making it challenging to perform most adversarial example attacks . Secondly, DI requires querying the suspect model thousands of times, which significantly increases the risk of detector attacks [ref]28. Thirdly, the effectiveness of DI on differentially private (DP)  DNN models remains unanswered. Hence, this paper aims to propose a novel ownership testing approach that addresses these limitations by achieving high verification efficiency and protecting the intellectual property of DP models.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: data points. While IPGuard can successfully identify white-box derivation attacks, such as fine-tuning, it is not effective against black-box extraction attacks, such as model extraction attack [ref]33, where the attacker retrains the model from scratch, resulting in a larger disparity in the decision surface compared to the victim model.
