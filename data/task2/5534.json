      "content": "Paper Title: Individual Fairness under Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many real-world applications, the main outcome under assessment, i.e., the class label, could be unknown for a portion of the study group.\nThis phenomenon, deemed censorship, can arise in various ways, hindering the use of many algorithms. For example¬†(Figure¬†1), a study may end before an individual experiences the event of interest, e.g., individual d4subscriptùëë4d_{4}. The studied individual can also be lost to follow-up during the study period, withdraw from the study, or experience a competing event making further follow-up impossible, e.g., individual d2subscriptùëë2d_{2}. In the typical setting of survival analysis, censored examples are only guaranteed not to have experienced events until their last observation, e.g. t2subscriptùë°2t_{2} and the end of the study for d2subscriptùëë2d_{2} and d4subscriptùëë4d_{4}, respectively, and we do not know their exact class labels. The censorship information is used together with the observed data to fit or evaluate survival models, a statistical model that analyzes the expected duration of time until each individual‚Äôs event. Specifically, we can guarantee that a censored example with the time of event TùëáT happens after TùëáT, so we can compare two events at T1subscriptùëá1T_{1} and T2subscriptùëá2T_{2} for T1<T2subscriptùëá1subscriptùëá2T_{1}<T_{2} if neither is censored at T1subscriptùëá1T_{1}, regardless of censorship at T2subscriptùëá2T_{2}. For instance, the green edges in Figure¬†1 represent the comparable pairs among individuals with censored and observed events (as the order graph), from which we can tell that d1subscriptùëë1d_{1} happens before d2subscriptùëë2d_{2}, while whether d2subscriptùëë2d_{2} happens before d3subscriptùëë3d_{3} or not remains unknown. Given that censored data is common, e.g., clinical prediction (Support)¬†, marketing analytics (KKBox)¬†[ref]26, recidivism prediction instrument datasets (COMPAS¬† and ROSSI¬†6), survival analysis has gained popularity in applied work. For example, in customer analytics whether a customer will cancel the service, e.g., event of interest/class label, can be unknown due to various reasons discussed above¬†[ref]26. Similarly, one may predict in domains of reoffense¬†, analyzing financial outcomes in actuarial analysis¬†, and predictive maintenance in mechanical operations¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: while whether d2subscriptùëë2d_{2} happens before d3subscriptùëë3d_{3} or not remains unknown.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
