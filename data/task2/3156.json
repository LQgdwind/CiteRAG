      "content": "Paper Title: UniLog: Deploy One Model and Specialize it for All Log Analysis Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLog Anomaly Detection. Log anomaly detection is the most widely studied topic in the log analysis domain. In this section, we conduct experiments on two log anomaly detection benchmark: HDFS and BGL to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\nWe compare UniLog to the following methods with 1) PCA , PCA-based anomaly detection method vectorize each log sequence as an event count vector and employed to find patterns between the dimensions of event count vectors. 2) Invariant Mining  which was the ﬁrst applied to log- based anomaly detection in  based on the assumption that program invariants are the linear relationships that always hold during system running. 3) LogCluster  that determine the state of a new log sequence by computing its distance to representative vectors in knowledge base and report the log sequence as normal or abnormal based on representation vector distance. 4) DeepLog  is the first deep learning approach on log anomaly detection. 5) LogAnomaly , the state-of-the-art method on log anomaly detection, combines sequential patterns and quantitative patterns. In Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the experimental results for log anomaly detection on HDFS and BGL dataset. Our proposed UniLog achieves the best performance on both datasets. Specifically, on the HDFS dataset, UniLog achieved precision of 0.97, recall of 0.99, and f1 score of 0.98. The f1 score is 0.3% higher than LogAnomaly. On the BGL dataset, our method achieve precision of 0.98, recall of 1.00 and f1 score of 0.99. It further improve the f1 score 0.3% over LogAnomaly. This improvement is non-trivial, since reliability on the system is vital and an f1 score improve over 0.1% might save millions of dollars.\n\n\n Log Summarization. After demonstrating the superiority of our method on log anomaly detection, we evaluate it for log summarization that requires refining the semantic information in the log sequence. We demonstrate the experimental results for log data summarization. We choose TextRank , a classic keyword extraction algorithm, and LogSummary [ref]6 the state-of-the-art method design specifically to summarize log data. Table V reports the experimental results; it shows that the UniLog can significantly improve our log summarization performance: UniLog is improving the F1 score by 0.070 on BGL data, 0.031 on HPC data, and 0.036 on Proxifier over LogSummary. On hard task HDFS, the F1 score of UniLog is 0.208 higher than LogSummary, demonstrate that UniLog is more effective than the classic model and LogSummary in a real-world situation.\n\n\nLog Failure Prediction. We now show UniLog can improve the performance on failure prediction tasks. As shown in Table III, we perform experiment on Switch log datasets to compare UniLog against a) SKSVM , a log-based failure prediction system used in computer b) HSMM [ref]43, a log-based failure prediction in ISP devices, and c) Prefix [ref]4, the state-of-the-art log failure prediction algorithm for switch failure prediction. We can observe that, though both SKSVM and HSMM are failure prediction algorithms, their performance is relatively low. This is due to that these two methods are designed specifically for computer and ISP service. As a result, they fail to generalize on Switch log dataset. On the contrary, our UniLog achieves better performance on all three switches, despite the fact that UniLog is not being designed for switch failure prediction tasks. Particularly, on the M2 and M3 switch, the UniLog strongly outperforms these approaches notably, obtains a +5.27% and +9.85% F1 score improvement. This provides another indication that UniLog is able to capture generalizable knowledge in the cross-service log data.\n\n\nLog Compression. We also conduct experiments on log compression. We compare our method to three popular data compression techniques that are widely used in the computer system, bzip , 7zip , zip . We also compare to LogParse , a log parsing method that can adaptively classify log based on the word. The LogParse can effectively combine with existing data compression techniques to compress log data. We therefore compare our method to LogParse, which is followed by bzip, 7zip, and zip algorithm. The experimental results are shown in Table IV. Our method consistently improves the compression ratio over all baseline methods. Specifically, UniLog increase 2.1% on average compression rate on four datasets compare to the previous state-of-the-art, which results in an excellent storage reduction. Besides, as the number of samples in the target dataset increase, UniLog achieve more improvement on the performance. For instance, on the largest dataset HDFS, where the number of logs is over two orders of magnitudes larger than HPC and Hadoop, the UniLog improves the compression rate relatively up to 3.4%.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: refining the semantic information in the log sequence. We demonstrate the experimental results for log data summarization. We choose TextRank , a classic keyword extraction algorithm, and LogSummary [ref]6 the state-of-the-art method design specifically to summarize log data. Table V reports the experimental results; it shows that the UniLog can significantly improve our log summarization\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
