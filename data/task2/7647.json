      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-domain and Cross-dimension Learning for Image-to-Graph Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRepresenting physical relationships via graph representations has proven to be an efficient, versatile, and expressive concept with vast utility in machine learning. Prominent examples are road network graphs [ref]2, neuron representations and connections in the brain , blood vessels [ref]8, and cell interactions . The underlying physical structures are typically captured as a voxelized image without regarding semantic content. Hence, constructing graph representations from images (image-to-graph) is one of the critical challenges for unlocking the full potential in many real-world applications . Traditionally, image-to-graph extraction involves a complex multi-stage process of segmentation, skeletonization, and graph pruning, which leads to inaccuracies and information loss at each step . These limitations negatively impact prediction accuracy and reduce the application to downstream tasks that require more information from the underlying image (e.g.,  ). Hence, there is a clear need for machine learning solutions that facilitate a direct image-to-graph extraction  . Recently, vision transformers have been proposed for this task and showed superior performance to traditional multi-stage graph extraction approaches  7. However, these approaches only work on large sets of annotated 2D data and have not been shown to generalize to diverse 3D datasets where graph-level annotations are even less common than pixel annotations. To address this challenge, we adopt and extend concepts from the field of inductive  Transfer Learning (TL) (see taxonomy in  and Supplementary Figure 1), which has not been explored for image-to-graph extraction. Specifically, we assume the availability of large sets of image-graph pairs in some source domains (e.g. 2D satellite images of roads) and a small set of labeled data from the target domain (e.g. 3D microscopy image of vascular networks) that can both be used to train our image-to-graph model.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: physical relationships via graph representations has proven to be an efficient, versatile, and expressive concept with vast utility in machine learning.
