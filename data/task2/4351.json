      "content": "Paper Title: CoSCL: Cooperation of Small Continual Learners is Stronger than a Big One\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability to incrementally learn a sequence of tasks is critical for artificial neural networks. Since the training data distribution is typically dynamic and unpredictable, this usually requires a careful trade-off between learning plasticity and memory stability. In general, excessive plasticity in learning new tasks leads to the catastrophic forgetting of old tasks , while excessive stability in remembering old tasks limits the learning of new tasks.\nMost efforts in continual learning either use a single model to learn all tasks, which has to sacrifice the performance of each task to find a shared solution 5; or allocate a dedicated parameter subspace for each task to overcome their mutual interference [ref]14 [ref]41, which usually lacks scalability. Recent work observed that a wider network can suffer from less catastrophic forgetting , while different components such as batch normalization, skip connections and pooling layers play various roles . Thus, how to achieve effective continual learning in terms of model architecture remains an open question. In contrast, the robust biological learning system applies multiple compartments (i.e, sub-networks) to process sequential experiences in parallel, and integrates their outputs in a weighted-sum fashion to guide adaptive behaviors   2.\nThis provides a promising reference for artificial neural networks. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the generalization errors of learning plasticity and memory stability in continual learning. We identify that both aspects can be uniformly upper-bounded by (1) discrepancy between task distributions, (2) flatness of loss landscape and (3) cover of parameter space.\nInspired by the biological strategy, we propose a novel method named Cooperation of Small Continual Learners (CoSCL). Specifically, we design an architecture with multiple narrower sub-networks111In contrast to a single continual learning model with a wide network, we refer to such narrower sub-networks as “small” continual learners. to learn all incremental tasks in parallel, which can naturally alleviate the both errors through improving the three components. To strengthen this advantage, we further encourage the cooperation of sub-networks by penalizing differences in the predictions of their feature representations. With a fixed parameter budget, CoSCL can substantially boost a variety of representative continual learning strategies (e.g., up to 10.64% on CIFAR-100-SC, 9.33% on CIFAR-100-RS, 11.45% on CUB-200-2011 and 6.72% on Tiny-ImageNet, detailed in Fig. 1 and Table 1). The superior performance comes from reducing the errors in both learning plasticity and memory stability by tightening the upper bound, consistent with our theoretical analysis. Our contributions include:\n(1) We present a unified form of generalization bounds for learning plasticity and memory stability in continual learning;\n(2) The generalization bounds suggest that the two aspects are not necessarily in conflict, but can be simultaneously enhanced in a compatible parameter space of a well-designed model architecture;\n(3) To achieve this goal, we draw inspirations from the biological strategy and propose to cooperate multiple (small) continual learners;\n(4) Extensive experiments validate the efficacy and generality of our proposal, which can be adapted to a variety of representative continual learning approaches and improve their performance by a large margin.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: to learn all tasks, which has to sacrifice the performance of each task to find a shared solution 5; or allocate a dedicated parameter subspace for each task to overcome their mutual interference [ref]14 [ref]41, which usually lacks scalability.
