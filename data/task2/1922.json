      "content": "Paper Title: RelTransformer: A Transformer-Based Long-Tail Visual Relationship Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Relationship Recognition. Correct visual relation prediction requires having a comprehensive understanding of the image contents, which guides many successful works in the literature. Early works employ RNN models to construct a global context by aggregating the node and edge features via iterative message passing such as   [ref]39  . e.g., VCTree [ref]39 composes a dynamic tree structure to organize the object orders and apply TreeLSTM  to aggregate features.\nThere are also several graph convolutional network (GCN)  approaches [ref]45   , which attempt to learn different importance weights to the neighborhood nodes. Lin et al. [ref]24 extend the graph attention to also capture the node-specific contextual information and encode the edge direction information. More recently, there is also emerging a Transformer-based approach , which models the pairwise interaction among nodes and edges in two separate Transformer networks. Our model differs from it mainly in two aspects: a) we have a different message-passing flow in which we specifically aggregate relation features from the relation-triplet and global-context information. b) We further design an effective memory attention module for augmenting the long-tail relation representation. Long-Tail Visual Relationship Recognition. Long-tail problem is very severe in visual relation recognition (VRR) 1  [ref]24. There are mainly two approaching directions to alleviate this problem. The first one is semantically guided visual recognition. In this case, language models  are employed for zero-shot or few-shot recognition 1 . There are also several VRR works 1  [ref]45  using the language priors as a guidance to learn relation features, which can derive a better classification on long-tail classes. The second direction is to apply the strategies that have been designed for unbalanced object detection, including various class imbalance loss functions (e.g. weighted cross entropy, focal loss , equalization loss ), sampling strategies (e.g., under-sampling , over-sampling 3 and class-balanced sampling ), data augmentation  , meta learning 2 , counterfactual learning , memory modules  and decoupling methods 7. In our long-tail VRR experiment, we also leverage the language models and many aforementioned long-tail strategies to better classify long-tail relation types. But we focus on understanding their collaborative effect with our message-passing mechanism and how they influence head and tail predictions.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: which guides many successful works in the literature. Early works employ RNN models to construct a global context by aggregating the node and edge features via iterative message passing such as   [ref]39  . e.g., VCTree [ref]39 composes a dynamic tree structure to organize the object orders and apply TreeLSTM  to aggregate features.\nThere are also several graph convolutional network (GCN)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
