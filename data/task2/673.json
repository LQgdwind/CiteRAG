      "content": "Paper Title: Point Cloud Based Reinforcement Learning for Sim-to-Real and Partial Observability in Visual Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual navigation encompasses a broad range of tasks (e.g., navigation towards given coordinates, objects, etc.), in which embodied agents (e.g., robots) must traverse through an environment to accomplish a certain objective , [ref]5. These tasks have been thoroughly addressed by the robotics community, and classic methods usually split the problems in separate modules, one being mapping and one or more levels of planning algorithms . However, their performance is conditioned on the availability of high-quality maps, and they perform poorly when used on unseen environments, due to a high number of environment-specific parameters. Recently, great focus has been put into learning-based navigation systems [ref]15, , which aim to improve their overall performance and generalize to unseen environments. Although in the machine learning community there have been several works related to visual navigation in either game-like domains ,  or robotic environments , [ref]18, the robotics community has been reluctant to adopt these systems, believing classic methods to perform better for generic tasks . In this context, [ref]5 shows that with sufficient training, RL-based methods can outperform classic methods on fair settings, and  shows that RL agents can solve visual navigation tasks with an almost perfect SPL score [ref]15 in simulations. We believe this to be the right direction, but there are still several limitations that need to be addressed, as we show in Section IV.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: a broad range of tasks (e.g., navigation towards given coordinates, objects, etc.), in which embodied agents (e.g., robots) must traverse through an environment to accomplish a certain objective , [ref]5.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
