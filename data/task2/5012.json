      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Manifold Nonnegative Tucker Factorization for Tensor Data Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-negative tucker factorization (NTF) also known as nonnegative multilinear singular value decomposition (SVD), is a multiway extension of nonnegative matrix factorization . It explores the nonnegative property of data which enhances the ability of part-based representation and has received considerable attention in many fields, e.g. text mining , hyperspectral imaging , blind source separation [ref]4 and data clustering . Finding and exploiting the low-rank approximation and low-dimensional manifold from high-dimensional data is a fundamental problem in machine learning.\nIn particular, the extracted components obtained by principle component analysis (PCA) , vector quantization (VQ)  may lose their physical meaning if the nonnegativity is not preserved for high-dimensional real-world data.\nHence, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) [ref]8  has been used to explore low-rank representation of given data.\nIt is intractable for NMF to deal with high-order tensors.\nThe order of a tensor is the number of dimensions of the array, and a mode is one of its dimensions 0.\nFor example, an RGB image can be represented by a third-order tensor with the dimensions of height ×\\times width ×\\times channel.\nWhen applying NMF to tensorial data, the first step is to reshape tensors into matrices, which often leads to a loss of the meaningful tensor structures, and large scale parameters leads to higher memory demands 1.\nTensorial data can naturally characterize data from multiple aspects which preserve the structure information in each mode.\nHowever, they are typically high dimensional and difficult to be handled in their original space.\nTo address this problem, nonnegative tensor decomposition (NTD) methods have been proposed to directly exploit multidimensional structures of tensors.\nNTD can be viewed as a special case of NMF which not only inherits the advantages of NMF but also provides physically meaningful representation of multiway structure representation. For nonnegative tensor data analysis, many nonnegative tensor decomposition methods are based on CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decompositions 2, Tucker 3 models and low-tubal-rank models 4, respectively.\nIn this paper, we focus on the tucker model, since it enables more flexible and interpretable decomposition by utilizing the interaction of latent factors.\nExisting NTF decomposition methods usually have the following major problems.\nFirst, many NTF methods decompose a high-dimensional tensor into a product of low-rank nonnegative projection matrices and a low-dimensional nonnegative core tensor by minimizing the Euclidean distance between their product and the original tensor data.\nThey are optimal when the data are condemned by additive Gaussian noise.\nHowever, they may fail on grossly corrupted data, since the corruptions or outliers seriously violate the noise assumption of gaussian distribution.\nSecond, the tucker-based model suffers from the rotational ambiguity 5, i.e, solutions with and without rotation transformations are equally good in the sense of yielding the maximum likelihood 1. This implies that NTF can only find arbitrary bases of the latent subspace.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: property of data which enhances the ability of part-based representation and has received considerable attention in many fields, e.g. text mining , hyperspectral imaging , blind source separation [ref]4 and data clustering .
