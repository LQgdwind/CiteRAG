Lexical and syntactic analysis are widely used to design domain-adapted methods or tools to support retrieving various requirements information from textual artifacts, such as abstraction , terminology , and other requirements knowledge . The most commonly used NLP techniques in requirements IR includes tokenization, part of speech tagging, lemmatization, and syntactic parsing, which are often conducted with off-the-shelf NLP tools, e.g., Stanford CoreNLP, GATE, and NLTK. Other than those basic NLP techniques, classification , clustering  , summarization , and topic modeling [ref]55 are also employed to mine requirements information from large collections of textual artifacts. Software requirements specifications are traditionally the most common input document type for NLP4RE research. As the growing of online user communities in the last decade, user generated content have become prevalent in NLP4RE research, e.g., user posts and reviews in Stack Overflow , App stores , and social media . Feature request , bug report , and user opinions  are the main retrieved requirements information types. In the same time, NLP techniques also achieved rapid advancement with the help of deep learning. Word embeddings and pre-trained language models are also widely used in NLP4RE research, especially in large scale user feedback mining    . Since the launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, it has become a hot research topic to evaluate and apply ChatGPT on various domains [ref]61, which can been glanced through the explosive growth of the volume of ChatGPT related papers. In the SE research community, ChatGPT is employed to perform various SE tasks, e.g., bug fixing [ref]62 and unit test generation . Our empirical evaluation of ChatGPT on multiple requirements IR tasks provides both quantitative and qualitative evidence for the promising potential of ChatGPT on retrieving requirements information. Therefore, our study can be used as a starting point to inspire researchers and practitioners to investigate more effective LLMs based NLP4RE methods and tools.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: are often conducted with off-the-shelf NLP tools, e.g., Stanford CoreNLP, GATE, and NLTK.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
