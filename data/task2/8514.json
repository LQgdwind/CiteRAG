      "content": "Paper Title: STITCH: Surface reconstrucTion using Implicit neural representations with Topology Constraints and persistent Homology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe perform an extensive evaluation of our method for the task of surface reconstruction. Please see the Supplement for additional results and ablation studies. We compare our method against different surface reconstruction methods—Poisson Surface Reconstruction (PSR) , Neural-Pull (NP) [ref]37, Implicit Geometric Regularization (IGR) , Divergence-guided shape implicit representation for unoriented point clouds (DiGS) , and Neural Singular Hessian (NSH) 1. Each of these methods (except for PSR) is able to work with unoriented point clouds. We evaluate our method on several different surface reconstruction datasets. We start with the surface reconstruction benchmark (SRB) [ref]6 and utilize the variant made widely available by Williams et al. 2 that includes ground truth meshes and corresponding point clouds. SRB consists of five different shapes—Anchor, Daratech, Dc, Gargoyle, and Lord Quas, each with varying geometric features. We also use five different shapes from the DFAUST  dataset, which consists of ≈\\approx40k human scans captured at various time points To better showcase the versatility of our approach, We also test on eight different plant geometries, each with a unique set of geometric features—particularly thin leaves and narrow connection between the leaves and the stalk. In addition, we also test on four challenging hollow and thin models—Torus, Hollow Ball, Eiffel Tower, and Lamp. To compare the reconstruction accuracy, we compute the mesh of the object from the SDF evaluated at a resolution of 2563256^{3} using Marching Cubes . We then sample points from the reconstruction to compute the one-sided Chamfer distance (see Supplement for the equations). Furthermore, we use the final predicted SDF for each method to calculate the topological loss. The evaluated metrics for the SRB dataset are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. STITCH performs competitively on the SRB dataset with a low standard deviation and is able to maintain stable performance close to top-performing baselines such as OG-INR and NSH. While PSR has slightly better results on some shapes, STITCH maintains consistently good alignment and is particularly effective in more challenging shapes (Figure 4). Topologically, STITCH outperforms all other methods with significantly lower significant feature loss across all tested shapes compared to other methods. This indicates that STITCH is able to preserve relevant geometric features and produce a single connected component. On the DFAUST dataset (Table 4), STITCH is able to achieve competitive mean and standard deviation values and its performance is in line with DIGS and OG-INR. Figure 6 shows a comparison of different reconstruction methods on 3D shapes with thin, challenging structures that have a wide variation in the point cloud density and noise. This comparison highlights the strengths of our method in handling thin and intricate shapes. Unlike other methods that either oversmooth or produce artifacts, STITCH achieves detailed reconstructions that closely match the input shapes. We showcase a similar comparison for plant geometries in Figure 7 and their metrics in Table 5. Plant leaves are often prone to occlusion (given the proximity of neighboring leaves), leading to inaccurate reconstructions or blob-like surfaces. STITCH outperforms baseline methods and effectively captures the relevant features pertaining to each plant geometry, and is able to reconstruct the surfaces with minimal blob-like surfaces. We attribute the tiny amount of blobs to the bias in our loss for a single connected component.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Please see the Supplement for additional results and ablation studies.
