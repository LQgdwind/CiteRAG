      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Structure-Guided Diffusion Model for 2D Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n2D Human Pose Estimation.\nModern 2D human pose estimation methods    [ref]50 usually adopt neural networks to extract deep features, then estimate human poses from deep features. Therefore, related works mainly focus on the backbone network [ref]48  , pose representation [ref]29 , and the framework of multi-person pose estimation  .\nHourglass [ref]29 stacks a multi-stage CNN network to extract features and regress 2D keypoints heatmaps to localize the coordinates of human joints. Based on the heatmap representation, SimpleBaseline [ref]48, HRNet , and ViTPose [ref]50 propose different backbone networks to extract better features, respectively. Except for the heatmap-based representation, some regression-based methods   also explore the different expressions of 2D human poses. To tackle the multiple instances in an image, three different frameworks are proposed. Top-down methods [ref]48  [ref]50 first detect human bounding boxes, then apply the single-person pose models on the cropped images with human boxes. Bottom-up methods   first estimate human poses, then assign them to different persons. One-stage methods   directly regress multi-person poses from an image by keypoints offsets or pose tokens in a single stage. Pose Refinement.\nSome methods      refine learned human poses by structure or distribution information. Graph-PCNN  adopts a two-stage graph pose refinement module to refine the human pose from sampled keypoints on heatmaps. PoseFix  proposes a model-agnostic general human pose refinement network to refine the estimated 2D pose from any pose model. DARK  proposes a distribution-aware coordinate representation to modulate 2D heatmaps. Although great improvements have been achieved through these approaches, their successes still rely on the quality of original heatmaps generated by the first stage.\nIn this paper, we aim to propose a new scheme for generating heatmaps via diffusion models.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: 2D Human Pose Estimation.\nModern 2D human pose estimation methods    [ref]50 usually adopt neural networks to extract deep features, then estimate human poses from deep features.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
