      "content": "Paper Title: Perceptions of Fairness and Trustworthiness Based on Explanations in Human vs. Automated Decision-Making\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomated decision-making has been increasingly adopted in areas such as hiring , lending , or even policing .\nAs the underlying systems, often referred to as automated decision systems (ADS), are informing evermore high-stakes decisions, it is of utmost importance to understand their inner workings—particularly for individuals affected by their decisions, because any malfunction (e.g., unfair decisions) will have staggering consequences for them. The reasons for adopting ADS are manifold  .\nIn fact, if properly designed and deployed, they are a valuable tool to combat stereotyping and thus contribute to overall social equity, e.g., in the fields of recruitment  , health care  [ref]8, or financial inclusion .\nThat said, ADS are typically based on artificial intelligence (AI)—specifically, machine learning (ML)—techniques, which leverage historical data to inform future decisions.\nNow, if historical data is biased (e.g., because certain socio-demographic groups were systematically disfavored), an ADS will likely pick up and perpetuate existing patterns of unfairness 0.\nA significant body of research on algorithmic fairness from the recent past has identified such instances where ADS are causing harmful outcomes, e.g., in job ad delivery 1, facial recognition 2, recidivism prediction 3, or grading 4.\nThese instances, among others, have likely been contributing to a recent general decline in trust towards AI 5. In recent years, an extensive body of research has been devoted to detecting and mitigating unfairness in ADS—mainly from a computer science viewpoint 6.\nA significant part of this work, however, has focused on formalizing the concept of fairness and modifying ML algorithms to satisfy different statistical equity constraints, without considering the feedback of individuals affected by automated decisions.\nAmong others, Srivastava et al. 7 emphasize this need for better understanding people’s attitudes towards fairness of ADS.\nWe argue that this research gap creates the potential for a plethora of high-impact contributions from information systems (IS) research around people’s perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness towards ADS.\nThis work is vital not only from a moral perspective but also regarding the effective design and implementation of ADS—with the end goal of creating decision systems that are fair, trustworthy, and, as a result, suitable for wide adoption.\nTo that end, we conduct a study to better understand people’s perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness towards ADS in comparison to the (hypothetical) scenario where a human instead of an ADS makes the decision.\nWe furthermore analyze how these perceptions may change depending on people’s background and experience with AI. Another issue of ADS revolves around explaining automated decisions to affected individuals.\nIt is widely understood that opaque (i.e., black box) ML models do not allow for meaningful interpretations as to how or why certain outcomes were arrived at 8 9.\nPrior research has also shown that explanations can be an effective tool for more transparent decision-making 0 1.\nTherefore, in this work, we provide study participants with thorough explanations regarding decisions—identical for both the case of the ADS and the human decision-maker.\nThe context of our study is lending, which is a common high-stakes application of ADS 2.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: .\nIn fact, if properly designed and deployed, they are a valuable tool to combat stereotyping and thus contribute to overall social equity, e.g., in the fields of recruitment  , health care  [ref]8, or financial inclusion .\nThat said, ADS are typically based on artificial intelligence (AI)—specifically, machine learning (ML)—techniques, which leverage historical data to inform future\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
