      "content": "Paper Title: Monkey Business: Reinforcement learning meets neighborhood search for Virtual Network Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe fifth-generation (5G) communications system is envisioned to serve a variety of novel services and industries, such as, autonomous vehicles, Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and remote healthcare, each requiring different Quality-of-Service (QoS).\nIn this context, network slicing is a new way to manage telecommunication networks in a similar manner to what is done with cloud computing, relying on virtualization. The idea is that an operator owns a physical network (analogous to a data center for cloud computing) that can host multiple virtual networks (or slices). The operator can instantiate slices on the fly to a third party service provider. Each slice provides resources in an isolated, adaptable and dynamic manner. Service providers can have demands for slices with specific QoS/security constraints, topologies and resource requirements. Slices would be implemented using Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN). The former allows to instantiate Network Functions (NFs - entities managing networking blocks such as authentication, gateways, etc). The latter enables packet routing to be modified by a centralized controller, enabling efficient and adaptable configuration of links (”virtual links”) of the slice.\nThe interest of such an approach mainly lies in its flexibility:\none could envision supporting various use cases such as autonomous vehicles (requiring ultra low latency and ultra high reliability), virtual reality (requiring high throughput) or sensor networks (requiring an enormous amount of connections on a small area). In the current ”one size fits all” paradigm, supporting such use cases would imply building a new physical network for each one, which would hardly be economically viable. In this context, an important question is how to place slices on such a network: clients give the operator slice (virtual network) requests in the form of interconnected NFs (e.g. a graph), and the operator tries to embed them onto the physical infrastructure (e.g. to provide enough CPU for each virtual node and enough bandwidth for each virtual link between those nodes), by accepting as many slices as possible, so as to maximize the operator’s gain.\nThis problem is known as Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem which has been extensively studied in the recent years[ref]5. The VNE being NP-complete and inapproximable , running an exact algorithm is not an option in most cases. Various methods have been studied for this problem, among which many are heuristic algorithms based on Linear programming, ranking algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL) methods . We are particularly interested in the latter ones, as these approaches enable to construct heuristics in an autonomous manner, based on experience and learning while solving the on-line version of the problem, where slices arrive and leave the system over time. Research on RL methods is still lacking, as current neural networks based methods either have hard constraints on the network topologies 0 or require very large amount of computing resources for training . On the other hand, Monte Carlo based methods such as  still have large rooms for improvement, as we show in this work. These shortcomings of other RL approaches are further developped in section 2. \nIn this paper, our main contribution is to provide a new state-of-the-art algorithm called Neighborhood Enhanced Policy Adaptation for this problem which combines reinforcement learning techniques with neighborhood search.\nThis article builds on our previous work from 1, since it improves the proposed Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA)2 algorithm with a neighborhood search technique. To our knowledge this is the first time the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based NRPA algorithm is complemented with such neighborhood search technique for any problem, enabling it to beat several state-of-the-art algorithms. The MCTS approach (called Maven-S) from  uses UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees)3, which is adapted to stochastic problems. On the other hand, NRPA is specifically adapted to deterministic optimization problems. In our case, we do not know the slices in advance making the arrival process stochastic; however, once a slice arrives it is fully observable, and so is the physical network, making NRPA more adapted to tackle the placement of slices, given the current state of the network. NRPA learns through exploring the NF placement possibilities of the slice at random while learning weights for biasing future explorations, which enables it to focus on regions of the search space that have been the most rewarding so far while still maintaining a good level of exploration. These characteristics make it a very efficient algorithm for solving the VNE. However we show it can be further enhanced when combining it with neighborhood search. They key idea is that NRPA bases its search on the tree structure of the search space, which is good for quickly finding good solutions. However it can limit exploration of new, better branch once the algorithm has converged. Neighborhood search enables us to exploit knowledge of those good solutions for jumping to better branches of the search tree (similar to how monkeys jump from branch to branch) and continue the search from there, which enables better future exploration.\nWe also propose a heuristic for initialization of the weights, and we show our numerical results, showing an improvement in the slice acceptance probability on real and synthetic networks compared to other methods, and therefore an increase in financial gains for an operator. Our contributions in this paper are then the following :\n We combine NRPA with neighborhood search and our heuristic weight initialization, deriving the Neighborhood Enhanced Policy Adaptation (NEPA) algorithm for the virtual network embedding problem which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both acceptance and revenue-to-cost ratio on all tested instances, including both synthetic and real topologies. Our approach is particularly effective on real topologies, on which it can even triple the number of accepted slices compared to some of the previous algorithms. We also investigate the topological features of those real topologies and explain how our algorithm can exploit them. Note that NRPA had never been used for the VNE problem. We publish a large set of testing scenarios for the community to experiment with, patching a lack of publicly available instances for quicker experimentation and comparisons (126 instances). We publish our implementations of several algorithms publicly (including NRPA, NEPA and algorithms from 4), since during this work, we found most algorithms lacked a well-documented implementation. To our knowledge, we are the first to explore the combination of NRPA with neighborhood search for any problem. We believe the idea can be exploited in other application where NRPA has been successful and where good neighborhood search algorithms are known such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)5 or the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)6 Finally, we assess wether the results of NEPA for the VNE can be improved by utilizing the reward function described in 7 (see Appendix B). The paper is organized as follows :\nSection I introduced our work, section II presents our litterature review of the VNE, then section III presents our model. We describe NEPA in section IV, section V presents our numerical experiments, and in section VI we summarize our work and we propose extensions and future perspectives\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: by accepting as many slices as possible, so as to maximize the operator’s gain.\nThis problem is known as Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem which has been extensively studied in the recent years[ref]5.
