Since these are IQA models, they do not take into account any temporal information. They were computed on every frame and averaged across all frames to obtain final video scores. In addition to the above IQA metrics, we also included 5 popular FR-VQA models: ST-RRED , SpEED [ref]6, FRQM[ref]27, VMAF111We used the pretrained VMAF model available at https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf  and deepVQA . When evaluating deepVQA, we only used stage-1 of the pretrained model (trained on the LIVE-VQA 4 database) obtained from the code released by the authors. All of the above methods other than FRQM require the reference and corresponding distorted sequences to have the same frame rate. When there were differences in frame rates, we performed naive temporal upsampling by frame duplication to match the reference frame rate. Another way of matching the frame rates is to downsample the reference video, however we did not use this method since it often introduces temporal artifacts in the reference video, such as stutter/judder which is undesirable. We also ignored highly specific temporal upsampling methods (e.g. motion compensated temporal interpolation), as the performances of these can be highly susceptible to the type of content considered and to the choice of interpolation method. Evaluation Criteria.\nWe employed Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficient (SROCC), Kendall’s rank order correlation coefficient (KROCC), Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient (PLCC), and root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the VQA models. All of the above metrics are calculated using DMOS values of the VQA dataset as ground truth. Before computing PLCC and RMSE, the predicted scores were passed through a four-parameter logistic non-linearity as described in 5:\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: They were computed on every frame and averaged across all frames to obtain final video scores. In addition to the above IQA metrics, we also included 5 popular FR-VQA models: ST-RRED , SpEED [ref]6, FRQM[ref]27, VMAF111We used the pretrained VMAF model available at https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf  and deepVQA .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
