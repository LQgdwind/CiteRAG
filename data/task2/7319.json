Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

The host CPU is CVA6[ref]18, which is a 6 stages, single-issue, in-order, 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V core, supporting the RV64GC ISA variant, SV39 virtual memory with a dedicated Memory Management Unit (MMU), three levels of privilege (Machine, Supervisor, User), and PMP .\nThe parallel hardware accelerator is the so-called PULP cluster.\nIt is built around 8 CV32E4-based cores [ref]21 sharing 16×\\times8 kB SRAM banks, composing a 128 kB L1 SPM.\nEach core has a private Floating Point Unit (FPU) supporting single-precision (FP32) and half-precision (FP16) floating-point formats.\nThe cluster also features a hierarchical I-cache directly connected to the cluster’s internal AXI interconnect. CVA6 and the cluster are the managers of the systems connected to the main AXI crossbar, which routes their requests to the desired subordinates according to the memory map.\nThe main subordinates of the systems are, respectively (i) the on-chip SRAM memory, (ii) the APB subsystem, and (iii) the off-chip main memory.\nThe on-chip memory is used for low-latency, high-bandwidth data storage.\nThe APB subsystem is used to communicate with off-chip sensors or memories through the commodity IOs.\nDifferently from high-end embedded systems relying on relatively power-hungry and expensive DDR3/4/5 memories, the platform under analysis adopts HyperRAMs as off-chip main memory, which are fully-digital low-power small-area DRAMs with less than 14 IO pins and that provide enough capacity to boot Linux  and bandwidth for IoT applications .\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: under analysis, namely (i) controllers, (ii) the main crossbar, (iii) bridges, and (iv) peripherals, which we model in the next Section.\nThe architecture leverages a set of fully open-source PULP IPs[ref]16.\nIt is based on Cheshire, an open-source host platform consisting of an RV64 Linux-capable CPU, a set of commodity IOs (SPI, SDIO, UART, …), and an AXI-based crossbar with a configurable\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
