      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating Markov Random Field Inference with Uncertainty Quantification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStatistical machine learning has widespread applications\nsuch as image analysis [ref]31, natural language processing ,\nglobal health 9, wireless communications , autonomous driving , etc.    .\nMany such approaches use probabilistic algorithms,\ne.g., Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC), which can be adopted to create\ngeneralized frameworks for solving a wide range of problems.\nCompared to Deep Neural Networks, these methods make it easier to gain insight\ninto why a result is obtained, and to what degree we can be certain about\nthe results. This can be achieved by quantifying the uncertainty of the result.\nThis is a very important feature in some contexts, such as many\nimage segmentation applications where quantifying the uncertainty\nin the segmentation boundaries is crucial (e.g., a surgeon’s\ndecision to resect what sections of a tumor will be impacted by the\nsegmentation generated by an algorithm  ). However, the benefits of MCMC come at a price. Since MCMC\nrequires iteratively sampling from probability\ndistributions, it is often computationally intensive.\nThis is due to the significant overhead of\nsampling in conventional processors . Furthermore,\nMCMC at first appears to be a sequential algorithm because updating each random\nvariable (RV) depends on the latest value of all other RVs, which\nmeans that it may take a long time to finish. Deploying\npseudo-random number generation can help reduce the\nsampling inefficiency 0. To avoid the overhead of serial execution,\nthough, one can take advantage of the conditional independence of RVs,\ni.e., develop a schedule which allows multiple independent\nRVs be updated in parallel  6  4. In this paper, we propose an accelerator which builds on these ideas\nand fuses them with architectural contributions that allow fast and\nefficient execution of MCMC and minimize the overhead of uncertainty\nquantification. To be more specific, we propose a tiled architecture\nto exploit near-memory computing, and the parallelism exposed by taking\nadvantage of the conditional independence of RVs in the first-order\nMarkov Random Field (MRF) model. MRF is a powerful model that can be\nutilized to represent a wide range of problems [ref]31  .\nOur proposed accelerator supports first-order MRF inference using MCMC in two modes of pure sampling or optimization. The main difference is that in optimization mode, the algorithm converges faster whereas in pure sampling mode the exact distribution of the solution is obtained which can be used in uncertainty quantification. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the pure sampling mode.\nWe develop memory\nbanking and on-chip communications schemes tailored to the semantics\nof the MRF model to facilitate a stall-free pipeline (Contribution 1). Our proposed accelerator targets first-order MRF, and although not general enough for all MCMC applications, it supports an important class of algorithms (stereo vision, image segmentation, motion estimation/optical flow) that are utilized by numerous higher-level computer vision applications. Many of our\nproposed techniques are also applicable to other structured probabilistic models. This work takes the first steps toward using these techniques for designing more generalized probabilistic accelerators. As part of our tiled accelerator architecture, we propose\na novel hybrid on-chip/off-chip memory system to efficiently support uncertainty quantification (Contribution 2).\nProbabilistic algorithms solve problems by gradually converging toward the final solution, and thus,\nregardless of model or domain, most RVs change labels less often. To quantify this effect,\nwe carefully analyze the behavior of two image analysis applications  ,\nand observe that most RVs take on a limited number of unique labels during\nthe execution. We build on this insight to design the novel memory system that\nstores a few more frequently selected values on-chip, and sends the rest to off-chip\nmemory to form a log, which is processed at the end of the execution to generate\nthe histogram of RVs used for uncertainty quantification. This approach strikes\na balance between on-chip memory capacity and off-chip communication\nbandwidth. Our experiments on an FPGA prototype for two image analysis applications show that our proposed approach for uncertainty quantification reduces off-chip memory bandwidth usage by 71% compared to naïvely storing all RV values at every iteration. Even though we use this solution in the context of first-order MRF\ninference, we believe the insight should hold for other types of probabilistic\nalgorithms accelerators.111This solution is applicable to\nproblems that have discrete random variables. We implement an FPGA prototype of our proposed design using Intel\nHigh-Level Synthesis (HLS) compiler , and developed the necessary\nruntime to verify and evaluate our implementation using real-world\napplications and input datasets. The results show that our design\nachieves a clock rate of 146MHz and a throughput of 4.672B\nlabels/sec on an Arria 10 FPGA. This is 26×\\times speedup over\nprevious work . We also perform ASIC\nanalysis on our HLS implementation using Mentor Graphics HLS Compiler 7\nand show that an accelerator with 2048 function units running at 3GHz in 15nm\ntechnology node  outperforms GPU implementations of motion estimation\nand stereo vision on an RTX 2080 Ti by 120×\\times-210×\\times while only occupying 7.7% of the area.\nMoreover, the aforementioned ASIC design point supports real-time processing of Full-HD images with\n64 labels per pixel at 30fps for 1500 iterations per frame. (Contribution 3). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides\na brief background about probabilistic algorithms and\nthe motivation for our work. The overview and challenges of\ndesigning the accelerator are discussed in\nSection III. Section IV describes the\nproposed architecture. Sections V and VI\npresent implementation and evaluation methodology, and\ndiscussion of the results. Related work is reviewed in\nSection VII. Finally, Section VIII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Statistical machine learning has widespread applications\nsuch as image analysis [ref]31, natural language processing ,\nglobal health 9, wireless communications , autonomous driving , etc.    .\nMany such approaches use probabilistic algorithms,\ne.g., Markov chain Monte-Carlo\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
