      "content": "Paper Title: HVPR: Hybrid Voxel-Point Representation for Single-stage 3D Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-sensory data, obtained from \\eg, RGB and depth sensors, provides complementary information for 3D object detection. For example, RGB and depth images give semantic and structural information of objects, respectively. Many approaches attempt to leverage features from RGB images and point clouds jointly for 3D object detection. MV3D  generates object proposals from BEV representations, and refines them using features from point clouds and RGB images. AVOD  instead incorporates these features to extract object proposals, which provides better detection results. To further enhance 3D representations, proxy tasks are also exploited , such as a ground estimation with point clouds and a depth completion with RGB images. Recent methods   also handle the case when multi-sensory data is not registered. They leverage correspondences between features from point clouds and RGB images to better exploit the complementary information. Recent approaches to 3D object detection use point clouds alone from a LiDAR sensor. They can be divided into two categories, voxel-based and point-based methods, depending on how to transform point clouds to 3D representations for localizing objects. First, voxel-based approaches convert irregular point clouds into ordered grid representations. Early works   exploit a BEV image, obtained by projecting raw point clouds, which provides a compact 3D representation and preserves the scales of objects. Hand-crafted BEV representations are, however, limited to obtain accurate 3D features for object localization. Recent methods represent point clouds in a form of 3D voxels     0. They often use 3D convolutions to extract features from the voxel representation, which is computationally inefficient. To alleviate this problem, PointPillars  propose to use a pseudo-image. Representing 3D voxels in a form of an image allows to exploit 2D convolutions, resulting in more efficient 3D object detection, compared to using 3D voxels directly. The voxel-based approaches mainly have two limitations: (1) Fine-grained 3D structures are lost during voxelization; (2) The localization performance largely depends on the size of voxel grids. As the grid size becomes smaller, fine-grained 3D representations can be obtained but at the cost of more runtime. Second, point-based approaches leverage raw point clouds directly. They extract point-based features, typically using PointNet++  , that provide more accurate spatial representations than 3D voxels. These approaches thus perform better than the voxel-based one in terms of detection accuracy. It is, however, computationally demanding to extract point-based features directly from a large amount of point clouds for \\eg, outdoor sceneries. To circumvent this issue, point-based approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline. Specifically, they estimate 3D object proposals either using point-based features   or off-the-shelf 2D object detectors  [ref]38 in the first stage. The object proposals are then refined with the point-based features inside the proposals for final predictions in the second stage. Recently, PV-RCNN [ref]33 and Fast Point R-CNN [ref]6 further reduce the computational cost of point-based approaches. They propose to exploit voxel-based features to generate 3D object proposals in the first stage, while refining them to estimate final 3D bounding boxes with point-based features in the second stage. Since these methods exploit 3D voxels and raw point clouds separately in different stages, they do not fully leverage the complementary information of the two representations. Moreover, the point-based approaches are still slower than voxel-based methods, even leveraging a single-stage framework  [ref]38. Our approach belongs to the voxel-based method in the sense that it uses a pseudo image representation of point clouds, similar to PointPillars . In contrast to previous voxel-based methods, we also exploit point-based features for the pseudo image representation in an efficient way, which boosts the detection performance significantly, while retaining fast runtime. Our approach is similar to recent point-based methods [ref]6 [ref]33  in that it exploits both voxel-based and point-based features [ref]6 [ref]33. On the contrary, we leverage both voxel-based and point-based representations jointly within a single-stage framework. We weave both representations in a form of a pseudo image, allowing to exploit 2D convolutions for efficient 3D object detection. Moreover, we further reduce the computational cost for extracting point-based features via augmenting a feature encoder with a memory module. Memory networks  have been introduced to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data by augmenting a neural network with an external memory module that can be read and written to. Based on this idea, recent works develop more advanced architectures using continuous memory representations  or a key-value memory . A number of approaches have adopted the memory-augmented networks to solve various computer vision tasks including visual question answering   , one-shot learning   , anomaly detection  7, and person recognition  .\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: To circumvent this issue, point-based approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline.
