      "content": "Paper Title: Bootstrapping Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Anatomical-aware Contrastive Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nManually labeling sufficient medical data with pixel-level accuracy is time-consuming, expensive, and often requires domain-specific knowledge. To bypass the cost for labeled data, semi-supervised learning (SSL) is one of the promising, conventional ways to train models with weaker forms of supervision, given a large amount of unlabeled data. Existing SSL methods include adversarial training     , deep co-training  , mean teacher schemes  , multi-task learning    , and contrastive learning  [ref]9 4 5  0. Among the aforementioned methods, contrastive learning [ref]8  has recently prevailed for DNNs to rich visual representations from unlabeled data. The predominant promise of label-free learning is to capture the similar semantic relationship and anatomical structure between neighboring pixels from massive unannotated data. However, going to realistic clinical scenarios will have the following shortcomings. First, different medical images share similar anatomical structures, but prior methods follow the standard contrastive learning  [ref]8 in comparing positive and negative pairs by binary supervision. That naturally leads to the issues of false negatives in representation learning  , which would hurt segmentation performance. Second, the underlying class distribution of medical image data is highly imbalanced, as illustrated in Figure 1. It is well known that such imbalanced distribution will severely hurt the segmentation quality , which may result in blurry contours and mis-classify minority classes due to the occurrence frequencies 9. That naturally questions whether contrastive learning can still work well in those imbalance scenarios. In this work, we present a principled framework called Anatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON (ACTION), for multi-class medical image segmentation. In contrast to prior work  [ref]9 5 which directly distinguish two image samples of the similar anatomical features that are in the negative pairs, the key innovation in ACTION is to actively learn more balanced representations by dynamically selecting samples that are semantically similar to the queries, and contrasting the model’s anatomical-level features with the target model’s in imbalanced and unlabeled clinical scenarios. Specifically, we introduce two strategies to improve overall segmentation quality: (1) we believe that all negative samples are not equally negative. Thus, we propose relaxed contrastive learning by using soft labeling on the negatives. In other words, we randomly sample a set of image samples as anchor points to ensure diversity in the set of sampled examples. Then the teacher model predicts the underlying probability distribution over neighboring samples by computing the anatomical similarities between the query and the anchor points in the memory bank, and the student model tries to learn from the teacher model. Such a strategy is much more regularized by mincing the same neighborhood anatomical similarity to improve the quality of the anatomical features; (2) to create strong contrastive views on anatomical features, we introduce AnCo, another new contrastive loss designed at the anatomical level, by sampling a set of pixel-level representation as queries, and pulling them closer to the mean feature of all representations in a class (positive keys), and pulling other representations apart from other class (negative keys). In addition to reducing the high memory footprint and computation complexity, we use active sampling to dynamically select a sparse set of queries and keys during the training. We apply ACTION on two benchmark datasets under different unlabeled settings. Our experiments show that ACTION can dramatically outperform the state-of-the-art SSL methods. We believe that our proposed ACTION can be a strong baseline for the related medical image analysis tasks in the future.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: given a large amount of unlabeled data.
