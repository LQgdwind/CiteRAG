      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Neural Networks Fused with Textures for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe test results with 3×3333\\times 3 patches and two LBP structures i.e., (8, 1) and (8, 2) with a total 512 textures are given in Table 1. The feature size of LSTM’s hidden unit is 512, and after concatenating with histograms of LBP, size of final feature map is 1024. The last-row estimates the parameters (Millions) of various models. The accuracy (%) is very decent, except age-invariant face recognition (AIFR) i.e., FG-Net. Many existing methods have experimented on FG-Net dataset for AIFR by following leave-one-person out strategy , . In our set-up, FG-Net test-set includes at least one unseen image per person by splitting 1002 samples into train-test (83:17) sets. Here, we have tested this challenging dataset for FGIC rather than AIFR. Hence, DNT is not directly comparable with existing methods. However, DNT attains better results (Table 1 and Table 3) than NTCA (48.96%) , and other works on AIFR . The REST dataset  is primarily tested for palmprint based biometric identification using traditional textures and more recently using CNNs. In this work, we have tested the left-hand images of REST dataset for classification using full hand-shapes and its class-labels only, i.e., without determining any region of interests for palmprint, or additional pre-processing stage. The proposed DNT has achieved 85.79% top-1 accuracy using DenseNet-201. The precision is 90.0% and recall is 86.0%. On the contrary, the SIFT descriptors  reported 80.83% palmprint identification success with the samples of 150 persons. Though, our DNT is not directly comparable with this existing work, yet, the gain of our method is significant on this dataset.\nThe ISIC 2017 dataset comprising with 2000 lesion images are classified into 3 categories, namely Melanoma, Seborrheic keratosis and Nevu in . The classification accuracy is 85.7% using Lesion Indexing Network (LIN). However, our method is not directly comparable with LIN . Our DNT has classified 7 skin diseases namely actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, nevus, pigmented benign keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and vascular lesion. The accuracy is  81.10%  using DenseNet-201 backbone. The confusion matrices are shown in Fig. 5, representing the performance of DNT using ResNet-50 and DenseNet-201 base CNNs. FoodNet presents classification of 50 Indian food-dishes [ref]15, and achieves 73.50% accuracy using an ensemble method. It consists 100 images per class and 80% images per class are used for training. We have used similar 80 dishes with 50 images per class, following 60:40 train-test ratio. DNT achieves 80.75% and 74.75% accuracy using DenseNet-201 and ResNet-50, respectively (Table 3). We have tested on ThaiFood-50 , and the accuracy is 80.42%. In , the accuracy is 83.07% using ResNet-50. On the contrary, DNT attains 95.18% using DenseNet-201, and 91.93% by ResNet-50 (Table 3). The performance on other datasets are also high. However, to the best of our knowledge, no significant results have been reported on dataset, like sea-life. We have reported the results in the context of FGIC on these datasets for further research. The overall classification performances of various CNNs using 3×3333\\times 3 patches and 2×25622562\\times 256 LBP on Indian food dishes and celebrity faces are shown in Fig. 6. It is evident that accuracy improvement is very small after 100 epochs. ResNet-50 and Xception are comparatively heavier models than the DenseNet family regarding the model parameters. Whereas, MobileNet-v2 is a lightweight model, yet, very efficient for FGIC. Next, experiments on Indian food and flower show accuracy gain using 4×4444\\times 4 patches while other components are unaltered. This test is comprised with 16 patches, 512 LBP and 512 LSTM features. The results imply more patches improve accuracy (Table 2). We have increased the number of LSTM’s hidden states and number of patches. This test is carried out with the fused features of 1024 textures (LBP), and 1024 LSTM units encoded from 16 patches. The results are reported in Table 3. Clearly, DenseNet-201 performs the best among four base CNNs, while other backbones produce satisfactory results. The significance of major components of DNT are tested, and the results are given in Table 4. Particularly, the benefits of random erasing over general image augmentation, number of patches, textures (LBP), LSTM, and their further increment in the feature space are investigated for performance improvement on two datasets using DenseNet-121 (DN-121). The ablative results justify the usefulness of essential components of the proposed DNT.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: backbone.
