      "content": "Paper Title: Planning for Sample Efficient Imitation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImitation learning¬†(IL) aims to solve the sequential decision-making problems with expert demonstration data. It has wide applications in games and robotics¬†[ref]4. Compared with RL, one major benefit of IL is that it can avoid the notorious reward design problem. IL can be divided into two branches: BC¬† and IRL¬†[ref]33. To solve the covariate shift problem of BC, researchers propose methods like dataset aggregation¬† and noise injection¬†. But these methods either require extra expert queries or exert constraints over the learning process. A recent variant branch of IRL is the Adversarial Imitation Learning¬†(AIL)¬†6 . AIL models IL as a state-action distribution matching problem. Many works extend AIL by using better distribution metrics such as fùëìf-divergence¬† and Wasserstein distance¬†. Though these methods can learn better reward functions and somewhat speed up the training, they do not directly focus on AIL‚Äôs sample efficiency problem. Some works have drawn attention to sample efficiency, for example¬†  5 propose to use off-policy training in AIL training to reduce sample complexity. ValueDICE¬† reformulates AIL objective in an offline min-max optimization process, but recent work points out that it is an improved form of BC¬†. VMAIL¬† uses a model-based approach to improve sample efficiency. It collects latent rollout with a variational model and reduces online interactions. MoBILE¬† also shows a provably sample efficient model-based imitation approach. Compared with these methods, our method introduces MCTS planning to the off-policy imitation learning and uses it to unify BC and AIL to take advantage of both. The idea of combining BC and AIL helps to improve the sample efficiency can be traced back to GAIL6. GAIL suggests using BC to initialize the policy network, but¬† finds that this does not work well because the initialized BC knowledge will be corrupted in AIL training. Then,  proposes to use an annealed¬†(decaying) BC loss to regularize policy training to solve this problem. But in this work, we find that such a BC regularizer can be harmful to exploration when BC is incorrect. One concurrent work mitigates this issue by using adpative BC loss and replacing AIL reward with optimal-transport-based imitation reward¬†3. We also notice that AlphaGo¬† involves BC in their method, but they focus on RL rather than IL, and BC is only used to initialize the policy. Different from these methods, EI uses BC actions as candidates in MCTS.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Imitation learning¬†(IL) aims to solve the sequential decision-making problems with expert demonstration data.
