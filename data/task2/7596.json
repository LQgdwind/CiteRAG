      "content": "Paper Title: Maximally Extendable Sheaf Codes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent constructions of asymptotically good111An infinite family of classical or quantum codes is called (asymptotically) good if both the dimension and the distance of the codes grows as Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) with the length n→∞→𝑛n\\to\\infty. classical locally testable codes (LTCs) and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes  [ref]2  [ref]4 are all based on the idea of lifting a small local (tensor) product code to a large global code. However, for these constructions to work, it is required that the local product code has a very specific property that can be expressed topologically as a coboundary expansion of a bipartite graph with a sheaf on it [ref]5. When we lift the product code, its local coboundary expansion propagates to the global one222Originally this was only formally shown for the quantum Tanner codes , the simplified version of the expander lifted product codes [ref]2. However, this holds for all current constructions .  , which implies many interesting properties of the obtained codes, including single-shot  linear time decoding  0 , NLTS property 1, , and linear energy barriers 2.\nGood​ qLDPC​ codes​ can​ also​ be​ converted to​ geometrically local codes 3,​ 2 4. Sheaf theoretic approach to classical linear codes, has spurred a lot of interest recently 5 6 7, [ref]2 [ref]5 8 9 . In fact, already in 5, Irit Dinur and Tali Kaufman study333In the language of algebraic topology, what they study corresponds to the idea of Čech cohomology of a sheaf., in the context of property testing, the obstructions to gluing together local pieces of data into the global one, and introduced agreement tests. In the current work, we conceptualize and generalize these ideas along with more recent research 8 9 , and introduce a new concept that we call a sheaf code. Essentially, a sheaf code is just a specific type of Tanner code\nℱ​(X)={c∈𝔽2n∣c|Xσ∈ℱσ,σ∈X}ℱ𝑋conditional-set𝑐superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛formulae-sequenceevaluated-at𝑐subscript𝑋𝜎subscriptℱ𝜎𝜎𝑋\\mathcal{F}(X)=\\{c\\in\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}\\mid c|_{X_{\\sigma}}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma},\\sigma\\in X\\}\ndefined by a hierarchical collection444It means that for σ⩽τ𝜎𝜏\\sigma\\leqslant\\tau in X𝑋X we have Xτ⊆Xσsubscript𝑋𝜏subscript𝑋𝜎X_{\\tau}\\subseteq X_{\\sigma}, and c∈ℱσ𝑐subscriptℱ𝜎c\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} implies c|Xτ∈ℱτevaluated-at𝑐subscript𝑋𝜏subscriptℱ𝜏c|_{X_{\\tau}}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau} . We also assume that X𝑋X has exactly n𝑛n maximal elements identified with the elements of [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n], and ℱσ=𝔽2subscriptℱ𝜎subscript𝔽2\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}=\\mathbb{F}_{2}, σ∈[n]𝜎delimited-[]𝑛\\sigma\\in[n]. of local codes ℱσ⊆𝔽2Xσsubscriptℱ𝜎superscriptsubscript𝔽2subscript𝑋𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{X_{\\sigma}}, Xσ⊆[n]subscript𝑋𝜎delimited-[]𝑛X_{\\sigma}\\subseteq[n], indexed by some poset X𝑋X, playing the role of a topological space555In fact, finite topological spaces and finite posets are almost the same thing (see, Appendices A and D)., and called its coded space666This term is inspired by the term “ringed space” from sheaf theory, meaning a topological space equipped with a sheaf of rings on it.. This allows one to deal with such linear codes using topological methods. In particular, it is possible to study cohomology groups Hi​(X;ℱ)superscript𝐻𝑖𝑋ℱH^{i}(X;\\mathcal{F}) of these codes with local coefficients in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} (see Section VI). The groups Hi​(X;ℱ)superscript𝐻𝑖𝑋ℱH^{i}(X;\\mathcal{F}) are very interesting since they give us a very general way to define quantum codes out of the classical sheaf codes 8 9 . In fact, many existing qLDPC codes can be described in this way. For example, the famous Kitaev toric code  defined on the natural cellulation of a torus X=Cℓ×Cℓ𝑋subscript𝐶ℓsubscript𝐶ℓX=C_{\\ell}\\times C_{\\ell}, viewed as a cell poset, where Cℓsubscript𝐶ℓC_{\\ell} is a cycle graph with ℓℓ\\ell vertices, is H1​(X;𝔽2¯)superscript𝐻1𝑋¯subscript𝔽2H^{1}(X;\\underline{\\mathbb{F}_{2}}) if we denote by 𝔽2¯​(X)¯subscript𝔽2𝑋\\underline{\\mathbb{F}_{2}}(X) the constant sheaf code on X𝑋X, where all local codes are repetition codes. Another example is the codes form [ref]4, obtained by changing the roles of checks and qubits in the expander lifted product codes777While both codes are lifted product codes , they also belong to the classes of fiber bundle  and balanced product 7 codes. [ref]2. These codes can be represented as H1​(X;ℱ)superscript𝐻1𝑋ℱH^{1}(X;\\mathcal{F}), where ℱ​(X)=𝒜​(Γ)⊗Gℬ​(Γ)ℱ𝑋subscripttensor-product𝐺𝒜ΓℬΓ\\mathcal{F}(X)=\\mathcal{A}(\\Gamma)\\otimes_{G}\\mathcal{B}(\\Gamma) is the balanced product (Definition 12) of two Zémor codes  𝒜​(Γ)𝒜Γ\\mathcal{A}(\\Gamma) and ℬ​(Γ)ℬΓ\\mathcal{B}(\\Gamma), considered as sheaf codes on ΓΓ\\Gamma. Note that the classical codes ℱ​(X)ℱ𝑋\\mathcal{F}(X) are essentially the same as the good classical LTCs constructed in . A sheaf theoretic approach to Tanner codes allows us to define a new property of such codes, that we call maximal extendibility. This idea is inspired by the notion of maximally recoverable (MR) codes  , studied in the context of locally recoverable codes  . Given a sheaf code ℱ​(X)⊆𝔽nℱ𝑋superscript𝔽𝑛\\mathcal{F}(X)\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{n}, we say that an index set U⊆X𝑈𝑋U\\subseteq X of local codes is extendable if every “local” codeword c∈𝔽∪σ∈UXσ𝑐superscript𝔽subscript𝜎𝑈subscript𝑋𝜎{c\\in\\mathbb{F}^{\\cup_{\\sigma\\in U}X_{\\sigma}}} satisfying only local constraints c|Xσ∈ℱσevaluated-at𝑐subscript𝑋𝜎subscriptℱ𝜎c|_{X_{\\sigma}}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}, σ∈U𝜎𝑈{\\sigma\\in U}, can be extended to a “global” codeword c^∈𝒞^𝑐𝒞{\\hat{c}\\in\\mathcal{C}}, satisfying all the constraints888In the language of sheaf theory, “local” and “global” codewords are called respectively local and global sections.. Furthermore, we say that 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is maximally extendable for a class of codes on the space X𝑋X (e.g., all product codes 𝒜⊗ℬtensor-product𝒜ℬ\\mathcal{A}\\otimes\\mathcal{B} with fixed dimensions of 𝒜,ℬ⊆𝔽2n𝒜ℬsuperscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{B}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}) if every set U⊆X𝑈𝑋U\\subseteq X extendable in some code from this class is also extendable in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. As it turns out, the maximally extendable999Since every information set U⊆[n]⊆X𝑈delimited-[]𝑛𝑋U\\subseteq[n]\\subseteq X for ℱ​(X)ℱ𝑋\\mathcal{F}(X) is clearly extendable, then for a maximally extendable code in a family of codes of the same dimension, if S𝑆S is an information set in some code from this family, then S𝑆S is also an information set of ℱ​(X)ℱ𝑋\\mathcal{F}(X). Hence, every maximally extendable code is also maximally recoverable. However, we do not know whether the converse is also true. product codes have asymptotically optimal coboundary expansion properties 0 for any number of component codes. Previously this was only known in the case of two codes [ref]4 [ref]5. The expansion properties of product codes in more than two dimensions are very important in the context of quantum LTCs 1. One possible way to attack the qLTC conjecture 2, 3, , positing the existence of good locally testable qLDPC codes (qLTCs), is to move away from the current paradigm [ref]2  [ref]4  of defining codes on ℓℓ\\ell-fold covering of products of graphs, to a more general paradigm of defining codes on arbitrary cubical complexes, which only locally looks like graph products. We think that an interesting direction of future research is to define sheaf codes on Ramanujan cubical complexes constructed in 4. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce main definitions and notations. In section III, we define sheaf codes and prove our main result. In sections IV–VII we give examples, introduce operations, and, finally, study the cohomology and the expansion of sheaf codes. We also have several appendices with some supplementary information.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the dimension and the distance of the codes grows as Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) with the length n→∞→𝑛n\\to\\infty. classical locally testable codes (LTCs) and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes  [ref]2  [ref]4 are all based on the idea of lifting a small local (tensor) product code to a large global code.
