      "content": "Paper Title: RepoFusion: Training Code Models to Understand Your Repository\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining of RepoFusion: We use the 220M parameter CodeT5-base¬†[ref]34 encoder-decoder model as our base code model for RepoFusion. We found that the pre-trained CodeT5 model was not good at completing Java code (see Appendix¬†C.3 for initial results).\nTherefore, to obtain a base model for RepoFusion training we finetuned CodeT5-base with an input context length of 512 using the next-token prediction objective on Java repositories from the dataset described in Section¬†3.1. Specifically, we used the repositories that were not included in Stack-Repo. For each file, we randomly sample ten pivot points with the code context prior to the pivot location in the file serving as the input to the encoder of CodeT5.\nThe finetuned CodeT5-base model was then used to initialize the training of RepoFusion.\nBased on the validation set performance, we found that for RepoFusion, NT-Prior-Last with N=32ùëÅ32N=32 and l=768ùëô768l=768 works the best. We provide complete details of training RepoFusion and finetuning CodeT5 in Appendix¬†B. Baselines: To benchmark the performance of RepoFusion, we conducted experiments with several methods, with each model utilizing the recommended tokenizers specific to the method and employing a maximum token generation limit of 128 per completion. To ensure a thorough analysis, we have incorporated encoder-decoder models as well as decoder-only models of different sizes, with varying context lengths and two different input context types. We present the details of the methods below: CodeT5 (FT): In addition to the previously described fine-tuned (FT) version of CodeT5-base, we also finetuned CodeT5-large (770M) with a context length of 512. Next, we assessed the performance of these models using input context lengths of 2048 and 4096. The input context was constructed by either considering the prior PPC (prior) alone or by concatenating equal lengths of the post PPC (post) and prior. BigCode models: We experimented with two models released by BigCode¬†888https://www.bigcode-project.org/. The first model is SantaCoder¬†, which is a 1.1B parameter model which supports a maximum context length of 2048 tokens and the second is the recently released StarCoderBase¬†[ref]18 model which is a 15.5B parameter model that can support up to 8192 tokens. Both of these models are trained with Fill-in-the-Middle¬† (FiM) objective on versions 1.1 and 1.2 of The Stack¬†[ref]17, respectively. These models were evaluated with both the prior and post+prior contexts as inputs. For experiments with post+prior, we used the FiM special tokens that were used while training these models. Since these models have been trained specifically to see the post PPC as suffix, they help us understand the role of training with multiple repo contexts in the way proposed by RepoFusion. CodeGen¬†4: CodeGen is a decoder-only transformer-based autoregressive model trained with the next-token prediction objective. It supports a maximum context length of 2048 tokens. We experimented with three pre-trained variants of CodeGen, namely CodeGen-2B-multi, CodeGen-6B-multi, and CodeGen-16B-multi. As before, we tried the scenarios where the input context consists of the post + prior as well as when the input context consists of just the prior. These models help us understand the performance of large pre-trained models that are not trained with repo context. It is important to note that when compared to our RepoFusion model, with the exception of CodeT5-base (FT), all other models are many times larger in size and have been trained on a significantly larger number of tokens. The rationale behind selecting these baselines is to compare the performance of training smaller models with additional repository context against training much larger models without incorporating repository context. Evaluation Metric: We conduct an exact string match between the predicted hole and the target hole, where the predicted hole is the string up to the occurrence of the first newline in the completion. If an exact match is found, it is considered a success; otherwise, it is deemed a failure. We measure the fraction of exact matches over the dataset and call it Success Rate.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Training of RepoFusion: We use the 220M parameter CodeT5-base¬†[ref]34 encoder-decoder model as our base code model for RepoFusion.
