Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2. Title: Federated Learning: Challenges, Methods, and Future Directions\n   Abstract: A comprehensive survey of federated learning approaches and challenges in distributed settings.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"citations\": [\n    {\n      \"ref_index\": 38,\n      \"titles\": [\n        \"Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\",\n        \"Federated Learning: Challenges, Methods, and Future Directions\",\n        \"Federated optimization in heterogeneous networks\",\n        \"Towards federated learning at scale: System design\",\n        \"A performance evaluation of federated learning algorithms\",\n        \"Distributed machine learning: A survey\",\n        \"Communication protocols for distributed learning\",\n        \"Scalable federated learning systems\",\n        \"Efficient distributed training algorithms\",\n        \"Large-scale distributed learning frameworks\"\n      ],\n      \"reasoning\": \"This [ref]38 appears in the context of 'massively distributed networks' for federated learning, so it likely refers to foundational papers on federated learning systems, distributed training, and communication-efficient methods in distributed networks.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"ref_index\": 5,\n      \"titles\": [\n        \"Bagging predictors\",\n        \"Ensemble methods in machine learning\",\n        \"Random forests for classification\",\n        \"Bootstrap methods and their application\",\n        \"Combining multiple classifiers\",\n        \"Large-scale machine learning systems\",\n        \"Distributed ensemble methods\",\n        \"Scalable classification algorithms\",\n        \"Massive data processing techniques\",\n        \"High-performance machine learning frameworks\"\n      ],\n      \"reasoning\": \"This [ref]5 appears in the context of 'at a large scale', suggesting it refers to papers on scaling machine learning methods, ensemble techniques, or methods that can handle large-scale data and distributed settings.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"ref_index\": 30,\n      \"titles\": [\n        \"Learning fair representations\",\n        \"Fair machine learning: A survey\",\n        \"Bias in machine learning systems\",\n        \"Addressing fairness in AI systems\",\n        \"Fair representation learning\",\n        \"Heterogeneous data handling methods\",\n        \"Multi-source learning algorithms\",\n        \"Cross-domain representation learning\",\n        \"Fair learning from diverse data\",\n        \"Bias mitigation in heterogeneous datasets\"\n      ],\n      \"reasoning\": \"This [ref]30 appears in the context of 'heterogeneous data' and 'fair representation learning', indicating it likely refers to papers on heterogenous data handling, bias mitigation, and learning representations that are fair across different data distributions.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

While RCE can be applied to LfO in principle, it tends to stay in a few expert states that are easy to reach in the offline setting, as discussed in Section C.2 of¬†[ref]5.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Recent approaches for LfO are mostly on-policy¬†[ref]26 [ref]39    algorithms and are not directly applicable to the offline LfO setting considered in this work.\nMobILE¬† is a model-based LfO algorithm, but it encourages uncertainty for online\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
