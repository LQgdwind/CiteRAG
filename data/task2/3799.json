      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Equilibrium Optical Flow Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to the inherent challenges of the flow estimation task, prior works have shown that explicit neural networks struggle to predict the flow accurately, requiring a prohibitively large number of training iterations . Recent works [ref]1   have resorted to mimicking the flavor of traditional optimization-based algorithms [ref]5 with RNNs (e.g., convGRUs). However, these methods are still quite different from the traditional methods in a few ways. For example, optimization-based methods 1) have an adaptive and well-defined stopping criteria (e.g., whenever they reach the optima); 2) are agnostic to the choice of solver (e.g., first- or second-order methods); and 3) are essentially path-independent (i.e., the output alone is the only thing we should need). None of these properties are directly characterized by the finite-step unrolling of recurrent networks. We propose to close this gap with a DEQ-based approach. Specifically, given the context embedding 𝐪𝐪{\\mathbf{q}} and the pyramid correlation tensor 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}, a DEQ flow estimator simultaneously solves for the fixed-point convergence of two alternate streams: 1) a latent representation 𝐡𝐡{\\mathbf{h}}, which constructs the flow updates; and 2) the flow estimate 𝐟𝐟{\\mathbf{f}} itself, whose updates are generically related as follows: This formulation captures the form of prominent flow estimator model designs like RAFT [ref]1 or GMA . Formally, the input 𝐱=(𝐪,𝒞)𝐱𝐪𝒞{\\mathbf{x}}=({\\mathbf{q}},{\\mathcal{C}}) and model parameters fθ=(ℋ,ℱ)subscript𝑓𝜃ℋℱf_{\\theta}=({\\mathcal{H}},{\\mathcal{F}}) jointly define a dynamical system that the DEQ flow model can directly solve the fixed point for using the following flow update equation in its forward pass: Intuitively, this corresponds to an “infinite-depth” feature representation 𝐳∗superscript𝐳{\\mathbf{z}}^{*} where, if we perform one more flow update step fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta}, both flow estimation 𝐟𝐟{\\mathbf{f}} and latent state 𝐡𝐡{\\mathbf{h}} will not change (thus reaching a fixed point, i.e., an “equilibrium”). Importantly, we can leverage much more advanced root solving methods like quasi-Newton methods (e.g., Broyden’s method  or Anderson mixing ) to find the fixed point. These methods guarantee a much faster (superlinear) and better-quality convergence than if we perform infinitely many naïve unrolling steps (as do recurrent networks but only up to a finite number of steps due to computation and memory constraints). Moreover, we note that prior works on implicit networks have shown that the exact structure of fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} subsumes a wide variety of model designs, such as a Transformer block [ref]2 , a residual block  , or a graph layer   . Similarly, for the deep equilibrium flow estimator, Eq. 2 engulfs exactly the designs of state-of-the-art optical flow models, which we follow and use without modification. For example, for RAFT [ref]1, where 𝒞​(𝐟∗+𝐜0)𝒞superscript𝐟superscript𝐜0{\\mathcal{C}}({\\mathbf{f}}^{*}+{\\mathbf{c}}^{0}) stands for the correlation lookup as in RAFT [ref]1. We also show in Appendix that GMA  can be easily written in a similar update form. The key question is, how do we update and train a DEQ flow estimator. It turns out that we can directly differentiate through this “infinite-level” flow state, (𝐡∗,𝐟∗)superscript𝐡superscript𝐟({\\mathbf{h}}^{*},{\\mathbf{f}}^{*}), without any knowledge of the forward fixed-point trajectory: (Implicit Function Theorem (IFT)  [ref]2) Given the fixed-point flow representation 𝐳∗=(𝐡∗,𝐟∗)superscript𝐳superscript𝐡superscript𝐟{\\mathbf{z}}^{*}=({\\mathbf{h}}^{*},{\\mathbf{f}}^{*}), the corresponding flow loss ℒ​(𝐡∗,𝐟∗,𝐟gt)ℒsuperscript𝐡superscript𝐟subscript𝐟gt\\mathcal{L}({\\mathbf{h}}^{*},{\\mathbf{f}}^{*},\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{gt}}) and input 𝐱=(𝐪,𝒞)𝐱𝐪𝒞\\mathbf{x}=({\\mathbf{q}},{\\mathcal{C}}), the gradient of DEQ flow is given by For the proof, see Bai et al. [ref]2. Importantly, this theorem enables us to decouple the forward and backward passes of a DEQ flow estimator; i.e., to perform gradient update, we only need the final output 𝐳∗superscript𝐳{\\mathbf{z}}^{*} and do not need to run backpropagation-through-time (BPTT). It means a huge memory reduction: whereas an L𝐿L-step recurrent flow estimator takes O​(L)𝑂𝐿O(L) memory to perform BPTT, a DEQ estimator reduces the overhead by a factor of L𝐿L to be O​(1)𝑂1O(1) (e.g., RAFT uses L=12𝐿12L=12 for training, so using a DEQ flow can theoretically reduce the iterative refinement memory cost by 12×12\\times). To summarize, a DEQ flow’s forward pass directly solves a fixed-point flow-update equation via black-box solvers; and its backward pass relies only on the final optimum 𝐳∗superscript𝐳{\\mathbf{z}}^{*}, which make this flow estimation process much more akin to the optimization-based perspective [ref]5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the flow estimation task, prior works have shown that explicit neural networks struggle to predict the flow accurately, requiring a prohibitively large number of training iterations .
