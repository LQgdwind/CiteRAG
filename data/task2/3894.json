      "content": "Paper Title: PGADA: Perturbation-Guided Adversarial Alignment for Few-shot Learning Under the Support-Query Shift\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the Theorem 3.1, the optimal transport can be easily misguided by considering perturbed images. The goal of PGADA is to generate a set of augmented data to derive a more robust embedding model and relieve the perturbation in images. Recently, MaxUp  synthesized augmented data by minimizing the maximum loss over the augmented data xpsubscript𝑥𝑝x_{p}, which can be formally written as follows. and can be easily minimized with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Specifically, MaxUp samples a batch of augmented data xpsubscript𝑥𝑝x_{p} and compute the gradient of the data point which has the highest loss L𝐿L. Therefore, the model would learn the hardest example over all augmented data xpsubscript𝑥𝑝x_{p}. However, it’s hard to collect sufficient labels for each class in few-shot learning. Therefore, instead of maximizing the empirical risk of the labeled data by Eq. (4), we introduce a self-supervised learning-based objective. where M𝑀M is the comparison module in few-shot learning, e.g., l2subscript𝑙2l_{2}-norm. By maximizing the distance between ϕ​(xp)italic-ϕsubscript𝑥𝑝\\phi(x_{p}) and ϕ​(x)italic-ϕ𝑥\\phi(x), PGADA generates perturbed image xpsubscript𝑥𝑝x_{p}, which is less similar to the original image x𝑥x in embedding space, as a hard example. To effectively generate the perturbed data, we introduce a semantic-aware perturbation generator to synthesize the augmented data. where G𝐺G is a model to generate the perturbed image xpsubscript𝑥𝑝x_{p}.111We employ a 333-layer convolutional neural network as our G𝐺G. Besides, we utilize dropout  to provide the randomness of our model. Compared to conventional adversarial training techniques [ref]23 , which usually sample the perturbed images from an i.i.d distribution xp∼P(⋅|x)x_{p}\\sim P(\\cdot|x), e.g., Gaussian distribution, our method can encode the semantic of the image x𝑥x without requiring many samples to achieve convergence . At the training phase (illustrated in the left of Fig. 2), we also minimize the empirical risk of the perturbed data xpsubscript𝑥𝑝x_{p} to ensure that the generator persists enough information to predict the original label y𝑦y with KL divergence . The objective is, Then, we adopt stochastic gradient descent (SGD)  to train our generator G𝐺G. It is worth noting that we fix the parameters of the embedding model ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi and θ𝜃\\theta when training the generator G𝐺G to stabilize the training process [ref]1. In addition, we minimize the KL divergence of the original data x𝑥x and the perturbed data point xpsubscript𝑥𝑝x_{p} to train the embedding model (illustrated in the right of Fig. 2). To enhance the generalizability of the embeddings, we also leverage the unlabeled data by the auxiliary contrastive self-supervised learning . At each iteration, we sample N𝑁N images either from training or testing set,222Note that it is valid to access the images from testing set in few-shot learning, which is named transductive few-shot learning . and generate 222 augmentations for each images, i.e., each augmented image has 111 positive example and 2​N−12𝑁12N-1 corresponding negative examples with the self-supervised loss defined as follows. ℓℓ\\ell denotes the NT-Xent Loss , which can be written as, where z∗subscript𝑧z_{*} is defined as W​ϕ​(x∗)𝑊italic-ϕsubscript𝑥W\\phi(x_{*}), and W𝑊W is a trainable projection matrix. Summing up, the overall all objective becomes where λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1} and λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2} are the trade-off parameters between each loss. Similarly, the classifier θ𝜃\\theta is trained by minimizing Lo​r​isubscript𝐿𝑜𝑟𝑖L_{ori} and La​d​vsubscript𝐿𝑎𝑑𝑣L_{adv}. The pseudo code is presented in Algorithm 1.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: employ a 333-layer convolutional neural network as our G𝐺G.
