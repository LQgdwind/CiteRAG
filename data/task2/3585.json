Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

ML-leak attack [ref]1. This is a confidence-based membership inference attack.\nThe attacker has no knowledge of the Dattacktrainsubscriptsuperscript洧냥trainattackD^{\\rm train}_{\\rm attack} and Dattacktestsubscriptsuperscript洧냥testattackD^{\\rm test}_{\\rm attack} membership labels.\nThus, a shadow model has to be trained to replicate the target model;\nthen the attack model must be trained based on the confidence scores of the shadow model.\nTo guarantee the strongest attack, the shadow model should have the same architecture as the target model.\nWe use the same architecture as in [ref]1 for the attack model\nwhich is a multi-layer perceptron with a 64-unit hidden layer and a sigmoid output layer. NSH attack . This is a combined\nconfidence/label-based membership inference attack.\nThe attacker has knowledge of the Dattacktrainsubscriptsuperscript洧냥trainattackD^{\\rm train}_{\\rm attack} and Dattacktestsubscriptsuperscript洧냥testattackD^{\\rm test}_{\\rm attack} membership labels.\nThus, no shadow model is needed.\nThe adversary can simply directly query the target model to receive the confidence score vectors.\nThe architecture is the same as in \nwhich consists of three neural networks.\nThe first has the layers of size:    4\nand takes confidence score vectors as input.\nThe second has the layers of size:   4\nand takes labels as input.\nThe third network has the layers of size:  4 [ref]1\nand takes the outputs of the first and second networks as input. For the model inversion attacks, we adopted the model proposed in [ref]5. Adversarial model inversion attack [ref]5.\nThe adversary trains an inversion model to infer reconstruction of the input data record.\nWe use the same inversion model architecture as in [ref]5\nwhich consists of four transposed CNN blocks.\nThe first three blocks each has a transposed convolutional layer\nfollowed by a sigmoid activation function that converts neural signals into real values in [ref]0 [ref]0 [ref]1.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: We used two different attack models for the membership inference attacks. ML-leak attack [ref]1. This is a confidence-based membership inference attack.\nThe attacker has no knowledge of the Dattacktrainsubscriptsuperscript洧냥trainattackD^{\\rm train}_{\\rm attack} and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
