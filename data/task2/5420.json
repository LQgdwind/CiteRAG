      "content": "Paper Title: An order out of nowhere: a new algorithm for infinite-domain CSPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the framework of CSPs, it is natural to consider not only classes of finite ℓℓ\\ell-hypergraphs but also classes of different finite structures in a fixed relational signature.\nIf such a class 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} is an amalgamation class, then there exists a countably infinite homogeneous structure 𝔹𝒦subscript𝔹𝒦\\mathbb{B}_{\\mathcal{K}} whose finite substructures are precisely the structures in 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}.\nHowever, CSP⁡(𝔹𝒦)CSPsubscript𝔹𝒦\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}_{\\mathcal{K}}) is not guaranteed to be contained in the complexity class NP since the class 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} does not have to be algorithmically enumerable (as mentioned above, there are uncountably many amalgamation classes of 3-hypergraphs; hence there exists such a 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} such that CSP⁡(𝔹𝒦)CSPsubscript𝔹𝒦\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}_{\\mathcal{K}}) is undecidable).\nA natural way of achieving the algorithmical enumerability of 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} is to require that there exists a natural number b𝒦subscript𝑏𝒦b_{\\mathcal{K}} such that a structure is contained in 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} if, and only if, all its substructures of size at most b𝒦subscript𝑏𝒦b_{\\mathcal{K}} are in 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}.\nIn this case, we say that 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} (or its Fraïssé limit 𝔹𝒦subscript𝔹𝒦\\mathbb{B}_{\\mathcal{K}}) is finitely bounded.\nFor every set ΨΨ\\Psi of formulas in the language of the structures at hand, one then gets as in the previous section a structure 𝔸𝒦,Ψsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi} whose domain is the same as 𝔹𝒦subscript𝔹𝒦\\mathbb{B}_{\\mathcal{K}} and whose relations are definable in first-order logic from the relations of 𝔹𝒦subscript𝔹𝒦\\mathbb{B}_{\\mathcal{K}} – we say that 𝔸𝒦,Ψsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi} is a first-order reduct of 𝔹𝒦subscript𝔹𝒦\\mathbb{B}_{\\mathcal{K}}. Thus, for every set ΨΨ\\Psi of formulas and every finitely bounded amalgamation class 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}, the generalized satisfiability problem parameterized by ΨΨ\\Psi and 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} is the CSP of a first-order reduct 𝔸𝒦,Ψsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi} of a finitely bounded homogeneous structure.\nIt is known that the complexity of the CSP over any such template depends solely on the polymorphisms of 𝔸𝒦,Ψsubscript𝔸𝒦Ψ\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathcal{K},\\Psi} .\nThis motivates the following conjecture generalizing the dichotomy for Graph-SAT which was formulated by Bodirsky and Pinsker in 2011 (see ). The modern formulation of the conjecture based on recent progress    is the following: Let 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} be a CSP template which is a first-order reduct of\na finitely bounded homogeneous structure. Then one of the following applies. The clone of polymorphisms of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} has no uniformly continuous minion homomorphism to the clone of projections 𝒫𝒫\\mathscr{P}, and CSP⁡(𝔸)CSP𝔸\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{A}) is in PP\\mathrm{P}. The clone of polymorphisms of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} has a uniformly continuous minion homomorphism to the clone of projections 𝒫𝒫\\mathscr{P}, and CSP⁡(𝔸)CSP𝔸\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{A}) is NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-complete. It follows that Theorem 3 is a special case of 4. It is known that if the clone of polymorphisms of any CSP template within the range of 4 has a uniformly continuous minion homomorphism to 𝒫𝒫\\mathscr{P}, then the CSP of such template is NP-hard .\nAlready before 4 was introduced, a similar conjecture was formulated by Feder and Vardi 5 for CSPs over templates with finite domains and it was confirmed independently by Bulatov and Zhuk 3 [ref]43 [ref]44 recently. 4 itself has been confirmed for many subclasses: for example for CSPCSP\\operatorname{CSP}s of all structures first-order definable in finitely bounded homogeneous graphs  , in (ℚ;<)ℚ(\\mathbb{Q};<) , in any unary structure , in the random poset 7, in the random tournament 3, or in the homogeneous branching C-relation , in ω𝜔\\omega-categorical monadically stable structures 2, as well as for all CSPCSP\\operatorname{CSP}s in the class MMSNP , and for CSPCSP\\operatorname{CSP}s of representations of some relational algebras .\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: before 4 was introduced, a similar conjecture was formulated by Feder and Vardi 5 for CSPs over templates with finite domains and it was confirmed independently by Bulatov and Zhuk 3 [ref]43 [ref]44 recently. 4 itself has been confirmed for many subclasses: for example for CSPCSP\\operatorname{CSP}s of all structures first-order definable in finitely bounded homogeneous graphs  ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
