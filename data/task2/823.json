      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial-Time Computation of Optimal Correlated Equilibria in Two-Player Extensive-Form Games with Public Chance Moves and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe implemented the scaled-extension-based decomposition routine of Section¬†3. We test our decomposition algorithm for triangle-free games on Goofspiel¬†, a popular benchmark game in computational game theory. In Goofspiel, each player has a personal deck of cards made of kùëòk different ranks (from 111 to kùëòk). A third deck (the ‚Äúprize‚Äù deck) is shuffled and put face down on the board at the beginning of the game. In each turn, the topmost card from the prize deck is publicly revealed. Then, each player privately picks a card from their hand‚Äîthis card acts as a bid to win the card that was just revealed from the prize deck. The player that bids the highest wins the prize card. We use an established tie-breaking rule: the prize card is discarded if the players‚Äô bids are equal. Furthermore, we adopt the convention that only the winner is revealed, but not the bids, in accordance with prior computational game theory literature¬† . The players‚Äô scores are computed as the sum of the values of the prize cards they have won. Because of the tie-breaking rule, Goofspiel is a general-sum game. Furthermore, since all chance outcomes are public, it is a triangle-free game. In Figure¬†3(left) we report the performance of our decomposition routine for k=3,4,5ùëò345k=3,4,5, both in terms of number of scaled extension operations required in the decomposition (Theorem¬†2) and of runtime of our single-threaded implementation, as well as the dimensions of the games. The runtime was averaged over 100 independent runs. Our decomposition algorithm performs well, and is able to scale to the largest game (Goofspiel with k=5ùëò5k=5 ranks, which has 3.6√ó1073.6superscript1073.6\\times 10^{7} relevant sequence pairs). In Figure¬†3(right) we used the characterization Œû=ùí±Œûùí±\\Xi=\\mathcal{V} to compute the set of all payoffs that can be reached by an EFCE, EFCCE, or NFCCE in 333-rank Goofspiel. The sets are highly non-trivial, and reinforce the observation that the behaviors and incentives that can be induced through extensive-form correlation are subtle and complex¬†. The sets of\nreachable payoff vectors was computed using Polymake, a library for\ncomputational polyhedral geometry¬† . We also implemented the linear programming formulation of EFCE described by¬†von Stengel and Forges 4, and the scalable regret minimization algorithm of¬†Farina et¬†al. [ref]12. We use the Gurobi commercial linear programming solver to solve the linear program formulation. As the game size increases, the barrier algorithm is the only algorithm that can solve the linear program. However, even that quickly becomes impractical. In the largest game, Gurobi uses roughly 200GB of memory, spends approximately 90 minutes to precondition the linear program, and requires slightly more than 20 minutes to perform each iteration of the barrier method using 30 threads. The regret minimization scales significantly more favorable in the large game. It requires roughly 6 seconds per iteration, and reaches 10‚àí2superscript10210^{-2} infeasibility in 4 minutes, 10‚àí3superscript10310^{-3} infeasibility in 12 minutes, and 10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4} infeasibility in 110 minutes. Additional data about the experiment is available in Appendix¬†C.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: polyhedral geometry¬† .
