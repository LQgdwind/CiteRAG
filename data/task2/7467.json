      "content": "Paper Title: Quantized Embedding Vectors for Controllable Diffusion Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion generative models were initially proposed in [ref]14 and have shown state-of-the-art sample quality in image and audio domains, readers of interest can be referred to [ref]15 [ref]16  . In the language domain, DiffusionBERT explores training BERT to learn the reverse process of a discrete diffusion process with an absorbing state . Recent work on continuous diffusion and controllable text generation  has demonstrated that language models can successfully control simple sentence attributes. In general, a diffusion model [ref]15  is a latent variable model that represents data x0∈ℝdsubscript𝑥0superscriptℝ𝑑x_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} as a Markov chain xT​…​x0subscript𝑥𝑇…subscript𝑥0x_{T}...x_{0}, with the respective variable in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, and xTsubscript𝑥𝑇x_{T} following a Gaussian distribution. The diffusion model aims to denoise the sequence of latent variables xT:1subscript𝑥:𝑇1x_{T:1} to approximate target samples generated from the target data distribution (see Figure 2). The initial state pθsubscript𝑝𝜃p_{\\theta} is approximated as 𝒩​(0,I)𝒩0𝐼\\mathcal{N}(0,I), and the denoising transition xt→xt−1→subscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡1x_{t}\\rightarrow x_{t-1} is parameterized by the model pθ​(xt|xt−1)=𝒩​(xt−1;μθ​(xt,t),σθ​(xt,t))subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡1𝒩subscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝜇𝜃subscript𝑥𝑡𝑡subscript𝜎𝜃subscript𝑥𝑡𝑡p_{\\theta}(x_{t}|x_{t-1})=\\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1};\\mu_{\\theta}(x_{t},t),\\sigma_{\\theta}(x_{t},t)). For instance, μθsubscript𝜇𝜃\\mu_{\\theta} and σθsubscript𝜎𝜃\\sigma_{\\theta} can be determined using a Transformer . To train the diffusion model, we use a forward process to generate intermediate latent variables x1:Tsubscript𝑥:1𝑇x_{1:T}. The process starts by incrementally adding Gaussian noise to the initial data point x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}. As the diffusion progresses through step T𝑇T, the samples xTsubscript𝑥𝑇x_{T} become approximately Gaussian. Each transition xt−1→xt→subscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝑥𝑡x_{t-1}\\rightarrow x_{t} is parameterized by q​(xt|xt−1)=𝒩​(xt;1−βt​xt−1,βt​I)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡1𝒩subscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝛽𝑡𝐼q(x_{t}|x_{t-1})=\\mathcal{N}(x_{t};\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{t}}x_{t-1},\\beta_{t}I), where βtsubscript𝛽𝑡\\beta_{t} is a hyperparameter representing the amount of noise added at diffusion step t𝑡t. The forward process q𝑞q does not contain any trainable parameters. The training objective of the diffusion model is to maximize the marginal likelihood of the data, which is formulated as 𝔼x0∼pd​a​t​a​{log⁡[pθ​(x0)]}subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝑥0subscript𝑝𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎subscript𝑝𝜃subscript𝑥0\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0}\\sim p_{data}\\{\\log[p_{\\theta}(x_{0})]\\}}. To achieve this, we utilize the variational lower bound of log⁡[pθ​(x0)]subscript𝑝𝜃subscript𝑥0\\log[p_{\\theta}(x_{0})] [ref]14. The model is trained to reverse the diffusion process and accurately reconstruct the original data. However, achieving this goal can be challenging and may necessitate the use of several optimization techniques to stabilize it . To tackle this issue, [ref]15 proposed a straightforward surrogate objective. They extended and reweighted each KL-divergence term in LV​L​Bsubscript𝐿𝑉𝐿𝐵L_{VLB} to create a mean-squared error loss, which is also referred to as : where μ^​(xt,x0)^𝜇subscriptx𝑡subscriptx0\\hat{\\mu}\\left(\\mathrm{x}_{t},\\mathrm{x}_{0}\\right) is the mean of the posterior q​(xt−1|x0,xt)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥𝑡q(x_{t-1}|x_{0},x_{t}) which is a closed form Gaussian, and μθ​(xt,t)subscript𝜇𝜃subscript𝑥𝑡𝑡\\mu_{\\theta}(x_{t},t) is the predicted mean of pθ​(xt−1|xt)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝑥𝑡p_{\\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t}) computed by a neural network. We also make use of similar simplifications in DLM  to stabilize training and improve sample quality.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Diffusion generative models were initially proposed in [ref]14 and have shown state-of-the-art sample quality in image and audio domains, readers of interest can be referred to [ref]15 [ref]16  .
