Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Attention of Disentangled Modalities for 3D Human Mesh Recovery with Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the model-size variants of our FastMETRO on the 3DPW  and Human3.6M [ref]15 datasets.\nIn this paper, the inference time is measured using a single NVIDIA V100 GPU with a batch size of 1. Comparison with Encoder-Based Transformers.\nIn Table 2, we compare our models with METRO  and Mesh Graphormer [ref]26 on the Human3.6M [ref]15 dataset.\nNote that encoder-based transformers  [ref]26 are implemented with ResNet-50  (R50) or\nHRNet-W64 [ref]45 (H64).\nFastMETRO-S outperforms METRO when both models employ the same CNN backbone (R50),\nalthough our model demands only 8.99% of the parameters in the transformer architecture.\nRegarding the overall inference speed, our model is 1.86×\\times faster.\nIt is worth noting that\nFastMETRO-L-R50 achieves similar results with METRO-H64, but our model is 2.58×\\times faster.\nFastMETRO-L outperforms Mesh Graphormer\nwhen both models employ the same CNN backbone (H64),\nwhile our model demands only 25.30% of the parameters in the transformer architecture.\nAlso, our model converges much faster than the encoder-based methods as shown in Figure 4. Comparison with Image-Based Methods.\nIn Table 3, we compare our FastMETRO with the image-based methods for 3D human mesh reconstruction on 3DPW  and Human3.6M [ref]15.\nNote that existing methods are implemented with\nResNet-50  (R50) or\nHRNet-W32 [ref]45 (H32) or\nHRNet-W64 [ref]45 (H64).\nWhen all models employ R50 as their CNN backbones,\nFastMETRO-S achieves the best results without\niterative fitting procedures or test-time optimizations.\nFastMETRO-L-H64 achieves the state of the art in every evaluation metric on the 3DPW dataset and PA-MPJPE metric on the Human3.6M dataset. Visualization of Self-Attentions.\nIn Figure 6, the first and second rows show the visualization of the attention scores in self-attentions between a specified body joint and mesh vertices.\nWe obtain the scores by averaging attention scores from all attention heads of all multi-head self-attention modules in our transformer decoder.\nAs shown in Figure 6, our FastMETRO effectively captures the non-local relations among joints and vertices via self-attentions in the transformer.\nThis improves the robustness to environment variations such as occlusions. Visualization of Cross-Attentions.\nIn Figure 6, the third and fourth rows show the visualization of the attention scores in cross-attentions between a specified body joint and image regions.\nWe obtain the scores by averaging attention scores from all attention heads of all multi-head cross-attention modules in our transformer decoder.\nAs shown in Figure 6, the input tokens used in our transformer decoder focus on their relevant image regions.\nBy leveraging the cross-attentions between disentangled modalities,\nour FastMETRO effectively learns to regress the 3D coordinates of joints and vertices from a 2D image.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: We evaluate the model-size variants of our FastMETRO on the 3DPW  and Human3.6M [ref]15 datasets.\nIn this paper, the inference time is measured using a single NVIDIA V100 GPU with a batch size of 1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
