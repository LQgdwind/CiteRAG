      "content": "Paper Title: MABNet: Master Assistant Buddy Network with Hybrid Learning for Image Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCNN-based representation is an appealing solution for image retrieval. Early approaches used fully connected (FC) layer activations as global image descriptors. However, the FC layer does not learn geometric invariance and suppresses spatial information. Consequently, the last convolutional layer before the FC layer can be considered as containing the spatial context. MAC  incorporated geometric invariance by choosing the last convolutional layer and adapting max-pooling, which boosted the model’s performance on image retrieval tasks.\nSum-Pooled Convolution (SPoC)  used sum pooling from the feature map.\nRef.  proposed non-parametric weighting schemes including cross-dimensional weighting and pooling steps. R-MAC [ref]1 used a hybrid approach by performing max-pooling over regions and sum-pooling of the regional descriptors.\nGeneralized mean pooling (GEM) 5, widely used for image retrieval tasks, generalizes max and average pooling with a pooling parameter. The combination of multiple global descriptors (CGD) 6 creates an ensemble effect by concatenating multiple global descriptors (including SPoC, MAC and GEM). Henceforth, CGD realizes a powerful hybrid approach for image retrieval. Among the many CNN-based image retrieval techniques, DELF  and DIR  have given state-of-the-art results. DELF is a local feature descriptor coupled with an attention mechanism\nto identify semantically useful features for image retrieval. On the other hand, DIR produces a global and compact fixed-length representation for each image by aggregating many region-wise descriptors. It uses a three-stream Siamese network  that explicitly optimizes the weights of R-MAC representation for image retrieval by using triplet ranking loss. It also learns the pooling mechanism of the R-MAC descriptor. Selective deep conv features  proposed the use of various masking strategies to select a subset of representative local convolutional features and boost its features’ discriminative power by making use of the SOTA embedding methods. siaMAC  is an unsupervised method of finetuning CNNs for image retrieval which exploits the 3D reconstructions to select the training data for CNN. It is possible to embed the convolutional feature maps into a high dimensional space to obtain compact features, useful for image retrieval tasks. Widely used embedding methods include Bag of Words (BoW) 8, Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) 9, and Fischer vectors 0. VLAD captures information about the statistics of local descriptors aggregated over the image. BoW aggregation keeps the count of visual words, whereas VLAD stores the sum of residuals (difference between the descriptor and its corresponding cluster center) for each visual word. NetVLAd 1 is a generalized VLAD layer which contains trainable parameters. However, convolution is a local operator whereas the transformer is a global operator that considers all the pixels and applies attention to find the important features. In a study 2, it is shown that effective receptive fields of lower layers for ViTs are much larger than ResNets, which helps them to incorporate more global information than CNNs. Even though ViT lacks the inductive biases present in CNNs through translation equivariance and locality, it can give competitive or even better results on various tasks like classification, object detection, object tracking, and segmentation. Recently, some works   used ViT for effective image retrieval. DINO’s  knowledge model contains explicit information about the semantic segmentation of an image giving better performance. These reasons motivated us to use ViT as the backbone of our model. Some works also focus on designing loss functions specific to image retrieval tasks.  combines the second-order spatial attention and the second-order descriptor loss to improve image features for retrieval and matching. 3 introduces an objective that optimizes Smooth-AP (smoothed approximation of average precision), instead of directly optimizing AP, which is non-differentiable. In order to increase the accuracy of image search systems, many post-processing techniques are employed as well. Query expansion (QE) 4 5 6 is a commonly used technique to achieve this goal, where relevant candidates produced during an initial ranking are aggregated into an expanded query, thus providing a robust representation of the query image, which is then used to search more images in the database. Aggregating the candidates reinforces the information shared between them and injects new information not available in the original query. The work in 7 presents another post-processing technique based on a graph neural network. Image re-ranking with heat diffusion  re-ranks several top-ranked images for a given query image by considering the query as a heat source which helps to avoid over-representation of repetitive features. A downside to diffusion is that it performs slowly compared to the naive KNN search. The work in  overcomes this problem by pre-computing diffusion results of each element in the database, making the online search a simple linear combination on top of the KNN search. It also proposes using late truncation, i.e., applying truncation after normalization to achieve better performance.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: retrieval tasks.\nSum-Pooled Convolution (SPoC)  used sum pooling from the feature map.\nRef.  proposed non-parametric weighting schemes including cross-dimensional weighting and pooling steps.
