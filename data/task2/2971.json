      "content": "Paper Title: Elucidating Robust Learning with Uncertainty-Aware Corruption Pattern Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst, we evaluate the accuracy of clean test set of Dirty-MNIST dataset and Dirty-CIFAR10 dataset, shown in Table 8 and 9 respectively. We observe that the proposed method outperforms compared methods except for Symmetry-20% noise rate, where the noise ratio is small. We would like to emphasize that the proposed method works better than the semi-supervised method like DivideMix [ref]24 even without any data augmentation like MixUp [ref]4 or MixMatch [ref]2. This is because, in the SDN setting, the model has to be robust not only to label corruption but also to noisy input as well. MLN obtains its robustness on both label corruption and input noise by mixture-of-experts architecture and its uncertainty. We would like to emphasize that MLN has its strength in robust learning on the corruption of output is dependent on quality of input. SDN setting can be more practical in that it is more natural to assume that the annotators will be more likely to make mistakes on a specific subset consisting of hard instances.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: compared methods except for Symmetry-20% noise rate, where the noise ratio is small. We would like to emphasize that the proposed method works better than the semi-supervised method like DivideMix [ref]24 even without any data augmentation like MixUp [ref]4 or MixMatch [ref]2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
