Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: MS-DARTS: Mean-Shift Based Differentiable Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly NAS approaches  [ref]17 train candidate architectures from scratch during each search step, thus the computation cost is very high. ENAS [ref]7 avoids training all candidate architectures from scratch by weight sharing. Although with speed up, this strategy may produce incorrect estimation of candidate architectures [ref]12. It may be difficult for NAS to find a good network architecture from a large number of candidate architectures, which further reduces the effectiveness of the final searched network architecture. Subsequently, DNA  converts the large NAS search space into blocks to reduce parameter changes via weight sharing and can thus fully explore and train candidate architectures. DAS  converts the discrete network architecture search space into a continuously differentiable one, such that gradient optimization can be applied for architecture search. The primary goal of DAS is on finding hyperparameters of conv layers (filter size, number of channels, and grouped convolutions). It is observed in Maskconnect 0 that cell-based network structure typically follows a pre-determined pattern between blocks, e.g., each block only connects to its first two blocks 1 or all previous blocks 2. Similarly, 3 4 also search for network architecture on continuous domains, where the aim is only on fine-tuning specific structures.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Early NAS approaches  [ref]17 train candidate architectures from scratch during each search step, thus the computation cost is very high.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
