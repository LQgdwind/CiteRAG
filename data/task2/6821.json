      "content": "Paper Title: Vision Relation Transformer for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScene Graph Generation (SGG) is a tool for understanding scenes by simplifying the visual relationships into a summary graph. SGG has been receiving increased attention from the research community due to its potential usability in assisting downstream visual reasoning tasks   . While SGG aims to provide a comprehensive view of relationships between objects in a visual scene, there is another set of research that represents interactions as relationships between humans and objects called Human-object Interaction (HOI)    . In this work, the focus is on SGG and its associated literature, emphasizing the study of object relationships within visual scenes. The SGG task was first introduced by Lu et al. . Early approaches mainly focused on including additional features from various sources other than the visual context, resulting in sub-optimal performance   . Later work proposed more powerful relation encoders with rich contextual information by employing message passing , sequential LSTMs 1 , and fully-connected graphs     7   8.\nRecent advancements in attention techniques have also resulted in attention-based SGG methods. Earlier work  in this direction used graph attention networks (GAT) 4 to capture object-level visual similarity. Recently, Transformers 3 have also been used for SGG [ref]7    after their successful adoption across computer vision   5. Current transformer-based SGG methods use attention to capture global context and improve the visual and semantic modality fusion. Lu et al.  used sequential decoding to capture context, while Dong et al. [ref]7 employed self- and cross-attention to fuse visual and semantic cues. Deviating from this, we use transformers to capture local-level relation cues as well as joint visual and geometric cues. Scene Graphs with additional knowledge.\nDue to the long-tail distribution of the relationships, it is difficult to obtain enough training data for every relation. To overcome this, using additional knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs   8, depth maps 7 , and data transfer 0 was proposed. Knowledge graph-based works refine features for relation prediction by reasoning using knowledge from large-scale databases. Yang et al.  and Sharifzahed et al. 7 use a monocular depth estimator to infer additional depth cues for relation prediction by fusing with visual features. Zhang et al. 0 expanded the dataset by increasing the SGG annotations through internal and external data transfer.\nOur approach can also use depth maps to provide additional geometric knowledge. However, introducing additional knowledge can increase the parameter count and computation time of the model. To tackle this problem, we strategically prune the parameters, resulting in a light-weight yet powerful SGG model. Unbiased Scene Graph Generation.\nThe SGG research community started paying attention to the problem of class imbalance only after the introduction of the less biased mean recall metric by Chen et al.  and Tang et al. 1. Subsequently, various unbiasing strategies  [ref]7  9 0 5 1 6 0 were proposed, many of which can be used in a model-agnostic fashion. Tang et al. 1 used counterfactuals from causal inference to disentangle unbiased representations from the biased ones. Yu et al. 6 utilized tree structures to filter irrelevant predicates. Zareian et al. 8 and Yan et al. 1 used re-weighting strategies while Li et al.  employed a re-sampling strategy. Dong et al. [ref]7 used a multi-expert learning setup that leverages knowledge distillation.\nHowever, while these methods attain high performance on unbiased metrics, they reduce the head class performance significantly as seen in Fig. 2(b). Hence, to attain an effective balance between the head and tail classes, we propose a mutually exclusive expert learning setup. Our model not only achieves better head and tail class balance but also sets a new state of the art.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: in attention-based SGG methods.
