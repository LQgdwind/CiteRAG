      "content": "Paper Title: FS-DETR: Few-Shot DEtection TRansformer with prompting and without re-training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDEtection TRansformer (DETR) approaches: After revolutionizing NLP  , Transformer-based architectures have started making significant impact in computer vision problems  . In object detection, methods are typically grouped into two-stage (proposal-based)    and single-stage (proposal-free)8    4 methods. In this field, a recent breakthrough is the DEtection TRansformer (DETR) , which is a single-stage approach that treats the task as a direct set prediction without requiring hand-crafted components, like non-maximum suppression or anchor generation. Specifically, DETR is trained in an end-to-end manner using a set loss function which performs bipartite matching between the predicted and the ground-truth bounding boxes. Because DETR has slow training convergence, several methods have been proposed to improve it 4 0 [ref]5. Conditional DETR 4 learns a conditional spatial query from the decoder embeddings that are used in the decoder for cross-attention with the image features. Deformable DETR 0 proposes deformable attention in which attention is performed only over a small set of key sampling points around a reference point. Unsupervised pre-training of DETR [ref]5 (UP-DETR), improves its convergence, where randomly cropped patches are summed to the object queries and the model is then trained to detect them in the original image. A follow-up work, DETReg , replaces the random crops with proposals generated by Selective Search.\nWhile our approach is agnostic to the exact variant of DETR,\ndue to its fast training convergence, we opted to use Conditional DETR as the model that we build our FS-DETR  approach upon. Beyond this, the above mentioned works are on closed set recognition and while UP-DETR’s unsupervised pre-training could be potentially used for few-shot detection, the experimental setting presented in their work doesn’t match the standard settings for few-shot detection and no code is provided for its training. We re-implemented UP-DETR [ref]5 for few-shot detection and found that our method outperforms it. This is expected as their goal is unsupervised pre-training and not FSOD. Few Shot Object Detection (FSOD) methods can be categorised into re-training based and without re-training methods. Re-training based methods assume that during test time, but before deployment, the provided samples of the novel categories can be used to fine-tune the model. This setting is restrictive as it requires training before deployment. Instead, without re-training methods can be directly deployed on the fly for the detection of novel examples. Re-training based approaches can be divided into meta-learning and fine-tuning approaches. Meta-learning based approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from the base classes to the novel classes through meta-learning 2 3   5 .\nFine-tuning based methods follow the standard pre-train and fine-tune pipeline. They have been shown to significantly outperform meta-learning approaches.\nTFA  proposes fine-tuning the final classification layer of a Faster R-CNN model (first trained on base classes), with a balanced subset containing also the examples of the novel classes. SRR-FSD  proposes to construct a semantic space using word embeddings, and then train a FSOD by projecting and aligning object visual features with their corresponding text embeddings. CME 7 proposes to learn a feature embedding space where the margins between novel classes are maximised. Retentive R-CNN 1 addresses the problem of learning a FSOD without catastrophic forgetting (i.e. without compromising base class accuracy). FSCE  aims to decrease instance similarity between\nobjects belonging to different categories by adding a secondary branch to the primary RoI head, which is trained via supervised contrastive learning.\nThe method of \nproposes a hallucinator network to generate\nexamples which can help the classifier learn a better decision boundary for the novel classes. FSOD-UP  proposes to construct universal prototypes capturing invariant object characteristics which, via fine-tuning, are adapted to the novel categories. DeFRCN 6 proposes to perform stop-gradient between the RPN and the backbone, and scale-gradient between RCNN and the backbone. More recently, FSODMC 0 proposes to address base class bias via novel class fine-tuning while calibrating the RPN, detector and backbone components to preserve well-learned prior knowledge. KFSOD  improves upon  by replacing the class-specific average-pooling of features\nwith kernel-pooled representations that are meant to capture non-linear patterns.\nTENET  extends KFSOD with a multi-head attention transformer block on\n2nd-, 3rd- and 4th-order pooling.\nFCT 6 extends 4 by incorporating a cross-transformer into both the feature backbone and detection head\nto encourage\nquery-support\nmulti-level interactions. Their approach is based on two-stage Faster-RCNN trained with a binary cross-entropy loss, i.e. it is entirely different from our architecture and training objective based on pseudo-class prediction. Meta-DETR  proposes a correlation aggregation module, which is then placed before a standard DETR encoder-decoder, that filters the query image tokens using the support images and tasks. In contrast, we model the interactions directly via a novel visual template prompting formulation, without any additional modules and can process an arbitrary number of examples per-object and object within the same forward pass. Moreover, their method requires finetuning for FSOD deployment, while our doesn’t require any retraining.\nTSF 3 proposes a transformer plugin module for modelling interactions the input features f𝑓f and a set of learnable parameters θ𝜃\\theta representing base class information (i.e. prototypes). In contrast to 3, our approach does not learn any type of base class prototypes and is fully dynamic (interactions between data and data as opposed to data and prototypes). Without re-training approaches are primarily based on metric learning  . A standard approach is 9, which uses cross-attention between the backbone’s and the query’s features to refine the proposal generation, then re-uses the query to re-weight the RoI features channel-wise (in a squeeze-and-excitation manner) for novel class classification. A similar approach for proposal generation is described in , where the squeeze-and-excitation module is replaced with a multi-relation network. QA-FewDet 4 extends 9 \nby modelling class-class, class-proposal and proposal-proposal relationships using various GCNs.\nFinally, the concurrent work of AirDet 6 attempts to learn a set of prototypes and a cross-scale support guided proposal network, with the association and regression performed at the\nend of the model via a detection head. To our knowledge, AirDet represents the state-of-the-art FSOD\nwithout re-training. We show that the proposed FS-DETR  outperforms it by a large margin. Relation to our work: Our method is the first to perform re-training free visual prompting for few shot object detection.\nDifferent to\nmany other works (e.g. TSF 3, AirDet 6), FS-DETR  does not learn perform visual prompting nor learn class-related prototypes (i.e. soft prompts-like). We emphasize that the pseudo-class embeddings in FS-DETR  are class-agnostic Finally, there are methods which are trained using metric learning  4 6 using a binary cross entropy loss. In contrast, FS-DETR  is trained to predict pseudo-classes using cross entropy (in a class-agnostic way) which is a more powerful training objective.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: function which performs bipartite matching between the predicted and the ground-truth bounding boxes.
