      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling Associative Reasoning Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAssociative thinking and reasoning, i.e., the capability to relate one concept with another by uncontrolled, sometimes subconscious thinking, is ubiquitous in our everyday life. It is a driving force for scientific progress, it is relevant for psychoanalysis, and cultural activities such as art are impossible to think without it . Associative thinking is a core topic in cognitive psychology and has been systematically researched by the seminal work of Mednick for about half a century [[, e.g.,]]Mednick1962, but only few and often domain restricted cognitive modeling approaches have been proposed so far  [ref]8 . Consider a simple associative task taken from fRAT . Your task for the functional Remote Association Task (fRAT) is to find for three given words such as the following: Tulip    Daisy    Vase exactly one word that can be associated with them all in a meaningful way. For this example above an answer is Flower (there can be other solutions too), because all three given words can relate to flower. In contrast to deductive or algebraic reasoning processes with a well-defined domain and operations, problems such as the one above cannot be solved by applying just a set of known rules. Such problems require a form of insight, which is a “sudden realization that appears to be correct” [ref]56 and creative thinking . Creative processes can differ from individual to individual and there is no straightforward algorithm known that needs just be applied to solve such problems, and hence developing computational and cognitive models is difficult. General concepts need to be identified and compared and in principle there can be infinitely many of such concepts. As we can see from the problem above, semantic processes are relevant. Other instances of such types of problems can be found in commonsense reasoning. The follwing example is from a benchmark collection for commonsense problems: An example taken from the Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA) Challenge : Assume that the pond froze over for the winter. What happened as a result? People skated on the pond. People brought boats to the pond. Another benchmark for commonsense reasoning with examples of this kind is the Winograd Schema Challenge . All these benchmarks have in common that it is not difficult for humans to come up with the correct response together with an explanation. To tackle general problems such as the ones above, an extensive amout of background knowledge is necessary, from a cognitive modeling perspective. For Problem 2 this includes the knowledge that a frozen pond has a solid surface consisting of ice, that it is possible to skate on ice and that boats are usually not used on frozen ponds. Since commonsense reasoning problems cannot be assigned to a specific domain, it is not possible to represent all this knowledge manually which is one of the reasons why these problems currently pose real challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) (for more information, see ). Understanding the human ability to draw meaningful conclusions in everyday situations is therefore not only relevant for cognitive science, but for AI too. Understanding how we solve such everyday problems may tell us more about human cognition than well-defined abstract problems. The general task is to reverse-engineer how associative reasoning can work on the cognitive level. We will focus here on Marr’s computational level . The reverse-engineering needs to be understandable – in the sense of explainable AI. For this reason, we do not aim for a connectionistic or neural network based approach. We expect from a model for creative thinking to – at least some extend – whitebox the blackbox processes of associative thinking. This requires to use symbolic and knowledge rich modeling approaches. Since AI considers problems related to commonsense reasoning as challenging and largely unsolved, it is obvious, that there are no simple algorithmic realizations for such associative processes. Following the basic paradigm of ‘cognition is computation’ and as long as we do not have computational models for general associative thinking, the gap between theories for associative thinking and cognitive models persists. To bridge this gap, in the following we will systematically introduce problems and domains such as commonsense reasoning and creativity thinking, among others and the current state of art in modeling. We demonstrate the importance of the need of a unified computational model for associative thinking that is (i) formally, as it is grounded in formal logics, (ii) able to approach concrete and core problems relevant for associative thinking, and (iii) providing new insights and hypothesis for the field. Beyond answering the core research question – Is it possible to model associative thinking by combining formally represented background knowledge, statistical methods, and automatic reasoning systems? there are several more aspects this work will contribute too: It will provide a framework to analyze the impact of knowledge and inference processes and how different aspects are selected by cognitive processes. This framework is based on first-order predicate logic for the reasoning mechanism and on various up-to date formalisms for very large knowledge bases. It will provide a testable, prototype implementation of the approach in Section Associative Reasoning.\nIt will apply the approach to\nmind-wandering in Section Mind-wandering and in Section Creativity\nhuman chains of associations as well as creative thinking are adressed. Furthermore the field of conscious and unconscious thinking will be touched in Section General Discussion.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: researched by the seminal work of Mednick for about half a century [[, e.g.,]]Mednick1962, but only few and often domain restricted cognitive modeling approaches have been proposed so far  [ref]8 .
