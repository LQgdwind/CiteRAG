      "content": "Paper Title: Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStructured representation learning appeared as a powerful way to introduce inductive biases and scale artificial intelligence to high-level cognition [ref]8 and exploit symmetries and invariances that can be leveraged by decomposing scenes into their natural constituents [ref]9. Particularly, object-centric representations provide a natural interface between bottom-up (e.g., emergentist, connectionist) and top-down (e.g., graph based, probabilistic) approaches . We summarize the closed-related works that influenced the proposed architecture classified in four topics111Some of the works may have overlapping features in other topics.: scene understanding (e.g., visual segmentation), physics-informed and interaction (e.g., simulation), behaviour (e.g., robotics) and reasoning (e.g., object relations). We analyse these works from the prism of behavioural reasoning. Visual segmentation methods have reached maturity with high accuracy on segmentation in both static images [ref]10 and videos . From IODINE [ref]10 that used IAI, recent methods evolved to fully amortized slot-attention architectures  and diffusion approaches . These methods, which can track 2D and 3D objects in cluttered scenes , capture object collisions and discover new objects , are designed for perception and not for reasoning or control the segmented objects. Physics methods have also shown a great potential in handling complex non-linear interactions. These are strongly influenced by the simulation approach to cognition . For instance, interaction  and propagation  networks are able to understand complex scene dynamics with multiple objects and even control them to reach a desired known state. Unfortunately, these methods require full observation of the objects states. Approaches that can work directly on pixels make use of ground-truth segmentation masks  or Visual interaction networks . While these approaches have some kind of physical “reasoning” a full-fledged architecture that performs 1st order logic reasoning from pixels and transforms to behaviour (control) is still not fully accomplished. These works focus on moving the objects meaningfully and usually have full access to the objects states (e.g. ). OP3  is an outstanding exception. However, it has two key limitations. First, it is restricted to a discrete action space of picking up and placing objects, with no continuous control. Second, it has no ability to learn tasks—it can only plan actions towards objectives specified ad hoc by means of a goal image that shows exactly what the scene in question ought to look like. Novel approaches use ReFs to describe the 3D representation of the object and control is solved by RRTs in the latent prediction dynamics and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to execute the actions . Still, ground truth objects mask are used for training and inference. Some methods have overcome this constraint through entity-based segmentation—as a simplification of object-centric representation that uses the center of the object as the location of the entity—and RL to overcome with the generation of meaningful behaviours . Unfortunately, this restricts the shape of objects to “point mass” like. Besides, there are object-centric approaches that instead of focusing on the interactive behaviour between the agent and the objects, they focus on view point matching  and agent navigation . Leaving out the literature on visual scene understanding with language, reasoning with object-centric representations as neurosymbols is, while the most promising, the least investigated area . There are just a few object-centric studies on visual reasoning in static images . Furthermore, there are relevant works from Large Language Models research (e.g., ), but they do not adhere to the grounding paradigm proposed, where reasoning should appear as an emergent property of learning a world physical model . For instance in  the reasoning capabilities are much more expressive than our proposed approach but they use pre-trained skill, which are conditioned on the language generated by the LLM. Conversely, our architecture learns the world dynamics and interaction through unsupervised learning, harnessing the construction of the proto-symbols while interacting. This does not prevent the possibility of connecting proposed architecture to a LLMs similarly to , but through the preference network, which is already grounded.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Structured representation learning appeared as a powerful way to introduce inductive biases and scale artificial intelligence to high-level cognition [ref]8 and exploit symmetries and invariances that can be leveraged by decomposing scenes into their natural constituents [ref]9.
