      "content": "Paper Title: MSGNN: A Spectral Graph Neural Network Based on a Novel Magnetic Signed Laplacian\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for extracting information from graph-structured data and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of machine learning tasks. However, compared to research on constructing GNNs for unsigned and undirected graphs, and graphs with multiple types of edges, GNNs for graphs where the edges have a natural notion of sign, direction, or both, have received relatively little attention. There is a demand for such tools because many important and interesting phenomena are naturally modeled as signed and/or directed graphs, i.e., graphs in which objects may have either positive or negative relationships, and/or in which such relationships are not necessarily symmetric . For example, in the analysis of social networks, positive and negative edges could model friendship or enmity, and directional information could model the influence of one person on another  . Signed/directed networks also arise when analyzing time-series data with lead-lag relationships [ref]4, detecting influential groups in social networks [ref]5, and computing rankings from pairwise comparisons . Additionally, signed and directed networks are a natural model for group conflict analysis , modeling the interaction network of the agents during a rumor spreading process , and maximizing positive influence while formulating opinions . In general, most GNNs are either spectral or spatial. Spatial methods typically define convolution on graphs as a localized aggregation whereas spectral methods rely on the eigen-decomposition of a suitable graph Laplacian. Our goal is to introduce a novel Laplacian and an associated GNN for signed directed graphs. While several spatial GNNs exist, such as SDGNN , SiGAT 0, SNEA 1, and SSSNET 2\nfor signed (and possibly directed) networks, this is one of the first works to propose a spectral GNN\nfor such networks. We devote special attention to the concurrent preprint SigMaNet 3 which also constructs a spectral GNN based on a different Laplacian. A principal challenge in extending traditional spectral GNNs to this setting is to define a proper notion of the signed, directed graph Laplacian. Such a Laplacian should be positive semidefinite, have a bounded spectrum when properly normalized, and encode information about both the sign and direction of each edge. Here, we unify the magnetic Laplacian, which has been used in 4 to construct a GNN on an (unsigned) directed graph, with a signed Laplacian which has been used for a variety of data science tasks on (undirected) signed graphs 5 6 7 8. Importantly, our proposed matrix, which we refer to as the magnetic signed Laplacian, reduces to either the magnetic Laplacian or the signed Laplacian when the graph is directed, but not signed, or signed, but not directed. Although this magnetic signed Laplacian is fairly straightforward to obtain, it is novel and surprisingly powerful:\nWe show that our proposed Magnetic Signed GNN (MSGNN) is effective for a variety of node clustering and link prediction tasks. Specifically, we consider several variations of the link prediction task, some of which prioritize signed information over directional information, some of which prioritize directional information over signed information, while others emphasize the method’s ability to extract both signed and directional information simultaneously. In addition to testing MSGNN on established data sets, we also devise a novel synthetic model which we call the Signed Directed Stochastic Block Model (SDSBM), which generalizes both the (undirected) Signed Stochastic Block Model from 2 and the (unsigned) Directed Stochastic Block Model from [ref]5. Analogous to these previous models, our SDSBM can be defined by a meta-graph structure and additional parameters describing density and noise levels. We also introduce a number of signed directed networks for link prediction tasks using lead-lag relationships in real-world financial time series. Main Contributions. The main contributions of our work are: We devise a novel matrix called the magnetic signed Laplacian, which can naturally be applied to signed and directed networks. The magnetic signed Laplacian is Hermitian, positive semidefinite, and the eigenvalues of its normalized counterpart lie in  02 . Our proposed Laplacian matrix and its counterpart reduce to existing Laplacians when the network is unsigned and/or undirected. We propose an efficient spectral graph neural network architecture, MSGNN, based on this magnetic signed Laplacian, which attains leading performance on extensive node clustering and link prediction tasks, including novel tasks that consider edge sign and directionality jointly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate GNNs on tasks that are related to both edge sign and directionality.111Some previous work, such as , evaluates GNNs on signed and directed graphs. However, they focus on tasks where either only signed information is important, or where only directional information is important. We introduce a novel synthetic model for signed and directed networks, called Signed Directed Stochastic Block Model (SDSBM), and also contribute a number of new real-world data sets constructed from lead-lag relationships of financial time series data.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: or enmity, and directional information could model the influence of one person on another  .
