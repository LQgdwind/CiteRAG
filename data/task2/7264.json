      "content": "Paper Title: Tiny Multi-Agent DRL for Twins Migration in UAV Metaverses: A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Stage II, UAV i𝑖i determines the bandwidth demand, denoted as bijsuperscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b_{i}^{j}, to purchase from RSU j𝑗j. This purchase decision is made to facilitate the migration of the corresponding UT. The bandwidth demand is guided by the bandwidth price strategies issued by the RSUs in Stage I. We denote the transmit power from RSU j𝑗j transmitting a rendered screen to UAVs as mjsuperscript𝑚𝑗m^{j}. Let τjsuperscript𝜏𝑗\\tau^{j} be the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) from RSU j𝑗j transmitting a rendered screen to UAVs, which is expressed as  where gjsuperscript𝑔𝑗g^{j} and σjsuperscript𝜎𝑗\\sigma^{j} represent the channel gain and additive white Gaussian noise, respectively. We define the spectrum efficiency of RSU j𝑗j transmitting a rendered screen to UAVs as qjsuperscript𝑞𝑗q^{j}, which is expressed as Therefore, the transmission rate of RSU j𝑗j transmitting a rendered screen to UAV i𝑖i is given by  The authors in  introduced the Structural Similarity Measure (SSIM) to assess local patterns of pixel intensities, accounting for normalization in terms of brightness and contrast. SSIM is a well-known and widely-adopted quality metric used to quantify the degree of similarity between the structural information of two images, which is a combination of three components and expressed as  where l​(x1,x2)𝑙subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2l(x_{1},x_{2}), c​(x1,x2)𝑐subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2c(x_{1},x_{2}), and s​(x1,x2)𝑠subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2s(x_{1},x_{2}) represent luminance comparison, contrast comparison, and structure comparison between image x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} and x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}, respectively. g​(⋅)𝑔⋅g(\\cdot) represents the combination function of SSIM. Note that the three components of SSIM are strictly independent, and SSIM meets the following three conditions : Symmetry: The SSIM between two images, denoted as x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} and x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}, is symmetric, meaning that S​S​I​M​(x1,x2)=S​S​I​M​(x2,x1)𝑆𝑆𝐼𝑀subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2𝑆𝑆𝐼𝑀subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥1SSIM(x_{1},x_{2})=SSIM(x_{2},x_{1}). Boundedness: The SSIM value between two images is bounded by 111, indicating that the SSIM score is always less than or equal to 111, i.e., S​S​I​M​(x1,x2)≤1𝑆𝑆𝐼𝑀subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥21SSIM(x_{1},x_{2})\\leq{1}. Unique maximum: The SSIM score reaches its maximum value of 111 if and only if the images being compared, x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} and x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}, are identical, i.e., S​S​I​M​(x1,x2)=1𝑆𝑆𝐼𝑀subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥21SSIM(x_{1},x_{2})=1 implies x1=x2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2x_{1}=x_{2}. In the quest for an immersive user experience within the metaverses, real-time rendering emerges as a pivotal technology [ref]16, with graphics rendering standing as a major function. With the dynamic mobility of UAVs, UAVs migrate their UTs between RSUs to make UMUs access metaverses services continuously and seamlessly. The fidelity of image rendering assumes a pivotal role in shaping the immersive experiences of UMUs.\nConsequently, we adopt the SSIM to gauge the realism of picture rendering, ensuring a seamless virtual environment for UMUs. We denote S​S​I​Mij𝑆𝑆𝐼superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑗SSIM_{i}^{j} as the SSIM score of the image received by UAV i𝑖i deciding to migrate its UTs to RSU j𝑗j, which is given by where lijsuperscriptsubscript𝑙𝑖𝑗l_{i}^{j}, cijsuperscriptsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗c_{i}^{j}, and sijsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖𝑗s_{i}^{j} represent the brightness similarity, contrast similarity, and structural similarity, respectively. The values quantify the image comparison between the rendered image in RSU j𝑗j and the received image by UMU after the migration of UT of UAV i𝑖i to RSU j𝑗j, followed by the transmission to UMU. α>0𝛼0\\alpha>0, β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, and ν>0𝜈0\\nu>0 are the parameters that adjust the brightness, contrast, and structural weights , respectively. Without loss of generality, to simplify the presentation of derivation, we set α=β=ν=1𝛼𝛽𝜈1\\alpha=\\beta=\\nu=1. We denote S​a​tij𝑆𝑎superscriptsubscript𝑡𝑖𝑗Sat_{i}^{j} as the satisfaction of UAV i𝑖i selecting RSU j𝑗j for UT migration, and employ logarithmic function ln⁡(⋅)⋅\\ln(\\cdot) to model the effect of the image transmission rate on the satisfaction of UAV i𝑖i, which is expressed as  where μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i} denotes the satisfaction factor of UAV i𝑖i, representing the sensitivity of UAV i𝑖i to the image transmission rate. Drawing inspiration from Gustav Fechner’s extension of the relationship between human perception and relative stimulus changes, known as Weber-Fechner’s Law (WFL) [ref]31, we leverage the ln⁡(⋅)⋅\\ln(\\cdot) function to model human perception of service quality. Then, we propose the utilization of metaverse immersion metrics to model the Quality of Experience (QoE) of UMUs based on WFL [ref]32. Therefore, the level of metaverses immersion that UAV i𝑖i can provide to UMUs after migrating its UTs to RSU j𝑗j can be expressed as where S​S​I​Mit​h𝑆𝑆𝐼superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑡ℎSSIM_{i}^{th} represents the minimum SSIM threshold of UAV i𝑖i . For UAVs, the metaverse immersion metric serves as a quantitative measure of QoE for UMUs, and a higher metric value indicates an enhanced QoE. Therefore, if UAV i𝑖i requests bandwidth resources from RSU j𝑗j, the utility function of UAV i𝑖i for RSU j𝑗j is given by where ξisubscript𝜉𝑖\\xi_{i} represents the metaverse immersion factor of UAV i𝑖i, and δi=ξi​μisubscript𝛿𝑖subscript𝜉𝑖subscript𝜇𝑖\\delta_{i}=\\xi_{i}\\mu_{i} for ensuring Uij>0superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑖𝑗0U_{i}^{j}>0. Since we consider multiple RSUs that provide similar resource services, UAV i𝑖i can choose to request bandwidth resources from any RSU, and the utility function of UAV i𝑖i is expressed as where 𝒃i={bi1,…,bij,…,biJ}subscript𝒃𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖1…superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗…superscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝐽\\boldsymbol{b}_{i}=\\{b_{i}^{1},\\ldots,b_{i}^{j},\\ldots,b_{i}^{J}\\} represents the bandwidth demand of UAV i𝑖i from each RSU j𝑗j, and 𝒑i={pi1,…,pij,…,piJ}subscript𝒑𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖1…superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗…superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑖𝐽\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}=\\{p_{i}^{1},\\ldots,p_{i}^{j},\\ldots,p_{i}^{J}\\} represents the bandwidth price of each RSU j𝑗j.\nEach UAV i𝑖i strategically determines its optimal bandwidth demand strategy vector, represented as 𝒃𝒊subscript𝒃𝒊\\boldsymbol{b_{i}}. This strategic decision-making process is driven by the objective of maximizing their respective utilities Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i}. The optimization is performed by the bandwidth price policy vector 𝒑isubscript𝒑𝑖\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}. The optimization problem for bandwidth purchases of UAVs is formulated as follows: where Risubscript𝑅𝑖R_{i} is the payment budget of UAV i𝑖i. UAVs decide their bandwidth purchase strategies depending on the pricing strategies employed by RSUs. The cumulative bandwidth purchases made by UAVs, on the other hand, influence the selling price strategies of RSUs. This interaction lays the groundwork for our upcoming derivation of the utility function of RSUs.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: implies x1=x2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2x_{1}=x_{2}.
