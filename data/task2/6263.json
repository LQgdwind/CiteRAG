      "content": "Paper Title: Power Control with QoS Guarantees: A Differentiable Projection-based Unsupervised Learning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present the performance of the proposed methods (DIPNet and DEPNet) with the conventional benchmarks. The considered performance metrics include network sum-rate, QoS violation probability, and per sample test time. To get a good estimate of the computation time, the overall computation time of each model is measured over the test set. Per-sample computation time is then calculated by averaging over the data points. For the calculation of the sum rate, if the output of a scheme violates the QoS constraint, we set the sum rate of that datapoint to be zero. In this way, the effect of constraint violation is highlighted in the performance evaluation. This method is adopted from [ref]15. In all the experiments, an FCNN with three 200-dimensional hidden layers is used as the backbone of DIPNet and DEPNet (ùí©rsubscriptùí©ùëü\\mathcal{N}_{r}). Batch normalization  and Dropout [ref]34 are used to accelerate the training and prevent over-fitting. The same neural network is used for the PNet as well. For the correction process of DEPNet, we used gradient descent with momentum for the training and Newton method for the testing. The momentum is set to 0.5 for all the datasets, and the step size is fine-tuned for each dataset individually from the interval of 0.5 to 0.0005. Similarly, the parameter ŒªùúÜ\\lambda in soft-loss (14) is chosen from the interval of 10 to 10000 for each dataset individually. The number of iterations in the iterative projection is set to 5 and 100 for the training (with Gradient Descent method) and testing (with Newton method), respectively. For all DNNs, we used a learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 10, and learning rate decay rate of 0.99. ADAM is also used for training the DNNs. All DNNs are trained for 20 epochs, and early stopping is used to pick the model with the best performance.\nThat is, after each epoch, we check the performance of the model over the validation set based on a metric like network sum-rate. Then, we pick the model that has the best performance among all epochs.\nThe performance metric for DIPNet and DEPNet is the network sum-rate.\nFor the PNet, we pick the model that has the minimum QoS violation probability. This is because choosing network sum-rate as the selecting criteria will result in a model that has a significant QoS violation probability, which will not be comparable with DIPNet and DEPNet. Moreover, based on the experiments, ŒªùúÜ\\lambda in the soft-loss of PNet is set to 1000 for Gaussian datasets and 10000 for path-loss datasets. This results in a model that has comparable performance in terms of network sum-rate and QoS violation with DIPNet and DEPNet. For the implementation, we used PyTorch  as the automatic differentiation engine. For implementing the implicit projection in DIPNet, we used the CVXPYlayer package . ECOS  is chosen as the optimization solver of this layer among the available options. To make the implementation consistent, GP is implemented in Python using CVXPY package . MOSEK , a commercial solver, is used as the backbone solver of CVXPY for both GP and Frank-Wolfe. The maximum number of iterations for Frank-Wolfe is set to 50 and the threshold is set to 0.001. Since the output of DIPNet is always feasible, we only applied Frank-Wolfe to the output of DIPNet, referred to as DIPNet+FW. Moreover, we used the genetic algorithm‚Äôs implementation on MATLAB with 5000 iterations for all the datasets. The experiments are done on a desktop computer with Intel Core i7-8700 CPU 3.20GHz and 8GB of RAM.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: the QoS constraint, we set the sum rate of that datapoint to be zero.
