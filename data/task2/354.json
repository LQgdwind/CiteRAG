Model-based Action-Gradient-Estimator Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) [ref]36  studies sequential decision making problems, in which an agent aims at maximizing the cumulative reward it collects in an environment.\nOne of the most popular classes of algorithms for RL are policy gradient methods  , which involve differentiable control policies improved by gradient ascent. They feature suitability to environments with continuous state and action spaces, and compatibility with state-of-the-art deep learning  methods.\nPolicy gradient algorithms often employ an actor-critic  scheme: an actor, which determines the control policy, is evaluated using a critic.\nThus, the degree of actor’s improvement is limited by the information provided by the critic, naturally raising the question of how the critic should be trained. Typically, algorithms that use powerful function approximators [ref]28  learn the critic by temporal difference , optimizing for an accurate prediction of the expected return of the actor.\nFor deterministic-policy continuous-control [ref]47 [ref]28, however, the value provided by the critic is neither used for improving the policy nor for acting in the environment .\nInstead, only the action-gradient of the value function, i.e., the gradient of the critic w.r.t. the action performed by the actor, is employed during policy optimization.\nSpecifically, the policy gradient is obtained through the computation of the action-value gradient, by chaining the actor’s Jacobian with the action-gradient of the critic. Learning the critic by value rather than by action-gradient of the value relies on hazy smoothness assumptions on the real value function [ref]47.\nThis means that, in conventional temporal difference learning, the critic learns action-value gradients implicitly, which could harm the performance of a deterministic policy gradient algorithm. In this paper, we propose Model-based Action-Gradient-Estimator Policy Optimization (MAGE), a continuos-control deterministic-policy actor-critic algorithm that explicitly trains the critic to provide accurate action-gradients for the use in the policy improvement step.\nMotivated by both the theory on Deterministic Policy Gradients [ref]47 and practical considerations, MAGE uses temporal difference methods to minimize the error on the action-value gradient.\nFor this, the algorithm leverages a trained dynamics model as a proxy for a differentiable environment and techniques reminiscent of double backpropagation .\nOn a challenging continuous control benchmark  , we show that MAGE is significantly more sample-efficient than state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2, we provide the notation and background on deterministic policy gradients.\nOur algorithm, together with its theoretical motivation, is introduced in Section 3, followed by empirical results in Section 4.\nIn Section 5, we present some of the related work and its relationship with our approach.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Reinforcement learning (RL) [ref]36  studies sequential decision making problems, in which an agent aims at maximizing the cumulative reward it collects in an environment.\nOne of the most popular classes of algorithms for RL\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
