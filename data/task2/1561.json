      "content": "Paper Title: GTAE: Graph-Transformer based Auto-Encoders for Linguistic-Constrained Text Style Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs one of the important content in social multimedia, language draws considerable attention and produce a series of text-related systems   [ref]3  . However, the text style has long been neglected in above applications and systems. Althought style transfer technologies have made significant progress in the field of computer vision [ref]6   , their success in natural language processing is much limited. Recently some preliminary works have emerged aiming at this task for text corpus 0 1 2, where a sentence is transferred to a target style attribute (e.g. sentiment, gender, opinion, etc.) while preserving the same content except for the style part. The manipulation of sentence attributes has wide applications in dialog systems and many other natural language fields. Different from related tasks like machine translation 3 and generic text generation 4, corpus for text style transfer are usually non-parallel, and thus the training process is performed in an unsupervised manner. Lacking paired text corpus poses a great challenge to preserving the style-independent content while transferring the style guided by other datasets. Current approaches mainly fall into the encoder-decoder paradigm. An encoder is used to extract latent embeddings of the sentence. Content and style embeddings are then disentangled in this space, so that style transfer can be achieved by manipulating the style feature vector, followed by a decoder to generate style-transferred sentences while keeping the content embeddings unchanged 0. However, in practice these two components are often deeply entangled and it is difficult to separate them in the latent space empirically. Besides, early variational autoencoder 5 based methods take Gaussian distribution as the prior of latent features, which is a too simplified assumption for natural language. Attempts to alleviate these problems include generating the prior with a learned neural network to replace the naive Gaussian assumption 6, adopting a cross-alignment strategy 1 and translating the sentence to the embedding space of another language under the assumption that translation will remove style-related features automatically 7 8 9. Nevertheless, due to the large searching space of models for natural language processing tasks and the lack of paired training corpus, it is non-trivial to retain semantic information in the learned content features. In practice, these approaches could still suffer from the large model space of natural language and fail to preserve the content and even logic of original sentences. However, language itself is an intelligent product of human beings, and by its nature should be limited to a much smaller model space based on linguistic rules which make up a language. Without parallel text corpus to restrict the content and the logic of transferred sentences, leveraging the linguistic knowledge provided by language grammars and logic rules could be an effective approach to prevent semantic information loss during the unsupervised training process. Inspired by this observation, we propose Graph-Transformer based Auto Encoder (GTAE) for non-parallel text style transfer, which models the linguistic constraints as graphs explicitly, and performs feature extraction and style transfer at the graph level, so as to maximally retain the content and the linguistic structure of original sentences. An illustration is provided in Fig. 1. In particular, we design two modules, i.e. a Self Graph Transformer (SGT) that updates the latent node embeddings with the desired style attribute and a Cross Graph Transformer (CGT) that retrieves the semantic information of input sentences, to replace the encoder and the decoder respectively. A linguistic graph is constructed using a public available semantic dependency parser based on learned grammar rules 0. Both SGT and CGT modules perform latent graph transformations constrained by the same linguistic graph structure for each input sentence. Then a simple RNN rephraser is used to generate final sentences from the transferred graphs. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on three text style transfer datasets for sentiments, political slants and title types, where our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of content preservation as expected, while achieving highly comparable transfer intensities and naturalness. The main contributions of this work are: (1) We propose to restrict the model space of natural language by its linguistic rules, rather than training without constraints or making too simplified assumptions, to mimic the natural language generation process of human. (2) We introduce a graph structure to model the linguistic constraints and propose a framework named Graph-Transformer based Auto Encoder to manipulate the latent space at the graph level. And our model is highly extendable for other tasks and model designs. (3) Empirical studies demonstrate the ability of our text style transfer system in preserving the semantic content. And we show that feature transformation in the graph-constrained model space will not affect transfer intensities and naturalness as well.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: As one of the important content in social multimedia, language draws considerable attention and produce a series of text-related systems   [ref]3  .
