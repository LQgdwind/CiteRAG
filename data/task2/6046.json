      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Mutual Influence between Self-Supervised Single-Frame and Multi-Frame Depth Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDepth estimation is an essential and challenging problem in 3D vision, which can be applied in a wide range of applications such as autonomous driving [ref]1 and augmented reality . Although active depth sensors e.g. Lidar and binocular cameras-based methods  exist, monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods that only use a single RGB camera to estimate depth still attract much attention due to their flexibility and low cost. In the past years, many deep learning-based MDE methods   [ref]6  [ref]8 have emerged. Among these methods, self-supervised methods [ref]6 [ref]8 that use unlabeled monocular video sequences as training data to eliminate the dependence on ground-truth depth made exciting progress. Early self-supervised methods [ref]6  [ref]8 mainly focus on single-frame depth estimation, which refers to inferring the corresponding depth map given a single image. Whilst flexible, single-frame approaches ignore that more than one frame may be available at test time in many practical applications. Therefore, a few recent works [ref]8    take multiple frames as input for depth estimation. Different from single-frame methods, these multi-frame methods mainly utilize the geometric matching features between multiple frames. Considering that dense feature matching is easily affected by occlusions, moving objects, and textureless regions, these methods try to utilize the single-frame information to improve multi-frame depth estimation unilaterally and show promising results. However, these “one-way” methods do not take full advantage of the “mutual” influence between single-frame depth estimation and multi-frame depth estimation due to ignoring the two issues: (1) the potential benefits of the difference between single-frame depth and multi-frame depth, and (2) the effect of multi-frame depth on single-frame depth estimation. Since current multi-frame depth methods   usually predict more accurate depth than single-frame methods  , the output of multi-frame depth models can be regarded as pseudo labels. Then we can model the uncertainty of single-frame depth using the difference between single-frame depth and multi-frame depth. Based on the above idea, we propose the Pixel-wise Adaptive Depth Sampling (PADS) module to determine the depth candidates used for multi-frame depth estimation, in which the single-frame depth is used to determine the geometric center of sampling range following  , and the difference between single-frame depth and multi-frame depth is used to determine the width of the sampling range. In this way, we improve the efficiency of depth sampling and form effective cost volumes for more accurate multi-frame depth estimation. Regarding the second issue, we adopt the multi-frame depth model as the teacher to train another single-frame depth network via distillation learning. To alleviate the impact that the teacher model generates inaccurate labels, we combine the photometric loss  and the distillation loss to form a minimum reprojection based distillation loss, ignoring the pseudo labels with large reprojection errors. Thus, the single-frame depth network also produces better results. To allow these two ideas to work in a compatible manner, we further propose a novel self-supervised training framework. Specifically, an uncertainty map is iteratively updated using the PADS module when training the teacher model and then fixed at test time. After distillation learning, the learned uncertainty map and the improved single-frame depth are further regarded as the input of the PADS module to determine the sampling range for cost volume generation so that the multi-frame network also benefits from the improved single-frame network. In summary, the contributions of the paper are as follows: A novel self-supervised distillation learning framework for MDE that fully utilizes the mutual benefits between self-supervised single-frame and multi-frame depth estimation. A pixel-wise adaptive depth sampling module to use the single-frame depth and the difference between single-frame depth and multi-frame depth as priors for multi-frame depth estimation. A distillation loss based on the minimum reprojection error to filter out the multi-frame depth predictions that may have large errors. A new state of the art on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets in self-supervised monocular depth estimation.
