      "content": "Paper Title: \\method: A Scalable Path-based Reasoning Approach for Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReasoning, the ability to apply logic to draw new conclusions from existing facts, has been long pursued as a goal of artificial intelligence¬†[ref]32 0. Knowledge graphs encapsulate facts in relational edges between entities, and serve as a foundation for reasoning. Reasoning over knowledge graphs is usually studied in the form of knowledge graph completion, where a model is asked to predict missing triplets based on observed triplets in the knowledge graph. Such a task can be used to not only populate existing knowledge graphs, but also improve downstream applications like multi-hop logical reasoning¬†[ref]34, question answering¬† and recommender systems¬†3. One challenge central to knowledge graph reasoning is the scalability of reasoning methods, as many real-world knowledge graphs¬†  contain millions of entities and triplets. Typically, large-scale knowledge graph reasoning is solved by embedding methods¬†  , which learn an embedding for each entity and relation to reconstruct the structure of the knowledge graph. Due to its simplicity, embedding methods have become the de facto standard for knowledge graphs with millions of entities and triplets. With the help of multi-GPU embedding systems¬†7 6, they can further scale to knowledge graphs with billions of triplets. Another stream of works, path-based methods¬†8   8, predicts the relation between a pair of entities based on the paths between them. Take the knowledge graph in Fig.¬†2(a) as an example, we can prove that Mother(a, f) holds, because there are two paths a ‚ÜíFatherFather‚Üí\\xrightarrow{\\text{Father}} b ‚ÜíWifeWife‚Üí\\xrightarrow{\\text{Wife}} f and a ‚ÜêBrotherBrother‚Üê\\xleftarrow{\\text{Brother}} c ‚ÜíMotherMother‚Üí\\xrightarrow{\\text{Mother}} f. As the semantics of paths are purely determined by relations rather than entities, path-based methods naturally generalize to unseen entities (i.e., inductive setting), which cannot be handled by embedding methods. However, the number of paths grows exponentially w.r.t.¬†the path length, which hinders the application of path-based methods on large-scale knowledge graphs. Here we propose \\methodto tackle the scalability issue of path-based methods. The key idea of our method is to search for important paths rather than use all possible paths for reasoning, thereby reducing time and memory in training and inference. Inspired by the A* algorithm¬†2 for shortest path problems, given a head entity uùë¢u and a query relation qùëûq, we compute a priority score for each entity to guide the search towards more important paths. At each iteration, we select KùêæK nodes and LùêøL edges according to their priority, and use message passing to update nodes in their neighborhood. Due to the complex semantics of knowledge graphs, it is hard to use a handcrafted priority function like the A* algorithm without a significant performance drop (Tab.¬†6(a)). Instead, we design a neural priority function based on the node representations at the current iteration, which can be end-to-end trained by the objective function of the reasoning task without any additional supervision. We verify our method on 4 transductive and 2 inductive knowledge graph reasoning datasets. Experiments show that \\methodachieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art path-based methods on FB15k-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10, even with only 10% of nodes and 10% edges at each iteration (Sec.¬†4.2). To verify the scalability of our method, we also evaluate \\methodon ogbl-wikikg2, a million-scale knowledge graph that is 2 magnitudes larger than datasets solved by previous path-based methods. Surprisingly, with only 0.2% nodes and 0.2% edges, our method outperforms existing embedding methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results (Sec.¬†4.2) as the first non-embedding method on ogbl-wikikg2. By adjusting the ratios of selected nodes and edges, one can trade off between performance and efficiency (Sec.¬†4.3). \\methodalso converges significantly faster than embedding methods (Fig.¬†1), which makes it a promising model for deployment on large-scale knowledge graphs. Additionally, \\methodoffers interpretability that embeddings do not possess. Visualization shows that \\methodcaptures important paths for reasoning (Sec.¬†4.4).\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Reasoning, the ability to apply logic to draw new conclusions from existing facts, has been long pursued as a goal of artificial intelligence¬†[ref]32 0.
