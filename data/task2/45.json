      "content": "Paper Title: Crowd Scene Analysis by Output Encoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe wide deployment of surveillance cameras in many cities stimulates the recent research interests in visual analysis of crowd scenes. It has a wide range of real-world applications, such as crowd surveillance, traffic monitoring and planning, even cell counting. Mainstream approaches can be summarized into two categories: counting by density prediction and counting by detection. State-of-the-art methods use regression-based models (e.g. object density estimator), which explicitly learn to count the objects of interest. These counting by density prediction approaches   [ref]3    have achieved superior performance on several existing counting datasets [ref]3  [ref]8. Density prediction methods measure deviation of the output density from a ground truth density during their training process. In order to train the density predictor, one has to create ground truth density map by smoothing on point (people head) annotations. This smoothing operation is extremely sensitive to high crowd density. If objects are densely present, peaks in the density map tend to merge. Neighboring peaks in the density map are very easy to mix together, thereby introducing errors in the very beginning stage. Additionally, sparse object locations create an imbalance in the cost function between positive and negative samples. Recent research  has indicated that only predicting object count or global density map for congested scenes is insufficient for real-world demand such as public safety or traffic flow monitoring. Grasping the accurate crowd position (rather than merely global density) is important for spatially identifying high-risk regions from whole monitor images. But there was a recent fashion to perform counting by density prediction. Although the crowd count could be a precise estimation in the whole image level, the predicted density map can largely deviate from the true density map in sub-image level. We illustrate this phenomenon in Fig.Â 1, where the global true count: 361 and estimated count: 365 are quite close to each other. But the estimated density does not offer reliable approximations to ground truth in specific image regions, whose true counts are 117, 63 and 16, but estimated counts are 138, 56 and 12. Despite the fashion of counting by density prediction, many researches  [ref]8  0 still propose to fulfill crowd counting and crowd localization simultaneously. Recent researches [ref]8  have argued that tackling localization task can bring noteworthy benefits for counting task, such as counting error correction, enabling localization-based applications e.g. human tracking. Counting by localization approaches formulate the counting task as a classic computer vision problem: object detection. For crowd scenes with few occlusion and low density, well-trained detector is able to localize objects, then object count is naturally obtained. These methods strive to directly predict the pixel level x,y-coordinate of objects. In this way, inevitable system prediction errors will also directly affect the pixel level coordinates of detected objects, such as position shift or size scaling of bounding boxes or dotted annotations. For general object detection, position shift or size scaling e.g. in tens pixels could be acceptable. However for accurate crowd localization, such shift or scaling can pose much bigger challenges for localization in crowded scenes where objects are densely distributed, and would result in complete false detections. It is often seen that the more crowded an area is, the more inaccurate detection could emerge. In this paper, we treat the task of crowd localization as an application of integrating Compressed Sensing based Output Encoding (CSOE) with supervised learning by CNN. As the output space is sparse for the crowd localization problem (only a few pixel locations are people head centroids), we can employ CSOE here. Furthermore, CS theory dictates that pairwise distances in the sparse space are approximately maintained in the compressed space 1. So, even after the output space encoding, CNN still targets the original output space in an equivalent distance norm. The principle behind our CSOE module is straightforward. CS converts the sparse output pixel space into dense and short vectors. As a regressor, we use a trained CNN to predict the compressed vectors. Then using a reconstruction algorithm, we recover sparse cell locations in the output pixel space. In other words, we seek a different route that casts the problem of detecting variable number of small objects into a task of signal regression in encoding signal space. Compared to pixel coordinates representation of crowd in images, a signal representation is more robust to inevitable system errors. On the basis of CSOE, we further render the structure of CNN+CS end-to-end trainable. CS-based encoding started with the work of Hsu et al. 1 that proved a generalization prediction error bound. The error bound depends on two factors. How well the machine learner has predicted; and how well the recovery process has worked. In this work, we realize the joint optimization of both the machine learner and the recovery process by implementing them as CNN-based observation layers and sparse coding based reconstruction layers of the end-to-end trainable network. In addition, we derive a backpropagation rule for the reconstruction layers. Thus, the end-to-end training process is not only occurring within the observation layers, but also back-propagates error signals to optimize the parameters of the reconstruction layers, finally removes the risk of gradient vanishing in the deep reconstruction layers. This is different from the conventional sequential pipeline, where each component is optimized independently and could cause error accumulation. Scale variation is a crucial challenge for object localization. An solution is to deploy in-network feature pyramids. E.g. FPN 2 adds a top-down connection to incorporate semantic high level features. Facing the issue of scale variation, we create Multiple Dilated Conv Branches (MDCB) sharing convolution weight but having different receptive field sizes for objects in different sizes. Furthermore, we deploy center pooling 3 to introduce the visual patterns within objects into the centroid point detection process. Due to the distance, capture angle between camera and crowd, targets present huge size variation. Recent crowd analysis works [ref]3 4 5 6 have suggested that the receptive field sizes of neural network should not be fixed, but modulated by the stimulus. Unfortunately, this property does not receive much attention in constructing deep learning models. In the paper, we present a nonlinear approach to aggregate information from multiple kernels to realize the adaptive changing of receptive field sizes. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Weighting (ARFW) module, which consists of a triplet of operations: spatially Aggregate, inter-channel Weight and Modulate. On the basis of backbone that generates multiple branches with various kernel sizes corresponding to different receptive field sizes, the Aggregate operator produces a channel descriptor by aggregating feature maps across their spatial dimensions. This descriptor enables a global receptive field within channel-wise feature maps. The Weight operator is based on two fully connected layers and produces a set of weights between channels. The Modulate operator modulates the feature maps of different receptive field sizes according to the channel weights. To this end, we propose a mechanism through which networks can learn to use global information to adaptively emphasize informative channels that have proper receptive field size and suppress less useful ones. The contributions of this paper are summarized as. (1) We propose the Compressed Sensing based Output Encoding (CSOE) scheme, which casts object localization as signal regression task, CSOE helps to boost localization performance in circumstances where targets are highly crowded without huge scale variation. (2) We create Multiple Dilated Convolution Branches (MDCB) that aims to improve localization accuracy when objects sizes change drastically in an image and offers a set of different receptive field sizes. Unlike traditional convolution+pooling operations, MDCB avoids excessive loss of detail resolution which poses huge challenges to high density crowd scenes analysis. (3) To further deals with scale variation issue, we propose an Adaptive Receptive Field Weighting (ARFW) mechanism through which networks can learn to use global information to adaptively emphasize informative channels that have proper receptive field size. (4) In the observation head, we enrich geometric center information by center pooling to capture more recognizable visual patterns that locate within objects, while may not always lie on the geometric center of objects. (5) We render the method end-to-end trainable by deriving an independent backpropagation rule for the reconstruction layers to prevent gradient vanishing and error accumulation brought by conventional cascaded networks.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: State-of-the-art methods use regression-based models (e.g. object density estimator), which explicitly learn to count the objects of interest.
