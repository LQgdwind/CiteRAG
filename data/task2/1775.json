      "content": "Paper Title: Realistic Differentially-Private Transmission Power Flow Data Release\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSimilar to [ref]1, we apply differential privacy with a practical\nlevel of sensitivity and distinguishability whereby the model maintains fidelity\nto the ground-truth optimal power flow at the transmission side of the power grid\nnetwork. However in addition to the previously discussed differences in the objectives\nand assumptions, our proposed mechanism also differs from [ref]1 on\nthree key modifications and extensions, as detailed below. First, in [ref]1 the values of conductance were perturbed with differential privacy, then the series reactance scaled proportionally to the resistance. However, here we apply the converse, perturbing the reactance 𝐫𝐫\\mathbf{r}, then accordingly scaling the resistance 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} — as reactance plays a much stronger role in the coupling between active power flows and voltage angle differentials over lines compared to resistance . Second, in [ref]1 an optimal dispatch cost objective was introduced into the objective function after applying differential privacy to restore feasibility after adding noise to network impedance. Although differential privacy is immune to post-processing as noted in  [ref]1, using the optimal dispatch cost objective may leak sensitive information, as it may give insight into the system solution by allowing an “inverse optimization” problem to be more easily solved, reconstructing the state of the original problem. Rather we apply transmission-level grid losses ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} as these are a more technically-focused aggregated metric of the system, so that there are many states/configurations that may produce the approximately the same grid loss value. Finally, as opposed to  [ref]1 we also obfuscate the branch shunt susceptance of the pi-model, 𝐛𝐬𝐡superscript𝐛𝐬𝐡\\mathbf{b^{sh}} (we assume shunt conductance is zero). Shunt susceptance becomes particularly prominent for cables and/or longer overhead lines, and can have significant influence on the flow of reactive power in the network. Together, these three key differences lead to a model of the AC Optimal Power\nFlow problem, which is more realistic than in [ref]1 and will\nbe detailed further next. We are using a generalization of the canonical AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The formulation is summarized in Model 1, as a function of complex power variables 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} and voltages 𝐕𝐕\\mathbf{V}, at network edges E𝐸E.It can be observed from Model 1, (9) and (10) that a cubic polynomial is being implemented. The mechanism for privacy-preserved minimum reactive power losses in this AC-OPF, faithful to suitable power flow constraints (s1)−(s6)subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠6(s_{1})-(s_{6}), is described in Algorithm 1, with description of OPF by output network description 𝒩˙=⟨N,E,𝐒,𝐘˙,𝛉𝚫,𝐬,𝐯⟩˙𝒩𝑁𝐸𝐒˙𝐘superscript𝛉𝚫𝐬𝐯\\mathcal{\\dot{N}}=\\langle N,E,\\mathbf{S},\\mathbf{\\dot{Y}},\\bm{\\theta^{\\Delta}},\\mathbf{s,v}\\rangle consisting of the set of nodes N𝑁N, the from edges E𝐸E, transformed AC power 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} and node admittance 𝐘˙˙𝐘\\mathbf{\\dot{Y}}, phase angle difference limits θΔsuperscript𝜃Δ\\theta^{\\Delta}, line apparent thermal limits 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} and voltage levels 𝐯𝐯\\mathbf{v}. Equations (11) to (15) describe the perturbation of shunt and series susceptances, and shunt conductances, as well as the μ𝜇\\mu parameter, used in (s4subscript𝑠4s_{4}) to (s6subscript𝑠6s_{6}), to solve the model as scaling constraints. We design the model to have the following properties: Line obfuscation: The line susceptances 𝐛~~𝐛\\mathbf{\\tilde{b}}\nof 𝒩~~𝒩\\mathcal{\\tilde{N}}, the network description satisfy ε𝜀\\varepsilon-differential privacy under α𝛼\\alpha-indistinguishability Consistency: 𝒩~~𝒩\\mathcal{\\tilde{N}} have feasible solutions to the OPF Constraints Model 1, (4) to (10) Objective Faithfulness: 𝒩~~𝒩\\mathcal{\\tilde{N}} is faithful to the value of the objective function (grid losses) up to a factor β𝛽\\beta, i.e., |𝒪​(𝒩)−𝒪​(𝒩~)𝒪​(𝒩)|≤β𝒪𝒩𝒪~𝒩𝒪𝒩𝛽|\\frac{\\mathcal{O(N)-O(\\tilde{N})}}{\\mathcal{O(N)}}|\\leq\\beta Then the following equations describe the perturbations of the line properties.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Similar to [ref]1, we apply differential privacy with a practical\nlevel of sensitivity and distinguishability whereby the model maintains fidelity\nto the ground-truth optimal power flow at the transmission side\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
