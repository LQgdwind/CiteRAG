      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSimultaneously evolving the learning task with the learner has been investigated in a variety of fields ranging from behavioral psychology  to evolutionary robotics  and RL [ref]21. For supervised learning (SL), this principle was given the name curriculum learning [ref]8. This name has by now also been established in the RL community, where a variety of algorithms, aiming to generate curricula that maximally benefit the learner, have been proposed. Narvekar and Stone [ref]22 showed that learning to create the optimal curriculum can be computationally harder than learning the entire task from scratch, motivating research on tractable approximations. Keeping the agent’s success rate within a certain range allowed to create curricula that drastically improve sample efficiency in tasks with binary reward functions or success indicators   . Many CRL methods     have been proposed inspired by the idea of ‘curiosity’ or ‘intrinsic motivation’   – terms that refer to the way humans organize autonomous learning even in the absence of a task to be accomplished. Despite the empirical success, no theoretical foundation has been developed for the aforementioned methods, preventing principled improvements. Another approach to curriculum generation has been explored under the name self-paced learning (SPL) for SL   , proposing to generate a curriculum by optimizing the trade-off between exposing the learner to all available training samples and selecting samples in which it currently performs well. Despite its widespread application and empirical success in SL tasks, SPL has only been applied in a limited way to RL problems, restricting its use to the regression of the value function from an experience buffer  or to a strictly episodic RL setting . Our method connects to this line of research, formulating the curriculum generation as a trade-off optimization of similar fashion. While the work by Ren et al.  is orthogonal to ours, we identify the result of Klink et al.  as a special case of our inference view. Besides allowing the combination of SPL and modern DRL algorithms to solve more complex tasks, the inference view presents a unified theory of using the self-paced learning paradigm for RL. As we interpret RL from an inference perspective over the course of this paper, we wish to briefly point to several works employing this perspective     .\nTaking an inference perspective is beneficial when dealing with inverse problems or problems that require tractable approximations  . For RL, it motivates regularization techniques such as the concept of maximum- or relative entropy    and stimulates the development of new, and interpretation of, existing algorithms from a common view  . Due to a common language, algorithmic improvements on approximate inference    can be shared across domains.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Simultaneously evolving the learning task with the learner has been investigated in a variety of fields ranging from behavioral psychology  to evolutionary robotics  and RL [ref]21.
