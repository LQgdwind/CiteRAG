Reclaiming unconditional speech synthesis from diffusion models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnconditional speech synthesis is the task of generating coherent speech without any conditioning inputs such as text or speaker labels [ref]1.\nAs\nin\nimage synthesis [ref]2, a well-performing unconditional speech synthesis model would have several useful applications:\nfrom latent interpolations between utterances and fine-grained tuning of different aspects of the generated speech, to audio compression and better\nprobability density estimation of speech. Spurred on by recent improvements in diffusion models  for images   , there has been a substantial improvement in\nunconditional speech synthesis\nin the last few years.\nThe\ncurrent best-performing approaches are all trained as\ndiffusion models  .\nBefore this, most studies\nused generative adversarial networks (GANs) \nthat map\na latent vector to a sequence of speech features with a single forward pass through the model.\nHowever,\nperformance was limited [ref]1 , leading to GANs falling out of favour for this task. Motivated by the StyleGAN literature   [ref]13 for image synthesis, we aim to reinvigorate GANs for unconditional speech synthesis.\nTo this end, we propose AudioStyleGAN (ASGAN): a convolutional GAN which maps a single latent vector to a sequence of audio features,\nand is designed to have a\ndisentangled latent space.\nThe model is based in large part on StyleGAN3 [ref]13, which we adapt for audio synthesis.\nConcretely, we\nadapt\nthe style layers to\nremove signal\naliasing caused by the non-linearities in the network.\nThis is accomplished with anti-aliasing filters to ensure that the Nyquist−\\mathchar 45\\relaxShannon sampling limits are met in each layer.\nWe also propose a modification to adaptive discriminator augmentation  to stabilize training by randomly dropping discriminator updates based on a guiding signal. Using objective metrics to measure the quality and diversity of generated samples  [ref]2 , we show that ASGAN sets a new state-of-the-art in unconditional speech synthesis on\nthe Google Speech Commands digits dataset .\nIt not only outperforms the best existing models, but is also faster to train and faster in inference.\nMean opinion scores (MOS)\nalso indicate\nthat ASGAN’s generated\nutterances sound\nmore natural (MOS: 3.68) than the existing best model (SaShiMi , MOS: 3.33). Through ASGAN’s design, the model’s latent space is disentangled during training, enabling the model – without any additional training\n– to also perform voice conversion and\nspeech editing\nin a zero-shot fashion.\nObjective metrics that measure latent space disentanglement indicate that ASGAN has smoother latent representations\ncompared to\nexisting diffusion models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Unconditional speech synthesis is the task of generating coherent speech without any conditioning inputs such as text or speaker labels [ref]1.\nAs\nin\nimage synthesis [ref]2, a well-performing unconditional speech synthesis model would have several useful applications:\nfrom latent interpolations between utterances and fine-grained\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
