The result is a coherent information processing system which can integrate low-level signals with high-level abstract reasoning so well that symbolic cognitive models  suggest the human mind operates on formal symbols. Similarly, physical symbol systems  characterise cognition as not only symbol recognition but also manipulation and combination.\nThis symbolic thought on top of signal processing within a connectionist architecture is learnt at a young age with children building an understanding of objects, their relations and rules in their environment [ref]55. Furthermore, neurobiological mechanisms in the human brain have been proposed for handling triplets of symbols, e.g. in the form of subject, verb and object . Yet, this level of harmony between neural and symbolic domains remains a mystery for machine learning. There has been a lot of interest and work on this topic under the umbrella of neuro-symbolic systems . In this context, neural refers to connectionist based approaches, mainly neural networks which have gained impressive achievements in image classification and audio recognition [ref]25 that scale well with large amounts of data and computing power. The symbolic part often refers to a logical formalism such as first-order logic  and its implementation within a logic programming paradigm . Although in the early days of Artificial Intelligence symbolic approaches were prominent, particularly in the form of expert systems 1, more recently they are used on top of neural networks in order to process non-symbolic sources of input such as images . Our approach provides a new perspective on existing feed-forward neural networks to build an end-to-end architecture that can not only handle low-level input but also converge to symbolic relations and rules. Hence, in this paper we focus on the question of whether an end-to-end neural network can learn objects, relations and rule-based reasoning going from pixels in an image all the way to logic-based rules.\nInspired by the perceptron algorithm  , we define an inductive bias to an otherwise regular feed-forward neural network in order to enable end-to-end neuro-symbolic learning. The main contribution of this paper is a novel way of constraining the bias of a linear layer to obtain the semantics of AND and OR gates as well as pruning and thresholding to extract symbolic rules from that layer. We evaluate our approach in a controlled environment with two synthetic datasets and present the analysis of the learnt objects, relations and rules. Our implementation using TensorFlow  is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/nuric/pix2rule with the accompanying data and analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [69]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]69: by continuous input such as vision and sound, humans have evolved to recognise, process and maintain symbolic thought that seem to have co-evolved with the use of a symbolic natural language [ref]69.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
