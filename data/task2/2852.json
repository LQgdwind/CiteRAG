      "content": "Paper Title: Investigating Health-Aware Smart-Nudging with Machine Learning to Help People Pursue Healthier Eating-Habits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the significant outcomes of nutri-FRS research over the years is domain knowledge. nutri-FRS researchers have contributed to acquiring knowledge on direct relations between particular food preferences and corresponding health-consequences and strategies to explain to the user why a recipe is particularly healthy for the individual. Further knowledge discovery included methods to introduce change in food decisions and strategies to map health guidelines on available food-data to filter for personalized, healthy recommendations. Few literature-review works looked into the success and failure of fundamental and domain-specific RS algorithms in nutri-FRS, contributing to knowledge on what works and what doesn’t in the nutr-FRS domain. To design and develop tools to assist the user in food activities, researchers need to understand how people make their food decisions. Knowledge of which variables, to what extent, and under which circumstances impact these decisions is significant. Different decision-variables are prioritized and negotiated in various ways during the food decision-making process, depending on the circumstances. Over time people develop their own rules and strategies for simplifying the processes involved in making food decisions . Jeffery Sobal et al. in    and Marketa Dolejsova et al. in  investigated human eating-habits and summarized which attributes influence food decisions and how these attributes change over time. Mariya Vizireanu et al in , Carole Bisogni et al. in  and Jeffery Sobal et al. in    outlined how individuals develop an understanding of healthy food. Ristovski Slijepcevic et al. in  looked into how healthy eating concepts are passed on through generations in families. Jeffery Sobal et al.  discussed how individuals adopt preexisting sound advice on healthy food and develop their own strategies to make better food decisions.\nSignificant research has been done to investigate the impact of different\nstimulus factors on human food choice, such as family { Ristovski Slijepcevic et al.  and Charles Abraham et al.  }, Society and Communities { Suzanne Higgs et al. ; Tegan Cruwys at al. and Ewelina Swierad et al.  } Social-media { Markus Rokicki et al. ; Andrew Arnold et al.  and Mariarosaria Simeone et al. } and Scientific findings  { Ristovski Slijepcevic et al. ; Lynn Spitzer et al.  and Susan Michie et al el.  } . Stefanie Mika in , Cristoph Trattner et al. in , Felicia Cordeiro et al. in  and Kerry Shih-Ping in  outline various challenges and research problems in the domain of nutri-FRS. Shahabeddin Abhari et al. in , Thi Ngoc et al. in [ref]165 , Weiqing Min et al. , Thomas Theodoridis et al in  and Christoph Trattner et al. in   studied the performance of various fundamental as well as food-domain-specific RS algorithms and reviewed which algorithmic strategies are the best for addressing specific nutri-FRS challenges. In many of their seminal research works, such as      , Christoph Trattner et al. looked into the potential of crowdsourced online recipes. Along with the healthiness of recipes available online, their research also looked at the hidden patterns within peoples’ uploaded recipes. Markus Rokicki et al. in   , investigated large online recipe corpuses to identify various relationships between lifestyle attributes and food preferences. Their research produced knowledge on possible correlations between certain food types and users-clusters, classified based on lifestyle attributes. They also provide various suggestions on which lifestyle variables are more likely to associate with healthier lifestyles. David Elsweiler et al., in many of their significant research works, such as    , investigated strategies to identify various taste-biases within online recipes and exploit the discovery for generating healthy recommendations. The nutri-FRS research community’s significant contribution has generated a versatile and extensive knowledge base relevant to nutri-FRS, enabling the more recent, optimistic research on machine-learned personalized healthy FR.\n\nReference markers found: [165]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]165: et al. in , Felicia Cordeiro et al. in  and Kerry Shih-Ping in  outline various challenges and research problems in the domain of nutri-FRS.
