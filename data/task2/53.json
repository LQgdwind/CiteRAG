      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancement of Short Text Clustering by Iterative Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to technological advances, short texts are generated at large volumes from different sources, such as micro-blogging, question-answering, and social news aggregation websites. Organizing these texts (e.g., grouping them by topic) is an important step towards discovering trends (e.g., political, economic) in conversations¬† and in other data mining tasks, such as data summarization¬†, frequent pattern analysis¬†, and searching for and filtering information¬†. Clustering the texts into groups of similar texts is the foundation for many of these organization strategies¬†[ref]5 [ref]6. The objective of our research is to effectively remove the outliers from the clusters (obtained by a clustering algorithm) and then reassign them to the proper clusters so as to improve the clustering quality of different clustering methods as well as outperform the state-of-the-art short text clustering methods which are based on neural networks¬†  and on a Dirichlet process multinomial mixture model¬†. The notion of our iterative classification is based on the idea of an iterative clustering algorithm called k-means--¬†0 which removes outliers in each iteration so as to obtain better clustering performance. Motivated by this, we remove outliers in each iteration of our iterative classification algorithm. Both k-means-- and our method compute representations of the outlier-free clusters. However, the way k-means-- and our method compute the representations are different. k-means-- represents each cluster by the average of the vectors of its non-outliers. In contrast, our method represents the clusters using a trained classification model. To obtain the model, it trains a classifier using the cluster labels of the non-outliers by following the notion of a previous work¬†1 which trained a classifier (i.e., support vector machine) using the labels obtained from k-means clustering.\nUsing the trained model, iterative classification reclassifies the outliers to their target clusters. The resulting set of clusters obtained by our method is the input for the next iteration or, if this is the last iteration, the final set of clusters is returned by the algorithm.\n The proposed clustering enhancement algorithm can be applied to any set of initial clusters and\nthus independent of the method used to obtain these clusters. The quality of the final set of clusters, however, does depend on the method used to compute the initial clusters. We use k-means¬†2, k-means--¬†0 and hierarchical clustering¬†2 using dense and sparse similarity matrices to compute the initial clusters.\nk-means and k-means-- clustering are applied to the vector representations of the texts. For hierarchical clustering, we use the text similarity matrix (dense or sparse). The dense similarity matrix stores the similarity value for each text pair, whereas the sparse similarity matrix keeps a certain number of most significant similarity values and discards the remaining ones (sets them to 0)¬†3. The matrix sparsification can be performed using different criteria for choosing the values to discard. We consider two approaches here, one based on kùëòk-nearest neighbors¬†2 and the other based on the similarity distribution111The similarity distribution based sparsification method has been described in our conference paper published in the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering, 2018.¬†4. The kùëòk-nearest neighbors method keeps the kùëòk largest entries in each row.\nIn the similarity distribution based method, the number of similarities to keep in each row is not fixed. Instead, it is based on the distribution of the similarity values in each row, as characterized by he mean and standard deviation of these values. These sparsification methods are discussed in detail\nin Section¬†4. The two major contributions of this work are as follows: The proposed clustering enhancement method improves the clustering quality of various short text datasets and does not require human annotated data to train the classification model. The implementation of our clustering enhancement method and the datasets are publicly available for reproducibility222https://github.com/rashadulrakib/short-text-clustering-enhancement.\n The combination of hierarchical clustering (using a sparse similarity matrix based on similarity distribution¬†4) and iterative classification performs better than other clustering methods combined with iterative classification. Moreover, this combination outperforms the state-of-the-art short text clustering methods by a statistically significant margin on the datasets with a moderate number of clusters. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. A brief overview of related work is presented in Section¬†2. The proposed clustering enhancement method is described in Section¬†3.\nWe discuss similarity matrix sparsification methods\nin Section¬†4.\nThe\nshort text clustering methods used in our experiments are described in Section¬†5.\nThe experimental results and evaluation of the proposed clustering enhancement method are\ndescribed in Section¬†6. We summarize the contributions and discuss future work in Section¬†7.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: frequent pattern analysis¬†, and searching for and filtering information¬†.
