      "content": "Paper Title: Crowdsharing Wireless Energy Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSharing energy services offer multiple advantages to the environment and IoT users. In what follows, we discuss each of the advantages in detail. Eco-friendly:\nThe global energy consumption of IoT devices is predicated with a 20% annual increase to reach 46 TWh by 2025. The massive energy consumption of IoT devices is one of the main contributors to 6% - 8% of the global carbon footprint caused by information and communication technologies . Crowdsharing energy contributes to reducing the carbon footprint by creating a self-sustained green IoT environment. The energy services rely on recycling spare energy or harvesting green energy from renewable resources such as body heat, solar, or kinetic activity . Spatial freedom:\nCrowdsharing energy services provide spatial independence for IoT users. Energy-constrained IoT devices are regularly required to be tethered to power outlets or carrying power banks. Both charging-cords and charging-pads are the last obstacle for IoT devices to achieve their spatial freedom. The prospected crowdsourced IoT environment is expected to enable wireless energy delivery up to five meters. This allows the seamless delivery of energy services. Flexibility: \nCrowdshared energy services are typically represented by time intervals. In this environment, consumers and providers may invoke or offer services for the full-time interval or only partially according to their preferences [ref]17, i.e., they do not have any lock-in contracts like traditional services. In addition, providers and consumers may extend their stay-time to offer or receive an energy service . These features offer flexible charging services in the crowdsharing environment. Energy on demand: \nThe miniaturization of IoT devices restricts the size of their batteries. The small size of the battery results in a limited energy storage capacity. This limitation restrains the capabilities of the IoT devices. Energy consumption optimization has been extensively researched to enable long-lasting working-time on a single charge. However, there is still a gap for further energy optimizations. Hence, crowdsharing energy presents a simple and yet effective solution to charge IoT devices and extend their working-time [ref]20. Convenience:\nCrowdsharing energy services present a convenient alternative to charge IoT devices as it allows them to be charged wirelessly anywhere and anytime. This ubiquity of wireless charging facilitates access to energy for IoT users. In addition, the flexibility in advertising and requesting energy services, as previously discussed, emphasizes the convenience for IoT users. IoT users might subscribe to crowdsharing energy without any lock-in contract. They can also move freely while providing or acquiring energy . This convenience promises a wide spread of the crowdsharing ecosystem. Growth of the Market:\nThe concept of wireless crowdcharging has recently gained increasing interest in industry . The market for wireless charging has an annual growth rate of 23.4 % and is predicted to reach $50 billion dollars in 2027 . This recent trend of adopting the wireless charging technology in the industry and the ubiquity of IoT promises the spread and accessibility of crowdsharing energy services .\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: are typically represented by time intervals. In this environment, consumers and providers may invoke or offer services for the full-time interval or only partially according to their preferences [ref]17, i.e., they do not have any lock-in contracts like traditional services. In addition, providers and consumers may extend their stay-time to offer or receive an energy service . These features\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
