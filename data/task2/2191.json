      "content": "Paper Title: A Condense-then-Select Strategy for Text Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtractive methods. \nMost of the previous extractive methods consist of two major components: scoring of each document sentence and selection of sentences.\nSequence labelling models   [ref]12 [ref]13 first learn a relevance score for each document sentence, and then select the document sentences with a score larger than 0.5. The joint scoring and selection approach   is proposed to extract sentences one by one. At each step, a decoder attends to the document sentences and selects the sentence with the highest attention score.\nSome of the methods above [ref]12 [ref]13   apply reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the non-differential ROUGE scores.\nRecently, Zhong et al.  propose a method to perform extraction at summary level instead of sentence level. This method first enumerates all possible combinations of document sentences as the summary candidates from a pruned document. Then it selects the candidate that has the highest semantic similarity with the document measured by a text matching model. \nCompared to the above extractive methods, our framework uses an abstractive model to condense the document sentences before the sentence extraction. Hence, our framework can introduce novel words in the output summary. Abstractive methods. \nAbstractive methods rely on the encoder-decoder neural model  to generate a summary.\nSee et al. [ref]2 propose the pointer-generator network that allows the decoder to copy words from the input document.\nGehrmann et al.  introduce the bottom-up attention to improve the contention selection ability of the pointer-generator network, whereas other methods    apply multi-task learning frameworks to enhance the contention selection capability.\nThe ASGARD method  incorporates the information from a knowledge graph into the decoder to improve the faithfulness of the generated summary. \nSeveral methods   apply RL to directly optimize the ROUGE scores.\nSince the training objective of ROUGE scores harms the language fluency of a decoder , we only use RL to train our extractor in order to improve ROUGE scores without hurting the fluency.\nRecent abstractive methods     fine-tune large pre-trained language models on text summarization datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance.\nXu et al.  uses the self-attention distribution in the Transformer encoder to estimate the centrality of each source word. Then the centrality of each word is used to guide the copying process in a large pre-trained language model. \nAnother line of research   studies the problem of controlling the absolute length of the output summary, whereas our compression-controllable abstractor only controls the length difference between the input and output sentences.\nCompared to these methods, our framework only performs sentence-level abstraction, which has higher training efficiency. Hybrid methods. \nExisting hybrid methods follow a select-then-compress framework that first selects document sentences and then condenses each of them. Traditional methods adopt integer linear programming 0, Hidden Markov Models , and statistical models based on a parsing tree .\nSome recent methods use neural networks to compress a selected document sentence by extracting important words  or selecting a compression option derived from constituency parses 1, but they cannot generate novel words.\nThe sentence rewriting method  applies the encoder-decoder model to rewrite the selected document sentences into shortened versions, which can generate novel words.\nThe SENECA model 2 explicitly incorporates the entity information into the extractor module.\nHowever, sentence-level compression is prone to delete salient information. We address this problem by adopting a condense-then-select strategy, which shares a similar idea with the trimming approach 3 for multi-document summarization. The trimming approach first compresses each leading document sentence into multiple candidates by heuristic rules, and then selects sentences from the candidates. We are the first to study this idea in abstractive summarization, where our abstractor can generate novel words. Although our work is closely related to the sentence-rewriting method , there are four key differences.\n(1) The sentence-rewriting method follows a select-then-compress framework; whereas our methods follow a condense-then-select framework. If salient information is deleted during content abstraction, the extractor in our framework can select original sentences to retain the salient information.\n(2) In the sentence-rewriting method, the extraction candidates only contain the original document sentences. Hence, the candidate extractor only considers the interactions among the document sentences. In our framework, the extraction candidates have two types of interaction: the interaction among different document sentences; and the interaction between a document sentence and its condensed versions. Hence, we add a sentence candidate set representation into the candidate extractor to model the interaction between a document sentence and its condensed versions.\n(3) The sentence-rewriting method uses the pointer-generator network [ref]2 as the abstractor. Our work extends the pointer-generator network to build a compression-controllable abstractor, which condenses a document sentence into two concise versions with different compression levels.\n(4) During training, the sentence rewriting method  uses the sentence-level Rouge-L score as the reward of selecting a candidate, which aims at a local optimum of one selection. Our work uses the marginal increase in ROUGE-L score of the output summary as the reward, which aims at the global optimum of the entire output summary.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Extractive methods. \nMost of the previous extractive methods consist of two major components: scoring of each document sentence and selection of sentences.\nSequence labelling models   [ref]12 [ref]13 first learn a relevance score for each document sentence, and then select the document sentences with a score larger than 0.5.
