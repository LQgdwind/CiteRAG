      "content": "Paper Title: Post-Quantum 𝜅-to-1 Trapdoor Claw-free Functions from Extrapolated Dihedral Cosets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe quantum hardness of LWE (QLWE) assumes that the LWE problem is hard for any quantum polynomial-time algorithms. Recently, the following connections between the QLWE assumption and quantum computation have received much attention. The first explicit connection is related to the dihedral coset problem (DCP). The DCP is quantumly derived from the dihedral hidden subgroup problem (DHSP)  . At FOCS ’02, Regev  proved the first quantum reduction from the lattice problem to the DCP. Namely, if there exists a polynomial-time quantum algorithm that solves the DCP, then there exists an algorithm to solve the \\poly\\poly\\poly-unique SVP. Furthermore, Brakerski et al. [ref]5 at PKC ’18 further generalized Regev’s proof and characterized the QLWE assumption under quantum polynomial-time reductions, showing that the LWE problem is quantumly equivalent to a generalization of DCP known as extrapolated dihedral coset problem (EDCP). Another interesting connection, initiated by the recent work of Brakerski et al. [ref]4 at FOCS ’18, is to leverage the QLWE assumption for demonstrating “proofs of quantumness” 111The term “proofs of quantumness” also known as “quantum supremacy”, is to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage.. Therein, an interactive cryptographic protocol was proposed between a polynomial-time classical verifier and a single untrusted polynomial-time bounded quantum prover, where a quantum prover can successfully respond to the verifier’s challenges and will be accepted, whereas any classical prover will be rejected. The interaction model is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. The core subroutine of their work is known as a qubit certification test protocol, which extremely relies on a powerful cryptographic tool called the 2-to-1 noisy trapdoor claw-free functions (NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2}) with adaptive hardcore bit (AHB) property. For now, the 2-to-1 trapdoor claw-free functions (TCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2}) promise to be an effective tool for limiting, describing, and verifying the actions of untrusted quantum devices. Conceptually, the TCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} is a pair of injective functions f0,f1subscript𝑓0subscript𝑓1f_{0},f_{1} which have the same image, and with access to a secret trapdoor it is easy to evaluate the two preimages x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} and x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} of the same image y𝑦y such that f0​(x0)=f1​(x1)=ysubscript𝑓0subscript𝑥0subscript𝑓1subscript𝑥1𝑦f_{0}(x_{0})=f_{1}(x_{1})=y. However, it is computationally difficult to invert f0,f1subscript𝑓0subscript𝑓1f_{0},f_{1} without the trapdoor. Such a pair of (x0,x1)subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥1(x_{0},x_{1}) is known as a claw, hence the name is claw-free  [ref]22. Moreover, the additional AHB property states that whenever f0​(x0)=f1​(x1)subscript𝑓0subscript𝑥0subscript𝑓1subscript𝑥1f_{0}(x_{0})=f_{1}(x_{1}), finding even a single bit of formation about x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} should be computationally intractable for any x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}. Note that a TCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} with the AHB property is often referred to as a strong TCF, while a TCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} without the AHB property is called as a regular (or ordinary) TCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2}. Unfortunately, it is unclear how to construct such a clean version of strong TCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} under standard cryptographic assumptions. Instead, a noisy version of TCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} called NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} based on the QLWE assumption is first introduced by [ref]4 [ref]22, which is the only known instance that satisfies the strong TCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} property. In [ref]4, the qubit certification test essentially employs the NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} to enforce qubits structure of the quantum prover. Roughly speaking, the classical verifier uses the NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} to enable the quantum prover to create a superposition as 12(|0⟩|𝒙0⟩+|1⟩|𝒙0−𝐬⟩\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}\\ket{\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}}+\\ket{1}\\ket{\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}-\\boldsymbol{\\rm s}}, where 𝐬∈\\ZZqn𝐬subscriptsuperscript\\ZZ𝑛𝑞\\boldsymbol{\\rm s}\\in\\ZZ^{n}_{q} is a fixed secret, 𝒙0∈\\ZZqnsubscript𝒙0subscriptsuperscript\\ZZ𝑛𝑞\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}\\in\\ZZ^{n}_{q} is arbitrary and 𝒙1=𝒙0−𝐬modqsubscript𝒙1modulosubscript𝒙0𝐬𝑞\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}=\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}-\\boldsymbol{\\rm s}\\mod q. Afterward, the verifier randomly chooses to either run a preimage test or an equation test. In the preimage test, the quantum prover would measure the above state in the computational basis, thereby resulting in 1-bit information of randomness b∈\\bin𝑏\\binb\\in\\bin, as well as a random preimage, 𝒙0subscript𝒙0\\boldsymbol{x}_{0} or 𝒙1subscript𝒙1\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}. Instead, in the equation test, the quantum prover would measure the above state in the Hadamard basis, yielding a bit c𝑐c and a string d∈\\binn​log⁡q𝑑superscript\\bin𝑛𝑞d\\in\\bin^{n\\log q}, which will be checked by the verifier for c=d⋅(𝒙0⊕𝒙1)𝑐⋅𝑑direct-sumsubscript𝒙0subscript𝒙1c=d\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}\\oplus\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}) holds 222In fact, the bit c𝑐c is evaluated by c=d⋅(𝒥​(𝒙0)⊕𝒥​(𝒙1))𝑐⋅𝑑direct-sum𝒥subscript𝒙0𝒥subscript𝒙1c=d\\cdot(\\mathcal{J}({\\boldsymbol{x}}_{0})\\oplus\\mathcal{J}({\\boldsymbol{x}}_{1})) in [ref]4, where 𝒥​(⋅)𝒥⋅\\mathcal{J}(\\cdot) is the binary representation function. For simplicity, we omit this function in the expression.. Notably, to completely protect against a cheating quantum prover, the proposal requires the aforementioned AHB property, which can be informally reformulated as follows: if a quantum polynomial-time bounded prover can pass both the preimage test and the equation test simultaneously, then the quantum prover can break the QLWE assumption by learning a bit of the secret 𝐬𝐬\\boldsymbol{\\rm s}. Unfortunately, as the NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} are essentially 2-to-1 functions, the rate of randomness generation per round is inefficient. To handle this issue, Mahadev et al.  recently consider replacing the NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} by a powerful cryptographic tool that looks like k𝑘k-to-1 functions for large k𝑘k, with the goal of producing log⁡k𝑘\\log k bits of randomness per round as opposed to 1. Concretely, the k𝑘k-to-1 functions introduced in their work arise from the use of leakage resilience techniques of LWE. The main idea behind in  is to change the preimage test of the original qubit certification test protocol by swapping the use of an LWE matrix 𝐀𝐀\\boldsymbol{\\rm A} for a computationally indistinguishable lossy matrix 𝐀~bold-~𝐀\\boldsymbol{\\rm\\widetilde{A}}, where 𝐀~=𝐁𝐂+𝐄bold-~𝐀𝐁𝐂𝐄\\boldsymbol{\\rm\\widetilde{A}}=\\boldsymbol{\\rm{B}}\\boldsymbol{\\rm{C}}+\\boldsymbol{\\rm{E}} and 𝐂∈\\ZZqℓ×n​(ℓ≈n/log⁡q)𝐂subscriptsuperscript\\ZZℓ𝑛𝑞ℓ𝑛𝑞\\boldsymbol{\\rm{C}}\\in\\ZZ^{\\ell\\times n}_{q}(\\ell\\approx n/\\log q). Since the matrix 𝐀~bold-~𝐀\\boldsymbol{\\rm\\widetilde{A}} is lossy, then for a valid image reported by the quantum prover there are up to k≈qn−ℓ𝑘superscript𝑞𝑛ℓk\\approx q^{n-\\ell} valid preimages. Hence, by exploiting the k𝑘k-to-1 functions based on leakage resilience, their protocol could produce \\bigOmega​n\\bigOmega𝑛\\bigOmega{n} bits of randomness in constant rounds. However, in their work, the construction of k𝑘k-to-1 claw-free hash functions based on leakage resilience faces two tricky problems during the equation test phase. Firstly, as the superposition over many preimages instead over two, it is unclear how to perform the Hadamard measurement in the equation test. Secondly, the classical verifier can no longer rely on the knowledge of a trapdoor, since the image 𝒚𝒚\\boldsymbol{y} inherently has many valid preimages. In the original qubit certification protocol, we know that the trapdoor is necessary for the verifier to inverse a given image 𝒚𝒚\\boldsymbol{y}, thereby obtaining the 𝒙0subscript𝒙0\\boldsymbol{x}_{0} and checking c=d⋅(𝒙0⊕(𝒙0−𝐬))𝑐⋅𝑑direct-sumsubscript𝒙0subscript𝒙0𝐬c=d\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}\\oplus(\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}-\\boldsymbol{\\rm s})) holds. To address both problems simultaneously, Mahadev et al. introduced a hypothetical protocol with a quantum verifier who is allowed access to the quantum prover’s state to remove the need for the trapdoor. Finally, to revert back to a classical verifier protocol, they proposed a compromise hybrid argument, in which the proposal uses the original NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} for the test rounds while uses the k𝑘k-to-1 functions for the generation rounds. The key to combining both is that lossy and uniform matrices are computationally indistinguishable. Although their final protocol can be reduced to a classical verifier protocol, the hypothetical quantum verifier introduced during their analysis makes the whole hybrid solution look unintuitive. Based on this, it is worth considering the following natural question: Assuming the QLWE assumption, can we construct a many-to-one claw-free function and require that this function even have a trapdoor? For this purpose, instead of building k𝑘k-to-1 functions via the leakage resilience, we attempt to extend the original NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2} and directly construct a family of κ𝜅\\kappa-to-1 noisy trapdoor claw-free functions (NTCFκ1subscriptsuperscriptabsent1𝜅{}^{1}_{\\kappa}) with κ=\\poly𝜅\\poly\\kappa=\\poly under QLWE assumption. Notably, for constructing NTCFκ1subscriptsuperscriptabsent1𝜅{}^{1}_{\\kappa}, we manifest an interesting connection between the NTCFκ1subscriptsuperscriptabsent1𝜅{}^{1}_{\\kappa} and the Extrapolated Dihedral Coset State introduced in [ref]5. Finally, we demonstrate the NTCFκ1subscriptsuperscriptabsent1𝜅{}^{1}_{\\kappa} can naturally be reduced to the NTCF21subscriptsuperscriptabsent12{}^{1}_{2}, thereby achieving the same application for proving the quantumness as [ref]4.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: to the DCP.
