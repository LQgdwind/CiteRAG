      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring and Distilling Posterior and Prior Knowledge for Radiology Report Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWriting a radiology report can be time-consuming and tedious for experienced radiologists, and error-prone for un-experienced radiologists . Similar to image paragraph generation, most existing works   [ref]44 attempt to adopt a HRNN to automatically generate a fluent report. However, due to the serious data deviation, these models are poor at finding visual groundings and are biased towards generating plausible but general reports without prominent abnormal narratives [ref]14 [ref]22 [ref]44 . Currently, some approaches [ref]14 [ref]22 [ref]44    have been proposed to alleviate data deviation. In detail, instead of only adopting a single sentence-level RNN to generate both the normal and abnormal sentences, [ref]14 introduced two RNNs as two different report writers, i.e., Normality Writer and Abnormality Writer, to help the model to generate more accurate normal and abnormal sentences, respectively. At the same time, [ref]22 proposed a hybrid model with template retrieval and text generation module, which focus on the generation of normal and abnormal sentences, respectively, to enhance the ability of model in describing abnormalities. Most recently,  designed the medical graph based on prior knowledge from chest findings, in which each node is denoted by disease keywords representing one of the disease findings, so as to increase the capability of models to understand medical domain knowledge. Concurrently to our own work, the auxiliary signals introduced in  is similar to the idea of our approach. In particular,  only consider the medical graph, while we further leverage the disease topic tags and working experience to enhance the learning of posterior and prior knowledge, respectively. Besides, we further provides the evidence of this advantage of our approach on two public datasets. It is observed that the data-driven RNNs designed in [ref]14 and [ref]22 could be easily misled by the rare and diverse abnormalities, disabling them from efficiently modeling the abnormal sentences.\nDifferent from them, our idea is mainly inspired by radiologists’ working patterns , to explore and distill the posterior and prior knowledge for accurate radiology report generation, which is missing in their approaches.\nFor the network structure, we first explore the posterior knowledge of input radiology image by proposing to explicitly extract the abnormal regions; Next, inspired by [ref]22 and  which proved the effectiveness of retrieval module and medical knowledge graph, we leverage the retrieved reports and medical knowledge graph to model the prior working experience and prior medical knowledge. In particular, instead of only retrieving some sentences in previous works [ref]22 , we propose to retrieve a large amount of similar reports. Besides, since the templates may change over time, which was ignored in [ref]22, using fixed templates will introduce inevitable errors. As a result, we treat the retrieved reports as latent guidance. In all, we combine the merits of retrieval module and knowledge graph in a single model. Finally, by distilling the useful prior and posterior knowledge, our approach could generate accurate reports.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: a radiology report can be time-consuming and tedious for experienced radiologists, and error-prone for un-experienced radiologists .
