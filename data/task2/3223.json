      "content": "Paper Title: RepMLPNet: Hierarchical Vision MLP with Re-parameterized Locality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe locality of images (i.e., a pixel is more related to its neighbors than the distant pixels) makes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) successful in image recognition, as a conv layer only processes a local neighborhood. In this paper, we refer to this inductive bias as the local prior. Besides, we also desire the ability to build up long-range dependencies, which is referred to as the global capacity in this paper. Traditional CNNs model the long-range dependencies by deep stacks of conv layers [ref]40. However, repeating local operations may cause optimization difficulties  [ref]40 . Some prior works enhance the global capacity with self-attention-based modules [ref]40 8 , which have no local prior. For example, due to the lack of local prior, ViT 8 requires an enormous amount of training data (3×1083superscript1083\\times 10^{8} images in JFT-300M) to converge. On the other hand, a fully-connected (FC) layer can also directly model the dependencies between any two input points, which is as simple as flattening the feature map as a vector, linearly mapping it into another vector, and reshaping the resultant vector back into a feature map. However, this process has no locality either. Without such an important inductive bias, the concurrently proposed MLPs 6 7   usually demand a huge amount of training data (e.g., JFT-300M), more training epochs (300 or 400 ImageNet  epochs) or special training techniques (e.g., a DeiT-style distillation method  7) to learn the inductive bias from scratch. Otherwise, they may not reach a comparable level of performance with traditional CNNs. We desire an MLP model that is 1) friendly to small-data, 2) trainable with ordinary training methods, and 3) effective in visual recognition. To this end, we make contributions in three aspects: methodology, component and architecture. Methodology We propose a novel methodology, Locality Injection, to provide an FC layer with what it demands for effective visual understanding: the locality. Specifically, we place one or more conv layers parallel to the FC and add up their outputs. Though the FC simply views the feature maps as vectors, completely ignoring the locality, the conv layers can capture the local patterns. However, though such conv layers bring only negligible parameters and compute, the inference speed may be considerably slowed down because of the reduction of degree of parallelism on high-power computing devices like GPUs . Therefore, we propose to equivalently merge the conv layers into the FC kernels after training to speed up the inference. By doing so, we obtain an FC layer that is structurally identical to a normally trained FC layer but is parameterized by a special matrix with locality. Since Locality Injection converts the training-time structure (FC + conv) to the inference-time (a single FC) via an equivalent transformation on the parameters, it can be viewed as a novel Structural Re-parameterization 5 1 4 3 6 technique. In other words, we equivalently incorporate the inductive bias into a trained FC layer, instead of letting it learn from scratch. The key to such an equivalent transformation is converting an arbitrary conv kernel to an FC kernel (i.e., a Toeplitz matrix). In this paper, we propose a simple, platform-agnostic and differentiable approach (Sec. 3). Component Based on Locality Injection, we propose RepMLP Block as an MLP building block. Fig. 1 shows a training-time RepMLP Block with FC, conv and batch normalization  (BN) layers can be equivalently converted into an inference-time block with only three FC layers. Architecture The hierarchical design has been shown to benefit visual understanding   . Therefore, we propose a hierarchical MLP architecture composed of RepMLP Blocks. In other words, as the feature map size reduces, the number of channels increases. We reckon that the major obstacle for adopting hierarchical design in a ResMLP- 7 or MLP-Mixer-style 6 model is that the number of parameters is coupled with the feature map size 111In this paper, an MLP refers to a model that mostly uses FC layers to linearly map features from a vector to another, so that the number of parameters must be proportional to the input size and output size. By our definition, another model, CycleMLP , is not referred to as an MLP., so that the number of parameters of the lower-level FC layers would be several orders of magnitude greater than the higher-level layers. For example, assume the lowest-level feature maps are of 56×\\times56, an FC layer requires 564=9.8superscript5649.856^{4}=9.8M parameters to map a channel to another, without any cross-channel correlations (i.e., like depth-wise convolution). We may let all the channels share the same set of parameters, so that the layer will have a total of 9.8M parameters. However, let the highest-level feature maps be of 7×\\times7, the parameter count is only 74=2.4superscript742.47^{4}=2.4K but the number of channels is large. Predictably, sharing so few parameters among so many channels restricts the representational capacity hence results in inferior performance. We solve this problem by a set-sharing linear mapping (Sec. 4.1) so that we can independently control the parameter count of each layer by letting the channels share a configurable number of parameter sets s𝑠s. With a smaller s𝑠s for the lower-level layers and a larger s𝑠s for the higher-level ones, we can balance the model size and the representational capacity. Another drawback of the concurrently proposed MLPs is the difficulty of transferring to the downstream tasks like semantic segmentation. For example, MLP-Mixer 6 demonstrates satisfactory performance on ImageNet but does not qualify as the backbone of a segmentation framework like UperNet  as it aggressively embeds (i.e., downsamples) the images by 16×\\times and repeatedly transforms the embeddings, so that it cannot produce multi-scale feature maps with different levels of semantic information. In contrast, our hierarchical design produces semantic information on different levels, so that it can be readily used as the backbone of the common downstream frameworks. In summary, with Locality Injection, RepMLP Block and a hierarchical architecture, RepMLPNet achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off with only 100 training epochs on ImageNet, compared to the other MLP models trained in 300 or 400 epochs. We also show the universality of Locality Injection as it improves the performance of not only RepMLPNet but also ResMLP 7. Moreover, RepMLPNet shows satisfactory performance as the first attempt to transfer an MLP-style backbone to semantic segmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: desire the ability to build up long-range dependencies, which is referred to as the global capacity in this paper.
