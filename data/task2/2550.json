      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating Iterated Persistent Homology Computations with Warm Starts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe list all data sets used in our experiments below, including synthetic data sets (1)(3) and empirical measurements and experiments (4)(5)(6). Sphere1 and Sphere2 : We first randomly generate two data sets, where each with 200 points on S1‚äÇ‚Ñù2superscriptùëÜ1superscript‚Ñù2S^{1}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2} and on S2‚äÇ‚Ñù3superscriptùëÜ2superscript‚Ñù3S^{2}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{3}, and next add normal noise with standard deviation 0.0010.0010.001 to them. We update persistence from unnoised spheres. Eight: We randomly generate a figure 8 with 200 points in ‚Ñù2superscript‚Ñù2\\mathbb{R}^{2} and add normal noise with standard deviation 0.0010.0010.001(See Figure¬†1). We measure the performance our updating scheme after the perturbation of noise scale. Klein3 : The data set was introduced in , which samples 400 points from the Klein bottle using its ‚Äúfigure-8‚Äù immersion in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}. We randomly re-sample 100 points from it and test our updating scheme on perturbation by normal noise with standard deviation 0.010.010.01. Bunny: The Bunny model comes from the Stanford Computer Graphics Laboratory . We use one of its 3D scan picture with size 40256 points in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3} and (uniform) randomly sample 100 points. Our updating scheme test on perturbation by normal noise with standard deviation 0.010.010.01. Dragon: It is a 3-dimensional scan of a dragon from the Stanford Dragon graphic model  and in  consists of 1000 and 2000 points sampled uniformly at random. We randomly re-sample 400 points from the 1000 points and test our updating scheme on perturbation by normal noise with standard deviation 0.010.010.01. H3N2: The data set from  contains 2722 different genetic sequences of H3N2 influenza, where each sequence is a vector in ‚Ñù1173superscript‚Ñù1173\\mathbb{R}^{1173}. There are many genetic metrics used to measure the difference between two genetic sequences, but we will focus on the Euclidean metric and encourage readers to try on different ones. We randomly sample 200 points and and test our updating scheme on perturbation by normal noise with standard deviation 0.010.010.01. . As suggested in [ref]5, we found the great efficiency of the cohomology clearing algorithm and so only tested the performance of the cohomology update Algorithm¬†5. In Table¬†3, each row represents an algorithm in BATS or in another package and each column records the time spent on recomputing or updating persistent homology on a data set. The first four algorithms are all implemented in BATS. BATS(c,enc) uses clearing, does not form the basis VùëâV and stops the filtration at the enclosing radius. BATS(c,b,enc) uses clearing, forms the basis VùëâV and stops at the enclosing radius. BATS(u,c,enc) updates the R‚ÄãUùëÖùëàRU decomposition from the cohomology clearing algorithm with two filtration both stop at enclosing radius. BATS(u,c,full) updates the R‚ÄãUùëÖùëàRU decomposition with two filtration both stop at infinite radius, where insertion and deletion are not involved in our updating scheme. We make the last two comparisons to see how addition/deletion and permutation will affect the updating performance. The final two rows are GUDHI  and Ripser [ref]5 and both of them use cohomology to compute persistent homology. The results in Table¬†3 show that our updating algorithm Algorithm¬†5 is better than recomputing except for data set Dragon. On Sphere2, our update scheme BATS(u,c,full) demonstrates a noticeable improvement in run time. However, for Dragon, we suspect insertion involved in update is the main bottleneck of its inefficiency, because a new row rùëür in RùëÖR at line 9 Algorithm¬†5 is a product of a row in Dr‚Ä≤subscriptsuperscriptùê∑‚Ä≤ùëüD^{\\prime}_{r} and the matrix VùëâV, which can be a big source of overhead.\nFor the comparisons between other TDA packages, Ripser demonstrates a large performance advantage over other options, but we note it is specifically optimized for Rips Filtrations.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and encourage readers to try on different ones.
