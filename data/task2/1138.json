      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Resolving the Challenge of Long-tail Distribution in UAV Images for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparison with base models.\nWe implement 3 base models: Faster R-CNN (FRCNN) [ref]27, RetinaNet (Retina) [ref]20 and Cascade R-CNN (CRCNN)  according to the same settings of DSHNet. For the backbone network, we choose ResNet50 (R50), ResNet101 (R101)  and ResNeXt101 (X101) 0, and use the default parameters (including the feature pyramid network (FPN) ) in MMdetection . Table 2 reports the overall A​P𝐴𝑃AP and A​P𝐴𝑃APs of all the 10 classes of VisDrone. DSHNet achieves consistent improvements on all the base models. On the most representative two-stage detector, Faster R-CNN, we conduct experiments using 3 different backbone networks, and the performance increases the most on ResNeXt101 (22.4 vs. 25.8). On the state-of-the-art Cascade R-CNN (CRCNN) model, our method also gains a considerable 3.0 overall AP (23.2 vs. 26.2). Moreover, in almost all the cases, AP of each class is improved compared with the counterpart in the base models. This demonstrates that both head and tail classes can benefit from DSHNet. For tail classes in particular, the detection results are improved significantly. For example, our DSHNet boosts the A​P𝐴𝑃APs of tail classes t​r​i​c​y​c​l​e𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒tricycle and b​u​s𝑏𝑢𝑠bus by about 29% (14.8 vs. 19.1) and 23.2% (34.9 vs. 43.0), respectively, based on the CRCNN (R50). We also present a visual comparison of the detection results on VisDrone dataset (Fig. 3). In this example, the detection precision of m​o​t​o​r𝑚𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟motor, one of the tail classes, is obviously improved by DSHNet as compared to the base model. On UAVDT, we conduct experiments based on RetinaNet [ref]20 and Faster R-CNN [ref]27. Similar to the results in VisDrone, DSHNet achieves remarkable improvements over baseline models, and the precision of both head classes and tail classes are largely improved. Specifically, the tail class b​u​s𝑏𝑢𝑠bus is dramatically improved from 3.4 to 14.7 on FRCNN-R50 as shown in Table 3. This clearly validates the effectiveness of our proposed DSHNet. Comparison with existing solutions tackling long-tail problems.\nWe compare our DSHNet with state-of-the-art methods for long-tail visual recognition. In MMF 3 and BGS , tail and head classes are defined according to the same rules as DSHNet (see Sec. 4.2 for detail). In SimCal [ref]28, we choose class-agnostic method which has better performance on overall AP. We assign 2 classes per batch for training in order to keep the sample ratio unchanged (2:10 on VisDrone 5 vs. 16:80 on MS COCO ). We first compare our method with MMF 3, which also addresses the imbalanced class distribution in VisDrone dataset. The main idea of MMF is to divide the 10 classes to 2 sub-categories and train and test the model separately for those two sub-categories.The feature network of each model in MMF only gets a part of all the classes as input, instead of getting the original distributed data like DSHNet, which harms the generalization of representation. Therefore, this method only slightly improves the base model from the results in Table 2 (21.7 vs. 22.6). And the overall AP is 2 points worse than our DSHNet (22.6 vs. 24.6). As discussed in Sec. 2, most existing methods tackling the long-tail problems on natural datasets do not work well on UAV datasets. Here, we choose two recent methods representing the re-sampling and re-weighting strategies, respectively. SimCal [ref]28 is improved from image-level re-sampling which also uses class-aware sampler. However, SimCal [ref]28 needs to sample enough categories and collect similar numbers of different targets to ensure a balanced distribution in a batch. SimCal [ref]28 is not trivially applicable on UAV datasets, and the performance is even inferior to that of the base model (20.0 vs. 21.7). BGS  is the representative re-weighting method which introduces the balanced group softmax to group corresponding classes together when computing loss. BGS is currently the best re-weighting solution to long-tail issue. However, BGS only achieve re-weighting in loss function while does not change the distribution of box head, which proved to effectively improve classifier learning [ref]28 2 4. Therefore, the imbalanced distribution of input cannot be re-balanced as good as DSHNet. Despite its better performance than the base model, BGS is still worse than DSHNet (23.0 vs. 24.6). How DSHNet performs with image patches?\nAs shown in Fig. 1, image cropping methods do not solve the long-tail distribution problem. Since image cropping can be considered as a data pre-processing procedure, our DSHNet can be equally applied to image patches, which could further improve the performance of cropping-based approaches. To evaluate DSHNet on image patches, we employ the state-of-the-art DMNet  to generate cropped patches and train DSHNet on them. The results in Table 2 (last two rows) show that DSHNet also works on image patches and boosts the overall AP by 2.2 points (30.3 vs. 28.1).\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Comparison with base models.\nWe implement 3 base models: Faster R-CNN (FRCNN) [ref]27, RetinaNet (Retina) [ref]20 and Cascade R-CNN (CRCNN)  according to the same settings of DSHNet.
