Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explore User Neighborhood for Real-time E-commerce Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nItem-item relations are usually user-independent, thus restricting the performance of item-based methods.\nTo tackle this problem, UI methods    focus on exploiting user-item relations and provide user-relevant recommendations.\nEarly works of UI methods leverage latent factor methods, such as Matrix Factorization   [ref]37.\nFor example, Paterek [ref]37 projects users and items into a common latent space and then predicts the preference with the user-item inner-product (NSVD).\nKabbur et al.  improve NSVD by excluding diagonal entries to avoid the self-similarity problem (FISM).\nSVD++  captures users’ interests more thoroughly by representing each user with user_id and her/his interactions. Recently, deep learning has been widely applied in recommender systems  [ref]38.\nThese works can be broadly classified into two categories: matching function based methods and representation based methods.\nMatching function based methods learn simple user/item representations and then utilize a complex matching model to capture user/item relations [ref]38 .\nTheir high latency in the matching step is not affordable in the real-world scenario.\nRepresentation based methods focus on utilizing complex models to acquire meaningful user/item vectors, while their matching functions are usually very simple, like, inner-product, which is easy to be applied in real-world applications.\nFor example, Xue et al.  extend MF with neural network to derive meaningful vectors (DeepMF).\nChen et al.  adopt attention  mechanism to extract different weights on users’ historical items and then obtain better user representations.\nMeanwhile, some methods attempt to leverage sequence information in users’ behaviors [ref]23  .\nFor example, Tang and Wang  propose a Convolutional\nSequence Model (Caser) to learn sequential patterns using both\nhorizontal and vertical convolutional filters.\nKang and McAuley [ref]23 model long-term sequential semantics by self-attention mechanism (SASRec), which achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nIn this paper, we focus on the Representation based manner.\nWe adopt the FISM and SASRec as our base model to evaluate the performance of our SCCF framework.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: problem, UI methods    focus on exploiting user-item relations and provide user-relevant recommendations.\nEarly works of UI methods leverage latent factor methods, such as Matrix Factorization   [ref]37.\nFor example, Paterek [ref]37 projects users and items into a common latent space and then predicts the preference with the user-item inner-product (NSVD).\nKabbur et al.  improve NSVD by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
