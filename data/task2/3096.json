However, potential benefits may be obtained through a multitask learning (MTL) setting on related tasks. Early works have shown that MTL is intuitively plausible to obtain inductive bias by including implicit data augmentation, regularization, and representation bias . Common MTL methods with deep learning usually follow different patterns, such as joint learning (parameter sharing) and learning with auxiliary tasks. Parameter sharing usually has two forms: hard sharing and soft sharing. Hard sharing comes with the form of using task-specific output layers while sharing the layers before task-specific layers among all tasks . Soft sharing usually means most of the layers in the neural networks are jointly trained together under the supervision from all tasks [ref]38. In the field of computer vision, significant efforts are put into leveraging MTL or joint learning.\nAn Identity-Aware CycleGAN (IACycleGAN) model that applies a new perceptual loss to supervise the image generation network is introduced for both face photo-sketch synthesis and recognition .\nIt is reasonable to improve the super-resolution performance on both the color and the depth image by incorporate mutual information shared by them together with a GAN-based architectural design [ref]40.\nA 2D/3D multitask system is proposed in [ref]41 where uses the pose estimation part as the primary tasks and jointly leverage the learned features for fine-grained action recognition.\nThe idea of MTL seems to be effectively involved in existing works with an encoder-decoder pattern for different types of computer vision tasks.\nFace alignment in the video is tackled with a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture in , where the proposed framework predicts 2D facial keypoint maps and also a constrained shape response map. In , the authors proposed a multi-purpose framework for image-to-video translation, and a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture is used for face alignment as well as generating future motion masks. These works also motivate us to explore the possibility of applying this pattern for 3D human pose estimation though they are not performing the 3D human pose estimation task itself. In particular, MTL also motivates the literature of pose estimation. A pose grammar mechanism that encodes kinematics, symmetry, and motor coordination, is proposed to tackle the problem of 3D human pose estimation . Jointly learning a head pose estimation network by leveraging a coarse-to-fine network is efficient and the synthetic data is involved in training . Body part segmentation can also provide extra information for accurately estimated the pose consider that joints should not be predicted outside the body part and particular joints can only be located in specific body parts .\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: the layers before task-specific layers among all tasks . Soft sharing usually means most of the layers in the neural networks are jointly trained together under the supervision from all tasks [ref]38.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
