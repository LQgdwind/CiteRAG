The authors of -[ref]7 consider the 3D placement of UAV(s) to maximize the coverage area. In , the authors propose a probabilistic LoS-non-LoS (NLoS) air to ground channel model and use it to find the optimal hovering altitude of a stationary UAV that maximizes the coverage area.  and  find the optimal altitude that maximizes the coverage area of a multi- and single-UAV system using circle packing theory.  uses a combination of exhaustive search and maximal weighted area algorithm to propose an optimal UAV placement method that maximizes the number of users covered, whereas [ref]7 considers the placement optimization of a dynamic standalone drone equipped with a steerable antenna. The work in  proposes a power-efficient deployment of multiple UAVs which are used as aerial base stations to collect data from ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices, whereas  and  consider minimizing the total transmit power of a drone base station by considering a downlink communication scenario. The authors of -[ref]15 consider the average throughput of a UAV-based aerial communication system as the performance metric.  and  maximize the minimum average throughput by considering an uplink communication between a set of GNs and a UAV, whereas , , [ref]15, and  consider a downlink communication scenario. In -, the authors consider the aerial vehicle’s energy consumption while proposing an energy-efficient UAV(s) deployment policy. In , the authors propose a tractable power consumption model for a single-rotor rotary-wing UAV and use it to design a 2D trajectory that consumes the least amount of energy. In , we extend the model to a multi-rotor UAV and propose a 2D trajectory for a PAP that maximizes the number of bits transmitted per Joule of energy consumed while following a fly-hover-communicate protocol to serve the users. The algorithm given in  designs an energy-efficient 2D trajectory for a fixed-wing UAV, while in , we determine a set of energy-efficient hovering points using circle packing theory. The works - use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to design a UAV(s) placement policy that guarantees fair service to the users.  uses the UAV trajectory as a tool to achieve fairness in terms of learning staleness, which reflects the learning time discrepancy among the users. The proposed policies of  and  achieve fairness in terms of coverage and throughput, respectively.
