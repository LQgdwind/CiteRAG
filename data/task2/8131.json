      "content": "Paper Title: Undecidability and incompleteness in quantum information theory and operator algebras\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTwo of G√∂del‚Äôs most famous results are his Completeness theorem for first-order logic and his Incompleteness theorem for first-order arithmetic. In this article, we survey how a version of the Completeness theorem for continuous logic has recently been used, together with a major undecidability result in quantum information theory, to prove a number of incompleteness results in operator algebras. (Some basic definitions and facts about operator algebras can be found in Section 3.) The main incompleteness result is connected to aguably one of the most famous open problems in operator algebras, namely the Connes embedding problem (CEP), which first arose in Connes‚Äô landmark 1976 paper , where he wrote the following: We now construct an approximate imbedding of NùëÅN in ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}. Apparently such an imbedding ought to exist for all II1 factors because it does for the regular representation of free groups. However, the construction below relies on condition 6. Here, ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R} is a particularly important von Neumann algebra known as the hyperfinite II1 factor. In the paper, Connes shows how to ‚Äúapproximately embed‚Äù some particular tracial von Neumann algebra NùëÅN into ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}, which he later shows means that he can embed NùëÅN into an ultrapower of ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}. He then comments that, although his proof relies on a particular condition satisfied by the algebra NùëÅN, this embedding out to exist regardless of this extra assumption, the reason being that the embedding exists for another particularly important algebra, namely the group von Neumann algebra corresponding to the free group. The relative uncertainty as to the strength of his conviction (given the use of the words ‚Äúought to‚Äù) combined with the fairly weak justification regarding the free group factor, has led many to call this statement a problem rather than a conjecture. The CEP was later shown to have (surpring) connections to a number of disparate areas of mathematics, including C‚àósuperscriptC\\mathrm{C}^{*}-algebra theory, free probability, logic, and quantum information theory to name a few. It was the latter connection that ultimately led to its refutation in 2020, when a result in quantum complexity theory known as MIP‚àó=REsuperscriptMIPRE\\operatorname{MIP}^{*}=\\operatorname{RE}  was announced. Roughly speaking, MIP‚àó=REsuperscriptMIPRE\\operatorname{MIP}^{*}=\\operatorname{RE} implies that the sets of probability distributions arising from measuring entangled quantum states are incredibly complicated (from the point of view of computability theory); a detailed discussion of the result, together with the necessary background material on quantum correlations, can be found in Section 2 of the paper. The connection between logic and the CEP is rather straightforward: in the language appropriate for studying tracial von Neumann algebras, the CEP states that every tracial von Neumann algebra is a model of the universal theory of ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}. The path from MIP‚àó=REsuperscriptMIPRE\\operatorname{MIP}^{*}=\\operatorname{RE} to the refutation of the CEP is highly nontrivial and involves several deep results. That being said, it was shown by the author and Hart in  and [ref]27 that by using a version of G√∂del‚Äôs Completeness theorem for continuous logic together with certain operator algebraic interpretations of the aforementioned correlation sets, one can give a refutation of CEP from MIP‚àó=REsuperscriptMIPRE\\operatorname{MIP}^{*}=\\operatorname{RE} that avoids these intermediate results. Moreover, just as G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness theorem for arithmetic shows that no satisfiable c.e. subset of true arithmetic can axiomatize true arithmetic, the model-theoretic approach mentioened above yields an Incompleteness theorem for the universal theory of ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}: there is no satisfiable c.e. subtheory of the universal (or even full) theory of ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R} that axiomatizes the universal theory of ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}. In [ref]27, we deemed this result a G√∂delian refutation of the CEP. Besides being interesting from the logical perspective, this G√∂delian refutation of the CEP had a number of interesting purely operator algebraic consequences, as was outlined in [ref]27. This G√∂delian refutation of the CEP is described in Section 4 of the paper. The G√∂delian refutation of the CEP led also to a number of other undecidability/incompleteness results in operator algebras   which we survey in Sections 4 and 5 of the paper. Only a couple of months before the writing of this article, the ideas around MIP‚àó=REsuperscriptMIPRE\\operatorname{MIP}^{*}=\\operatorname{RE} were used to refute a prominent conjecture in probability theory known as the Aldous-Lyons conjecture. Although this resolution does not involve model theory per se111At least for the moment‚Ä¶, we could not resist including a brief discussion of this conjecture and its resolution in Section 6. A number of open questions related to the themes of the paper are collected in Section 7. It is well-known that G√∂del became great friends with Einstein during the latter part of their careers while at the Institute for Advanced Study; G√∂del was very interested in physics and even dabbled in general relativity, constructing a pathological solution to Einstein‚Äôs equations that contained closed timelike loops. (See 0 for an interesting popular account of both this friendship and solution to Einstein‚Äôs equations.) We can only speculate that, around 70 years after his original Completeness and Incompleteness Theorems were published, G√∂del would have been thrilled to see his ideas being pursued in these areas of mathematics and computation so closely tied to physics. Throughout this article, we assume familiarity with basic continuous logic. The reader unfamiliar with continuous logic is encouraged to refer to Hart‚Äôs article , which is written with an eye towards applications to operator algebras. The reader interested in learning more about the CEP and its connections with logic, quantum information theory, and C‚àósuperscriptC\\mathrm{C}^{*}-algebras can consult the author‚Äôs (fairly comprehensive) survey . One bit of notation that we employ throughout the paper: given a positive integer nùëõn, we set [n]:={1,‚Ä¶,n}assigndelimited-[]ùëõ1‚Ä¶ùëõ[n]:=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}.
