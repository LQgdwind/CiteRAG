This work is done when N. Akar is on sabbatical leave as a visiting professor at University of Maryland, MD, USA, which is supported in part by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye (Tübitak) 2219-International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAoI metric was first proposed in a single-source, single-server queuing scenario [ref]5. A survey of existing research on AoI and its applications can be found in   . Several AoI stochastic analysis methods have been developed in the literature. For random arrivals (RA), where status updates take place according to a random process, e.g., such as the Poisson process, the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) approach of  is generally used in the literature for obtaining the mean AoI, whereas SHS can also be used to obtain the moment generating function (MGF) and also the higher moments of AoI in certain scenarios  . On the other hand, for multi-source GAW systems (and also for a special multi-source RA system with one single packet buffer), an alternative absorbing Markov chain (AMC) based method is proposed to find the distribution of AoI in [ref]33, which requires a-priori information about the service time distributions. The current paper is different than [ref]33, since we only focus on the average AoI in this paper (as opposed to its distribution), which only depends on the first two moments of the per-source service times (and not on their distributions), and also on the packet error probabilities. Age-aware scheduling for AoI minimization has extensively been studied in the literature. Maximum age first (MAF) policy   , where the source with the highest instantaneous age is scheduled, and maximum-age-difference drop (MAD) policy , where the source which would result in the maximum drop in age is scheduled, have been proposed in the literature for homogeneous multi-source settings. For heterogeneous scenarios, max-weight and Whittle-index policies    have been proposed that are shown to perform very well despite the lack of proof of optimality in general scenarios. Timeliness of communication in federated learning (FL), which was addressed in , is another domain where age-aware scheduling policies have been utilized. Further,  proposes an age-aware scheduling policy for FL which also takes into account the instantaneous channel qualities. Age-aware scheduling policies require the scheduler to continuously track the age of the sources, and therefore, can introduce a significant communication overhead, especially in channels susceptible to packet drops. Moreover, in open-loop communication systems where feedback on packet drops is absent, age-aware scheduling may not even be feasible. Therefore, age-agnostic cyclic scheduling has recently appeared as a low cost open-loop solution compared to age-aware scheduling 0 1  [ref]29. A framework called Eywa was recently introduced in , where the goal is to construct almost uniform cyclic schedulers (AUS), which is a special class of cyclic schedulers designed to distribute the scheduling instances of a given source as uniformly as possible within the cycle. Eywa works in a discrete time setting and assumes that all sources have the same deterministic service times with heterogeneous packet errors. However, in real systems, service time requirements may be different across the sources, for which case reference [ref]29 obtains the optimal cyclic scheduler that minimizes the weighted AoI for two heterogeneous sources, and also develops a heuristic scheduler for the case of several sources, but in the absence of packet errors. The focus of our current paper is on age-agnostic scheduling in a massive connectivity setting, and also in the presence of packet errors.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: AoI metric was first proposed in a single-source, single-server queuing scenario [ref]5.
