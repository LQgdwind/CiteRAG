In other words, a k𝑘k-matching in G𝐺G is a set of k𝑘k pairwise non-incident edges of G𝐺G. Given a class of graphs 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, the problem #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}) asks, on input k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} and a graph G∈𝒢𝐺𝒢G\\in\\mathcal{G}, to compute the number of k𝑘k-matchings in G𝐺G; the parameter is k𝑘k. We remark that #​Match​(𝒢)=#​Sub​(ℳ→𝒢)#Match𝒢#Sub→ℳ𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G})=\\#\\textsc{Sub}(\\mathcal{M}\\to\\mathcal{G}) where ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} is the set of all 111-regular graphs. The goal of this section is to prove that #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}) is hard whenever 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is monotone and somewhere dense, i.e., the hardness part of Theorem 2. Before moving on, let us pin down some definitions and basic facts. Our analysis relies on the following “coloured” version of the graph tensor product, as in : Let H𝐻H be a graph, and let (G1,c1)subscript𝐺1subscript𝑐1(G_{1},c_{1}) and (G2,c2)subscript𝐺2subscript𝑐2(G_{2},c_{2}) be H𝐻H-coloured graphs. The tensor product (G1,c1)×(G2,c2)subscript𝐺1subscript𝑐1subscript𝐺2subscript𝑐2(G_{1},c_{1})\\times(G_{2},c_{2}) is the H𝐻H-coloured graph (G^,c^)^𝐺^𝑐(\\hat{G},\\hat{c}) defined by: V​(G^)={(v1,v2)∈V​(G1)×V​(G2)|c1​(v1)=c2​(v2)}𝑉^𝐺conditional-setsubscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2𝑉subscript𝐺1𝑉subscript𝐺2subscript𝑐1subscript𝑣1subscript𝑐2subscript𝑣2V(\\hat{G})=\\{(v_{1},v_{2})\\in V(G_{1})\\times V(G_{2})~{}|~{}c_{1}(v_{1})=c_{2}(v_{2})\\}. {(u1,u2),(v1,v2)}∈E​(G^)subscript𝑢1subscript𝑢2subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2𝐸^𝐺\\{(u_{1},u_{2}),(v_{1},v_{2})\\}\\in E(\\hat{G}) if and only if {u1,v1}∈E​(G1)subscript𝑢1subscript𝑣1𝐸subscript𝐺1\\{u_{1},v_{1}\\}\\in E(G_{1}) and {u2,v2}∈E​(G2)subscript𝑢2subscript𝑣2𝐸subscript𝐺2\\{u_{2},v_{2}\\}\\in E(G_{2}). c^​(v1,v2)=c1​(v1)^𝑐subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑐1subscript𝑣1\\hat{c}(v_{1},v_{2})=c_{1}(v_{1}) (equivalently by (T1), c^​(v1,v2)=c2​(v2)^𝑐subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑐2subscript𝑣2\\hat{c}(v_{1},v_{2})=c_{2}(v_{2})) for all (v1,v2)∈V​(G^)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2𝑉^𝐺(v_{1},v_{2})\\in V(\\hat{G}). The crucial property of the tensor product is given by:141414Proofs of Lemma 32 and Lemma 33 can also be found in Section 3.1 in an earlier version  of . If H𝐻H is a graph and (F,cF)𝐹subscript𝑐𝐹(F,c_{F}), (G1,c1)subscript𝐺1subscript𝑐1(G_{1},c_{1}), (G2,c2)subscript𝐺2subscript𝑐2(G_{2},c_{2}) are H𝐻H-coloured graphs, then The final ingredient we need is the non-singularity of a certain matrix whose entries count homomorphisms between fractured graphs. Formally, let H𝐻H be a graph. The square matrix MHsubscript𝑀𝐻M_{H} has its rows and columns indexed by the fractures of H𝐻H, and its entries satisfy: where cρsubscript𝑐𝜌c_{\\rho} and cσsubscript𝑐𝜎c_{\\sigma} are the canonical H𝐻H-colourings of the fractured graphs H​♯​ρ𝐻♯𝜌H\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\rho and H​♯​σ𝐻♯𝜎H\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\sigma (see Definition 8 and Observation 9). By ordering the columns and rows of MHsubscript𝑀𝐻M_{H} along a certain lattice, the following property was established in previous work.151515See Footnote 14. For each graph H𝐻H, the matrix MHsubscript𝑀𝐻M_{H} is nonsingular. If 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is closed under uncoloured tensor products161616The adjacency matrix of the tensor product of two uncoloured graphs G𝐺G and F𝐹F is the Kronecker product of the adjacency matrices of G𝐺G and F𝐹F., then the hardness result can be achieved by applying the reduction of 7 verbatim. However, that reduction fails if 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is not closed under uncoloured tensor products, and this closure property is very restrictive. Consider for example the class 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} of square-free graphs, i.e., graphs that do not contain the 444-cycle C4subscript𝐶4C_{4} as a subgraph. Then 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is clearly monotone and, since it contains the 333-subdivision of every graph, it is also somewhere dense by Lemma 16. However, 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is not closed under (uncoloured) tensor products: the path on 222 edges P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} is in 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, but P2×P2∉𝒢subscript𝑃2subscript𝑃2𝒢P_{2}\\times P_{2}\\notin\\mathcal{G} since it contains a C4subscript𝐶4C_{4}. The main insight of this section is a weakened closure property for monotone and somewhere dense graph classes, established in the lemma below. Combined with the characterisation of somewhere dense graph classes via r𝑟r-subdivisions (Lemma 16), this property implies that any monotone and somewhere dense class is closed under tensor products of subdivisions of coloured graphs. Let r∈ℕ0𝑟subscriptℕ0r\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0}, let H𝐻H be a graph without isolated vertices, and let (G,c)𝐺𝑐(G,c) be an H𝐻H-coloured graph on n𝑛n vertices, and let ρ𝜌\\rho be a fracture of Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}. Then\n(Gr,cr)×(Hr​♯​ρ,cρ)superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜌subscript𝑐𝜌(G^{r},c^{r})\\times(H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\rho,c_{\\rho})\nis a subgraph of the r𝑟r-subdivision of a complete graph of order O​(k​n)𝑂𝑘𝑛O(kn), where k=|E​(H)|𝑘𝐸𝐻k=|E(H)| and the constants in the O​()𝑂O() notation depend only on r𝑟r. Let T=(Gr,cr)×(Hr​♯​ρ,cρ)𝑇superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜌subscript𝑐𝜌T=(G^{r},c^{r})\\times(H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\rho,c_{\\rho});\nsee Figure 3 for an example. The claim follows from Claims 1, 2, and 3 below, with Claim 3 applied to F=T𝐹𝑇F=T. Claim 1. |V​(T)|=O​(k​n)𝑉𝑇𝑂𝑘𝑛|V(T)|=O(kn). Straightforward since Grsuperscript𝐺𝑟G^{r} is a subgraph of Knrsuperscriptsubscript𝐾𝑛𝑟K_{n}^{r}. Claim 2: if x𝑥x and y𝑦y are distinct vertices of T𝑇T of degree at least 333, then the length of any simple path from x𝑥x to y𝑦y is a multiple of r+1𝑟1r+1. To prove this, recall that T𝑇T is Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}-coloured by c^^𝑐\\hat{c} from Definition 31, and that V​(Hr)𝑉superscript𝐻𝑟V(H^{r}) can be partitioned into V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H) and a set S𝑆S of k​r𝑘𝑟kr fresh subdivision vertices. Let (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) be a vertex of T𝑇T such that c^​(u,v)=s∉V​(H)^𝑐𝑢𝑣𝑠𝑉𝐻\\hat{c}(u,v)=s\\notin V(H), that is, (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is coloured with a subdivision vertex s𝑠s. We show that (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) has degree at most 222 in T𝑇T. Let s1subscript𝑠1s_{1} and s2subscript𝑠2s_{2} be the two neighbours of s𝑠s in Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}. By the construction of (Gr,cr)superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟(G^{r},c^{r}), u𝑢u has exactly two neighbours in Grsuperscript𝐺𝑟G^{r}, say u1subscript𝑢1u_{1} and u2subscript𝑢2u_{2}. Furthermore, cr​(u1)=s1superscript𝑐𝑟subscript𝑢1subscript𝑠1c^{r}(u_{1})=s_{1} and cr​(u2)=s2superscript𝑐𝑟subscript𝑢2subscript𝑠2c^{r}(u_{2})=s_{2}. Since s𝑠s has degree 222 in Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}, there are only two cases for ρssubscript𝜌𝑠\\rho_{s}. Case 1: ρs={B}subscript𝜌𝑠𝐵\\rho_{s}=\\{B\\} where B={{s,s1},{s,s2}}𝐵𝑠subscript𝑠1𝑠subscript𝑠2B=\\{\\{s,s_{1}\\},\\{s,s_{2}\\}\\}. In this case sBsuperscript𝑠𝐵s^{B} is the only vertex of H​♯​ρ𝐻♯𝜌H\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\rho that is coloured by cρsubscript𝑐𝜌c_{\\rho} with s𝑠s. Since c^​(u,v)=s^𝑐𝑢𝑣𝑠\\hat{c}(u,v)=s implies cρ​(v)=ssubscript𝑐𝜌𝑣𝑠c_{\\rho}(v)=s, we conclude that v=sB𝑣superscript𝑠𝐵v=s^{B}. Hence (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) has exactly two neighbours in T𝑇T, (u1,s1B1)subscript𝑢1superscriptsubscript𝑠1subscript𝐵1(u_{1},s_{1}^{B_{1}}) and (u2,s2B2)subscript𝑢2superscriptsubscript𝑠2subscript𝐵2(u_{2},s_{2}^{B_{2}}), where B1subscript𝐵1B_{1} and B2subscript𝐵2B_{2} are the blocks of ρs1subscript𝜌subscript𝑠1\\rho_{s_{1}} and ρs2subscript𝜌subscript𝑠2\\rho_{s_{2}} containing respectively {s,s1}𝑠subscript𝑠1\\{s,s_{1}\\} and {s,s2}𝑠subscript𝑠2\\{s,s_{2}\\}. Case 2: ρs={B,B′}subscript𝜌𝑠𝐵superscript𝐵′\\rho_{s}=\\{B,B^{\\prime}\\} where B={{s,s1}}𝐵𝑠subscript𝑠1B=\\{\\{s,s_{1}\\}\\} and B′={{s,s2}}superscript𝐵′𝑠subscript𝑠2B^{\\prime}=\\{\\{s,s_{2}\\}\\}.\nIn this case sBsuperscript𝑠𝐵s^{B} and sB′superscript𝑠superscript𝐵′s^{B^{\\prime}} are the only two vertices of H​♯​ρ𝐻♯𝜌H\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\rho that are coloured by cρsubscript𝑐𝜌c_{\\rho} with s𝑠s. Since c^​(u,v)=s^𝑐𝑢𝑣𝑠\\hat{c}(u,v)=s implies cρ​(v)=ssubscript𝑐𝜌𝑣𝑠c_{\\rho}(v)=s, we conclude that v∈{sB,sB′}𝑣superscript𝑠𝐵superscript𝑠superscript𝐵′v\\in\\{s^{B},s^{B^{\\prime}}\\}. Assume that v=SB𝑣superscript𝑆𝐵v=S^{B}; the other case is symmetric. Then the only neighbour of (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) in T𝑇T is (u1,s1B1)subscript𝑢1superscriptsubscript𝑠1subscript𝐵1(u_{1},s_{1}^{B_{1}}), where B1subscript𝐵1B_{1} is the block of ρs1subscript𝜌subscript𝑠1\\rho_{s_{1}} that contains the edge {s,s1}𝑠subscript𝑠1\\{s,s_{1}\\}. We conclude that the only vertices (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) of degree at least 333 in T𝑇T satisfy c^​(u,v)∈V​(H)^𝑐𝑢𝑣𝑉𝐻\\hat{c}(u,v)\\in V(H), implying that cr​(u)∈V​(H)superscript𝑐𝑟𝑢𝑉𝐻c^{r}(u)\\in V(H) and thus, by the definition of crsuperscript𝑐𝑟c^{r}, that u∈V​(G)𝑢𝑉𝐺u\\in V(G), hence u𝑢u is not a subdivision vertex.\nThe claim follows since the length of every simple path between two non-subdivision vertices u1subscript𝑢1u_{1} and u2subscript𝑢2u_{2} in Grsuperscript𝐺𝑟G^{r} is a multiple of (r+1)𝑟1(r+1), and since T𝑇T can be obtained from (Gr,cr)superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟(G^{r},c^{r}) by splitting vertices. Claim 3: if F𝐹F is a graph where the length of any simple path between two vertices of degree at least 333 is a multiple of (r+1)𝑟1(r+1), then F𝐹F is a subgraph of the r𝑟r-subdivision of a complete graph of order O​(|V​(F)|)𝑂𝑉𝐹O(|V(F)|). Note first that we can deal with each connected component of F𝐹F separately. Furthermore, the claim is clearly true if F𝐹F is just a path (of any length). For what follows we can hence assume that F𝐹F is connected and not isomorphic to a path.\nWe say that a path P𝑃P in F𝐹F is extendable if its internal vertices have degree 222, one endpoint sPsubscript𝑠𝑃s_{P}\n(the “startpoint”) has degree 111, and the other endpoint has degree at least 333.\nIf P𝑃P has length ℓPsubscriptℓ𝑃\\ell_{P},\nthen its extension length is the smallest ℓP′∈ℕ0subscriptsuperscriptℓ′𝑃subscriptℕ0\\ell^{\\prime}_{P}\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0} such that ℓP+ℓP′subscriptℓ𝑃subscriptsuperscriptℓ′𝑃\\ell_{P}+\\ell^{\\prime}_{P} is a multiple of r+1𝑟1r+1.\nLet F′superscript𝐹′F^{\\prime} be the graph formed from F𝐹F by considering\nevery extendable path P𝑃P and adding a new length-ℓP′subscriptsuperscriptℓ′𝑃\\ell^{\\prime}_{P} path from sPsubscript𝑠𝑃s_{P} (adding ℓP′subscriptsuperscriptℓ′𝑃\\ell^{\\prime}_{P} fresh vertices to make up this path). Observe that, for every pair of non-isolated vertices u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime} and v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} of F′superscript𝐹′F^{\\prime}, if both u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime} and v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} have degree not equal to 222, then the length of every simple path from u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime} to v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} in F′superscript𝐹′F^{\\prime} is a multiple of (r+1)𝑟1(r+1).\nTherefore F′superscript𝐹′F^{\\prime} is a subgraph of the r𝑟r-subdivision of a complete graph of order at most O​(|V​(F′)|)=O​(|V​(F)|)𝑂𝑉superscript𝐹′𝑂𝑉𝐹O(|V(F^{\\prime})|)=O(|V(F)|), where the constants depend only on r𝑟r. Moreover F𝐹F is by construction a subgraph of F′superscript𝐹′F^{\\prime}, which this concludes the proof of the claim.\n∎ To establish the hardness of #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}), we first consider an edge-coloured version. Let G𝐺G be a graph and k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}. A k𝑘k-coloring of E​(G)𝐸𝐺E(G) is a map c:E​(G)→{1,…,k}:𝑐→𝐸𝐺1…𝑘c:E(G)\\to\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}. A matching M⊆E​(G)𝑀𝐸𝐺M\\subseteq E(G) is edge-colorful under if for every colour in {1,…,k}1…𝑘\\{1,\\ldots,k\\} there is precisely one element of M𝑀M with that colour. Let 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} be a class of graphs. The problem #​ColMatch​(𝒢)#ColMatch𝒢\\#\\textsc{ColMatch}(\\mathcal{G}) asks, on input k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, a graph G∈𝒢𝐺𝒢G\\in\\mathcal{G}, and a k𝑘k-coloring c𝑐c of E​(G)𝐸𝐺E(G), to compute the number of edge-colorful k𝑘k-matchings in G𝐺G. The problem is parameterised by k𝑘k. Let 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} be a monotone somewhere dense class of graphs. Then #​ColMatch​(𝒢)#ColMatch𝒢\\#\\textsc{ColMatch}(\\mathcal{G}) is #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}-hard and, assuming ETH, cannot be solved in time f​(k)⋅|G|o​(k/log⁡k)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝐺𝑜𝑘𝑘f(k)\\cdot|G|^{o(k/\\log k)} for any function f𝑓f. Let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a class of 333-regular expander graphs. Both the treewidth and the number of edges of the elements of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} grow linearly in the number of vertices; that is, |E​(H)|∈Θ​(|V​(H)|)𝐸𝐻Θ𝑉𝐻|E(H)|\\in\\Theta(|V(H)|) and 𝗍𝗐​(H)∈Θ​(|V​(H)|)𝗍𝗐𝐻Θ𝑉𝐻\\mathsf{tw}(H)\\in\\Theta(|V(H)|) for all H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} (see, e.g., [ref]36). Hence theorems 21 and 23 imply that #​cp-Hom​(ℋ→𝒰)#cp-Hom→ℋ𝒰\\#\\text{\\sc{cp-Hom}}(\\mathcal{H}\\to{\\mathcal{U}}) is #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}-hard and, assuming ETH, cannot be solved in time f​(|H|)⋅|G|o​(|H|/log⁡|H|)⋅𝑓𝐻superscript𝐺𝑜𝐻𝐻f(|H|)\\cdot|G|^{o(|H|/\\log|H|)} for any function f𝑓f. We will now show that #​cp-Hom​(ℋ→𝒰)≤𝖥𝖯𝖳#​ColMatch​(𝒢)superscript𝖥𝖯𝖳#cp-Hom→ℋ𝒰#ColMatch𝒢\\#\\text{\\sc{cp-Hom}}(\\mathcal{H}\\to{\\mathcal{U}})\\leq^{\\mathsf{FPT}}\\#\\textsc{ColMatch}(\\mathcal{G}). Let H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} and (G,c)𝐺𝑐(G,c) be the input of #​cp-Hom​(ℋ→𝒰)#cp-Hom→ℋ𝒰\\#\\text{\\sc{cp-Hom}}(\\mathcal{H}\\to{\\mathcal{U}}). By Lemma 16, there is r∈ℕ0𝑟subscriptℕ0r\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0} such that Gr∈𝒢superscript𝐺𝑟𝒢G^{r}\\in\\mathcal{G} for all G∈𝒰𝐺𝒰G\\in{\\mathcal{U}}. Construct then Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r} and (Gr,cr)superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟(G^{r},c^{r}), which clearly takes polynomial time. Let k=|E​(Hr)|𝑘𝐸superscript𝐻𝑟k=|E(H^{r})|; clearly k∈O​(|H|)𝑘𝑂𝐻k\\in O(|H|) where the constants depend only on r𝑟r. Now, by Lemma 24, Next, we view surjectively Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}-coloured graphs (G~,c~)~𝐺~𝑐(\\tilde{G},\\tilde{c}) also as edge-coloured graphs where every edge e={u,v}𝑒𝑢𝑣e=\\{u,v\\} is mapped to the colour {c~​(u),c~​(v)}~𝑐𝑢~𝑐𝑣\\{\\tilde{c}(u),\\tilde{c}(v)\\}. This allows us to invoke the results of  and deduce what follows.171717In , the number of edge-colourful k𝑘k-matchings of G𝐺G is denoted by #​𝖢𝗈𝗅𝖤𝖽𝗀𝖾𝖲𝗎𝖻​(Φ,k→G)#𝖢𝗈𝗅𝖤𝖽𝗀𝖾𝖲𝗎𝖻→Φ𝑘𝐺\\#\\mbox{$\\mathsf{ColEdgeSub}(\\Phi,k\\to G)$}, where ΦΦ\\Phi is the graph property of being a matching. The identities (6) and (7) are immediate consequences of Lemma 4.1 and Corollary 4.3 in  (see also Lemma 3.1 and Corollary 3.3 in an earlier version  of ). First, there is a unique function a𝑎a from fractures of Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r} to rationals such that, for every surjectively Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}-coloured graph (G~,c~)~𝐺~𝑐(\\tilde{G},\\tilde{c}), the number of edge-colourful k𝑘k-matchings of (G~,c~)~𝐺~𝑐(\\tilde{G},\\tilde{c}) is: where the sum is over all fractures of Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}. Additionally, a𝑎a satisfies: where ⊤top\\top is the coarsest fracture, that is, for each v∈V​(Hr)𝑣𝑉superscript𝐻𝑟v\\in V(H^{r}) the partition ⊤vsubscripttop𝑣\\top_{v} only contains a singleton block (and therefore Hr​♯⊤=Hrlimit-fromsuperscript𝐻𝑟♯topsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\top=H^{r}). In particular, it is easy to see that Now let σ𝜎\\sigma be a fracture of Hrsuperscript𝐻𝑟H^{r}. Considering (6) with (G~,c~)=(Gr,cr)×(Hr​♯​σ,cσ)~𝐺~𝑐superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜎subscript𝑐𝜎(\\tilde{G},\\tilde{c})=(G^{r},c^{r})\\times(H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\sigma,c_{\\sigma}) and applying Lemma 32, the number of colorful k𝑘k-matchings in (Gr,cr)×(Hr​♯​σ,cσ)superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜎subscript𝑐𝜎(G^{r},c^{r})\\times(H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\sigma,c_{\\sigma}) equals: By Lemma 34, (Gr,cr)×(Hr​♯​σ,cσ)superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜎subscript𝑐𝜎(G^{r},c^{r})\\times(H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\sigma,c_{\\sigma}) is a subgraph of the r𝑟r-subdivision of a complete graph, which is in 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} by our choice of r𝑟r. Since 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is monotone this implies (Gr,cr)×(Hr​♯​σ,cσ)∈𝒢superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜎subscript𝑐𝜎𝒢(G^{r},c^{r})\\times(H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\sigma,c_{\\sigma})\\in\\mathcal{G}, too. Hence, if we have an oracle for #​ColMatch​(𝒢)#ColMatch𝒢\\#\\textsc{ColMatch}(\\mathcal{G}), then we can compute the value of (8), while #​𝖧𝗈𝗆​((Hr​♯​ρ,cρ)→(Hr​♯​σ,cσ))#𝖧𝗈𝗆→superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜌subscript𝑐𝜌superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜎subscript𝑐𝜎\\#\\mathsf{Hom}((H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\rho,c_{\\rho})\\to(H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\sigma,c_{\\sigma})) can obviously be computed in a time that is a function of |H|𝐻|H| and r𝑟r.\nThus, by letting 𝖼𝗈𝖾𝖿𝖿​(ρ):=a​(ρ)⋅#​𝖧𝗈𝗆​((Hr​♯​ρ,cρ)→(Gr,cr))assign𝖼𝗈𝖾𝖿𝖿𝜌⋅𝑎𝜌#𝖧𝗈𝗆→superscript𝐻𝑟♯𝜌subscript𝑐𝜌superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟\\mathsf{coeff}(\\rho):=a(\\rho)\\cdot\\#\\mathsf{Hom}((H^{r}\\raisebox{0.86108pt}{\\rotatebox[origin={c}]{-15.0}{$\\sharp$}}\\rho,c_{\\rho})\\to(G^{r},c^{r})), in FPT time we obtain a system of linear equations with unknowns 𝖼𝗈𝖾𝖿𝖿​(ρ)𝖼𝗈𝖾𝖿𝖿𝜌\\mathsf{coeff}(\\rho) and whose matrix is MHrsubscript𝑀superscript𝐻𝑟M_{H^{r}}, see (5). By Lemma 33 MHrsubscript𝑀superscript𝐻𝑟M_{H^{r}} is nonsingular, hence by solving the system we can retrieve: Since a​(⊤)≠0𝑎top0a(\\top)\\neq 0, we can divide by a​(⊤)𝑎topa(\\top) and recover #​𝖧𝗈𝗆​((Hr,𝗂𝖽Hr)→(Gr,cr))#𝖧𝗈𝗆→superscript𝐻𝑟subscript𝗂𝖽superscript𝐻𝑟superscript𝐺𝑟superscript𝑐𝑟\\#\\mathsf{Hom}((H^{r},\\mathsf{id}_{H^{r}})\\to(G^{r},c^{r})) as desired. This concludes the parameterized reduction to #​ColMatch​(𝒢)#ColMatch𝒢\\#\\textsc{ColMatch}(\\mathcal{G}) and proves the thesis.\n∎ With the hardness results for #​ColMatch​(𝒢)#ColMatch𝒢\\#\\textsc{ColMatch}(\\mathcal{G}) above, we can finally obtain our complexity dichotomy for #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}). First, we prove: Let 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} be a monotone somewhere dense class of graphs. Then #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}) is #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}-hard and, assuming ETH, cannot be solved in time f​(k)⋅|G|o​(k/log⁡k)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝐺𝑜𝑘𝑘f(k)\\cdot|G|^{o(k/\\log k)} for any function f𝑓f. A well-known application of inclusion-exclusion (see, e.g., [15, Lemma 1.34]) yields a parameterized reduction from #​ColMatch​(𝒢)#ColMatch𝒢\\#\\textsc{ColMatch}(\\mathcal{G}) to #​Match​(𝒢′)#Matchsuperscript𝒢′\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}) that preserves the parameter, where 𝒢′superscript𝒢′\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} is the class of all subgraphs of 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. By monotonicity 𝒢′=𝒢superscript𝒢′𝒢\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{G}, so the claim of Lemma 36 holds for #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}), too.\n∎ Finally, we obtain: Let 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} be a monotone class of graphs and assume that ETH holds. Then #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is nowhere dense. In particular, if 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is nowhere dense then #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}) can be solved in time f​(k)⋅|V​(G)|1+o​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑉𝐺1𝑜1f(k)\\cdot|V(G)|^{1+o(1)} for some computable function f𝑓f; otherwise #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}) cannot be solved in time f​(k)⋅|G|o​(k/log⁡k)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝐺𝑜𝑘𝑘f(k)\\cdot|G|^{o(k/\\log k)} for any function f𝑓f. Immediate from Theorem 18 and Theorem 37.\n∎ Unless #​P=P#PP\\#\\mathrm{P}=\\mathrm{P}, Corollary 38 / Theorem 2 cannot be strengthened to achieve polynomial time tractability of #​Match​(𝒢)#Match𝒢\\#\\textsc{Match}(\\mathcal{G}) for nowhere dense and monotone 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. Let indeed 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} be the class of all K8subscript𝐾8K_{8}-minor-free graphs. Then 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is clearly monotone, and since it does not contain the subdivisions of cliques larger than 777, it is also nowhere dense by Lemma 16. However, as shown recently by Curticapean and Xia , counting perfect matchings (i.e., k𝑘k-matchings with k=n/2𝑘𝑛2k=n/2) in K8subscript𝐾8K_{8}-minor-free graphs is #​P#P\\#\\mathrm{P}-hard.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: grow linearly in the number of vertices; that is, |E​(H)|∈Θ​(|V​(H)|)𝐸𝐻Θ𝑉𝐻|E(H)|\\in\\Theta(|V(H)|) and 𝗍𝗐​(H)∈Θ​(|V​(H)|)𝗍𝗐𝐻Θ𝑉𝐻\\mathsf{tw}(H)\\in\\Theta(|V(H)|) for all H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H} (see, e.g., [ref]36). Hence theorems 21 and 23 imply that #​cp-Hom​(ℋ→𝒰)#cp-Hom→ℋ𝒰\\#\\text{\\sc{cp-Hom}}(\\mathcal{H}\\to{\\mathcal{U}}) is #​𝖶​#𝖶delimited-[]1\\#\\mathsf{W}-hard and, assuming ETH, cannot be solved in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
