      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Knowledge Distillation from Model Checkpoints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo examine the common assumption ‚Äúhigh performing teachers lead to better student models‚Äù and explore the value of intermediate models, we design two experiments. 1) The standard KD is to train a full teacher model to distill a student model. What if we adopt the intermediate teacher models instead?\n2) The standard ensemble KD is to train multiple full teacher models independently and average their output to distill a single student model. What if we adopt the Snapshot Ensemble instead of the Full Ensemble?\nWe name the first experiment as ‚ÄúIntermediate Teacher vs. Full Teacher‚Äù, and the second experiment as ‚ÄúSnapshot Ensemble vs. Full Ensemble‚Äù. For generality, we conduct experiments on the CIFAR-100 , Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet [ref]38 datasets with various teacher-student pairs. The distillation loss functions follow Eqs. (1) and (2). For fair comparison, we search the optimal hyperparameters (i.e., the loss ratio Œ±ùõº\\alpha and the temperature œÑùúè\\tau ) for each teacher-student pair. Top 1 accuracy is averagely evaluated in five independent experiments. The ‚ÄúIntermediate Teacher vs. Full Teacher\" experiment is conducted on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.\nOn CIFAR-100, we adopt WRN-40-2[ref]39 and ResNet-110 as teacher models, WRN-40-1[ref]39, ResNet-32, and MobileNetV2[ref]41 (width multiplier is 0.75) as student models. We train each teacher model for 200 epochs to ensure convergence. We save the intermediate models at the 20thth{}^{\\text{th}}, 40thth{}^{\\text{th}}, ‚Ä¶, 180thth{}^{\\text{th}} epochs as intermediate teachers, and the models at the 200thth{}^{\\text{th}} epoch as full teachers. On ImageNet, we adopt ResNet-50 , and ResNet-34  as teacher models, and MobileNetV2 [ref]41, and ResNet-18  as student models. We follow the standard PyTorch practice but train teacher models for 120 epochs to guarantee convergence. We save the intermediate models at the 60thth{}^{\\text{th}} epoch as intermediate teachers, and the models at the 120thth{}^{\\text{th}} epoch as full teachers. The ‚ÄúSnapshot Ensemble vs. Full Ensemble‚Äù experiment is conducted on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. We train models for 150 epochs on Tiny-ImageNet to ensure convergence. We save the intermediate models at the 75thth{}^{\\text{th}} epoch as intermediate teachers, and the models at the 150thth{}^{\\text{th}} epoch as full teachers. We adopt WRN-40-1[ref]39, ResNet-32, and MobilenetV2[ref]41 as student models, and WRN-40-2[ref]39, and ResNet-110 as teacher models. Due to the page limitation, we include the introduction of the datasets and detailed experimental settings in the Appendix A.1.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: as ‚ÄúIntermediate Teacher vs. Full Teacher‚Äù, and the second experiment as ‚ÄúSnapshot Ensemble vs. Full Ensemble‚Äù.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
