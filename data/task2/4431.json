      "content": "Paper Title: Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPerson re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve people appearing at different locations and moments from the over-lapped cameras.\nThe deep learning-based approaches for person ReID can achieve promising performance on popular benchmarks [ref]1, which enables the applications of person ReID in many computer vision-based applications, such as city surveillance, suspect tracking, and urban analysis. The deployment of person ReID in real-life still suffers from many great challenges.\nOne prevalent challenge is that the recognition accuracy of the person ReID models will decrease, with the changing of camera environments.\nThis is mainly because of the domain mismatch between the training and deployment environments.\nSpecifically, the person ReID models are usually pre-trained on given datasets which consist of images of a fixed set of person identities captured in specific camera environments.\nHowever, in the real-life person ReID deployment, thousands of newly images that are captured every moment often involve many new person identities, which are unavailable at the model training stage.\nMeanwhile, the camera environments are dynamic and ever-changing due to influences brought by many reasons, such as illumination changing and varying camera views.\nThe domain gap between the training and inference environment limits the performance of person ReID in real-world deployment.\n Another challenge for person ReID is to preserve the privacy of the person images [ref]1.\nThe person images contain sensitive private information, such as individualsâ€™ identities, locations, genders, ethnicity, and even facial features .\nSharing these sensitive person images for model training and data analytics is infeasible due to the potential risk of privacy leakage and the expensive communication costs for data transmission.\nBesides, many EU/UK countries have issued privacy protection regulations (e.g., GDPR ) to prohibit the centralization of sensitive data from in-situ devices. To address the domain shift problem for person ReID, some recent works (e.g., [ref]4 [ref]5  ) adopted lifelong learning.\nThese works enable person ReID models to continuously learn knowledge from new scenarios without forgetting previously learnt knowledge.\nHVIL [ref]5 presents a human-in-the-loop paradigm for lifelong person ReID under interactive manual feedback.\nCRL  and AKA [ref]4 generalise the representation of lifelong person ReID for intra- and inter- domains respectively.\nGwFReID  alleviates forgetting under a class-imbalance lifelong condition for person ReID.\nHowever, these works require centralized training with the drifted data from deployed devices to learn new knowledge, which also bring data privacy concerns. To alleviate privacy concerns, some recent works (e.g.,   ) adopted federated learning to jointly train models on the edge clients without centralizing data.\nThe federated learning-based approaches enable the sensitive data to be utilized in situ (e.g.,  ),\nwhile different edge clients can collaboratively update models by aggregating the gradients or parameters (e.g., ) without sharing private data. Prior works, however, considered the problems of continuously updating models and decentralized training models separately.\nThey are still unable to support distributed edge clients to continuously learn new knowledge while collaboratively sharing their knowledge under privacy-preserving.\nHence, we first propose to judiciously combine both federated learning and lifelong learning for person ReID.\nMoreover, we observe that knowledge learnt from different locations and moments has implicit spatial and temporal correlations.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, pedestrians that appeared in the past often reappear on other streets in the near future.\nWe suppose the knowledge learnt from one edge client may also be informative to other neighbor clients shortly.\nHowever, previous works neglected the spatial-temporal correlations for recognition knowledge at different locations and moments.\nTherefore, they failed to adaptively utilize the knowledge across spatial and temporal spaces, and thus limit performance improvement. We propose a Federated Spatial-Temporal Incremental Learning framework, named FedSTIL, based on spatial-temporal knowledge integration for decentralized continuously learning for person ReID.\nThe edge clients utilize their arriving drift data to optimize the local model for incremental domain knowledge.\nMeanwhile, some general representations of the drift data are periodically stored in local memory for future rehearsal to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting.\nNext, the parameter server integrates the incremental knowledge from different edge clients based on the spatial-temporal correlation.\nThen, the parameter server delivers these informative knowledge to the edge clients.\nFinally, the edge clients will utilize both the integrated knowledge and previous learnt knowledge to further improve the model with lifelong learning.\nThe framework enables the distributed edge clients to continuously and collaboratively learn from every new scenario without sharing private data. The main contributions of our paper are summarized as: Propose a federated lifelong person ReID framework, which enables the distributed edge clients to continuously learn incremental knowledge with collaboration. Design a spatial-temporal knowledge integration method to transfer task-specific knowledge among edge models to improve their performance. Demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via extensive experiments, ablation studies, and visualization.
