      "content": "Paper Title: S-HR-VQVAE: Sequential Hierarchical Residual Learning Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder for Video Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral studies focused on extracting spatial information from videos.\nHu et al. [ref]12 proposed DrNet to model spatial features in single video frames, but temporal information was not taken into account.\nMcNet [ref]13 was proposed to model the motion (temporal) and content (spatial) aspects, which were however treated as independent sources of information.\nMsNet [ref]14 introduced mutual suppression adversarial training to acquire disentangled motion and content representations.\nBoth McNet and MsNet neglect possible joint correlations between spatial and temporal aspects in video frames. In , ConvLSTM was thus introduced to capture joint spatial and temporal correlations in video frames, where visual representations are extracted by exploiting convolutions in both input-to-state and state-to-state transitions.\nUnfortunately, ConvLSTM has a few shortcomings, including difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies, limited ability to model complex temporal patterns and poor scalability. To address ConvLSTM deficiencies, Wang et al.  proposed a new architecture based on spatiotemporal LSTM, referred to as PredRNN, employing (i) complex nonlinear transition functions from one frame to the next, and (ii) a dual memory structure.\nUnfortunately, PredRNN struggles to model complex long-term dependencies in the data, which can result in poor future frames prediction. PredRNN++  was therefore devised to address some of PredRNN’s limitations, introducing a different hierarchical recurrent structure that captures dependencies at multiple timescales.\nPredRNN-V2  was also proposed to improve PredRNN by traversing all nodes of PredRNN in a zigzag path of bi-directional hierarchies in order to jointly model spatial correlations and temporal dynamics.\nMotivated by PredRNN and PredRNN++, Wang et al.  put forth E3D-LSTM, the eidetic 3D memory cell with a short-time convolution window with spatiotemporal connection chain of convolutional LSTM blocks. Su et al.  improved the efficiency of higher-order ConvLSTMs by leveraging low-rank tensor factorization. This model effectively captured both visual appearances and temporal dynamics leveraging new recurrent mechanism, such as “spatiotemporal memory flow,” and new training procedures.\nIn , a novel model, dubbed Robust-ST-ConvLSTM (R-ST-LSTM), was introduced to extend ConvLSTM leveraging a novel spatiotemporal unit based on memory flow. R-ST-LSTM demonstrated a remarkable performance improvement in long-term frame prediction tasks.\nNevertheless, a constraint of these approaches lies in their ability to encode long-term dynamics since it predominantly relies on the input sequence to establish relationships between frames. As a result, capturing the comprehensive long-term motion context for accurate future prediction becomes challenging, particularly when the input sequence exhibits limited dynamics. To address the spatiotemporal challenge, we propose ST-PixelCNN: First, we extend PixelCNN with causal convolutions in time and spatiotemporal self-attention to model the spatiotemporal correlations. Then, we make the model operate on the latent discrete representations produced by HR-VQVAE rather than on the pixels directly.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Several studies focused on extracting spatial information from videos.\nHu et al. [ref]12 proposed DrNet to model spatial features in single video frames, but temporal information was not taken into account.\nMcNet [ref]13 was proposed to model the motion (temporal) and content\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
