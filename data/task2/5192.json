      "content": "Paper Title: High-Fidelity Guided Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we provide further details for the implementation of our approach as well as other baselines used while reporting results in the main paper. Ours. We use publicly available text-conditioned latent diffusion models 0  for implementing the purposed approach in the main paper.\nThe constrained optimization is performed using gradient descent with the Adam  optimizer and number of gradient steps Ng​r​a​d∈ subscript𝑁𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑2060N_{grad}\\in .\nWhile several formulations of the distance measure ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} and painting function f𝑓f are possible (refer Sec. C), we find that simply approximating the function ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} using mean squared distance and f𝑓f as a convolution operation with a gaussian kernel seems to give the fastest inference time performance with our method. For consistency with prior works, we use the non-differentiable painting function from SDEdit [ref]23 while reporting quantitative results. All results are reported using the DDIM sampling  with 50 inference steps for performing the reverse diffusion process. SDEdit[ref]23. We use the standard image-to-image pipeline from the open-source diffusers library 0 for reporting results for SDEdit [ref]23 with different values of hyperparameter t0∈ subscript𝑡001t_{0}\\in . Similar to our method, all results are reported at 512×512512512512\\times 512 resolution using DDIM sampling  with 50 inference steps for performing the reverse diffusion process. Unless otherwise specified, a classifier-free guidance scale 2 of 7.57.57.5 is used for all experiments. SDEdit + Loopback. We use the previously described SDEdit implementation and iteratively reperform guided synthesis with the previous diffusion outputs to improve realism of the generated outputs. In particular, we use Ni​t​e​r=4subscript𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟4N_{iter}=4 iterations for the iterative process. Also, similar to , in order to increase the realism of generated outputs with each iteration, the hyperparameter t0subscript𝑡0t_{0} is updated as, where n∈[1,Ni​t​e​r]𝑛1subscript𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟n\\in[1,N_{iter}] is the iteration number. Unless otherwise specified, we use the standard hyperparameter selection of k=1.05𝑘1.05k=1.05 and t0n=1=0.8subscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑛100.8t^{n=1}_{0}=0.8 for our experiments. ILVR [ref]5. The original ILVR [ref]5 algorithm was proposed for iterative refinement with diffusion models in pixel space. We adapt the ILVR implementation for inference with latent diffusion models  for the purposes of this paper. In particular given a reference painting y𝑦y, the original ILVR algorithm modifies the diffusion output xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} (in pixel space) at any timestep t𝑡t during reverse diffusion process as, where q​(yt∣y)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑡𝑦q(y_{t}\\mid y) represents the forward diffusion process from y→yt→𝑦subscript𝑦𝑡y\\rightarrow y_{t}, ϕN(.)\\phi_{N}(.) is a low pass filter achieved by scaling down the image by a factor of N𝑁N and then upsampling it back to the original dimensions. Assuming a latent diffusion model with encoder ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} and decoder 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, we simply adapt the above update in latent space as follows, where Eq. 13, 16 map the latent features ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z_{t} to pixel space xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}, and vice-versa. Eq. 14 computes ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t} from y𝑦y by first mapping y𝑦y to zysubscript𝑧𝑦z_{y}, computing the forward diffusion zy→zyt→subscript𝑧𝑦subscript𝑧subscript𝑦𝑡z_{y}\\rightarrow z_{y_{t}} and then reverting back zytsubscript𝑧subscript𝑦𝑡z_{y_{t}} to ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t}. Finally, Eq. 15 is simply the original update rule from ILVR algorithm [ref]5.\nA hyperparmeter value of N=4𝑁4N=4 is used while reporting results.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: operation with a gaussian kernel seems to give the fastest inference time performance with our method.
