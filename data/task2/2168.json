      "content": "Paper Title: S2 Engine: A Novel Systolic Architecture for Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSparsity widely exists in modern deep CNNs, including weight sparsity and feature sparsity.\nFor example, the intrinsic redundancy of deep CNNs allow us to prune majority of the weights with negligible accuracy loss by re-training the models  [ref]11.\nMoreover, feature sparsity is introduced during inference by ReLU function that converts negative inputs to zeros.\nThe average weight sparsity of three typical CNNs are listed in¬†Table¬†II.\nBecause feature sparsity varies with different input images, we randomly select 500005000050000 images from ImageNet  and calculate their corresponding feature sparsity.\nSince all the MACs with zero operand(s) can be skipped without affecting the convolution result, only the MACs on aligned data pairs have to be computed and defined as must-be-performed MACs as shown in Fig.¬†2.\nThe distributions of feature density and must-be-performed MAC ratios of the three CNNs are depicted in Fig.¬†3.\nAccording to these statistics, the sparsity of both weights and features is not trivial and provides a considerable opportunity to reduce computational cost and memory footprint. Although the sparsity of CNNs is not trivial, its irregularity makes it difficult to effectively accelerate the executions of the sparse CNNs¬†.\nFig.¬†2 demonstrates the fundamental challenge brought by such irregularity.\nTo eliminate all the unnecessary MAC operations (with one or two zero operands), only the aligned data pairs need to be sent to PEs.\nAs a result, although c‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv0ùëêùëúùëõsubscriptùë£0conv_{0} and c‚Äão‚Äãn‚Äãv1ùëêùëúùëõsubscriptùë£1conv_{1} share the same kernel, the actual weights they access in the kernel can be totally different due to the difference between the sparsity patterns of I‚ÄãF0ùêºsubscriptùêπ0{IF}_{0} and I‚ÄãF1ùêºsubscriptùêπ1{IF}_{1}.\nFig.¬†1 demonstrates that how such an irregularity brings challenge to systolic array.\nThe weights required by PE0 (w1,0subscriptùë§10w_{1,0}) and PE1 (w0,0subscriptùë§00w_{0,0} and w3,0subscriptùë§30w_{3,0}) for convolution are different, which breaks the data transmission path inside the systolic array.\nThis characteristic also prevents the accelerators with explicitly planned dataflow    from fully leveraging the network sparsity.\nIt also becomes challenging to optimize both data reuse and sparsity at the same time. Table¬†III summarizes the sparsity strategies explored by existing accelerators.\nFor example, TPU does not explore any of the two sparsity strategies in systolic arrays , since each zero would inevitably occupy a PE.\nEyeriss only exploits the feature sparsity .\nBy utilizing feature sparsity, Cnvlutin achieves performance improvement by skipping the operations with zero elements in feature maps .\nCambricon-X  and , however, only exploit weight sparsity within the network trained by their proposed pruning algorithm.\nCambricon-S fully deploys the sparsity of both features and weights, but only supports them at coarse granularity and requires additional pruning algorithms .\nEIE also exploits these two types of sparsity [ref]33 but is only designed for fully-connected networks.\nSCNN exploits these two types of sparsity on both convolutional and fully-connected layers . However, SCNN requires lots of coordinate computations and introduces significant overhead.\nAs an evidence, SCNN only achieves 79%percent7979\\% of the speed but consumes 33%percent3333\\% more energy when processing dense CNNs  .\nSparTen [ref]18 supports sparse vector-vector multiplication and load balance optimization to improve the hardware utilization, but the required additional computation resources degrade the energy efficiency significantly.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: including weight sparsity and feature sparsity.\nFor example, the intrinsic redundancy of deep CNNs allow us to prune majority of the weights with negligible accuracy loss by re-training the models  [ref]11.\nMoreover, feature sparsity is introduced during inference by ReLU function that converts negative inputs to zeros.\nThe average weight sparsity of three typical CNNs are listed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
