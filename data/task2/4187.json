      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Neural Network Aided MU-MIMO Detectors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we first evaluate the posterior distribution approximation of the proposed detectors.\nWe then analyse the performance of our proposed detectors by comparing their SER performance with that of the state-of-the-art MP and NN based detectors. More specifically, the SER is evaluated with respect to the channel condition number, SNR, and transmit-to-receive antennas ratio. The MP detectors considered in this paper are the AMP , MMSE , BPIC 4, OAMP 2, and EP  detectors.\nThe weighting coefficients in the EP and GEPNet detectors are set to 0.90.90.9 and 0.70.70.7, respectively. Besides the proposed NN based GEPNet and GPICNet detectors, we also consider the state-of-the-art NN based GNN [ref]21, OAMPNet  and RE-MIMO  detectors.\nSince we focus on MU-MIMO systems where the transmit-to-receive antennas ratio is high, we consider Œ±‚âúKN‚àà2 ‚âúùõºùêæùëÅ121\\alpha\\triangleq\\frac{K}{N}\\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2},1\\right].\nThe proposed GEPNet and GPICNet detectors only need to be trained with Ktrain‚àà{12‚ÄãN,N}subscriptùêætrain12ùëÅùëÅK_{\\rm train}\\in\\{\\frac{1}{2}N,N\\}, as discussed in the previous section. The RE-MIMO  was trained with Ktrain‚àà{12‚ÄãN,12‚ÄãN+1,‚Ä¶,N}subscriptùêætrain12ùëÅ12ùëÅ1‚Ä¶ùëÅK_{\\rm train}\\in\\{\\frac{1}{2}N,\\frac{1}{2}N+1,\\dots,N\\}, as suggested in . The OAMPNet and GNN detectors were trained with the same number of users as in the testing phase, i.e., Ktrain=KsubscriptùêætrainùêæK_{\\rm train}=K, as suggested by their authors.\nWe also provide the ML detection results. The ML detector was implemented by using Gurobi optimizer  to solve the quadratic minimization problem (4). Specifically, the Gurobi optimizer employs an advanced version of the widely known branch-and-cut method . Unless otherwise mentioned, 500000500000500000 channel realizations were used to compute the SER. We employ 444-QAM, 161616-QAM, and 646464-QAM modulation.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: in the EP and GEPNet detectors are set to 0.90.90.9 and 0.70.70.7, respectively. Besides the proposed NN based GEPNet and GPICNet detectors, we also consider the state-of-the-art NN based GNN [ref]21, OAMPNet  and RE-MIMO  detectors.\nSince we focus on MU-MIMO systems where the transmit-to-receive antennas ratio is high, we consider Œ±‚âúKN‚àà2\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
