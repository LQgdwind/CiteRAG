As mentioned above, envy-free allocations may not exist for the case of indivisible items. Since envy-freeness is arguably a fundamental notion of fairness, as evident from its importance in fair cake cutting, there has been a significant body of research aimed towards finding ex-ante envy-free allocation lotteries in the indivisible setting.\nThe work of Freeman¬†et¬†al.¬† addresses the key question of whether ex-ante envy-freeness\ncan be achieved in combination with ex-post envy-freeness up to one item. They settle it positively by designing an efficient algorithm that achieves both properties simultaneously.\nCaragiannis¬†et¬†al.¬† explore the interim allocation lotteries (iEF) which provide fairness guarantees that lie between ex-post and ex-ante envy-freeness. They develop\npolynomial-time algorithms for computing iEF lotteries that maximize various efficiency notions. Budish¬†et¬†al.¬† employ a general class of random allocation mechanisms to achieve ex-ante fairness and efficiency in the presence of real-world constraints. Several other works explore fairness and efficiency guarantees of allocation lotteries as well, but for ordinal utilities¬†  . Another line of research has explored various relaxations of envy-freeness. The notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) was introduced by Budish¬†et¬†al.¬†2 as one of the first ‚Äògood‚Äô relaxations of envy-freeness in the indivisible setting. We say an\nallocation is EF1 when every agent (weakly) prefers her own bundle over any other agent¬†jùëój‚Äôs bundle after removing some item from¬†jùëój‚Äôs bundle. EF1 allocations are guaranteed to always exist for general monotone valuations and can be computed efficiently . Moreover, this fairness notion is compatible with the economic efficiency objective of Pareto-optimality¬†6. Later, envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) was introduced by Caragiannis¬†et¬†al.¬†6 as a refinement of EF1 and is now considered as the most compelling fairness criterion while dividing indivisible items. We say an allocation is EFX when every agent\n(weakly) prefers her own bundle than any other agent¬†jùëój‚Äôs bundle after removing her least positively-valued item from¬†jùëój‚Äôs bundle. Recent works [ref]4 [ref]5 7 8 have shown existential guarantees for EFX in various special cases.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: items. We say an allocation is EFX when every agent\n(weakly) prefers her own bundle than any other agent¬†jùëój‚Äôs bundle after removing her least positively-valued item from¬†jùëój‚Äôs bundle.
