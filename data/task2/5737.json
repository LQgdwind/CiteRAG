      "content": "Paper Title: DUDES: Deep Uncertainty Distillation using Ensembles for Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic segmentation is a computer vision task that aims to assign a class label to each pixel in a given image, with the goal of understanding the semantic content of the image. Hence, it can be viewed as a pixel-wise classification task. Recently, methods based on deep neural networks have become the most popular and successful approach to solve this problem [ref]29. Despite their unrivaled performance on established benchmark datasets like Cityscapes  or PASCAL VOC [ref]7, neural networks lack interpretability 1, are unable to distinguish between in-domain and out-of-domain samples , and tend to be overconfident . These shortcomings are especially severe for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving  and the analysis of medical imaging  or computer vision tasks that have high demands on reliability like industrial inspection  and automation . Quantifying the predictive uncertainty is a promising endeavour to make such applications safer and more reliable, e.g., by preemptively making risk-averse predictions or by providing feedback to a human operator when predictions are uncertain. Some of the most relevant methods include Bayesian Neural Networks , Monte Carlo Dropout , and \\acde . Unfortunately, all of these methods require computationally expensive estimation of a distribution of outputs by sampling from a stochastic process. Recently, the concept of \\ackd has been introduced as a potential solution   6 . Knowledge distillation is a technique for transferring the knowledge embodied in a complex model, referred to as the teacher, to a smaller model, referred to as the student. By incorporating the knowledge learned by a more complex model, the student’s performance can be enhanced 5  . In this work, we present a novel approach for efficient and reliable uncertainty quantification, which we call \\acdudes as shown in Figure 1. \\acdudes applies student-teacher distillation with a \\acde to accurately approximate predictive uncertainties while maintaining simplicity and adaptability. In comparison to the \\acde, only a single forward pass is required to obtain predictive uncertainties, which massively reduces the inference time and eliminates the computational overhead. \\acdudes simultaneously simplifies and outperforms previous work on \\acde-based uncertainty distillation, which we experimentally evaluate on the Cityscapes dataset. Additionally, it is worth noting that, the \\acde can in principle be substituted by any other \\acuq method. After a brief overview of the related works on \\acuq and \\ackd in Section 2, the methodology of \\acdudes is described in Section 3. In Section 4, we demonstrate the ability of \\acdudes through quantitative and qualitative analysis of the predictive uncertainties, and the potential to identify wrongly classified pixels and out-of-domain samples on the Cityscapes dataset. Section 5 discusses the experimental results and their potential impact on future research, while Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: of the image.
