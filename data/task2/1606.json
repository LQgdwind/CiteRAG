      "content": "Paper Title: GradInit: Learning to Initialize Neural Networks for Stable and Efficient Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nControlling the norms of network parameters at initialization has proven to be an effective approach for speeding up and stabilizing training.\nGlorot and Bengio  studied how the variance of features evolves with depth in feed-forward linear neural networks by assuming both activations and weight tensors are independent and identical random variables. They developed a technique in which the variance of each filter scales with its fan-in (the number of input neurons).\nThis style of analysis was later generalized to the case of ReLU networks¬†[ref]2.\nThese two analyses are most effective for feed-forward networks without skip connections or normalization layers.\nBased on the orthogonal initialization scheme¬†4, Mishkin and Matas 5 proposed an iterative procedure to rescale the orthogonally initialized weights of each layer in feedforward networks so that the activations of that layer have unit variance. However, this method fails to prevent the blowup of activations with depth for ResNets¬†6. Recently, Gurbuzbalaban and Hu 7 proposed initialization schemes such that the network can provably preserve any given moment of order s‚àà(0,2]ùë†02s\\in(0,2] for the output of each layer. The motivation is that the stochastic gradient updates can result in heavy-tailedness in the distribution of the network weights with a potentially infinite variance, but finite sùë†s-order moment 8. Again, these initialization schemes can only be applied for feed-forward neural networks. For more complex architectures, normalization layers 9  and skip connections  stabilized training dynamics and improved the state-of-the-art. Similarly, learning rate warmup is a common trick for training large Transformers¬†.\nThese methods make training tractable for some models, but do not eliminate the high initial gradient variance that destabilizes training when the network is deep¬†[ref]9 0 1 or when the normalization layers are not carefully positioned¬†. Several authors have proposed better initializations for networks with skip connections.\nThis is often achieved by replacing the normalization layers with simpler scaling or bias operations, and scaling the weight matrices in each layer so that the variance of activations does not increase with depth¬†[ref]9 0 1 2. Similar analysis has been applied to self attention in Transformers¬†. Without removing the normalization layers, it is possbile to stabilize the initial parameter updates by introducing carefully initialized learnable scale factors to the skip connections¬† or the residual branches¬†.\nHowever, such techniques are often restricted to one specific architecture such as ResNets. Recently, Dauphin and Schoenholz 6 proposed a task-agnostic and automatic initialization method, MetaInit, for any neural network achitecture. MetaInit optimized the norms of weight tensors to minimize the ‚Äúgradient quotient‚Äù, which measures the effect of curvature near the initial parameters, on minibatches of random Gaussian samples.\nHowever, as training data is usually accessible for most tasks of interest, it is simpler and potentially more efficient to use the training data for initialization.\nMetaInit also involves the gradient of a Hessian-vector product that requires computing a ‚Äúgradient of the gradient‚Äù multiple times in tandem, which is very computationally intensive.\nOur proposed method distinguishes itself from MetaInit in the following ways:\n(i) Our method is more computationally efficient. MetaInit involves computing third-order derivatives, results in long computing times and high memory usage. The memory overhead of MetaInit is more of an issue for networks with normalization layers. For the relatively small-scale CIFAR-10 problem with batch size 64, MetaInit requires three GPUs (RTX 2080Ti), while the proposed GradInit needs just one.\n(ii) Our method takes the stochasticity of minibatches into consideration. MetaInit uses the local curvature evaluated on a single minibatch, which fails to capture the variance of the loss/gradient between two different stochastic minibatches.\n(iii) Our method considers the training dynamics of different optimization algorithms including the learning rate and the direction of the gradient step, and effectively handles different optimizers including SGD and Adam.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: They developed a technique in which the variance of each filter scales with its fan-in (the number of input neurons).\nThis style of analysis was later generalized to the case of ReLU networks¬†[ref]2.\nThese two analyses are most effective for feed-forward networks without skip connections or normalization layers.\nBased on the orthogonal initialization scheme¬†4, Mishkin and Matas 5 proposed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
