      "content": "Paper Title: Relating Implicit Bias and Adversarial Attacks through Intrinsic Dimension\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe idea behind the phenomenon of implicit bias is that the loss landscape of an overparameterized network has many local minima, and which local minimum one converges to after training depends on the complex interplay between factors including the choice of the model architecture and parameterization [ref]3 , the initialization scheme [ref]9, the optimization algorithm [ref]9   and the data statistics .\nThe implicit bias of state-of-the-art models has been shown to play a critical role in the generalization property of deep neural networks  . Analytical characterizations of the implicit bias have been provided only for deep linear convolutional or fully connected networks [ref]3.\nOne interesting effect of the implicit bias of the network is its tendency to learn specific frequencies in the target function during training, a phenomenon called spectral bias [ref]15. This bias results in the network learning low complexity functions and can potentially explain its ability to generalize [ref]15  . Also, not surprisingly, the implicit bias strongly influences the type of input features extracted by a trained neural network. In particular, in , the authors show that very few image frequencies in the Fourier domain are essential to the network to perform classification. These findings have helped to characterize the spectral bias of neural networks with a focus on the input space rather than the target function (as in [ref]15).\nInterestingly, a deep connection exists between robust classification and implicit bias . Empirically, a strong relationship has been found between the network robustness and the statistics of the Fourier spectra of the input data  or architecture  and detection strategies in the Fourier domain have been used to defend against adversarial attacks .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: has many local minima, and which local minimum one converges to after training depends on the complex interplay between factors including the choice of the model architecture and parameterization [ref]3 , the initialization scheme [ref]9, the optimization algorithm [ref]9   and the data statistics .\nThe implicit bias of state-of-the-art models has been shown to play a critical role in the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
