      "content": "Paper Title: Regular Expressions with Backreferences on Multiple Context-Free Languages, and the Closed-Star Condition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe seminal work for regular expressions with backreferences is by Aho .\nCâmpeanu et al. formalized the semantics of rewbs using an ordered tree .\nMore recently, Schmid formalized rewbs with the notions of ref-languages and dereferencing functions, and proposed memory automata (MFA), a class of automata equivalent to rewbs 5.\nFreydenberger and Schmid examined deterministic variants of rewbs and MFAs .\nAs stated in the introduction, the relationship between the expressive power of rewbs and those of other well-known language classes such as CFL, NESL, SL, IL and CSL has been investigated   . We want to refer to syntactic restrictions of rewbs related to this paper.\nAs mentioned in Definition B.1, the closedness condition was originally proposed by Câmpeanu et al.  and named no unassigned references (NUR) by Chida and Terauchi . However, unlike us, these papers asserted the condition globally on the entire rewb and did not consider asserting the condition locally at subexpressions of the rewb.\nBerglund and van der Merwe defined a non-circular rewb, which excludes mutual references such as ((1\\2a)1(2\\1\\1)2)∗((_{1}\\backslash 2a)_{1}(_{2}\\backslash 1\\backslash 1)_{2})^{\\ast} .\nLarsen introduced the notion of nested levels and showed a language Lisubscript𝐿𝑖L_{i} expressible by a rewb at each nested level i𝑖i but not at any levels below i𝑖i . Roughly, the nested level of a rewb represents the nesting depth of capturing groups and references.\nOur recent work showed that every rewb without captured references describes an NESL and each Lisubscript𝐿𝑖L_{i} of Larsen’s hierarchy is also an NESL . The use of a reference \\i\\absent𝑖\\backslash i inside a star has been considered as a bizarre syntax increasing the difficulty of a rewb.\nFreydenberger and Holldack proposed a syntactic condition called variable star-free (vstar-free) , which asserts that every subexpression immediately under a star must be a pure regular expression.\nThe closed-star condition proposed in our paper is similar to vstar-free in that it also asserts a condition on the subexpression immediately under a star. However, our closed-star condition is strictly more lenient than vstar-freeness: it is easy to see that every vstar-free rewb is closed-star, but for instance, ((1a∗)1\\1)∗((_{1}a^{\\ast})_{1}\\backslash 1)^{\\ast} is closed-star but not vstar-free.\nFreydenberger and Schmid investigated the computational complexity of some basic problems such as intersection-emptiness, inclusion and equivalence of vstar-free rewbs that additionally satisfy a certain form of determinism . Next, we discuss PMCFLs and MCFLs.\nVijay-Shanker et al. 8 and Weir  proposed a model called linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) and showed its semilinearity and polynomial time recognition.\nIndependently, Seki et al. 6 introduced PMCFG and MCFG and examined those expressive powers and properties.\nIn particular, they showed that MCFG is equivalent to LCFRS.\nIt is widely recognized that MCFG is a natural generalization of CFG and has several characterizations besides LCFRS, such as\ncontext-free hyper-graph grammar (CFHG)   and\ndeterministic tree-walking transducer (DTWT) .101010The name seems to have been introduced by  and the original paper  used another name tree automaton.\nThe equivalence between CFHG and DTWT is shown by Engelfriet and Heyker  and that between LCFRS and DTWT is shown by Weir 9.\nMore recently, Denkinger characterized m𝑚m-MCFG by an automata model called m𝑚m-restricted tree stack automata .\nSeki et al. 6 also proved a pumping lemma for m𝑚m-MCFLs. However, this pumping lemma is somewhat weaker than ordinary ones (see Theorem A.10 in Appendix A).\nKanazawa proved a pumping lemma of the usual form for a subclass of MCFLs called well-nested MCFLs .\nAs remarked in the introduction, unary PMCFLs and MCFLs can be characterized by EDT0L systems and those of finite index [ref]28 .\nIn particular, Rozenberg and Vermeir investigated the properties of ET0L systems of finite index 2. One of their results is the equivalence of ET0LFINsubscriptET0LFIN\\text{ET0L}_{\\text{FIN}} and EDT0LFINsubscriptEDT0LFIN\\text{EDT0L}_{\\text{FIN}}.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: lemma of the usual form for a subclass of MCFLs called well-nested MCFLs .\nAs remarked in the introduction, unary PMCFLs and MCFLs can be characterized by EDT0L systems and those of finite index [ref]28 .\nIn particular, Rozenberg and Vermeir investigated the properties of ET0L systems of finite index 2. One of their results is the equivalence of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
