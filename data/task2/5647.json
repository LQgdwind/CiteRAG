Several testbeds/ frameworks/ benchmarks have been introduced to facilitate OWL by considering novelties as first-class citizens. This section describes related research on domains for OWL and situates NovPhy within them. GNOME is a novelty-centric simulator tool that facilitates developing and evaluating AI systems in multi-agent environments such as strategic board games [ref]14.\nGNOME is applied to the popular board game monopoly to inject novelties from the first three levels of the novelty hierarchy described above. Example novelties from GNOME are adding more dice to the game, shuffling the order of slots on the board, etc. NovGrid  and NovelGridworlds  are two frameworks developed for grid environments. NovGrid is a toolkit developed for novelty generation in MiniGrid environment . NovGrid extends the MiniGrid environment by enhancing the functionality of existing objects and enabling agents to detect and adapt to novelty.\nNovelGridworlds implements a Minecraft  inspired grid world to study novelties.\nIn NovGrid, authors have introduced novelties based on the first two novelty hierarchy levels while in NovelGridworlds authors introduce novelties based on the first three levels of the novelty hierarchy. NovelCraft  is a benchmark dataset for novelty detection and adaptation based on a modified version of Minecraft. NovelCraft is a 3D environment where an agent needs to select a sequence of actions to turn available resources into a pogo stick . In this work, authors have established agent performance in novelties based on the first level of the novelty hierarchy: objects . None of the above-mentioned novelty domains is based on physics, which is an important characteristic to consider when developing agents that work in the real world.\nCartpole with novelty  and Science Birds Novelty  are two physics based domains developed for novelty detection and adaptation. In Cartpole, an agent must keep the pole balanced by pushing the cart forward, backward, left, or right. In Science Birds Novelty, which is based on the physics game Angry Birds , an agent needs to destroy the pigs by shooting birds from a slingshot. NovPhy uses the Science Birds framework  and introduces various realistic physical reasoning tasks, as our focus is on evaluating agents’ physical reasoning ability under the influence of novelty. As mentioned in Section 2.1, we use five physical reasoning scenarios and combine them with novelties from all eight levels of the novelty hierarchy.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: for OWL and situates NovPhy within them.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
