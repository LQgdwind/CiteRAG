      "content": "Paper Title: Dealing with Incompatibilities among Procedural Goals under Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn intelligent agent may in general pursue multiple procedural goals at the same time111A goal is procedural when there is a set of plans for achieving it. These goals are also known as achievement goals .. In this situation, some conflicts between goals could arise, in the sense that it is not possible to pursue them simultaneously. Reasons for not pursuing some goals simultaneously are generally related to the fact that plans for reaching such goals may block each other. Consider the well-known “cleaner world” scenario, where a set of robots have the task of cleaning the dirt of an environment.\nAlthough the main goal of the robots is to clean the environment, during the execution of this task they may pursue some other goals. Furthermore, consider that there exist uncertainties in both actions and sensing. According to Castelfranchi and Paglieiri , at least three forms of incompatibility could emerge: Terminal incompatibility: Suppose that at a given moment one of the robots – let us call him 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} – has a technical defect; hence, 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} begins to pursue the goal “going to the workshop to be fixed”. Recall that 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} is already pursuing the goal of cleaning the environment; however, if 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} wants to be fixed he has to stop cleaning. Hence, 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} cannot pursue both goals at the same time because the plans adopted for each goal lead to an inconsistency, since he needs to be operative to continue cleaning and non-operative to be fixed. Instrumental or resource incompatibility: It arises because the agents have limited resources. Suppose that 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} is in slot (2,4) and detects two dirty slots, slot (4,2) and slot (4,8). Therefore, he begins to pursue two goals: (i) cleaning slot (4,2) and (ii) cleaning slot (4,8); however, he only has battery for executing the plan of one of the goals. Consequently a conflict due to resource battery arises, and 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} has to choose which slot to clean. Superfluity: It occurs when the agent pursues two goals that lead to the same end. Suppose that 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} is in slot (2,2) and he detects dirt in slot (4,5), since it is far from its localization, he has no certainty about the kind of dirt and he begins to pursue the goal “cleaning slot (4,5)”. Another cleaner robot – 𝚃𝙾𝙼𝚃𝙾𝙼\\mathtt{TOM} – also detects the same dirty slot and he has the certainty that it is liquid dirt; however, 𝚃𝙾𝙼𝚃𝙾𝙼\\mathtt{TOM}’s battery is quite low, whereby he sends a message to 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} to mop slot (4,5). Thus, 𝙱𝙾𝙱𝙱𝙾𝙱\\mathtt{BOB} begins to pursue the goal “mopping slot (4,5)”. It is easy to notice that both goals have the same end, which is that slot (4,5) to be cleaned. Argumentation is an appropriate approach for reasoning with inconsistent information . The process of argumentation is based on the construction and the comparison of arguments (considering the so-called attacks among them). Argumentation has been applied for practical reasoning for the generation of desires and plans (e.g., ). In  and , the authors represent the agent’s plans by means of arguments (these arguments are called instrumental arguments) and the conflicts between plans are expressed in form of attacks. In our example, we can have an argument A𝐴A representing a plan p𝑝p, an argument B𝐵B representing another plan p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime}, and both attack each other. The question is: what argument will be selected? According to [ref]8, one can measure the strength of the arguments to refine the notion of acceptability (selection) of arguments. Thus, each argument is measured and a strength value is assigned to it. Then, the arguments’ strengths determine the preference of one of them. In , , , and , the authors use instrumental arguments to represents plans and define possible attacks; however, the agent’s beliefs are not pervaded with uncertainty. Besides, in , , and  the actions are not taken into account in the structure of the arguments. The strength of an instrumental argument is measured in  based on the worth of the goals that make it up and the cost of the plan with respect to the resources it needs to be achieved. Other related works are focused on dealing with uncertainty in structured arguments. Hunter 0 assign a probability distribution over the models of the language, which are used to give a probability distribution to the arguments that are constructed using classical logic. Haenni et al. 1 also applies the approach of assigning a probability distribution over the models models of logical arguments. In 2, Amgoud and Prade propose a possibilistic logic framework where arguments are built from an uncertain knowledge base and a set of prioritized goals. In 3, Nieves et al. present an argumentation approach based on the ASP’s language for encoding knowledge under imprecise or uncertain information. Chesñevar et al. 4 present P-DeLP (Possibilistic Defeasible Logic Programming), which combines features of argumentation theory and logic programming and incorporates a possibilistic treatment of uncertainty. This work was extended in 5 by applying also fuzzy techniques. Thus, the authors use PGL+, a possibilistic logic over Gödel logic extended with fuzzy constants. Schweimeier and Schroeder 6 also use fuzzy logic and propose an argumentation framework with fuzzy unification to handle uncertainty. Nevertheless, all these works are not related to goals conflicts and do not represent plans by means of arguments. Against this background, the aim of this article is to study and propose a way of measuring the strength of instrumental arguments whose premises are pervaded of uncertainty. This will lead us to determine the set of non-conflicting plans and non-conflicting goals the agent can continue pursuing. Thus, the research questions that are addressed in this article are: How to measure the strength of an instrumental argument considering that its premises have uncertain elements?, and Given that we use instrumental arguments to determine the incompatibilities between goals, how the uncertainty of the elements of instrumental arguments impact on determining the set of compatible goals? In addressing the first question, we use a coherence-based probability logic approach 7. We assign and/or calculate a probabilistic interval for each element of the argument and the interval of the argument is calculated based on the uncertainty of its premises. Lastly, the argument’s strength is calculated from this interval. The reason to choose an interval is that it can be used to represent a range of possible values and/or the aggregation of several perceptions. For example, suppose that the dirty sensor of a cleaner robot has a sensitivity error for distinguishing between a dirty slot and a stain on the slot when he is far from the observed slot. In this case, it would be better to represent the probability that such slot is dirty by using an interval. Regarding the second question, we use Dung’s argumentation semantics in order to obtain the set of compatible goals. Thus, the main contributions of this article are:\n A way of measuring the strength of structured arguments whose premises are pervaded with uncertainty, Two different ways of measuring the strength of instrumental arguments: (i) considering their logical structure and (ii) considering the necessary resources. A three-dimensional representation of the logical strength, which allows the agent to compare the argument in more than one way. To the best of our knowledge, the suggested three-dimensional strength of arguments is the first one in its kind for leading with arguments that are pervaded with uncertainty, and A way of selecting goals based on abstract argumentation semantics. This article has also a practical contribution since it can be applied to real engineering problems. As it can be seen in the example, this kind of approach can be used in robotic applications (e.g., 890) in order to endow a robot with a system that allows him to recognize and decide about the goals he should pursue. Another possible application is in the spatial planning problem, which aims to rearrange the spatial environment in order to meet the needs of a society 1. As space is a limited resource, it causes that the planner finds conflicts in the desires and expectations about the spatial environment. These desires and expectation can be modeled as a set of restrictions and conditions, which can be considered as goals (e.g., suitability, dependency, and compatibility)2. Thus, the planner can be seen as a software agent that has to decide among a set of conflicting goals. Although these conflicting goals are not goals the agent wants to achieve, as in the case of the robot, the agent may use this approach in order to resolve the problem and suggest a possible arrangement of the spatial environment. It could also be applied during a design process, in which inconsistencies among design objectives may arise and this results in design conflicts 3. In this case, agents may represent designers that share knowledge and have conflicting interests. This results in a distributed design system that can be simulated as an Multi-Agent System 45. This last type of application involves more than one agent; however, since there is a conflict among goals, it can be resolved by applying the proposed approach. Another interesting application is in the medication adherence problem. In 6, the authors propose a coach intelligent agent that is in charge of supporting the medical management of patients. This agent has autonomous reasoning capabilities that allow him to deal with long-term goals in the settings of medication plans. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Next section presents some necessary technical background related to probabilistic logic. In Section 3, the main building blocks on which this approach is based are defined. Section 4 is devoted to the kinds of attacks that may occur between arguments. In Section 5, we study and present the strength calculation proposal. Section 6 is focused on the definition of the argumentation framework and on studying how to determine the set of compatible goals by means of argumentation semantics. We present the evaluation of our proposal in terms of fulfilling the postulates of rationality in Section 7. Finally, the conclusions and future work are presented in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: argument A𝐴A representing a plan p𝑝p, an argument B𝐵B representing another plan p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime}, and both attack each other.
