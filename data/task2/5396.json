      "content": "Paper Title: Streaming LifeLong Learning With Any-Time Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we aim to achieve ‘any-time-inference’ ability in streaming lifelong learning (SL). This is an appealing ability as it allows practical applicability of AI agents/robots, which can be continually updated and deployed without catastrophic forgetting . While deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art performance throughout various tasks ranging across vision, language, speech, etc., these models suffer from catastrophic forgetting , if trained incrementally with sequentially arriving data. LifeLong Learning (LLL) or continual learning (CL)  studies the problem of training a deep neural network (DNN) continuously with sequentially coming data without forgetting. This paper introduces a novel approach, which enables DNN for class-incremental streaming classification. Class-incremental streaming classification/learning (CISL) is a challenging variant of LLL [ref]4 [ref]5, with the following essential and desirable properties: Learner sees each labeled instance only once (desirable), Learner needs to adapt the newly available data immediately (desirable), The input data stream can be non-i.i.d and temporally contiguous/coherent (essential), The AI agent can be evaluated at any moment, i.e., ‘any-time-inference’ (essential), The AI agent should be able to predict a class label among all the observed classes so far during inference without having the task-id  (essential), For practical applicability, learner must limit their memory usage (desirable). A wide variety of CL approaches     0 1 2 have been proposed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting in DNN. However, most of the existing approaches mainly focus on ‘incremental-batch-learning’ (IBL) , where the input data in each incremental step arrives in batches, and the agent visits them multiple times in order to enable CL. While these methods are applicable in a static environment, these methods are ill-suited for a rapidly changing dynamic environment, where an AI agent requires to learn from the newly available knowledge immediately with no forgetting. Different from this, ‘streaming learning’ (SL) imposes a unique set of restrictions/challenges (as mentioned earlier) and has not received widespread attention like the other existing CL approaches. However, its utility is apparent, as it enables the practical deployment of autonomous AI agents. Hayes et al. [ref]5 argued that SL is closer to biological learning than other existing CL scenarios. Fig. 1 demonstrates an example of streaming classification scenario. In Table I, we classify the existing CL approaches in accordance to the underlying assumption that they impose. It can be observed that ExStream [ref]4 and REMIND [ref]5 are the only two CL approaches, that focus on streaming classification. However, it is worth mentioning that ExStream [ref]4 uses full buffer replay, which violates the subset buffer replay constraint of CISL. Furthermore, while REMIND [ref]5 satisfies all the CISL constraints, it stores a comparably large number of past samples in memory, which limits its applicability. In this work, we overcome the aforementioned limitations in a principled manner and introduce a novel CISL method, dubbed as Bayesian Class Incremental Streaming Learning (BaSiL), that seeks to incorporate the ability of rehearsal with a functional regularization into a simple yet effective framework of streaming variational Bayes. We leverage both the replay samples and the sequential data to compute the joint likelihood in order to approximate the posterior in each incremental step. As a consequence, the proposed approach does not require explicit finetuning unlike approaches like 4, and can be evaluated ‘on-the-fly’ at any moment. We also propose a novel online ‘loss-aware’ buffer management policy and various sample selection strategies that include the most informative sample(s) in memory or select for rehearsal, which significantly boosts the model’s performance. Our experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to circumvent forgetting in highly challenging streaming scenarios. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We introduce BaSiL, a novel rehearsal-based dual regularization framework, which includes a streaming Bayesian framework and a functional regularizer, to alleviate forgetting in challenging CISL setup, We propose a novel online ‘loss-aware’ replay buffer management policy and various sampling strategies which significantly boosts the model’s performance, We empirically show that the proposed method can be evaluated at any time without requiring to finetune unlike  4  with no significant drop in final accuracy, Empirical evaluations and ablations on three benchmark datasets validate the superiority of BaSiL over the existing baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: This paper introduces a novel approach, which enables DNN for class-incremental streaming classification.
