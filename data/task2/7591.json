      "content": "Paper Title: Automated Software Verification of Hyperliveness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate ForEx in various settings where FEHT-like specifications arise.\nWe compare with HyPA (a predicate-abstraction-based solver) [ref]12, PCSat (a constraint-based solver that relies on predicate templates) , and HyPro (a model-checker for ‚àÄ‚àó‚àÉ‚àósuperscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} properties in finite-state systems) .\nOur results were obtained on a M1 Pro CPU with 32GB of memory. Before we evaluate ForEx on ‚àÄ‚àó‚àÉ‚àósuperscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} properties, we investigate the counting-based loop alignment principle underlying ForEx.\nWe collect the kùëòk-safety benchmarks from HyPA [ref]12 (which themself were collected from multiple sources    ) and depict the verification results in Table 1(a).\nWe observe that ForEx can verify many of these instances.\nAs it explores a restricted class of loop alignments (guided by LABEL:rule:loop-count), it is more efficient on the instances it can solve.\nHowever, for some of the instances, ForEx‚Äôs counting-based alignment is insufficient.\nInstead, these instances require a loop alignment that is context-dependent, i.e., the alignment is chosen based on the current state of the programs [ref]12   . HyPA [ref]12 explores a liberal program alignment by exploring a user-provided predicate abstraction.\nThe verification instances considered in [ref]12 include a range of ‚àÄ‚àó‚àÉ‚àósuperscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} properties on very small programs, including, e.g., GNI and refinement properties.\nIn Table 1(b), we compare the running time of ForEx with that of HyPA (using the user-defined predicates for its abstraction).111The properties checked by HyPA [ref]12 are temporal, i.e., properties about the infinite execution of programs of the form while‚Äã(‚ä§,‚Ñô)whiletop‚Ñô\\text{\\color[rgb]{0.59375,0.25,0.02734375}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.59375,0.25,0.02734375}{while}}(\\top,\\mathbb{P}).\nTo make such programs analyzable in ForEx (which reasons about finite executions), we replaced the infinite loop with a loop that executes ‚Ñô‚Ñô\\mathbb{P} some fixed (but arbitrary) number of times.\nWe observe that ForEx can verify the instances significantly quicker.\nMoreover, we stress that ForEx solves a much more challenging problem as it analyzes the program fully automatically without any user intervention. Unno et al.¬† present an extension of constraint Horn clauses, called pfwCSP, that is able to express a range of relational properties (including ‚àÄ‚àó‚àÉ‚àósuperscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} properties).\nTheir custom pfwCSP solver (called PCSat) instantiates predicates with user-provided templates.\nWe compare PCSat and ForEx in Table 1(c).\nForEx can verify 6 out of the 8 ‚àÄ‚àó‚àÉ‚àósuperscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} instances.\nForEx currently does not support termination proofs for loops in existentially quantified programs (which are needed for TI_GNI_hTF and TS_GNI_hTF), whereas PCSat features loop variant templates and can thus reason about the termination of existentially quantified loops in isolation.\nIn the instances that ForEx can solve, it is much faster.\nWe conjecture that this is due to the fact that the constraints generated by ForEx can be solved directly by SMT solvers, whereas PCSat‚Äôs pfwCSP constraints first require a custom template instantiation. Programs whose variables have a finite domain (e.g., boolean) can be checked using explicit-state techniques developed for logics such as HyperLTL .\nWe verify GNI on variants of the four boolean programs from  with a varying number of bits.\nWe compare ForEx with the HyperLTL verifier HyPro , which converts a program into an explicit-state transition system.\nWe depict the results in Figure¬†5(a).\nWe observe that, with increasing bitwidth, the running time of explicit-state model-checking increases exponentially (note that the scale is logarithmic).\nIn contrast, ForEx can employ symbolic bitvector reasoning, resulting in orders of magnitude faster verification.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: We evaluate ForEx in various settings where FEHT-like specifications arise.\nWe compare with HyPA (a predicate-abstraction-based solver) [ref]12, PCSat (a constraint-based solver that relies on predicate templates) , and HyPro (a model-checker for ‚àÄ‚àó‚àÉ‚àósuperscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} properties in finite-state\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
