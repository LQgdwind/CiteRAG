      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Health Mentioning Classification of Tweets using Contrastive Adversarial Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial Training (AT) has been studied in many supervised classification tasks such as object detection  , object segmentation  and image classification[ref]10  . AT is the process of training the model to defend against malicious “attacks” and increase network robustness. AT involves the training of the model simultaneously with adversarial and clean examples. These malicious attacks are generated by perturbing the original input examples, so that the model predicts the wrong class label [ref]21  for them. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) proposed in[ref]10 is the method for generating adversarial examples for images. [ref]11 extends FGSM to NLP tasks such that it perturbs word embeddings instead of original text inputs and applies the method to both supervised and semi-supervised settings with Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) for the latter. Recent works propose to add perturbations to the attention mechanism of transformer-based methods  . Compared to single-step FGSM, [ref]21 applies the multi-step approach to generate adversarial examples that proves more effective as compared to single-step FGSM, however it increases the computational cost due to the inner loop that iteratively calculates the perturbations.  proposes free adversarial training, where the inner loop calculates the perturbation as well as gradients with respect to the model parameters and updates the model parameters.  also uses the free AT algorithm and adds gradient accumulation to achieve a larger effective batch. It also applies perturbations to word embeddings of LSTM and BERT-based models similar to [ref]11. In our work, we generate adversarial examples using one-step FGSM and perform contrastive learning with clean examples to learn the representations for the input examples.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Adversarial Training (AT) has been studied in many supervised classification tasks such as object detection  , object segmentation  and image classification[ref]10  .
