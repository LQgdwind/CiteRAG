      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Artistic Style Transfer with Conditional Adversarial Networks1footnote 11footnote 1\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe entire network consists of mainly three parameter spaces called a content encoder, style encoder, and decoder, as shown in Fig.¬†3. Content encoder and style encoder outputs latent vectors of content image and style image, respectively. The decoder uses those encoded features in the generative model to generate style transfer images. The discriminative model uses the content encoder and style encoder to generate adversarial losses to train. Content encoders take an image and output an encoded latent vector [of length 32]. An encoder is created by a set of sequential modules in the form of [Conv ‚Üíabsent‚Üí\\xrightarrow{} Batchnorm‚Üíabsent‚Üí\\xrightarrow{} ReLU]. The content encoder is trained on pairwise marginal loss in the training process. As an adoption model of StyleGAN  synthesis network here, we do not directly feed encoded features over the bottleneck to the decoder model. Instead, we feed features using skip connections from the content encoding models intermediate CNN modules to intermediate up-sampling CNN modules in the decoding model. In the training process, the content encoder is trained in the way a face-recognition model is being trained [ref]21. Instead of using triplet loss , here we are using the sum of pairwise marginal loss on the positive sample and negative sample in each training step. The content discriminator is fed by random sample pairs in the training process, where positive and negative pairs are randomly generated in a way each has a 0.5 probability. Also, instead of using semi-hard ranking loss functions like triplet loss, hard ranking loss functions, namely the pairwise marginal loss function in the discriminator make the gradient descent more robust. As stated above, we can guarantee that the content encoder model is trained to do expected tasks because the same encoder model is trained on content encoding vector classification by using a ranking loss function in the discriminator training step. Furthermore, we have assessed the accuracy of the content discriminator network and objective function on a separate data set. The major concern here is that encoder vectors must show locational proximity to indicate semantic similarity in the original style when transformed into UMAP, PCA base encoded vector spaces. For example, the pencil drawing‚Äôs encoder vector position in point cloud must have proximity to a pencil sketch image rather than an oil painting. In essence, the style encoder is trained to yield approximately similar encoding vectors for similar style images. The task appears to be like embedding a vector training process but defining an objective function to train and using that in an adversarial loss function causes many issues. Also, the use of classification objective function to train is not accurate in theory and empirically. As stated in CycleGAN paper [ref]8 ‚Äúbuilding yùë¶y, G:x‚Üíy:ùê∫absent‚Üíùë•ùë¶G:x\\xrightarrow{}y, mapping does not guarantee that an individual input x and an output y are paired up in a meaningful way- there are infinitely many mappings Gùê∫G‚Äù. On the other hand, a design objective as a dictionary  learning is not practically possible due to the complexity of the parameter space and scale. Because manipulating dictionary metrics in training and inference stages is computationally costly . The idea is to build an embedding vector training process without explicitly using an embedding vector. As well as the model architecture must support proper discriminative loss function to be trained in the adversarial phase. The concept of metrics learning in deep learning [ref]6 for similarity search is the optimal way to train Because, in theory, such a model uses sparse categorical cross-entropy as the objective function. As stated in the objective section, this objective makes encoding vector distribution estimates for each class so that their negative log-likelihood is as minimal as possible. In essence, this makes encoding vectors of the same class drop under the same distribution and achieve distribution clustering by preserving proximity. As stated in Deep-TEN  CNN models with residual connection from low level feature layers to high level feature layers are suitable for tasks like material and texture extraction. In  they have empirically proven this point by using the ResNet model to classify garments based on texture. However, the DensNet  model is a perfect candidate for this because it concatenates all features in previous modules, in the current module, and the transition layer is weighted between different layers to generate more complex features than features generated by ResNet  on a particular resolution. This makes the model have a much stronger gradient flow. Also, in  the width of the layer being proportional to the growth rate makes the feature extractor of the style encoder have to have a much smaller parameter space. Generator models are mainly a combination of content encoder, style encoder and decoder. Here the decoder model is a sequential set of up-sampling CNN modules like the U-Net with skip connection to content encoder sub-model. The network architecture is inspired by the StyleGAN  synthesis network. Instead of using a single mapping network  to generate features from the inputs here we implement two separate encoder models as shown in Fig.¬†3. The decoder sub-model in the generator starts from the latent vector space generated only by the style encoder. The generator model is fed by the low-level feature from the content encoder using skip connection. The targethere is to make decoder sensitivity style encoded high-level features while using low-level features to generate content on the image. Therefore, the final image will not be affected by the exact shapes and colors of the content image and what objects are present in the style image.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: intermediate CNN modules to intermediate up-sampling CNN modules in the decoding model.
