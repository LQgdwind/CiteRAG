      "content": "Paper Title: WDiscOOD: Out-of-Distribution Detection via Whitened Linear Discriminant Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning models are typically designed with a closed-world\nassumption [ref]46, where test data is assumed to be drawn from the same distribution as the training data.\nWithout any built-in mechanism to distinguish novel concepts, deep neural networks are prone to generate incorrect answers with high confidence when presented with out-of-distribution (OOD) data.\nSuch a misleading decision could result in catastrophic consequences in applications, which makes the deep neural network hard to deploy in the open world.\nTo address this issue, significant research efforts have been devoted to the\nproblem of OOD detection, which aims to establish a robust method for\nidentifying when the testing data is “unknown.” Specifically, OOD detection requires establishing a scoring function to\nseparate ID and OOD data.\nDesigned for deep visual classifiers, the majority of works examine\nactivation patterns from the classification layer.\nFor example, a popular baseline is to leverage the maximum posterior\nprobability output of a softmax classifier to indicate ID-ness , assuming that the network is more confident with its decision for ID data.\nThe idea is enhanced by neural network calibration techniques   , which aim to align network confidence with actual likelihood. The technique has been shown to improve OOD detection performance.\nOther classifier-based scores explore unnormalized posterior probabilities\nknown as logits  , and norms of gradients\nbackpropagated from the classification layer  . Recently, ViM  argues that both class-dependent and class-agnostic information can potentially facilitate the OOD detection task.\nBased on the idea, it designs a scoring function by mapping the\nfeature-space principle component residual to the logit space.\nDespite the great performance achieved, ViM still requires supervision to\ntrain the classification layer.\nMeanwhile, advances in pretraining large-scale visual encoders using\ncontrastive learning techniques  [ref]27 have occured in recent\nyears.\nThese methods no longer rely on jointly training deep visual encoders with task heads, but instead formulate objectives directly in the feature space to produce high-quality visual representations.\nThe learnt encoder can be applied to downstream tasks with little or no fine-tuning required 6 9,\nsuggesting a new paradign for addressing computer vision problems.\nWhile it is non-trivial to adopt classifier-based OOD detection methods directly to visual encoders, applying feature space methods is straightforward.\nFor example, SSD 8 applies Mahalanobis 1 distance in\nthe contrastive feature space, and demonstrates superior performance\ncompared to a typical classification visual encoder. In this work, we aim to reason about both class-specific and class-agnostic information solely within the feature space.\nTo achieve this, we utilize Whitened Linear Discriminant Analysis (WLDA) to project visual features into two subspaces: a discriminative subspace and a residual subspace.\nThe former contains compact class-discriminative signals, while the latter constrains shared information.\nWe refer to these subspaces as Whitened Discriminative Subspace (WD) and Whitened Discriminative Residual Subspace (WDR), respectively.\nGiven the compactness of the WD space, we detect anomalies by measuring the distance to the nearest class center.\nConversely, in the WDR space where in-distribution (ID) classes are entangled, we examine the distance to the centroid of all training data as an OOD indicator.\nThe final proposed scoring function unifies the information from both subspaces by computing a weighted sum of the scores in each space. While subspace techniques for OOD detection have been explored previously  , our approach differs significantly. Assuming ID data lies on a low-dimensional manifold, existing approaches measure the residual magnitude as an indicator for OOD-ness 4.\nIn contrast, we assume the residual space captures rich class-shared information.\nFurthermore, while past literature examines the residual to principles  or classifier weights ,\nwe explore the remaining information to discriminative components.\nThis design enables us to jointly reason with both discriminative and residual information without relying on task heads, which is more applicable to stand-alone visual encoders. As shown in Fig. 1, WDiscOOD achieves superior performance on large-scale ImageNet-1k benchmark compared to a wide range of baselines,\nunder both classic CNN and recent Visual Transformer (ViT) architectures.\nIn addition, our method surpasses other feature-space approaches in distinguishing novel concepts from stand-alone contrastive encoders, involving Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) model [ref]27 and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model 6.\nWhat’s more, we discover that the Whitened Discriminative Residual Space is\nmore effective in identifying anomalous responses compared to other subspace techniques or even a subset of classifier-based scoring methods,\nverifying the importance of the class-agnostic feature component for the task. In summary, our contribution involves: A new OOD detection score, based on WLDA, that jointly considers\nclass-discriminative and class-agnostic information solely within the\nfeature space. A new insight into the effectiveness of the Whitened Discriminative Residual Subspace space, which\ncaptures the shared information stripped of discriminative signals, for\ndetecting anomalies in OOD samples. New state-of-the-art results achieved by our method on the\nlarge-scale ImageNet OOD detection benchmark, for various visual\nclassifiers (CNN and ViT) as well as contrastive visual encoders (SupCon\nand CLIP).\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: Deep learning models are typically designed with a closed-world\nassumption [ref]46, where test data is assumed to be drawn from the same distribution as the training data.\nWithout any built-in mechanism to distinguish novel concepts, deep neural networks are prone to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
