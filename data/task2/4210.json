      "content": "Paper Title: Curious Exploration via Structured World Models Yields Zero-Shot Object Manipulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrediction error [ref]5 [ref]6 , novelty and Bayesian surprise   , learning progress [ref]5  , empowerment   and count-based metrics  [ref]27 are among the popular intrinsic reward signal definitions used in RL. These intrinsic rewards are either used to aid exploration in challenging tasks with sparse task rewards or in a task-agnostic setup where they are the only rewards. Algorithms using the task-agnostic setting follow two routes to solve downstream tasks:\n(i) they re-label the collected data during intrinsic exploration with the downstream task reward and perform offline RL   [ref]27 or\n(ii) they use snapshots of the exploration policy for bootstrapping and fine-tune them on downstream tasks  .\nThe first variant does not require additional interaction with the environment, however, additional training of a new policy is still necessary. In addition, offline RL struggles with the distribution shift, while we show that a good world model can generalize better.\nThe second variant suffers from another inherent issue: the emerging behaviors of the exploration policy are lost during training.\nAlthough Groth et al.  address this problem by snapshotting and performing hierarchical RL, this is more of a bandaid solution.\nMany intrinsically motivated learning systems use a goal-achieving setting with predefined goal spaces     or auxiliary tasks .\nThe differences in the existing paradigms are highlighted in Table 1. Methods such as ICM [ref]6 rely on retrospective intrinsic motivation (here prediction error), i.e. the agent has to already be in the next state to assess how novel that state is. In order to accommodate planning for multi-step intrinsic motivation signals into the future, we need a way to predict them. Haber et al. , for instance, do so by learning a loss model to predict the prediction error at future time steps.\nAnother line of research, including our method, uses the disagreement of an ensemble of world models to estimate the predictive information gain as the intrinsic motivation measure  .\nPlan2Explore  shares similarities to our approach in the task-agnostic exploration phase, using multi-step ensemble disagreement as intrinsic reward. It works with a latent dynamics prediction model and has been applied to domains with image observations. However, Plan2Explore does not use structured world models and lacks mechanisms to achieve combinatorial generalization that is beneficial for sample-efficient exploration in object manipulation tasks. Several works showcase improved dynamics prediction performance in environments with interacting entities using structured world models   .\nKipf et al.  uses a GNN to learn the latent transition dynamics in simple manipulation tasks with 2D shapes and 3D blocks from images. However, they use an object-factorized action space and do not tackle exploration but rely on an external dataset.\nSanchez-Gonzalez et al.  applies GNNs to learn the dynamics of physical bodies, where the entities correspond to joints, also without active exploration.\nDriess et al.  uses GNNs and NERFs to obtain object-centric representations from images and RRT planners.\nBiza et al.  also utilizes the combinatorial generalization of structured world models to achieve zero-shot task generalization. However, the policy uses parameterized high-level actions and the world model is learned on an offline expert dataset, thus sidestepping the exploration challenge.\nOutside the model-based paradigm, Li et al.  achieves block stacking in Construction using a GNN policy, attention and tailored learning curriculum.\nIn contrast, we use GNNs for computing intrinsic rewards and online planning. Watters et al.  deploy curious exploration with retrospective prediction error as an intrinsic reward in an object-centric setting with image inputs and a pre-trained vision model for object discovery, but without object-object interactions. In Seitzer et al. , an object-centric causal action-influence is used as an intrinsic reward to improve sample efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Prediction error [ref]5 [ref]6 , novelty and Bayesian surprise   , learning progress [ref]5  , empowerment   and count-based metrics  [ref]27 are among the popular intrinsic reward signal definitions used in RL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
