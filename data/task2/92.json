      "content": "Paper Title: Sentiment Analysis Using Averaged Weighted Word Vector Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a text, especially in order to determine whether the writer’s attitude toward a particular topic, product, etc., is positive, negative, or neutral. A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text in the document or sentence. As mentioned in Task 5 of Semeval 2016, we use the Web to share our experiences about products, services, or travel destinations . Texts that provide online feedback, such as reviews, comments, etc., are important for consumer decision-making  and customer comments create valuable sources that can help companies measure satisfaction and improve their products or services. Sentiment Analysis (SA) includes every aspect of Natural Language Processing such as entity recognition, coreference resolution, negation handling, etc.  and as Cambria et al. mention, “it requires a deep understanding of the explicit and implicit, regular and irregular, and syntactic and semantic language rules”. The several workshops and conferences focusing on SA-related shared tasks. Some of them are (NTCIR; TAC2013[ref]7; SemEval-2013 Task 2[ref]8; SemEval-2014 Task 4; SemEval-2015 Task 120; SemEval-2016 Task 61; SemWebEval 20142; GESTALT-20143; SentiRuEval4. These competitions provide training datasets. Currently, most of the available SA-related datasets (Socher et al5; Ganu et al6) are monolingual and generally focus on English texts. Also, some of them provide multilingual datasets (Klinger and Cimiano 7; Jiménez-Zafra et al.8) that are useful to enable the development and testing of cross-lingual methods 9. Besides these, some other datasets exist, such as Stanford IMDB Reviews0 or Yelp dataset 1, and some SA studies were made by using these datasets. In this work, we focus on a comprehensive analysis of SA studies, and we are very close to the state-of-the-art results (2, 3). In this work, we make a comprehensive analysis of some existing methods to produce semantic polarities from the reviews from different domains, and we propose two new approaches to produce semantic polarities. Our approach uses weighted word vectors to create feature sets. For this purpose, we used word2vec4 and glove5 methods. We ensembled and compared our approaches with existing approaches and analyzed experimental results from domains IMBD reviews, Semeval 2016 Task Dataset, and Yelp Restaurant reviews. We are very close to state-of-the-art performance accuracies with our approaches. We provide the source code and prepared datasets for the model as well as trained word vectors at https://github.com/alierkan/Sentiment-Analysis. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents previous works related to sentiment analysis. In Section 3, we describe our model. In Section 4, we describe the data sets used during experimentation. The results are then presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the final conclusions and potential future lines of this work.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: explicit and implicit, regular and irregular, and syntactic and semantic language rules”.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
