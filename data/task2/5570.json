      "content": "Paper Title: Emotion Prediction Oriented method with Multiple Supervisions for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo verify the effectiveness of the proposed EPO-ECPE, we compare it with 13 existing methods. We summarize these methods as follows: Inter-EC is a pipeline model that extracts the emotion clauses and cause clauses separately and then extracts the pairs with causality based on the relative position between the emotion clause and cause clause . E2EECPE takes the ECPE as a link prediction task and learns to make a link from the emotion clause to the cause clause, which means if there is a link between the emotion clause and cause clause, they can form an effective emotion-cause pair [ref]14. PairGCN proposes a Pair Graph Convolutional Network model for the dependency among candidate pairs in the local neighborhood and considers the difference of dependency relations type in the propagation of contextual information . LAE-MANN uses the multi-level attention mechanism based on LSTM or BERT encoders, which is denoted as LML and LMB, respectively . ECPE-2D uses a 2D-Transformer representation scheme to encode the inter-pair interactions under the window-constrained and cross-road 2D-Transformer to obtain the abundant information . SLSN-U detects and matches the emotion clause and cause clause simultaneously with the local search for extracting emotion-cause pairs . RANKCP  proposes a unified framework to extract emotion-cause pairs from the ranking perspective by scoring the candidate pairs with consideration of dependency relations among clauses. ECPE-MLL is a multi-label joint framework, which contains the cause extraction corresponding to the specified emotion clause and the emotion extraction corresponding to the specified cause clause . Transition views the ECPE as a procedure of parsing-like directed graph construction and generates the directed graph with labeled edges based on a sequence of actions . Tagging is a sequence labeling method, which takes the relative distance between the emotion clause and cause clause as the tag to ensure the emotion and the corresponding causes can be extracted simultaneously . IE-CNN-CRF takes the emotional type as a part of the labeling tag to distinguish the cause clause under different emotional types to solve the extraction of multiple emotion-cause pairs in the document . UTOS views the emotion-cause pair extraction task as a unified sequence labeling problem. It divides the labeling tags into a content part for emotion/cause identification and a pairing part for clause pairing. Additionally, UTOS integrates the information of the target clause, global context, and former decoded label into an end-to-end unified sequence labeling framework . Refinement proposes a multi-task sequence tagging framework, which encodes the distances between the emotion clause and cause clause into a novel tagging scheme to extract emotions with the associated causes simultaneously. It uses the prediction distribution of both auxiliary tasks as an inductive bias to refine the pair tagging distribution [ref]8.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: task and learns to make a link from the emotion clause to the cause clause, which means if there is a link between the emotion clause and cause clause, they can form an effective emotion-cause pair [ref]14.
