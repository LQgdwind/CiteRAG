      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe last decade or so has seen a surge in the performance of machine learning models, whether in supervised learning [ref]15 or RL  . These achievements rely on deep neural models that are often described as black-box   , trading interpretability for performance. In many real world tasks, predictive models can hide undesirable biases (see e.g. Sec. 2 in  for a list of such occurrences) hindering trustworthiness towards AIs. Gaining trust is one of the primary goals of interpretability (see Sec. 2.4 of  for a literature review) along with informativeness requests, i.e. the ability for a model to provide information on why a given decision was taken. The computational complexity of such informativeness requests can be measured objectively, and [ref]5 showed that multi-layer neural networks cannot answer these requests in polynomial time, whereas several of those are in polynomial time for linear models and DT. In contrast to deep neural models, DTs provide a global look at the learned model and transparently reveal which features of the input are used in taking a particular decision. This is referred to as global  or model-based  interpretability, as opposed to post-hoc interpretability  . Even though DTs are globally intepretable, they have also been used in prior work for post-hoc interpretability of deep neural models, e.g. in image classification  or RL . The latter work provides another motivation for DTs, as their simpler nature allowed to make a stability analysis of the resulting controllers and provided theoretical guarantees of their efficacy. In the 54 papers reviewed in , over 25%percent2525\\% use DTs as the interpretable model and over 50%percent5050\\% the more general class of decision rules. DTs are a common interpretable model and it is thus important to improve their associated learning algorithms. However, interpretability of DTs is hindered if the tree grows too large. The quantification of what is too large might vary greatly depending on the desired type of simulability, that is whether we want individual paths from root to leaf to be short or the total size of the tree to be small [16, p. 13]. In both cases, an algorithmic mechanism to control these tree metrics and to manage the inevitable trade-off between interpretability and performance is necessary. One of the main challenges for learning DTs is that it is a discrete optimization problem that cannot, a priori, be solved via gradient descent. Algorithms such as CART  build a DT by greedily maximizing the information gain—a performance related criteria. Interpretability can then be controlled by fixing a maximal tree depth, or by using post-processing pruning algorithms  2. Unfortunately, this two-step process provides no guaranty that the resulting DT is achieving an optimal interpretability-performance trade-off. An alternative way to learn DTs, that inherently takes into account the interpretability-performance trade-off, is the recently proposed framework of Iterative Bounding Markov Decision Processes (IBMDPs) . An IBMDP extends a base MDP state space with feature bounds that encode the current knowledge about the input, and the action space with information gathering actions that refine the feature bounds by performing the same test a DT would do: comparing a feature value to a threshold. The reward function is also augmented with a penalty to take the cost of information gathering action into account. The IBMDP reward function encodes an interpretability-performance trade-off: an agent learns when to add decision nodes or when to make a prediction. In this work we study the IBMDP setting when the base MDPs encode supervised classification tasks. By doing so, we are able to analyse the optimality of policies learned with RL with respect to the IBDMP reward function. Thus our work studies RL frameworks to learn DTs that trade-off between interpretability (depth of the DT) and performance (accuracy of the DT). After a literature review and the introduction of our notations in Section 2 and 3, our work continues as follows:\nSection 4: we present a simple toy task to benchmark RL algorithms solving IBMDPs and analyse causes of failure of existing RL algorithms solving IBMDPs. \nSection 5: we present a new RL framework with optimality guarantees w.r.t the IBDMP objective. \nSection 6: we apply this framework to UCI [ref]11 supervised classification datasets.
