Interestingly, it is observed that, despite of having a discrepancy of the pricing behaviour in the early stage of market, the value of NFT was continuously on rise. Later, Goldberg et al.  identified that the pricing of the NFTs, which has not been considered in , is closely linked with the location of the parcels, particularly the locations close to the center part or have some memorable addresses tend to have higher price. Further, Christopher Yencha  considered spatial characteristics of Decentraland parcels to provide an evidence of the effects of locations on the price, similar to the real estate market. To map the market trends and the trade network after NFT market experienced a record sale in 2021, Nadini et al.  used statistical properties of the market and showed how visual features and sales history are good predictors for the price of Decentraland as well as other NFTs. As cryptocurrency pricing behaviour is an important factor for the market of NFTs, the authors in  presented a wavelet coherence analysis between NFT pricing and cryptocurency. Observably, a spillover index showed only limited volatility transmission effect between cryptocurrency and NFTs. Rachel Schonbaum in  envisioned the possibility of improved market efficiency in Decentraland’s LAND market, which in turn has positive implications for NFT usage on the Metaverse. According to them, the NFT-world is likely to change in the next decade, bringing a lot of potential for positive changes in the near future. Few significant research attempts demonstrating the impact of social media on the pricing of popular NFT’s, including Decentraland is reported in  [ref]29 . Christian Pinto-Gutiérrez et al.  showed how the change in cryptocurrency market (Bitcoin and Ether) draw attention of the investors of NFT’s, such as Decentraland and Cryptopunk, by examining the data of Google search trends. A time series analysis on Google trends data of cryptocurrency prices for NFT’s is presented in [ref]29. Junliang Luo et al.  performed tweet keyword analysis based on Decentraland along with other top 18 NFT projects, demonstrating the impact of feature word extraction to influence the price of NFTs. To predict NFT performance by solely relying on images and description, the authors in  proposed a multimodal representation based learning by considering Decentraland transactions data along with other NFTs. S.C.Brunet et al.  provided a detailed study to show how the factors related to the revenue-generating potential of the Decentraland parcels are more likely to play a role in its pricing, rather the user traffic on the parcel. J.Luo et al.  analysed user behavior in Decentraland using graph analysis technique, along with an examination of the user traffic and transactions. This is observed that interaction in virtual world is different from the traditional social-media platform. Majority of the interaction is based on economic incentive, rather than socializing. Some people even may not wish to join due to the lack of knowledge about blockchain technology.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: potential for positive changes in the near future.
