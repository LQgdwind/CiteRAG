Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Demystifying Platform Requirements for Diverse LLM Inference Use Cases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite the promise of being an exciting paradigm towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), LLMs still suffer from the obstacles of factual hallucination    , incomplete, outdated or incorrect knowledge [ref]73, and the lack of domain-specific knowledge  [ref]118. Enhancing LLMs with external knowledge through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proven effective against all such challenges    [ref]80 as mentioned in . Before prefill, RAG takes an input query embedding, compares it against a large vector database using KNN search, and augments the query with the k most similar vectors retrieved from the database. As the size of these knowledge databases can be of the order of trillions , several ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) techniques including IVF-PQ, HNSW, SONG, and CAGRA have been proposed over the years that trade-off search latency and memory footprint with recall accuracy. The key implication of using RAG in LLM serving is a significant increase in the input prompt size. This results in higher Time Per Output Token (TPOT) and larger KV caches. We study these implications in detail in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [73]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]73: promise of being an exciting paradigm towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), LLMs still suffer from the obstacles of factual hallucination    , incomplete, outdated or incorrect knowledge [ref]73, and the lack of domain-specific knowledge  [ref]118.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
