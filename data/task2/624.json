      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Periodic Averaging: A Practical Approach to Reducing Communication in Distributed Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany techniques have been proposed to reduce the communication overhead in distributed training. Gradient Compression. \nA popular approach to reducing communication overhead of distributed training is to perform compression of the gradients¬†[ref]52[ref]53.\nFor example, Wen et al.¬† propose to quantize the gradients to three numerical levels, and thus only two bits are transmitted for a gradient value instead of 32 bits.\nLin et al.¬†[ref]52 claim that by combining multiple compression techniques, they can achieve 270x to 600x compression ratio without losing accuracy.\nStrom¬† proposed to only send gradient components larger than a predefined threshold.\nAji et al.¬†[ref]53 presented a heuristic approach to truncate the smallest gradient components and only communicate the remaining large ones.\nAlistarh et al.¬† proposed a quantization method named QSGD and gave its convergence rate for both convex and non-convex optimization. Despite their popularity in research, these compression-based approaches yield small practical gains on HPC clusters with fast connections due to several reasons.\nFirst, gradient compression commonly assume that the model parameters are maintained by one or multiple parameter servers¬†, and they cannot be easily combined with bandwidth-optimal Allreduce, which is a more efficient way to aggregate data from multiple machines¬†[ref]56.\nSecond, these quantization-based methods usually change the convergence property of SGD as some information of the gradients is lost in compression¬†.\nThird, the compression or quantization procedure itself incurs computation overheads, which can defeat the benefits of saved communication time, especially when the interconnect is fast. Periodic Averaging SGD.\nPeriodic averaging has been widely used to reduce the communication overhead in distributed training¬†.\nThe idea is to simply perform the synchronization only once in a few iteration.\nEarlier works demonstrate that periodic averaging can be incorporated into asynchronous SGD¬†.\nDownpour SGD¬† maintains the model parameters on each node locally;\nafter kùëòk iterations of local updates, the change of the local model parameters is sent to the parameter server asynchronously, and the parameter serve updates the global model parameter according to the received parameter changes.\nZhang et al.¬† improve Downpour SGD by presenting EASGD which simulates an elastic force to link the model parameters on different nodes with the global model parameters.\nThey show that EASGD with periodic communication has guaranteed convergence on quadratic and strongly-convex optimization if the hyperparamters are properly configured.\nRecently, Zhou et al.¬† prove that O‚Äã(1/M‚ÄãK)ùëÇ1ùëÄùêæO(1/\\sqrt{MK}) convergence rate can be achieved by constant periodic averaging SGD for non-convex optimization.\nHowever, they claim that it\nis hard to determine the optimal period in practice because it depends on\ncertain unknown quantities associated with the objective function.\nIt is also unclear from their analysis how one can adjust the averaging period to achieve the\noptimal convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: the communication overhead in distributed training.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
