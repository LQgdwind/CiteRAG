      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Hypergraph Network for Trust Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe baseline methods can be divided into three categories, including traditional network embedding methods, trust prediction methods, and hypergraph-based methods. By comparing our trust prediction model with these three categories of methods, we can provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of our model. To keep a controlled environment and fair comparison, we utilize the same input features of all the models. As the network embedding methods and\nhypergraph-based methods are directly relevant to our model, we add fully connected layers and the ReLU function to enable them to predict trust. In detail, the baselines can be listed as follows: Traditional network embedding methods: GAT 0: GAT is a deep learning model for graph-structured data, which employs a self-attention mechanism based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It can weigh and aggregate features of neighbor nodes, which can effectively capture the relevance between nodes. SGC 1: SGC is a variant of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). It simplifies the architecture by removing nonlinear activation functions and collapsing the weight matrices between consecutive layers, which speeds up the training process. For this group of baselines, we can investigate the performance of our method in trust prediction in different graph embedding methods. Trust prediction methods: Guardian : Guardian incorporates information from the structure of social networks into its GCN model to assess the trustworthiness of relationships. AtNE-Trust : AtNE-Trust employs auto-encoders and a feature fusion unit to integrate user attributes and trust network structures, thereby enhancing the prediction of trust relationships. KGTrust 2: KGTtrust combines a discriminative convolutional layer with a knowledge-augmented GNN to assess trust relationships. For this group of baselines, we can investigate the accuracy of different models in trust prediction.\n Hypergraph-based methods: UniGCN [ref]42: UniGCN extends the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to accommodate hypergraph structures. UniGAT [ref]42: UniGAT expands the Graph Attention Network (GAT) model to function with hypergraph structures. HGNN+ : HGNN+ employs a trainable weight matrix to integrate correlations across various modalities or types, capturing high-order interactions through hypergraph convolution in the spatial domain. For this group of baselines, we can investigate the effectiveness of our proposed method in handling complex and high-order correlations in trust prediction compared to the use of existing hypergraph structures.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: with a knowledge-augmented GNN to assess trust relationships.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
