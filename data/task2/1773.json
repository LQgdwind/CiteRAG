      "content": "Paper Title: Any Part of Bayesian Network Structure Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we will propose an efficient version of APSL by using feature selection. APSL uses a standard MB discovery algorithm, MMMB or HITON-MB, for MB discovery. However, the standard PC discovery algorithms, MMPC¬† and HITON-PC¬† (used by MMMB and HITON-MB, respectively), need to perform an exhaustive subset search within the currently selected variables as conditioning sets for PC discovery, and thus they are computationally expensive or even prohibitive when the size of the PC set of the target becomes large. Feature selection is a common dimensionality reduction technique and plays an essential role in data analytics¬†[ref]31  .\nExisting feature selection methods can be broadly categorized into embedded methods, wrapper methods, and filter methods¬†[ref]33. Since filter feature selection methods are fast and independent of any classifiers, they have attracted more attentions. It has been proven in our previous work¬† that some filter feature selection methods based on mutual information prefer the PC of the target variable. Furthermore, these methods use pairwise comparisons¬† (i.e., unconditional independence tests) to remove false positives with less correlations, they can find the potential PC of the target variable without searching for conditioning set, and thus improving the efficiency of PC discovery. Thus, to address the problem exists in APSL for PC discovery, we use a filter feature selection method based on mutual information instead of the standard PC discovery algorithm. However, the feature selection method we use cannot find spouses for edge orientations. Because the feature selection method uses pairwise comparisons rather than conditional independence tests¬†, it cannot find the separating sets which is the key to finding spouses¬†. Standard PC discovery algorithms find separating sets to make a target variable and the other variables conditionally independent, only the variables in the PC of the target are always conditionally dependent on the target¬†. Thus, standard PC discovery algorithms find PC and separating sets simultaneously. However, these algorithms are computationally expensive in finding separating sets since they need to find the separating sets of all variables independent of the target. Instead, it is only necessary to find the separating sets of the variables in the PC of each variable in the target‚Äôs PC set, as spouses of the target variable exist only there. Thus in this subsection, based on using feature selection for PC discovery, we propose an efficient Markov blanket discovery algorithm for spouses discovery, called MB-FS (Markov Blanket discovery by Feature Selection). Moreover, we use MB-FS instead of the standard MB discovery algorithm for MB discovery in APSL to improve the efficiency, and we call this new any part of BN structure learning algorithm APSL-FS (APSL using Feature Selection), an efficient version of APSL using feature selection. In the following, we will go into details about using feature selection for PC discovery and MB discovery, respectively. (1) PC discovery: We choose a well-established feature selection method, Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF)¬†, for PC discovery because the size of the PC of each variable in a BN is not fixed. FCBF specifies a threshold Œ¥ùõø\\delta to control the number of potential PC of the target variable, instead of specifying the number of the PC in advance. As illustrated in Algorithm 2, FCBF first finds a potential PC of the target variable from the entire variable set whose correlations with the target are higher than the threshold (Lines 1-6). Then, FCBF uses pairwise comparisons to remove false positives in the potential PC to get the true PC (Lines 7-20). (2) MB discovery: As illustrated in Algorithm 3, MB-FS first uses FCBF to find the PC of the target variable TùëáT, and uses FCBF to find the PC of each variable in the TùëáT‚Äôs PC as the candidate spouses of TùëáT. Then, MB-FS finds the separating set from the subsets of the PC of TùëáT, to make TùëáT and the variable YùëåY in the candidate spouses are conditionally independent. Finally, if TùëáT and YùëåY are conditionally dependent given the union of the separating set and their common child XùëãX, YùëåY is a spouse of TùëáT owing to Theorem 2.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: expensive or even prohibitive when the size of the PC set of the target becomes large.
