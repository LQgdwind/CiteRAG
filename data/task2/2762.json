Towards Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks via Confidence Calibration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks.\nModern GCNs mimics CNNs to learn the local and global structural patterns of graphs through designed convolution and readout functions.  generalizes CNNs to graph signal based on the spectrum of graph Laplacian. ChebNet  uses Chebyshev polynomials to approximate the KùêæK-order localized graph filters and GCN  further employs the 1-order simplification of the Chebyshev filter. GAT  utilizes attention mechanisms to adaptively learn aggregation weights. GraphSAGE  uses various ways of pooling for aggregation.\n introduces self-training to GCNs and  proposes a multi-stage self-supervised (M3S) self-training algorithm of GCNs. Both  and  focus on the few-shot learning and neither has ever explored self-training with higher label rates in GCNs. More works on GNNs can be found in surveys  , however, to the best of our knowledge, current GNNs have not considered the confidence calibration. Confidence Calibration. Confidence calibration has been studied for a long time in CV and NLP [ref]12  [ref]25    [ref]40 .\n[ref]12 discovers modern neural networks are poorly calibrated and study factors influencing calibration. Platt scaling  is a simple post-hoc calibration method for binary models, which transforms the logit using scalar parameters. Temperature scaling is the simplest multi-class extension of Platt scaling and matrix and vector scaling are another two extensions of platt scaling.\n[ref]40 proposes Mix-n-Match calibration strategies which mix parameter methods with non-parameter methods.\n[ref]25 explores the non-linear space for post-hoc calibration function using a neural network.\nMoreover,  points out GNNs can be miscalibrated in the supervised scenario and mainly focus on miscalibration originated from the imbalanced class distribution.\nHowever, none of them have considered the confidence calibration in GNNs on the common semi-supervised scenario.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: , however, to the best of our knowledge, current GNNs have not considered the confidence calibration.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
