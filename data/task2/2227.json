      "content": "Paper Title: Fingerprinting Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ref]1 are used in various applications, e.g., image and audio synthesis  , attribute editing [ref]4, text-to-image translation .\nA well-trained GAN model (especially the generator) is regarded as the core Intellectual Property (IP) due to two reasons . First, to cope with complicated tasks and datasets, modern GAN models are designed to be more sophisticated. For instance, BigGAN  has 8.32 billion floating-point operations (BFLOPs) while SAGAN  has 9.18 BFLOPs.\nTraining such a production-level GAN model usually requires a large amount of computing resources, valuable data, and human expertise. Second, GAN models are adopted in many applications with huge commercial values, such as image/video filters in TikTok , anime character maker MakeGirlsMoe , and Beauty Cam . Therefore, the model vendors have strong motivations to protect such assets, and prevent the malicious model buyers or customers from abusing, copying or redistributing the models without authorization. Existing IP protection methods for deep learning models can be roughly divided into two categories. (1) Watermarking: the model owner embeds carefully-crafted watermarks into the target model by a parameter regularizer  or backdoor data poisoning    . Later, the watermarks can be extracted from the model parameters or output as the ownership evidence.\n(2) Fingerprinting: the model owner generates unique sample-label pairs that can exclusively and exactly characterize the target model (Fig. 1(a)). Common approaches    0 1 adopt adversarial examples to identify such fingerprint examples. Compared to watermarking, fingerprinting does not need to make modifications on the target model. Hence, it can better preserve the performance of the target model  1. It also shows more applicability and convenience, especially for some scenarios where the model owner does not have the right or capability to modify the models. Due to these advantages, fingerprinting is a more promising method for IP protection of deep learning models, and we focus on this strategy in this paper. However, simply extending prior fingerprinting solutions from classification models to GAN models can cause some issues.\n(1) Persistency: adversarial examples against GANs are more sensitive to the changes in the model or input-output. So it is easier for an adversary to invalidate such fingerprints by slightly transforming the models or data samples. (2) Stealthiness: the adversarial output from a GAN model can be more anomalous than the adversarial label from a classification model, giving the model thief opportunities to detect the fingerprint and then manipulate the verification results. Experiments in Section VI quantitatively demonstrate these limitations. It is necessary to design a fingerprinting scheme dedicated to GAN models. We propose the first fingerprinting scheme to protect the IP of image-to-image translation GAN models. The key innovation of our scheme is a composite deep learning model constructed from the target GAN model and a classifier (shown in Fig. 1(b)). Specifically, to make the ownership verification stealthier, we aim to design a set of fingerprints, whose input samples and output samples from the target model are visually indistinguishable from normal ones. With this requirement, it seems impossible for the model owner to detect the plagiarism, as prior solutions require the output of the plagiarized model has large divergence from the ground truth. To address this issue, we propose to employ a classifier that can accurately identify the output from the plagiarized model, and assign a unique label to it.\nThe introduction of the classifier can also enhance the persistency of the fingerprints: although the model owner is not permitted to change the target GAN model, he can freely modify the classifier to better recognize the fingerprint output.\nThis benefit cannot be achieved in prior solutions    0. Based on this scheme, we provide three concrete designs that can practically protect the IP of GAN models. In the first method (CFP-AE), the model owner can produce a set of fingerprint samples (i.e., verification samples), whose outputs from the target model are adversarial examples exclusively for the owner’s classifier. In the second and third methods (CFP-iBDv1, CFP-iBDv2), the target model’s responses to the fingerprint samples are designed to be invisible backdoor samples 2, which can activate the backdoor embedded in the classifier to produce unique labels. We leverage the Triplet Loss 3 and fine-grained categorization 4 5 techniques to design novel loss functions, which can implant the backdoor into the classifier for better security and efficiency. We perform comprehensive assessments to evaluate our fingerprinting scheme. Specifically, drawing on the core idea of the previous cryptography-based watermarking framework for classification models , we theoretically prove that our scheme satisfies four important security requirements: functionality-preserving, non-trivial ownership, unremovability and unforgeability.\nAdditionally, extensive evaluations over three state-of-the-art GAN models (AttGAN [ref]4, StarGAN 6, STGAN 7) show that the fingerprints from our methods perform much better than prior strategies in identifying the target GAN models, and maintaining higher robustness against various model and image transformations.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ref]1 are used in various applications, e.g., image and audio synthesis  , attribute editing [ref]4, text-to-image translation .\nA well-trained GAN model (especially the generator) is regarded as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
