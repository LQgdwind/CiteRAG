      "content": "Paper Title: G3SR: Global Graph Guided Session-based Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we first review traditional methods for session-based recommendation, in comparison with deep learning-based methods. We then introduce the pre-training technique and finish this section by discussing the difference between the proposed method and previous methods. Traditional methods. For the general recommendation problem, Matrix Factorization (MF)  [ref]17   is one of the most popular solutions. MF aims to decompose the user-item rating matrix and assumes that users and items can, therefore, be mapped into a common latent space where they can be directly compared. This method doesn’t fit the session-based recommendation problem well since session data are anonymous and the rating matrix can be extremely sparse if we treat each session as a user. Item-based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)    is an alternative since it only relies on item similarities which can be calculated based on the co-occurrence in the session data. However, IBCF fails to capture the sequential relations because it recommends the next item merely based on the last one. To model sequential data, some Markov chains (MC) based methods have been developed   . Shani et al. use Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to solve the problem , which can generate recommendations based on the learned transition probability matrix. Rendle et al. propose the Factorizing Personalized Markov Chains model (FPMC)  that combines the power of MF and MC to simultaneously model users’ general interests and sequential behaviour patterns. Nevertheless, these methods suffer a huge drawback that the assumption on conditional independence is too strong. Deep learning-based methods. With the rise of deep learning, an increasing number of research works begin to use deep learning techniques to solve recommendation problems   . Hidasi et al. first define the session-based recommendation problem which aims to recommend the next item based on an anonymous session and they propose the GRU4Rec model  based on recurrent neural networks. Based on GRU4Rec, Tan et al. further enhance the performance by employing a few useful techniques such as data augmentation and knowledge distillation . To better manage sequential behaviours and user’s main purpose simultaneously, Li et al. propose NARM , which uses the encoder-decoder architecture enhanced by the attention mechanism. Later, Liu et al. propose STAMP  based on simple MLP network, which is capable of capturing users’ long-term interests as well as their short-term attention. As graph neural networks have achieved success in many different tasks, they have also been used in solving different recommendation problems    . Wu et al. first employ graph neural networks to solve the session-based recommendation problem. They propose SR-GNN  which models session sequences as graph-structured data and use a graph neural network to capture complex item transitions. Xu et al. further propose a graph contextualized self-attention model (GC-SAN) , which enhances the graph neural network with a self-attention readout module. Qiu et al. improve the graph neural network by considering the inherent order of item transitions, where a weight graph attention network is used to learn item embeddings for each item in a session . More recently, there are two contemporary research works that also study the usage of global information [ref]34 [ref]35. Qiu et al. propose the Full Graph Neural Network (FGNN) [ref]34 along with a concept named Broadly Connected Session (BCS) graph which falls in between the session graph and the global graph. They use a Weighted Graph Attention Network (WGAT) to learn on this BCS graph rather than the session graph. Wang et al. propose the Global Context Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GCE-GNN) [ref]35 which decomposes the representation learning process into two pathways. One is done on the session graph and the other one is done on the global graph. The representations are then added together and further enhanced by combining positional information. Note that these works are orthogonal to our research, since they both focus on designing more sophisticated model architectures and attention methods to implement an end-to-end recommendation algorithm, while we introduce a pre-training process and strive to use it to simplify the downstream recommendation problem. Pre-training. In general, most of the supervised tasks in Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Recognition (SR) require huge amounts of labelled data to learn state-of-the-art models, but obtaining such data can be extremely expensive and sometimes impossible. Thus, pre-training    has appeared as an important and effective technique in recent years because representations learned with available substantial amounts of labelled or unlabeled data can benefit various downstream tasks where only limited amounts of data are available. For example, in NLP, pre-trained language models   have made significant breakthroughs in the past few years in text classification , machine translation , etc. While the target of pre-training and fine-tuning may be completely different, it allows to make better use of available data in terms of learning useful representations. Besides, unsupervised pre-training is empirically proved to have better generalization and serves as a regularization method . More recently, pre-training graph neural networks  is proposed to improve performance on tasks operated on graph-structured data. Although an increasing amount of research focuses on the session-based recommendation problem, unlike previous studies, we take the global item-to-item relations into consideration and explore how it can further improve the performance as well as reduce the amount of data required in the training process. We achieve this goal by introducing an unsupervised pre-training process to learn initialized representations for each item. Besides, we also investigate the readout function for the graph network. Our results point out that parameter-free methods can achieve highly competitive performance compared with data-driven attention-based methods.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: and finish this section by discussing the difference between the proposed method and previous methods.
