      "content": "Paper Title: Cohomology in Constraint Satisfaction and Structure Isomorphism\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConstraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and structure isomorphism (SI) are two of the most\nwell-studied problems in complexity theory. Mathematically speaking, an instance of\none of these problems takes a pair of structures (A,B)𝐴𝐵(A,B) as input and asks\nwhether there is a homomorphism\nA→B→𝐴𝐵A\\rightarrow B for CSP or an isomorphism A≅B𝐴𝐵A\\cong B for\nSI. These problems are not in general thought to be tractable. Indeed the general\ncase of CSP is NP-Complete and restricting our structures to graphs the\nbest known algorithm for SI is Babai’s quasi-polynomial time algorithm .\nAs a result, it is common in complexity and finite model theory to study approximations\nof the relations →→\\rightarrow and ≅\\cong. The k𝑘k-consistency and k𝑘k-Weisfeiler-Leman111The algorithm we call “k𝑘k-Weisfeiler-Leman” is more commonly called “(k−1)𝑘1(k-1)-Weisfeiler-Leman” in the literature, see for example . We prefer “k𝑘k-Weisfeiler-Leman” to emphasise its relationship to k𝑘k-variable logic and sets of k𝑘k-local isomorphisms. algorithms efficiently determine two such approximations\nto →→\\rightarrow and ≅\\cong which we call →ksubscript→𝑘\\rightarrow_{k} and ≡ksubscript𝑘\\equiv_{k}. These relations have many characterisations\nin logic and finite model theory, for example in  and .\nOne that is particularly useful is that of the existence of\nwinning strategies for Duplicator in certain Spoiler-Duplicator games with k𝑘k pebbles  .\nFor both of these games Duplicator’s winning strategies can be represented as non-empty\nsets S⊂𝐇𝐨𝐦k​(A,B)𝑆subscript𝐇𝐨𝐦𝑘𝐴𝐵S\\subset\\mathbf{Hom}_{k}(A,B) of k𝑘k-local partial homomorphisms which satisfy\nsome extension properties and connections between these games have been studied before.\nFor example, a joint comonadic semantics is given by the pebbling comonad of Abramsky,\nDawar and Wang . The limitations of these approximations are well-known.\nIn particular, it is known that k𝑘k-consistency only solves CSPs of bounded width and\nk𝑘k-Weisfeiler-Leman can only distinguish structures which differ on properties expressible in the infinitary counting\nlogic Cksuperscript𝐶𝑘C^{k}. Feder and Vardi  showed that CSP encoding linear\nequations over the finite fields do not have bounded width, while Cai, Fürer, and Immerman \ndemonstrated an efficiently decidable graph property which is not expressible in\nCksuperscript𝐶𝑘C^{k} for any k𝑘k. In the present paper, we introduce a novel approach to the CSP and SI problems\nbased on presheaves of k𝑘k-local partial homomorphisms and isomorphisms, showing\nthat the problems can be reframed as deciding whether certain presheaves admit global sections.\nWe show that the classic k𝑘k-consistency and k𝑘k-Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms can\nbe derived by computing greatest fixpoints of presheaf operators which remove some\nefficiently computable obstacles to global sections. Furthermore, we show how\ninvariants from sheaf cohomology can be used to find further obstacles to combining\nlocal homomorphisms and isomorphisms into global ones. We use these to construct new efficient extensions\nto the k𝑘k-consistency and k𝑘k-Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms computing relations\n→kℤsuperscriptsubscript→𝑘ℤ\\rightarrow_{k}^{\\mathbb{Z}} and ≡kℤsubscriptsuperscriptℤ𝑘\\equiv^{\\mathbb{Z}}_{k} which refine →ksubscript→𝑘\\rightarrow_{k} and ≡ksubscript𝑘\\equiv_{k}. The application of presheaves has been particularly successful in computer science\nin recent decades with applications in semantics  , information theory \nand quantum contextuality [ref]3  .\nThis work draws in particular on the application\nof sheaf theory to quantum contextuality, pioneered by Abramsky and Brandenburger [ref]3\nand developed by Abramsky and others for example in  and . Using this work, we prove that these new cohomological\nalgorithms are strictly stronger than k𝑘k-consistency and k𝑘k-Weisfeiler-Leman. In\nparticular, we show that cohomological k𝑘k-consistency decides solvability of linear equations\nwith k𝑘k variables per equation over all finite rings and that there is a fixed k𝑘k\nsuch that ≡kℤsubscriptsuperscriptℤ𝑘\\equiv^{\\mathbb{Z}}_{k} distinguishes structures which differ on Cai, Fürer and Immerman’s property. It is also interesting to compare →kℤsubscriptsuperscript→ℤ𝑘\\rightarrow^{\\mathbb{Z}}_{k} and ≡kℤsubscriptsuperscriptℤ𝑘\\equiv^{\\mathbb{Z}}_{k} with\nother well-studied refinements of →ksubscript→𝑘\\rightarrow_{k} and ≡ksubscript𝑘\\equiv_{k}. For →ksubscript→𝑘\\rightarrow_{k},\nsuch refinements include the algorithms of Bulatov  and Zhuk \nwhich decide all tractable CSPs and the algorithms of Brakensiek, Guruswami, Wrochna\nand Živný [ref]12 and Ciardo and Živný \nfor Promise CSPs. For ≡ksubscript𝑘\\equiv_{k}, comparable approximations to ≅\\cong include linear\nDiophantine equation methods employed by Berkholz and Grohe \nand the invertible-map equivalence of Dawar and Holm  which bounds\nthe expressive power of rank logic. The latter was recently used by Lichter  to demonstrate a property which is decidable in PTIME but not expressible in rank logic. In our paper, we show that\n≡kℤsubscriptsuperscriptℤ𝑘\\equiv^{\\mathbb{Z}}_{k}, for some fixed k𝑘k, can distinguish structures which differ on this property.\nComparing →kℤsubscriptsuperscript→ℤ𝑘\\rightarrow^{\\mathbb{Z}}_{k} to the Bulatov-Zhuk algorithm and algorithms for PCSPs remains a direction\nfor future work. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 establishes some\nbackground and notation.\nSection 3 introduces the presheaf formulation of CSP and SI and\nnew formulations of k𝑘k-consistency and k𝑘k-Weisfeiler-Leman in this framework.\nSection 4 demonstrates how to apply aspects of sheaf cohomology to CSP and\nSI and defines new algorithms along these lines.\nSection 5 surveys the strength of these new cohomological algorithms.\nSection 6 concludes\nwith some open questions and directions for future work.\nMajor proofs and additional background are left to the appendices.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The application of presheaves has been particularly successful in computer science\nin recent decades with applications in semantics  , information theory \nand quantum contextuality [ref]3  .\nThis work draws in particular on the application\nof sheaf theory to quantum contextuality, pioneered by Abramsky and Brandenburger [ref]3\nand developed by Abramsky and others for example in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
