      "content": "Paper Title: Natural Language Processing Advancements By Deep Learning: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDocument summarization refers to a set of problems involving generation of summary sentences given one or multiple documents as input. Generally, text summarization fits into two categories: Extractive Summarization, where the goal is to identify the most salient sentences in the document and return them as the summary. Abstractive Summarization, where the goal is to generate summary sentences from scratch; they may contain novel words that do not appear in the original document. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nExtractive summarization is prone to generate long and sometimes overlapping summary sentences; however, the result reflects the author’s mode of expression.\nAbstractive methods generate a shorter summary but they are hard to train. There is a vast amount of research on the topic of text summarization using extractive and abstractive methods.\nAs one of the earliest works on using neural networks for extractive summarization,  [ref]196 proposed a framework that used a ranking technique to extract the most salient sentences in the input.\nThis model was improved by  which used a document-level encoder to represent sentences, and a classifier to rank these sentences.\nOn the other hand, in abstractive summarization, it was   which, for the first time, used attention over a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model for the problem of headline generation.\nHowever, since simple attention models perform worse than extractive models, therefore more effective attention models such as graph-based attention  and transformers [ref]173 have been proposed for this task.\nTo further improve abstractive text summarization models,   proposed the first pointer-generator model and applied it to the DeepMind QA dataset .\nAs a result of this work, the CNN/Daily Mail dataset emerged which is now one of the widely used datasets for the summarization task.\nA copy mechanism was also adopted by  for similar tasks.\nBut their analysis reveals a key problem with attention-based encoder-decoder models: they often generate unusual summaries consisting of repeated phrases.\nRecently,   reached state-of-the-art results on the abstractive text summarization using a similar framework.\nThey alleviated the unnatural summaries by avoiding generating unknown tokens and replacing these words with tokens from the input article.\nLater, researchers moved their focus to methods that use sentence-embedding to first select the most salient sentence in the document and then change them to make them more abstractive [ref]203 .\nIn these models, salient sentences are extracted first and then a paraphrasing model is used to make them abstractive.\nThe extraction employs a sentence classifier or ranker while the abstractor tries to remove the extra information in a sentence and present it as a shorter summary.\nFast-RL [ref]203 is the first framework in this family of works.\nIn Fast-RL, the extractor is pre-trained to select salient sentences and the abstractor is pre-trained using a pointer-generator model to generate paraphrases.\nFinally, to merge these two non-differentiable components, they propose using Actor-Critic Q-learning methods in which the actor receives a single document and generates the output while the critic evaluates the output based on comparison with the ground-truth summary. Though the standard way to evaluate the performance of summarization models is with ROUGE  and BLEU , there are major problems with such measures.\nFor instance, the ROUGE measure focuses on the number of shared n-grams between two sentences.\nSuch a method incorrectly assigns a low score to an abstractive summary that uses different words yet provides an excellent paraphrase that humans would rate highly.\nClearly, better automated evaluation methods are needed in such cases. There are additional problems with current summarization models.\nShi et al.  provides a comprehensive survey on text summarization.  provides a recent survey on summarization methods.  provides an advanced composite deep learning model, based on LSTMs and Restricted Boltzmann Machine, for multi-doc opinion summarization. A very influential recent work, , introduces Hibert ( HIerachical  Bidirectional  Encoder  Representations from  Transformers) as a pre-trained initialization for document summarization and report state-of-the-art performance.\n\nReference markers found: [196]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]196: There is a vast amount of research on the topic of text summarization using extractive and abstractive methods.\nAs one of the earliest works on using neural networks for extractive summarization,  [ref]196 proposed a framework that used a ranking technique to extract the most salient sentences in the input.\nThis model was improved by  which used a document-level encoder to represent sentences,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
