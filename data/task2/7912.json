      "content": "Paper Title: Network Representation and Modular Decomposition of Combinatorial Structures: A Galled-Tree Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is a common task in phylogenetics to reconstruct rooted trees with leaf set X𝑋X, reflecting the\nevolutionary relationships between species, genes, or other taxa collected in X𝑋X, from distances\nd:X×X→ℝ:𝑑→𝑋𝑋ℝd\\colon X\\times X\\to\\mathbb{R} among them. In particular, there is a well-known\none-to-one correspondence between so-called rooted dated phylogenetic trees (T,t)𝑇𝑡(T,t) and\nultrametrics, i.e., metrics satisfying the strong triangle inequality d​(x,y)≤max⁡{d​(x,z),d​(y,z)}𝑑𝑥𝑦𝑑𝑥𝑧𝑑𝑦𝑧d(x,y)\\leq\\max\\{d(x,z),d(y,z)\\} for all x,y,z∈X𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑋x,y,z\\in X  . In this case, the date t​(lca⁡(x,y))𝑡lca𝑥𝑦t(\\operatorname{lca}(x,y)) assigned to the unique least common ancestor lca⁡(x,y)lca𝑥𝑦\\operatorname{lca}(x,y) of x𝑥x and y𝑦y in T𝑇T coincides\nwith the distance d​(x,y)𝑑𝑥𝑦d(x,y) for all x,y∈X𝑥𝑦𝑋x,y\\in X. In their seminal paper , Böcker and Dress considered a combinatorial generalization of ultrametrics\nand removed the restrictions regarding the values\nof t𝑡t and d𝑑d as far as possible. Instead of considering real numbers d​(x,y)𝑑𝑥𝑦d(x,y), they considered\nsymbolic dating maps δ:X×X→Υ:𝛿→𝑋𝑋Υ\\delta\\colon X\\times X\\to\\Upsilon, i.e., symmetric maps assigning to each pair (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) some\nsymbol δ​(x,y)∈Υ𝛿𝑥𝑦Υ\\delta(x,y)\\in\\Upsilon. In particular, they showed the one-to-one correspondence between\nso-called symbolic ultrametrics and symbolic dated, or simply labeled, phylogenetic trees (T,t)𝑇𝑡(T,t).\nSymbolic ultrametrics δ:X×X→Υ:𝛿→𝑋𝑋Υ\\delta\\colon X\\times X\\to\\Upsilon are defined by the following two properties: There are no four vertices x,y,u,v∈X𝑥𝑦𝑢𝑣𝑋x,y,u,v\\in X such that δ​(x,y)=δ​(y,u)=δ​(u,v)≠δ​(y,v)=δ​(x,v)=δ​(x,u)𝛿𝑥𝑦𝛿𝑦𝑢𝛿𝑢𝑣𝛿𝑦𝑣𝛿𝑥𝑣𝛿𝑥𝑢\\delta(x,y)=\\delta(y,u)=\\delta(u,v)\\neq\\delta(y,v)=\\delta(x,v)=\\delta(x,u). |{δ​(x,y),δ​(x,z),δ​(y,z)}|≤2𝛿𝑥𝑦𝛿𝑥𝑧𝛿𝑦𝑧2|\\{\\delta(x,y),\\delta(x,z),\\delta(y,z)\\}|\\leq 2\nfor all x,y,z∈V𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑉x,y,z\\in V. While long considered of interest only from a theoretical point of view111Anecdotally,\nSebastian Böcker mentioned in a private communication that he never thought that symbolic ultrametrics would have\nany practical relevance. (cf. e.g. 0  ), such symbolic dating maps have become relevant in practice and are shown\nto play a crucial role in the understanding of so-called orthologous and paralogous genes\n7  and the reconstruction of gene and species trees . Restricting these symmetric maps δ:X×X→{0,1}:𝛿→𝑋𝑋01\\delta\\colon X\\times X\\to\\{0,1\\} to be binary, there\nis a direct translation to “usual” graphs G=(X,E)𝐺𝑋𝐸G=(X,E) with vertex set X𝑋X and adjacent vertices x𝑥x\nand y𝑦y precisely if δ​(x,y)=1𝛿𝑥𝑦1\\delta(x,y)=1. It is well known 7 that a graph G𝐺G represents a\nsymbolic ultrametric if and only if G𝐺G is a cograph, i.e., G𝐺G\ndoes not contain induced paths P4subscript𝑃4P_{4} on four vertices  .\nIn this case, G𝐺G can be “explained” by a 0/1010/1-labeled tree (T,t)𝑇𝑡(T,t)\nin the sense that x,y∈X𝑥𝑦𝑋x,y\\in X are adjacent if and only if t​(lca⁡(x,y))=1𝑡lca𝑥𝑦1t(\\operatorname{lca}(x,y))=1.\nIn a more general setting, symbolic ultrametrics can be characterized as edge-colored graphs that do not contain so-called\nmonochromatic P4subscript𝑃4P_{4}s (due to Condition (U2)) and rainbow triangles (due to Condition (U3)) 9 7, see Theorem 3.2.\nA similar result was provided by Gurvich in [28, Thm. 3] for the\ncharacterization of the normal forms of so-called positional games with perfect information. Independent of the work of Böcker and Dress, Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg established the theory of labeled 2-structures\n .\nThis theory relates to clustering and tree-representation, and is closely connected to symbolic\ndating maps. As shown in 9, a symbolic dating map\nδ𝛿\\delta is a symbolic ultrametric if and only if the translation of δ𝛿\\delta\ninto symmetric labeled 2-structures is “uniformly non-prime”.\nThe latter is closely related to the notion of modules or clans    9, i.e.,\nsubsets M⊆X𝑀𝑋M\\subseteq X for which δ​(x,z)=δ​(y,z)𝛿𝑥𝑧𝛿𝑦𝑧\\delta(x,z)=\\delta(y,z) is satisfied for all x,y∈M𝑥𝑦𝑀x,y\\in M and z∈X∖M𝑧𝑋𝑀z\\in X\\setminus M.\nIn particular, for each symbolic dating map δ𝛿\\delta, there is a unique set system ℭδsubscriptℭ𝛿\\mathfrak{C}_{\\delta} of non-overlapping modules\ncalled the modular decomposition of δ𝛿\\delta. Since no two elements in ℭδsubscriptℭ𝛿\\mathfrak{C}_{\\delta} overlap,\nℭδsubscriptℭ𝛿\\mathfrak{C}_{\\delta} is a hierarchy and thus, the Hasse diagram Tδ≔ℋ​(ℭδ)≔subscript𝑇𝛿ℋsubscriptℭ𝛿T_{\\delta}\\coloneqq\\mathscr{H}(\\mathfrak{C}_{\\delta})\nis a phylogenetic tree    that can be equipped with a labeling tδsubscript𝑡𝛿t_{\\delta} resulting in a labeled tree (Tδ,tδ)subscript𝑇𝛿subscript𝑡𝛿(T_{\\delta},t_{\\delta}).\nIn the absence of so-called prime modules, the information about δ𝛿\\delta is fully captured by\n(Tδ,tδ)subscript𝑇𝛿subscript𝑡𝛿(T_{\\delta},t_{\\delta}) in the sense that tδ​(lca⁡({x},{y}))=δ​(x,y)subscript𝑡𝛿lca𝑥𝑦𝛿𝑥𝑦t_{\\delta}(\\operatorname{lca}(\\{x\\},\\{y\\}))=\\delta(x,y) for all x,y∈X𝑥𝑦𝑋x,y\\in X.\nHowever, in the presence of prime modules, the full information of δ𝛿\\delta cannot be determined\nfrom (Tδ,tδ)subscript𝑇𝛿subscript𝑡𝛿(T_{\\delta},t_{\\delta}) alone. To summarize at this point, several equivalent notions of symbolic dated maps exist:\nsymbolic 2-dissimilarity [ref]41, symmetric 2-structures, or edge-colored graphs.\nThese structures have in common that they are mainly considered from a tree-reconstruction point of view,\ni.e., characterizations are provided for those symbolic dated maps that can be represented by labeled phylogenetic\ntrees. In this paper, we aim to generalize the latter concept and ask under which conditions\nsymbolic dated maps can be represented by labeled networks, i.e., rooted directed acyclic graphs.\nA first step in this direction is provided in 2 4 3, where “binary” maps\nδ:X×X→{0,1}:𝛿→𝑋𝑋01\\delta\\colon X\\times X\\to\\{0,1\\} have been characterized that can be explained\nby so-called galled-trees, which results in the definition of so-called GaTEx graphs.\nFurthermore, in  those symbolic dated maps are characterized\nthat can be explained by particular\nrather “tree-like” directed acyclic graphs which may admit several roots.\nIn  it was shown that every symbolic map can be explained by some rooted median network\nand in [ref]41 some results are presented for so-called 3-way symbolic maps that arise from restricted versions of galled-trees. To cover the different, yet similarly flavored, definitions related to symbolic dated maps\nand to simplify the notion, we consider strudigrams, which are triples 𝒮=(𝒳,Υ,σ)𝒮𝒳script-Υ𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\Upsilon,\\sigma)\nsuch that σ𝜎\\sigma is a map that assigns a unique label\nσ​(x,y)∈Υ𝜎𝑥𝑦Υ\\sigma(x,y)\\in\\Upsilon to each two elements x,y∈X𝑥𝑦𝑋x,y\\in X.\nThe word strudigram is composed of the first parts of the words structures,\ndissimilarities, and graphs. A strudigram 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S} is explained by a labeled\nnetwork (N,t)𝑁𝑡(N,t) with leaf set X𝑋X if, for all x,y∈X𝑥𝑦𝑋x,y\\in X, there is a unique least common ancestor lca⁡(x,y)lca𝑥𝑦\\operatorname{lca}(x,y)\nand it holds that the labels t​(lca⁡(x,y))𝑡lca𝑥𝑦t(\\operatorname{lca}(x,y)) and σ​(x,y)𝜎𝑥𝑦\\sigma(x,y) coincide. We provide in Section 2 the necessary definitions concerning clustering systems and\nnetworks, and in Section 3 more details on the notion of strudigrams. As it turns\nout, each strudigram 𝒮=(𝒳,Υ,σ)𝒮𝒳script-Υ𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\Upsilon,\\sigma) can be explained by some labeled network having\nO​(|X|2)𝑂superscript𝑋2O(|X|^{2}) vertices, assigning to each two-element subset {x,y}𝑥𝑦\\{x,y\\} of X𝑋X a unique lcalca\\operatorname{lca}. This\nbegs the question of whether there are simpler networks. One way to address this question is by\nusing the modular decomposition tree (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S} as explained in Section\n4. In the absence of so-called prime vertices in (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau), this labeled tree\nexplains 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}. This is precisely the case if the translation of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S} into a symbolic dated map\nδ𝛿\\delta is a symbolic ultrametric. The aim is thus to reconstruct a network by locally replacing such prime\nvertices by some networks and keeping as much of the tree structure of 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} as possible. The latter is covered in\nSection 5. In particular, we show how to obtain so-called lca-networks to explain\ngiven strudigrams.\nWhile the concept of replacing prime vertices in (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau)\nis rather general, we focus in Section 6 on those networks that can be obtained from\n(𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) by replacing prime vertices with so-called galls that are, roughly speaking,\nbiconnected directed acyclic graphs composed of two paths that only share their start and end point.\nSuch networks are also known as galled-trees. We provide characterizations of strudigrams 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S},\ncalled GaTEx strudigrams, that can be explained by such labeled galled-trees in terms of their\nunderlying so-called primitive substructures. As it turns out, GaTEx strudigrams, as well as\nnetworks that explain them, can be constructed in polynomial time, as shown in Section\n7.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: cannot be determined\nfrom (Tδ,tδ)subscript𝑇𝛿subscript𝑡𝛿(T_{\\delta},t_{\\delta}) alone.
