      "content": "Paper Title: RouteNet-Fermi: Network Modeling with Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNetwork modeling is arguably one of the key tools when designing, building, and evaluating computer networks, even since the early days of networking . Network models are used in protocol design, performance evaluation, or network planning, just to cite a few examples. The two most widespread network modeling techniques are analytical models based on Queuing Theory (QT), and packet-level simulators  . However, the evolution of computer networks, especially concerning complexity and traffic characteristics, highlights some of the limitations of classical modeling techniques. Despite their tremendous success and widespread usage, some scenarios require more advanced techniques capable of accurately modeling complex traffic characteristics, while scaling to large real-world networks. Especially, two relevant applications can benefit from advanced network modeling techniques: Network Digital Twins (NDT) , and network optimization tools. Commonly, an NDT is referred to as a virtual replica of a physical network that can accurately mimic its behavior and can make performance predictions for any given input condition (e.g., traffic, topology change, or new routing configuration). In other words, an NDT is an accurate network model that can support a wide range of network configurations and that can accurately model the complex non-linear behaviors behind real-world networks. As a result, NDTs can be used to produce accurate performance predictions, carry out what-if analysis, or perform network optimization by pairing it with an optimization algorithm  . In the context of network optimization, we can only optimize what we can model. Optimization algorithms operate by searching the network configuration space (e.g., to find an alternative routing scheme). For each configuration, a network model is used to estimate the resulting performance to see if it fulfills the optimization goal (e.g., minimize delay [ref]6). To achieve efficient online optimization, it is essential an accurate and fast network model. State-of-the-art modeling techniques have important limitations in effectively supporting the stringent requirements of current packet-switched networks. Queuing Theory imposes strong assumptions on the packet arrival process (Poisson traffic generation), which often is not sufficient to model real-world networks . Internet traffic has been extensively analyzed in the past two decades   0 1 2 and, despite the community has not agreed on a universal model, there is consensus that in general aggregated traffic shows strong autocorrelation and a heavy-tail 3. Alternatively, packet-level simulators can accurately model networks. However, this comes at a high computational cost. The cost of a simulator depends linearly on the number of packets forwarded, which can be in the range of millions per second on a single 1Gbps link. In consequence, they are slow and impractical when considering large networks with realistic traffic volumes. This also severely limits its applicability to online network optimization, given the hard time constraints of such types of applications. In this context, Deep Learning (DL) offers an extraordinary set of techniques to build accurate data-driven network models. DL models can be trained with real data, without making any assumptions about physical networks. This enables building models with unprecedented accuracy by modeling the entire range of non-linear and multidimensional characteristics. In this paper, we first make a systematic analysis of the performance of DL techniques for network modeling, using classical discrete-event network simulators as a baseline. Specifically, we analyze the performance of Multilayer Perceptron-based (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network-based (RNN), and Graph Neural Network-based (GNN) models. We find that classical DL techniques, such as MLPs and RNNs, are not practical enough for network modeling as they fail to provide accurate estimates when the network scenario differs from the examples seen during training (e.g., link failure). More recently, GNNs have been proposed as a novel neural network architecture specifically designed to learn over graph-structured data. They have been successfully used in other domains, such as quantum chemistry 4 or logistics 5. However, in our analysis, we find that standard GNNs 4 do not work well for network modeling and that we need a custom GNN architecture to model computer networks. As a result, we propose RouteNet-Fermi (RouteNet-F), a GNN architecture for network modeling. RouteNet-F shares the same goals as Queuing Theory. It provides performance estimates (delay, jitter, and packet loss) on given network scenarios (Figure 1) with remarkable accuracy and speed. The proposed model is not limited to Markovian traffic as Queuing Theory; it supports arbitrary models (including autocorrelated processes) which better represent the properties of real-world traffic 3. Interestingly, it also overcomes one of the main limitations of DL-based models: RouteNet-F generalizes and provides accurate estimates in network scenarios not seen in training (e.g., different topologies, traffic matrices, routing configurations). We benchmark RouteNet-F against a state-of-the-art DL-based model (MimicNet 6) and with a state-of-the-art queuing theory model. We show that our model outperforms both baselines in all the scenarios, achieving a 5.64% error when tested in a dataset with packet traces coming from a real-world network, an 11% error when evaluated in a physical testbed, and a 6.24% error when estimating the delay on networks over a large dataset with 1,000 network samples, with topologies ranging from 50 to 300 nodes. As any Deep Learning model 6 7 8, RouteNet-Fermi does not provide strong mathematical performance guarantees. However, the error of the estimates produced by the model is strongly bounded. The minimum estimated delay assumes no queuing across the path while the maximum assumes that all the queues are full. RouteNet-Fermi will not produce delay estimates outside these bounds. The implementation of the model used in the evaluation of this paper is publicly available at 9.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: (e.g., to find an alternative routing scheme).
