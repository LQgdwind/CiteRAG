      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Comparable Knowledge Distillation in Semantic Image Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nApplying the classical KD framework to semantic image segmentation problems is straight-forward. The distillation loss in Equation 3 is usually applied on image-level, summing over all classes, but since image segmentation is essentially pixel-wise classification, it can be applied to each pixel in the image instead. This most basic distillation loss is referred to as pixel-wise distillation (LP‚ÄãIsubscriptùêøùëÉùêºL_{PI}) and is a useful baseline for more complex distillation schemes. Since pixel-wise distillation treats each pixel in isolation and ignores the fact that segmentation depends strongly on contextual information, various alternative distillation techniques exist, many of which use pixel-wise distillation as one part of their framework. The earliest proposed technique investigates a ‚Äùconsistency‚Äù loss comparing regional differences in student and teacher output [ref]34 aiming for a more contextual distillation of knowledge by matching the distance of the center pixel and an 8-neighborhood. Instead of a direct matching of student and teacher output, in Knowledge Adaptation (KA)  teacher output is compressed to a more dense latent space by an autoencoder before being compared to student logits. Additionally, an affinity loss term is introduced to better capture long-range dependencies. Structured Knowledge Distillation (SKD) 6 is the most cited publication in the field and uses a combination of three loss terms, one of them the basic pixel-wise loss. Again the other two loss terms are supposed to focus more on contextual information in both intermediate and output layers. The pair-wise loss (LP‚ÄãAsubscriptùêøùëÉùê¥L_{PA}) is based on a pair-wise Markov random field framework and encourages students to mimic the teacher at intermediate layers. The holistic loss (LH‚ÄãOsubscriptùêøùêªùëÇL_{HO}) requires an additional discriminator model with the task to differentiate student and teacher output. Student and discriminator compete with each other following a similar training protocol as used to train Generative Adversarial Networks, ultimately leading to the student output being as similar as possible to the teacher output 6. Building upon SKD, Intra-Class Feature Variation Distillation (IFVD)  also uses the pixel-wise and holistic loss terms, but replaces the pair-wise loss with the new IFV loss, LI‚ÄãF‚ÄãVsubscriptùêøùêºùêπùëâL_{IFV}.\nPer-class prototypes are calculated and the distance of intermediate features to the respective prototype is aligned between student and teacher.\nAnother suggested approach, CSCACE , introduces a Channel and Spatial Correlation (CSC) and an Adaptive Cross Entropy (ACE) term. CSC calculates correlation matrices between intermediate features and can be understood as an extension of the pair-wise loss of SKD. ACE combines the classic pixel-wise KD loss with the ground truth label by only using the teacher output when the teacher prediction is correct. As one of the few approaches that modify the pixel-wise distillation loss, Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD)  proposes a channel/class-wise normalization of student and teacher outputs before calculating the KL-divergence, a technique that is copied by several later methods.\nDouble Similarity Distillation (DSD)  introduces a pixel-wise similarity loss, which matches intermediate student and teacher features by utilizing self-attention maps across multiple layers.\nA category-wise similarity distillation loss makes the student mimic the teacher at output level by minimizing the L2 distance between correlation matrices of student and teacher output.\nMasked Generative Distillation (MGD)  is a more general technique, which can also be used for knowledge distillation in image classification or object detection.\nThe proposed method masks some parts of the input while still requiring the student to mimic the full teacher output. Inter-Class Distance Distillation (IDD)  and Feature-Augmented Knowledge Distillation (FAKD)  use the pixel-wise-distillation loss with channel-wise normalization as suggested in CWD . IDD additionally includes all terms introduced by SKD and an inter-class feature distance loss following a similar reasoning as IFVD.\nFAKD does not introduce additional loss terms but proposes the perturbation of intermediate student features in multiple ways and training the student to mimic the teacher despite the applied perturbations. Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation (SSTKD) 4 and Adaptive Perspective Distillation (APD)  use the pixel-wise distillation loss.\nSSTKD additionally includes the holistic loss of SKD and two novel loss terms, which encourage the student to mimic low-level texture information of the teacher 4.\nThe authors of APD argue that segmentation networks learn to generalize and thus acquire a universal perception.\nTheir introduced adaptive perspective includes calculating class-wise average features of individual images.\nAccording to the authors, this process distills contextual information more explicitly.\nAPD is the only reviewed technique that updates part of the teacher model during student training.\n Self-attention and Self-distillation  introduces a self-attention loss term to make the student learn contextual information from the teacher and a layer-wise context distillation loss. The second term is different from other discussed techniques, as it is applied across student layers to ensure a consistent representation of contextual information in shallow layers.\nCross-Image Relational Knowledge Distillation (CIRKD)  again uses the pixel-wise distillation loss and uses three more loss terms. Unique about this method is the introduction of a pixel queue to make student models mimic the teachers distance to output for pixels of the same class from previous images.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: of which use pixel-wise distillation as one part of their framework.
