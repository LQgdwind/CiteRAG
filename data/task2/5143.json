      "content": "Paper Title: Structural Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown to be a very effective tool in solving fundamental computer vision tasks .\nOne major application of CNNs includes real-time perception systems found in e.g. autonomous vehicles, where object detection is often a task of major importance.\nDeployment of CNNs into real-time applications, however, introduces strict limitations on memory and latency.\nOn the other hand, increased performance of state-of-the-art detectors typically comes with an increase in memory requirements and inference time .\nThus, the choice of network model and its according detection performance is strictly limited.\nSeveral techniques have been proposed to tackle this problem, e.g. pruning , weight quantization , parameter prediction  and Knowledge Distillation (KD) .\nIn this work we are particularly interested in the latter, as it provides an intuitive way of performance improvement without the need for architectural modifications to existing networks. With KD, the knowledge acquired by a computationally expensive teacher model is transferred to a smaller student model during training.\nKD has proven to be very effective in tasks such as classification , segmentation , and in particular has seen considerable progress in detection very recently  [ref]7   5.\nDue to the complexity of the output space of a typical detection model, it is necessary to apply KD at the intermediate feature level, as solely relying on output-based KD has proven ineffective   [ref]7   [ref]25  5.\nIn feature-based KD, in addition to existing objectives, a training objective is introduced which minimizes the error between teacher and student activations and is de-facto standard defined by the ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norm distance between individual feature activations  [ref]7  [ref]25  5, as shown in fig.¬†1(a).\nThe ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norm however ignores three important pieces of information present in the feature maps: (i) spatial relationships between features, (ii) the correlation between the teacher and student features and (iii) importance of individual features. We notice recent work has (implicitly) focused on bypassing the latter point through\nmechanisms that sample feature activations by assuming that object regions are more \"knowledge-dense\"   [ref]25 5.\nHowever, as demonstrated by Guo et¬†al. [ref]7 (2021), even distilling exclusively background feature activations can lead to significant performance improvement, therefore it cannot be assumed that solely object regions contain useful knowledge.\nSampling mechanisms furthermore introduce additional drawbacks which may limit their broader implementation into real-world applications, e.g. the need for labeled data [ref]7  [ref]25. In this work, we propose Structural Knowledge Distillation, which aims to improve the downsides associated with the ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norm as a central driver for KD methods, rather than designing an ever more sophisticated sampling mechanism.\nOur key insight is illustrated in fig.¬†1(b):\nThe feature space of a CNN can be locally decomposed into luminance (mean), contrast (variance) and structure (cross-correlation) components, a strategy that has seen successful application in the image domain in the form of SSIM .\nThe new training objective becomes to minimize local differences in mean and variance, and maximize local zero-normalized cross-correlation between the teacher and student activations.\nDoing so allows us to capture additional knowledge contained in spatial relations and correlations between feature activations of the teacher and additionally the student, rather than directly minimizing the difference in individual activations. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method we perform extensive experiments using various detection architectures and training schemes. Overall our contribution is as follows: We propose Structural Knowledge Distillation, which introduces ‚ÑìSSIMsubscript‚ÑìSSIM\\ell_{\\text{SSIM}} and variations as a replacement of the ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norm for feature-based KD in object detection models. This enables the capture of additional knowledge manifested in local mean, variance and cross-correlation relationships in the feature space of student and teacher networks. We illustrate through an analysis of the feature space that our method focuses on different areas than ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norms, and that therefore solely sampling from object regions is suboptimal as the entire feature space can contain useful knowledge depending on the activation pattern. We demonstrate a consistent quantitative improvement in detection accuracy for various training settings and model architectures by performing extensive experiments on MSCOCO .\nOur method even performs on par or outperforms carefully tuned state-of-the-art object sampling mechanisms  , and fundamentally achieves this by only introducing one line of code.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: student model during training.\nKD has proven to be very effective in tasks such as classification , segmentation , and in particular has seen considerable progress in detection very recently  [ref]7   5.\nDue to the complexity of the output space of a typical detection model, it is necessary to apply KD at the intermediate feature level, as solely relying on output-based KD has proven\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
