      "content": "Paper Title: Design Patterns for AI-based Systems: A Multivocal Literature Review and Pattern Repository\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSoftware systems relying on artificial intelligence (AI) have gained considerable attention in industry and academia .\nAs such, AI-based systems are systems which contain one or several AI software components, with potentially different responsibilities .\nHowever, a large percentage of AI projects (∼similar-to\\sim70-80%) is estimated to fail  , without making it to production or staying there in sustainable fashion for longer periods of time. To tackle these problems, the discipline of AI Engineering was formed [ref]5.\nWhile AI engineering practices  can be one way to improve quality, another approach more focused on architecture and design are patterns.\nAccording to Gamma et al. , design patterns are proven, reusable solutions to frequently occurring problems.\nEven though the impact of individual design patterns on software quality is sometimes controversial,\na recent systematic literature review by Wedyan and Abufakher  reports an overall positive impact of design patterns on software quality. While new design patterns are slowly emerging for AI-based systems, it is currently difficult to get a recent overview of the pattern landscape in this space.\nIn 2019, Washizaki et al. [ref]9 conducted a first multivocal review and reported design patterns for machine learning (ML) systems.\nThe authors suggested repeating the study after several years, since the research topic would be actively researched and many new design patterns could establish after the study. Our goal is therefore to provide an extensive, updated overview of design patterns used for AI-based systems, and to create an extendable pattern repository to document the results.\nBy surveying ML practitioners, Washizaki et al. [ref]9 discovered that 31% solve problems in an ad-hoc way and do not consciously use existing design patterns.\nThe effort for finding and using design patters should therefore be reduced, both to raise awareness and to allow the wide-spread usage of successful design patterns. To address this, we conducted a multivocal literature review (MLR), using both scientific (white) and practitioner (gray) resources.\nWe especially wanted to find patterns published after the search window of Washizaki et al. [ref]9, traditional patterns adapted to the AI context, and patterns not restricted to ML systems, i.e., ones applicable to AI-based systems in general.\nThis study will answer the following research questions: RQ1: Which new design patterns have emerged for AI-based systems? RQ2: Which existing design patterns have been adapted to AI-based systems? RQ3: How can these patterns be consistently documented and made accessible for researchers and practitioners? During the identification of patterns for AI-based systems, we consciously differentiated between new patterns that emerged specifically for AI-based systems and existing, traditional patterns from other fields that were adapted for AI-based systems.\nIn addition to finding and categorizing the patterns, a web-based pattern repository has been created to make the pattern collection easily browsable and accessible.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: is estimated to fail  , without making it to production or staying there in sustainable fashion for longer periods of time.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
