      "content": "Paper Title: Expected Scalarised Returns Dominance: A New Solution Concept for Multi-Objective Decision Making An earlier version of this work was presented at the Adaptive and Learning Agents Workshop 2021 [1]. This article extends our workshop paper with additional theoretical analysis and new empirical results.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor MORL there are two classes of algorithms: single-policy and multi-policy algorithms [ref]4 . When the user’s utility function is known a priori, it is possible to use a single-policy algorithm   to learn an optimal solution. However, when the user’s utility function is unknown we aim to learn a set of policies that are optimal for all monotonically increasing utility functions. The current literature on the ESR criterion focuses only on scenarios where the utility function of a user is known  , overlooking scenarios where the utility function of a user is unknown. Moreover, a set of solutions under the ESR criterion for the unknown utility function scenario  has yet to be defined. Various algorithms have been proposed to learn solution sets under the SER criterion (see Section 2.5), for example   . Under the SER criterion, multi-policy algorithms determine optimality by comparing policies based on the utility of expected value vectors (see Equation 4). In contrast, under the ESR criterion it is crucial to maintain a distribution over the utility of possible vector-valued outcomes. SER multi-policy algorithms cannot be used to learn optimal policies under the ESR criterion because they compute expected value vectors. It is necessary to develop new methods that can generate solution sets for the ESR criterion with unknown utilities. The development of methods that determine an optimal partial ordering over return distributions is a promising avenue to address this challenge. First-order stochastic dominance (see Section 2.6) is a method which gives a partial ordering over random variables [ref]20 . FSD compares the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the underlying probability distributions of random variables to determine optimality. When computing policies under the ESR criterion, it is essential that the expected utility is maximised. To use FSD for the ESR criterion, we must show the FSD conditions presented in Section 2.6 also hold when optimising the expected utility for unknown monotonically increasing utility functions. For the single-objective case, Theorem 2 proves for random variables X and Y, if X ⪰F​S​Dsubscriptsucceeds-or-equals𝐹𝑆𝐷\\succeq_{FSD} Y, the expected utility of X is greater than, or equal to, the expected utility of Y for monotonically increasing utility functions. In Theorem 2, random variables X and Y are considered, and their corresponding CDFs FXsubscript𝐹𝑋F_{X}, FYsubscript𝐹𝑌F_{Y}. The work of Mas-Colell et al.  is used as a foundation for Theorem 2. A random variable, X, is preferred to a random variable, Y, for all decision makers with a monotonically increasing utility function if, X ⪰F​S​Dsubscriptsucceeds-or-equals𝐹𝑆𝐷\\succeq_{FSD} Y. If X ⪰F​S​Dsubscriptsucceeds-or-equals𝐹𝑆𝐷\\succeq_{FSD} Y, then333CDFs with lower probability values for a given z𝑧z are preferable. Figure 2 explains why this is the case., Since, When integrating both 𝔼​(u​(X))𝔼𝑢𝑋\\mathbb{E}(u(X)) and 𝔼​(u​(Y))𝔼𝑢𝑌\\mathbb{E}(u(Y)) by parts, the following results is generated: Given FX​(−∞)subscript𝐹𝑋F_{X}(-\\infty) = FY​(−∞)subscript𝐹𝑌F_{Y}(-\\infty) = 0 and FX​(∞)subscript𝐹𝑋F_{X}(\\infty) = FY​(∞)subscript𝐹𝑌F_{Y}(\\infty) = 1, the first terms in 𝔼​(u​(X))𝔼𝑢𝑋\\mathbb{E}(u(X)) and 𝔼​(u​(Y))𝔼𝑢𝑌\\mathbb{E}(u(Y)) are equal, and thus Since FX​(z)≤FY​(z)subscript𝐹𝑋𝑧subscript𝐹𝑌𝑧F_{X}(z)\\leq F_{Y}(z) and u′​(z)≥0superscript𝑢′𝑧0u^{\\prime}(z)\\geq 0 for all monotonically increasing utility functions, then and thus, A utility function maps an input (scalar or vector return) to an output (scalar utility). Since the probability of receiving some utility is equal to the probability of receiving some return for a random variable, X, we can write the following: where c𝑐c is a constant.\nUsing the results shown in Theorem 2 and Equation 10, the FSD conditions highlighted in Section 2.6 can be rewritten to include monotonically increasing utility functions: Let X and Y be random variables. X dominates Y for all decision makers with a monotonically increasing utility function if the following is true: In MORL, the return from the reward function is a vector, where each element in the return vector represents an objective. To apply FSD to MORL under the ESR criterion, random vectors must be considered. In this case, a random vector (or multi-variate random variable) is a vector whose components are scalar-valued random variables on the same probability space. For simplicity, this paper focuses on the case in which a random vector has two random variables, known as the bi-variate case. FSD conditions have been proven to hold for random vectors with n𝑛n random variables in the works of Sriboonchitta et al. 0, Levhari et al. 1, Nakayama et al. 2 and Scarsini 3. In Theorem 3, the work of Atkinson and Bourguignon 4 is distilled into a suitable Theorem for MORL. Theorem 3 highlights how the conditions for FSD hold for random vectors when optimising under the ESR criterion for a monotonically increasing utility function, u𝑢u, where ∂2u​(x1,x2)∂x1​∂x2≤0superscript2𝑢subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥20\\frac{\\partial^{2}u(x_{1},x_{2})}{\\partial x_{1}\\partial x_{2}}\\leq 0 5. It is important to note Atikson and Bourguignon 4 have shown the conditions for FSD hold for random vectors for utility functions where ∂2u​(x1,x2)∂x1​∂x2≥0superscript2𝑢subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥20\\frac{\\partial^{2}u(x_{1},x_{2})}{\\partial x_{1}\\partial x_{2}}\\geq 0. We plan to extend these conditions for MORL in a future work. In Theorem 3, X and Y are random vectors where each random vector consists of two random variables, X=[X1,X2]Xsubscript𝑋1subscript𝑋2\\textbf{X}=[X_{1},X_{2}] and Y=[Y1,Y2]Ysubscript𝑌1subscript𝑌2\\textbf{Y}=[Y_{1},Y_{2}]. FX1X2F_{{X_{1}X{{}_{2}}}} and FY1​Y2subscript𝐹subscript𝑌1subscript𝑌2F_{Y_{1}Y_{2}} are the corresponding CDFs.

Note that Using integration-by-parts (I), and the fact that ΔF​(t,0)=∂ΔF​(0,z)∂z=0subscriptΔ𝐹𝑡0subscriptΔ𝐹0𝑧𝑧0\\Delta_{F}(t,0)=\\frac{\\partial\\Delta_{F}(0,z)}{\\partial z}=0 (Z), we obtain: Given that ∂2u​(t,z)∂t​∂z≤0superscript2𝑢𝑡𝑧𝑡𝑧0\\frac{\\partial^{2}u(t,z)}{\\partial t\\partial z}\\leq 0, ∂u​(t,z)∂t≥0𝑢𝑡𝑧𝑡0\\frac{\\partial u(t,z)}{\\partial t}\\geq 0 and ΔF​(t,z)≤0subscriptΔ𝐹𝑡𝑧0\\Delta_{F}(t,z)\\leq 0, we know that the last two terms are positive.\nTherefore, we can state that According to Lemma 2 (see Section 10), as u​(t,z)​F​(t,z)𝑢𝑡𝑧𝐹𝑡𝑧u(t,z)F(t,z) is a positive monotonically increasing function in both t𝑡t and z𝑧z, we know that: Using integration-by-parts (I), and the fact that ΔF​(t,0)=0subscriptΔ𝐹𝑡00\\Delta_{F}(t,0)=0 (Z), we have: Finally, given that ∂u​(t,z)∂z≥0𝑢𝑡𝑧𝑧0\\frac{\\partial u(t,z)}{\\partial z}\\geq 0 and ΔF​(t,z)≤0subscriptΔ𝐹𝑡𝑧0\\Delta_{F}(t,z)\\leq 0, we know that: Using the results from Theorem 3, Equation 11 can be updated to include random vectors, For random vectors X and Y, X is preferred over Y by all decision makers with a monotonically increasing utility function if, and only if, the following is true: Using the results from Theorem 3 and Definition 3, it is possible to extend FSD to MORL.\nFor MORL, under the ESR criterion, the return distribution, ZπsuperscriptZ𝜋\\textbf{Z}^{\\pi}, is considered to be the full distribution of the returns of a random vector received when executing a policy, π𝜋\\pi (see Section 3), return distributions can be used to represent policies. In this case, it is possible to use FSD to obtain a partial ordering over policies. For example, consider two policies, π𝜋\\pi and π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime}, where each policy has the underlying return distribution ZπsuperscriptZ𝜋\\textbf{Z}^{\\pi} and Zπ′superscriptZsuperscript𝜋′\\textbf{Z}^{\\pi^{\\prime}}. If Zπ⪰F​S​DZπ′subscriptsucceeds-or-equals𝐹𝑆𝐷superscriptZ𝜋superscriptZsuperscript𝜋′\\textbf{Z}^{\\pi}\\,\\succeq_{FSD}\\textbf{Z}^{\\pi^{\\prime}} then π𝜋\\pi will be preferred over π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime}. Policies π𝜋\\pi and π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} have return distributions ZπsuperscriptZ𝜋\\textbf{Z}^{\\pi} and Zπ′superscriptZsuperscript𝜋′\\textbf{Z}^{\\pi^{\\prime}}. Policy π𝜋\\pi is preferred over policy π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} by all decision makers with a utility function, u𝑢u, that is monotonically increasing if, and only if, the following is true: Now that a partial ordering over policies has been defined under the ESR criterion for the unknown utility function scenario, it is possible to define a set of optimal policies.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: For MORL there are two classes of algorithms: single-policy and multi-policy algorithms [ref]4 .
