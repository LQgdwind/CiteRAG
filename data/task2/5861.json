      "content": "Paper Title: Pitchclass2vec: Symbolic Music Structure Segmentation with Chord Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomatic segmentation on audio signal is a prolific research field in which many different solutions have been presented, ranging from self-similarity matrices   to neural network based methods [ref]22 [ref]23 . Harmonic content has been used to improve those methods both using probabilistic models  and transformer based models .\nSignificant research has been performed on phrase-level structural segmentation based on melodic    as well as polyphonic content .\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, the only approach proposed in literature for global music segmentation on symbolic harmonic content is FORM . FORM performs structural segmentation by exploiting repeated patterns extracted from harmonic progressions encoded as sequences of strings. Each string represent a chord. In the original work chord labels are transformed into 242424 class of chords, 121212 major chords and 121212 minor chords, while every other chord feature is removed.\nIn this paper, FORM is re-implemented in order to compare the results of the proposed method with the current state of the art (see Section 5).\nFORM pattern detection algorithm is based on suffix trees. Each node on a suffix tree represents a (possibly recurrent) sub-sequence of a string. FORM extracts sub-sequences appearing in at least two position in the analyzed harmonic progression.\nA partial segmentation is obtained by labeling each sub-sequence as a new section. The final segmentation is obtained by labeling remaining sub-sequences as their preceding neighbouring section.\nThe results are compared with a random baseline that generates arbitrarily long structures and to a heuristic that assigns to each composition the typical pop song structure ABBBBCCBBBBCCDCCE , in which each different label represent a structure in the chord progression and is stretched to fit the whole sequence.\nThe main issue with FORM is in way chord labels are compared. The string representation does not take into account semantic similarity between chords nor the algorithm is able to detect near-similar patterns, i.e. patterns whose difference can be ignored in the context of music structure segmentation. Our structure segmentation method is based on our novel chord representation method, pitchclass2vec, based on continuous word representation.\nThe core idea of continuous word representation is based on the Distributional Hyphotesis : the semantic meaning of a word w𝑤w can be approximated from the distribution of words that appear within the context of w𝑤w.\nThe objective of continuous word representation is the maximization of the following log-likelihood: where 𝒞tsubscript𝒞𝑡\\mathcal{C}_{t} represents the indices of the words that appears as context of the word wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} and the function p​(wc|wt)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑤𝑐subscript𝑤𝑡p(w_{c}|w_{t}) is parameterized using d𝑑d-dimensional vectors in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, respectively 𝐮wtsubscript𝐮subscript𝑤𝑡\\mathbf{u}_{w_{t}} and 𝐯wcsubscript𝐯subscript𝑤𝑐\\mathbf{v}_{w_{c}}.\nThe problem can be framed as a binary classification task in which words are predicted to be present (or absent) from the context of wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t}.\nA similarity function s​(wc,wt)𝑠subscript𝑤𝑐subscript𝑤𝑡s(w_{c},w_{t}) between two words wcsubscript𝑤𝑐w_{c} and wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t}, can be computed as the scalar product 𝐮wtT​𝐯wcsuperscriptsubscript𝐮subscript𝑤𝑡𝑇subscript𝐯subscript𝑤𝑐\\mathbf{u}_{w_{t}}^{T}\\mathbf{v}_{w_{c}}.\nThe representations obtained by training the described method on a large corpus correctly approximates the semantic meaning of words. In the last few years, continuous word representation has been applied in a growing number of application areas, achieving state-of-the-art results in the natural language processing field  in tasks such as part of speech tagging, named entity recognition and document classification. The described approach has been first proposed by the word2vec skipgram model [ref]16. Word2vec, however, is limited by the lack of morphological knowledge of a word.\nWhen computing the representation of a word, none of its morphological components are taken into account. Let’s take for instance two morphologically similar words, house and housing. Their computation does not share any common element and the final representation of the words will not be influenced by their similarities.\nFasttext  was presented as a solution to this issue and has proven to be more effective in the representation of a word using continuous representations.\nThe novel aspect is in the way representations are computed. At first the n-grams that compose a word are extracted. For each n-gram a continuous vector representation is computed, using the same methodology as word2vec. The representation of the original words is finally obtained as the sum of its n-gram components.\nUsing this technique, the final representation of a word is conditioned by its morphological structure. When two words share one or more n-grams their vectors will be the sum of at least one common element, which will bias both vectors in being more similar to each other.\nAn additionally advantage of the fasttext approach is the way out-of-vocabulary words (words that never appear in the training corpus, and whose representation is hence unknown) are handled. When using fixed approach such as word2vec, out of vocabulary words are represented as a static vector, usually randomly sampled from a normal distribution. Fasttext instead is able to compute the representation in a meaningful way, given that at least one of the n-grams in the out-of-vocabulary term has been computed previously in the training corpus.\nFigure 2 shows a visual comparison between word2vec (Figure 2(a)) and fasttext (Figure 2(b)). Continuous word representations have already been applied to chord symbols with promising results. In chord2vec  the authors obtain state-of-the-art results on the log-likelihood estimation task. Log-likelihood estimation is the task of correctly estimating, given one element in a sequence, the probabilities of another element being the upcoming element in the sequence.\nChord2vec is inspired by the word2vec method, in which chords are represented by the notes that they are composed of.\nThe representation model proposed by chord2vec is similar to pitchclass2vec.\nInstead of computing chord representations with the notes that compose a chord, the representations of pitchclass2vec takes into account the relationship between the notes that compose each chord. An in depth discussion is presented in section 3. More recently, word2vec-based approach on symbolic chord annotations has been analyzed by .\nChord representations are based on the chord label without taking into account the notes that compose it. The encoding is then used on two different tasks: chord clustering and log-likelihood estimation.\nThe log-likelihood estimation task is used to investigate the historical harmonic style of different composers.\nThe log-likelihood results strongly correlates with current musicological knowledge. For instance the model finds difficult to predict chords from artists that make a sporadic use of common harmonic progressions .\nFThe chord clustering task highlights how it’s possible to observe similarities between functionally equivalent chords (chords that shares notes between each other) and a well defined difference between functionally different chords.\nContinuous word representations are hence adequate to encode chords in the first place, and more importantly they are able to autonomously internalize relations between chords that have been previously observed by domain experts.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Automatic segmentation on audio signal is a prolific research field in which many different solutions have been presented, ranging from self-similarity matrices   to neural network based methods [ref]22 [ref]23 .
