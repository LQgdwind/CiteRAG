      "content": "Paper Title: A Fully Adaptive Radau Method for the Efficient Solution of Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations at Low Tolerances\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHigh-precision solving of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is required in many disciplines, from controls and safety scenarios such as identifying potential asteroid collisions , to robustly resolving chemical reactions in astrochemistry which span more time scales than which 64-bit floating point numbers can account for . There are many traditional scenarios where high precision is required as well, for example, in pharmacometrics it is a requirement during inference to solve the model to a much lower tolerance than what‚Äôs generally used in simulation (tolerances of around 1e-10) in order to improve the robustness of the fitting schemes [ref]3. This is due to the fact that calculating derivatives of ODE solutions incurs error from the forward pass and induced solver error from the extended equations for the forward/adjoint pass, making higher forward simulation accuracy a requirement in order to achieve accurate gradients and thus a stable optimization scheme [ref]4 . There is a wealth of high-order schemes for non-stiff ODEs, including the higher order Verner methods , dop853 , high order Gauss-Legendre schemes , and adaptive-order adaptive-time Adams-Bashforth-Moulton schemes like those developed in LSODE [ref]9 and CVODE 0 1. Higher order schemes tend to be more efficient at computing solutions to higher accuracy due to the faster convergence with respect to shortened d‚Äãtùëëùë°dt . In the SciML open source benchmarks, on non-stiff equations at high accuracy (required errors of roughly 1e-10 and below), schemes above order 5 such as Vern9 typically dominate in terms of performance. However, there are many fundamental difficulties for achieving higher-precision solving via high-order methods for stiff equations. Importantly, it is known for many of the standard schemes that an order of 5 is the absolute maximum that can be achieved. For example, with implicit backwards differentiation formulae (BDF) integrators it is known that there is an order barrier where the 6th order method is too unstable for most use cases and all orders above are not zero stable 2, limiting all standard implementations such as lsoda 3, CVODE 0 1, ode15s 4, to be an adaptive order scheme where order cannot go above 5 (but is generally bounded below 3 for highly stiff equations for stability region concerns). Meanwhile, singularly-implicit diagonal Runge-Kutta schemes (SDIRK) and common Rosenbrock-Wanner schemes with single Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma all have a maximum order of 5 1, which is the reason the vast majority of other common stiff ODE solvers are below this order bound such as rodas 5, the FATODE suite 6, Rodas5P 7, and many more. Implicit extrapolation methods could use extra internal stages to overcome this order barrier and achieve arbitrary order, though traditional Fortran implementations such as Seulex and SODEX were never able to achieve the efficiency of the more commonly used ODE solver schemes and the recent Julia advances require using extra compute (exploiting multithreading) in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance 8. Thus the only commonly used stiff ODE software for stiff equations which overcomes this order barrier are the RadauIIA schemes, which were popularized by Ernst Hairer‚Äôs implementation of radau in Fortran 9. This implementation was a major achievement which uses the fact that RadauIIA schemes of arbitrary order can be derived and are A-B-L stable, giving a platform to build an arbitrary order scheme which is not stability bound for the higher order calculations. However, in order to reduce the computation and due to fundamental programming limitations of the time, the radau scheme pre-derived the schemes for only order 5, 9, and 13 and only for double precision (64-bit) floating point numbers. As such, the scheme tends to perform well for problems defined in double precision which require sufficient accuracy, doing well in the SciML benchmarks for problems which range between 1e-10 to the 64-bit floating point accuracy limit of around 1e-14. In addition, this older limitation does not effectively exploit many of the features of modern hardware, such as pervasive multithreading, single-input multiple data (SIMD) registers, and higher-precision / mixed-precision arithmetic. For these reasons, we developed a modern implementation of the adaptive-order adaptive-time RadauIIA schemes in Julia which overcomes the previously mentioned issues and is able to fully exploit modern hardware. The software we have developed is available for use in Julia‚Äôs OrdinaryDiffEq.jl package, part of the DifferentialEquations.jl interface 4. Much of the theory detailed in this article is adapted from Hairer‚Äôs original implementation  and 1. However, our modernization includes a few crucial details, such as the ability to automatically derive order coefficients to arbitrary order to arbitrary user-chosen precision. As such, our adaptive-order scheme can automatically adapt to any order limit chosen by the user, and ultimately generate efficient schemes to any error tolerance provided by the user. Through benchmarks we demonstrate that this scheme achieves state-of-the-art efficiency when highly accurate solutions to stiff ODEs are required.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: during inference to solve the model to a much lower tolerance than what‚Äôs generally used in simulation (tolerances of around 1e-10) in order to improve the robustness of the fitting schemes [ref]3.
