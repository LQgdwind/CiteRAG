      "content": "Paper Title: Image-based Deep Learning for Smart Digital Twins: a Review\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage data collection techniques involve selecting and deploying appropriate sensors to capture visual information from the physical system. This can include 360° camera , thermal camera , web camera , 3D Scanner , depth sensors , RGB camera   or even drones equipped with imaging capabilities. So, we can select a sensor from the wide range of sensors, but that relies on the application’s unique requirements and the specific kind of visual data needed for the digital twin. The physical and digital systems are connected through the network to communicate and exchange data in real-time . Next, the physical system processes and sends the data to the digital system  . In addition, synthetic images can be generated using game engines like Unity Perception Package [ref]15, Microsoft AirSim [ref]16, and UnrealROX  in the digital system. Different DTs leverage these synthetic images to improve the training dataset and increase the models'performance and robustness  [ref]16 . Moreover, combining the real and synthetic images can generate new images to train the model effectively . As synthetic data are created using the software, they are prelabeled. So we do not need extra effort to label them. The preprocess and labeling data can be stored in the Data Storage to use them in the future or to train the model . ML and deep learning algorithms train the digital system on the preprocessed data. These algorithms help to analyze the data and recognize features like detecting people, objects, defects, and system surveillance     . Moreover, the output of the models is used to monitor and control the physical system. Finally, the predictions or outcomes made by the digital system are sent back to the physical system, where the physical works based on the feedback   . In summary, smart DTusually begins with data collection from the physical system, followed by data processing and transmission to the digital system. Then, if needed, data is further processed, or synthetic images are generated in the digital system or stored in the storage. After that, different ML or deep learning models are trained on them to predict the output  . So, an intelligent image-based DT architecture leverages image processing, deep learning, and ML techniques to create a connected system to build the smart DT.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: data in real-time .
