      "content": "Paper Title: BERT Loses Patience: Fast and Robust Inference with Early Exit\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Learning models have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that are slightly altered with perturbations often indistinguishable to humans [ref]47. Jin et al.  revealed that PLMs can also be attacked with a high success rate. Recent studies   attribute the vulnerability partially to the overthinking problem, arguing that it can be mitigated by early exit mechanisms. In our experiments, we use a state-of-the-art adversarial attack method, TextFooler , which demonstrates effectiveness on attacking BERT. We conduct black-box attacks on three datasets: SNLI , MNLI  and Yelp [ref]49. Note that since we use the pre-tokenized data provided by Jin et al. , the results on MNLI differ slightly from the ones in Table 1. We attack the original ALBERT-base model, ALBERT-base with Shallow-Deep  and with Patience-based Early Exit. As shown in Table 5, we report the original accuracy, after-attack accuracy and the number of queries needed by TextFooler to attack each model. Our approach successfully defends more than 3×3\\times attacks compared to the original ALBERT on NLI tasks, and 2×2\\times on the Yelp sentiment analysis task. Also, PABEE increases the number of queries needed to attack by a large margin, providing more protection to the model. Compared to Shallow-Deep , our model demonstrates significant robustness improvements. To analyze, although the early exit mechanism of Shallow-Deep can prevent the aforementioned overthinking problem, it still\nrelies on a single classifier to make the final prediction, which makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In comparison,\nsince Patience-based Early Exit exploits multiple layers and classifiers, the attacker has to fool multiple classifiers (which may exploit different features) at the same time, making it much more difficult to attack the model. This effect is similar to the merits of ensemble learning against adversarial attack, discussed in previous studies 0 1 2.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: Deep Learning models have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that are slightly altered with perturbations often indistinguishable to humans [ref]47.
