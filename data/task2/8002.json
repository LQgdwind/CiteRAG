      "content": "Paper Title: IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe literature on prophet inequalities models with deterministic horizon is vast. The techniques required for RH differ significantly, and the reader interested in the deterministic setting is referred to surveys such as , which contains many recent developments;  , for an economic point of view (including applications to Posted Price Mechanisms and more broadly online auctions); , for classical results concerning infinite instances. Besides the classical and IID PI, already reviewed in Section¬†1.1, the other two main models with deterministic horizon we mention here are the Random Order and the Order Selection PI. In the first the random values arrive in a uniform random order (this model has been shown to be 0.67240.67240.6724-competitive in  and 0.72350.72350.7235-hard in ), in the second the order can be chosen by the gambler (this model has been shown to be 0.72580.72580.7258-competitive in  and is 1/Œ≤1ùõΩ\\nicefrac{{1}}{{\\beta}}-hard, since the IID PI is a particular case). The existing literature strictly related to RH is limited to   , which explore the topic from the point of view of online automated mechanism design (see  for a survey), with a strong emphasis on the multiple-items setting. Although the setting treated in this work is the single-item one, it is crucial, since a standard machinery has already been developed in  to extend results for single-item RH to multiple items, as long as the horizons for each item are uniformly bounded. To the best of our knowledge,  is the first paper to consider the problem of unknown market size (that is, random horizon with unknown distribution). As an example of practical applications of RH, the original motivation proposed by the authors was that in search keyword auctions such as Google, the supply (search queries that the users enter, resulting in a search results page on which ads can be displayed) is not known in advance, and arrives in an online fashion. This is a multi-unit auction of unknown size for a perishable item (the search queries, who perish within a fraction of a second), to be allocated to buyers (the ads that will be displayed on the search results page). Their analysis provides constant-approximations of both the online and offline optimal single-price algorithm. These results are limited to unknown horizons. This assumption has later been shown to be hard for RH in . In practice, distributional knowledge is available via the history of past transactions. Therefore, in  the focus shifted to admitting known horizons. As to obtaining constant-approximations, however, they focus solely on generalising to multiple items the additive prophet inequality of 1 for bounded value distributions, whereas our main focus is on multiplicative prophet inequalities, in line with , already extensively reviewed (see Section¬†1.2). In the remaining of this section we will focus on another well-known problem in theoretical computer science, the Secretary Problem (SP), extensively studied in the random horizon setting, partially inspiring our approach. For the history and variations on the problem see  . The classical SP is as follows: let nùëõn be a known number of secretaries for hire. They are interviewed in an online fashion by the employer, all n!ùëõn! possible orderings being equally likely. The employer is able, at the end of each interview, to rank all the secretaries that have been presented so far ( relative ranks). Each time, the employer must either hire (and stop with the interview), or irrevocably reject the secretary (and proceed with the next interview, except for the last one: the employer will have to hire the last secretary, if the previous n‚àí1ùëõ1n-1 were rejected). The objective is maximising the probability of choosing the best secretary, that is the one having absolute rank 111. The problem is solved in : the optimal stopping rule consists in rejecting all the first r‚àí1ùëü1r-1 of the nùëõn secretaries, and to accept the first secretary, which is better than all previous ones (relative rank 111) thereafter. The number r=rnùëüsubscriptùëüùëõr=r_{n} can be characterised such that as n‚ü∂‚àû‚ü∂ùëõn\\longrightarrow\\infty, both r/nùëüùëõ\\nicefrac{{r}}{{n}} and the probability of selecting the best (secretary) tend to 1/e‚âà0.36791ùëí0.3679\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}}\\approx 0.3679. This result is also obtained in  through an alternative study of an underlying Markov chain. Consider the following process {xt}t‚àà[n]0subscriptsubscriptùë•ùë°ùë°subscriptdelimited-[]ùëõ0\\{x_{t}\\}_{t\\in[n]_{0}}: if the employer enumerates the secretaries in the order in which they are encountered, and then lets x0=1subscriptùë•01x_{0}=1, and for t‚àà[n]ùë°delimited-[]ùëõt\\in[n], lets xtsubscriptùë•ùë°x_{t} be the number of the first secretary, which is preferable to the one denoted by xt‚àí1subscriptùë•ùë°1x_{t-1}; then we have that {xt}subscriptùë•ùë°\\{x_{t}\\} is a Markov chain with state space [n]delimited-[]ùëõ[n]. Potential-based optimal stopping techniques yield the aforementioned results. The Markovian approach is crucial to the analysis of random horizon SP. When the number of secretaries is random, it is denoted by NùëÅN, and the secretaries are interviewed in uniform random order, conditionally on NùëÅN. At each interview the employer, who has distributional knowledge of NùëÅN, makes the decision of stopping in ignorance of whether there will be a secretary to interview next. The employer would obtain no reward, in the eventuality that the secretary just rejected was indeed the last. This model was first studied in  through a generalisation of the Markovian approach of . The optimal stopping rule is no longer as simple as in the deterministic case, where we had that it is optimal to stop after a waiting time, as soon as a secretary having relative rank 111 is interviewed. This is called one stopping island scenario. Depending on the horizon‚Äôs distribution, we can have a more complicated set ŒìŒì\\Gamma composed of multiple islands, in which it is optimal to stop at a secretary with relative rank 111, and outside which it is not. For uniform, geometric and Poisson horizons there still is only one island yielding non-vanishing asymptotics of the probability of choosing the best, but the value varies. In [ref]1 it was later shown that a hard family of horizons {Nm}subscriptùëÅùëö\\{N_{m}\\} (with supp‚Å°(Nm)=[m]0suppsubscriptùëÅùëösubscriptdelimited-[]ùëö0\\operatorname{supp}(N_{m})=[m]_{0}, for every m‚àà‚Ñïùëö‚Ñïm\\in\\mathbb{N}) could be constructed, meaning that as m‚ü∂‚àû‚ü∂ùëöm\\longrightarrow\\infty, the probability of choosing the best vanishes. In order to recover a constant nonzero limiting value, more information is needed. PS has also been studied in its full-information variant, that is when the common continuous distribution, from which the quality measurement of each of the nùëõn secretaries is sampled independently, is known by the employer, who can proceed to directly inspect, at each interview, the secretary‚Äôs true quality. A first heuristic solution to this problem was given in  via a backward induction argument. A rigorous proof of this form of the optimal stopping rule was successively derived in  via the Markovian approach. The full-information variant has also been studied with random horizon by , where the Markovian approach of  is successfully extended. To the best of our knowledge, a hard instance is not yet known for the full-information problem with random horizon. Both no- and full-information PS have also been studied under the harder hypothesis of random freeze, respectively in  . In this case, given nùëõn secretaries, interviews may have to stop at an independent random time N‚â§nùëÅùëõN\\leq n, with distribution known to the employer. Finally, we mention a variant of SP studied in : instead of seeking to maximise the probability of choosing the best, the employer seeks to minimise the expected rank of the chosen secretary. This problem was extended to bounded random horizons NùëÅN in , and studied for a parametric family of IHRIHR\\operatorname{IHR} horizons. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work, which investigates broad distributional classes (note that they are defined in terms of hazard rate properties) rather than families of distributions of a given form.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: which it is not.
