      "content": "Paper Title: Scoped Effects as Parameterized Algebraic Theories\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe central idea of algebraic effects  is that impure computation can be built and reasoned about equationally, using an algebraic theory.\nEffect handlers  are a way of implementing algebraic effects and provide a method for modularly programming with different effects.\nMore formally, an effect handler gives a model for an algebraic theory.\nIn this paper we develop equational reasoning for a notion arising from an extension of handlers, called scoped effects, using the framework of parameterized algebraic theories. The central idea of scoped effects (Sec. 2.2) is that certain parts of an impure computation should be dealt with one way, and other parts another way, inspired by scopes in exception handling.\nCompared to algebraic effects, the crucial difference is that the scope on which a scoped effect acts is delimited.\nThis difference leads to a complex relationship with monadic sequencing (>>=much-greater-thanabsent\\mathbin{>\\mkern-6.8mu>\\mkern-6.9mu=}).\nThe theory and practice of scoped effects       has primarily been studied by extending effect handlers to deal with not just algebraic operations, but also more complex scoped operations.\nThey form the basis of the fused-effects and polysemy libraries for Haskell.\nAside from exception handling, other applications include back-tracking in parsing  and timing analysis in telemetry [ref]39. Parameterized algebraic theories (Sec. 2.3) extend plain algebraic theories with variable binding operations for an abstract type of parameters. They have been used to study various resources including logic variables in logic programming , channels in the π𝜋\\pi-calculus , code pointers , qubits in quantum programming [ref]38, and urns in probabilistic programming .\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: form the basis of the fused-effects and polysemy libraries for Haskell.\nAside from exception handling, other applications include back-tracking in parsing  and timing analysis in telemetry [ref]39.
