Furthermore, several counter-forensic approaches have been developed to provide an appropriate analysis [ref]18  . These approaches are often very effective given the vulnerability of existing multimedia forensics tools, which are commonly not designed to operate under adversarial settings. In this scenario, it is necessary to develop forensic techniques qualified for achieving high performance under adversarial settings, referred to as adversarial multimedia forensics  [ref]5. This turns out to be a challenging task due to the weakness of the traces usually handled by the forensic analysis.\n The goal of this research is to provide a robust detector (trained with videos captured in a different software and cameras) in adversarial multimedia forensics, in the unaware and aware scenarios, when the detector is unaware of the attacks (we refer to as unaware scenario) and in other scenarios when the detector is aware of the attacks (we refer to as aware scenario)  [ref]5.\n Our work is generally focused on adversarial multimedia forensic [ref]5  , and not on camera model identification  [ref]23 . As a result, the following questions are motivating us to write this paper: RQ1: How are the most current techniques efficient to identify the malicious videos from real ones? RQ2: How can a user detect a real background from a virtual one in videoconferencing software under adversarial settings? RQ3: What is the performance of such a detector against different attack/manipulation scenarios?\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: developing forensic tools to retrieve data and detect possible tampered multimedia documents . Furthermore, several counter-forensic approaches have been developed to provide an appropriate analysis [ref]18  . These approaches are often very effective given the vulnerability of existing multimedia forensics tools, which are commonly not designed to operate under adversarial settings.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
