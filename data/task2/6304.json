Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Conservative Prediction via Data-Driven Confidence Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n∗ Ensemble requires 5×5\\times the compute compared to other methods. We assess the capability of models fine-tuned with DCM to abstain from making incorrect predictions.\nWe evaluate on several toy and real-world image classification datasets that exhibit distribution shift. Datasets.\nWe evaluate selective classification performance on CIFAR-10  and CIFAR-10-C [ref]20, Waterbirds  [ref]52, Camelyon17 , and FMoW .\nThese datasets were chosen to evaluate selective classification performance in the presence of diverse distribution shifts: corrupted inputs in CIFAR-10-C, spurious correlations in Waterbirds, and new domains in Camelyon17 and FMoW. The specific ID/OOD settings for each dataset are as follows.\nFor CIFAR-10, the ID dataset is CIFAR-10 and the OOD dataset is CIFAR-10-C. The ID+OOD dataset is a 50-50 mix of the two datasets.\nFor Waterbirds, the ID dataset is the training split and the OOD dataset is a group-balanced validation set; we do not consider an ID+OOD dataset here.\nFor Camelyon17, the ID dataset consists of images from the first 333 hospitals, which are represented in the training data.\nThe OOD dataset consists of images from the last 222 hospitals, which do not appear in the training set.\nThe ID+OOD dataset is a mix of all five hospitals.\nFor FMoW, the ID dataset consists of images collected from the years 2002−2013200220132002-2013, which are represented in the training data.\nThe OOD setting tests on images collected between 2016−2018201620182016-2018, and the ID + OOD setting tests on images from 2002−2013200220132002-2013 and 2016−2018201620182016-2018. Comparisons.\nAs points of comparison, we consider 666 representative prior methods which have been shown to perform well on selective classification benchmarks:\nMSP [ref]21, MaxLogit , Binary Classifier , Fine-Tuning on the labeled ID validation set, Deep Gamblers , and Self-Adaptive Training .\nWe also evaluate Ensemble , an ensemble of 555 MSP models as a rough upper bound on performance given more compute.\nAll methods use the same labeled ID validation set for hyperparameter tuning and/or calibration. DCM outperforms other methods when OOD data is present.\nWe present representative metrics in Table 3 and complete tables with all metrics in Tables 8, 9 and 10.\nDCM consistently outperforms all baselines in settings of distribution shift (OOD and ID+OOD).\nDCM even outperforms Ensemble on three of the four datasets, despite requiring 1/5151/5 of the compute.\nFine-Tuning outperforms DCM when the training and validation datasets are from the same distribution (ID).\nIn settings where the test distribution differs from the training and validation distributions, DCM outperforms Fine-Tuning on most metrics.\nThese experiments indicate that the model learned by DCM is more meaningfully conservative in conditions of distribution shift, compared to state-of-the-art methods for uncertainty quantification and selective classification.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: evaluate on several toy and real-world image classification datasets that exhibit distribution shift. Datasets.\nWe evaluate selective classification performance on CIFAR-10  and CIFAR-10-C [ref]20, Waterbirds  [ref]52, Camelyon17 , and FMoW .\nThese datasets were chosen to evaluate selective classification performance in the presence of diverse distribution shifts: corrupted inputs in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
