Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Sample Named Entity Recognition for Security Vulnerability Reports by Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe role of NER is not limited to serving as the first step of vulnerable software identification as in the VIEM system .\nIndeed, there has been extensive applications of the NER in miscellaneous computer security tasks. Feng et al. emphasize the importance of NER applications targeted at software domain for developing security applications like detecting compromised and vulnerable devices\n [ref]11.\nYe et al. investigate the challenge of NER involving software, and they note that the common word polysemy is one important factor that complicates the task  [ref]46.\nPandita et al. identifies software names in the description of mobile applications with NER together with other techniques;\nthen they locate the sentences pertaining to security permissions with extracted information  .\nSun et al. notice the sizable difference between the source of CVE records named ExploitDB and CVE database in terms of both content completeness and update time.\nThey, therefore, propose to automatically extract the relevant information from ExploitDB descriptions to create CVE records with NER and other technologies  .\nMa et al. cast the API extraction from software documentation as an NER task, and they leverage an LSTM-based architecture to obtain high-fidelity APIs across different libraries and languages through fine-tuning and transfer learning  [ref]27.\nAnother work by Ye et al. attempts to use the NER to enable entity-centric applications for software engineering  . However, when they reduce their training data to 10% of the original dataset, their NER model’s performance drop from an F1 score of 78% to 60%.\nThis drop in performance highlights the difficulty of building NER systems in the few-shot setting. Our work strives to identify vulnerabilities from public security reports, and therefore treats NER as a vehicle;\nfurthermore, the architecture we leverage also benefits from fine-tuning and transfer learning.\nHowever, we face a unique challenge of resource constraints: our system should reach competitive systems’ performance with as few labeled samples as possible.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: computer security tasks. Feng et al. emphasize the importance of NER applications targeted at software domain for developing security applications like detecting compromised and vulnerable devices\n [ref]11.\nYe et al. investigate the challenge of NER involving software, and they note that the common word polysemy is one important factor that complicates the task  [ref]46.\nPandita et al.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
