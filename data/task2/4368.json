      "content": "Paper Title: Stroke-Based Autoencoders: Self-Supervised Learners for Efficient Zero-Shot Chinese Character Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNatural language processing (NLP) tasks have achieved great success using self-supervised learning methods. Large-scale pre-trained models, such as Bert and GPT[ref]2, have become essential backbones in text classification[ref]3, question answering, and natural language understanding.\nChinese characters emerged as hieroglyphs and naturally carry very rich morphological and semantic information.\nTherefore, the pictographic structures of Chinese characters can further facilitate many language-dependent NLP tasks, such as the recognition of Chinese names [ref]7 and the segmentation of Chinese words.\nFor semantic enhancement, artificial encoding and image-based representation are the two main encoding styles for Chinese characters. Character encoding methods are often at Radical-level[ref]7 or Stroke-level. But these human-generated encoding approaches carry no spatial information and may lead to repetition.\nFor image representation, most methods extract information from Chinese character pictures directly 0, which generally fails to utilize global information with local information of Chinese characters simultaneously.\nBased on the above analysis, we explore a self-supervised learning strategy on Chinese character images to learn the encoding of Chinese characters and attempt to extract the characters’ semantic information in a more comprehensive and effective style. Self-supervised learning on images learns image representations by recovering masked images based on the encoding of input images.\nInspired by Transformer, Dosovitskiy et al. 1 apply Transformer directly to the sequences of image patches for image recognition, and Bao et al. 2 propose a masked image modeling task to pre-train Vision Transformers.\nMost recently, masked aotuencoder (MAE) 3 masks a high proportion(75%) of the input images and performs well on downstream tasks, such as image recognition, object detection, instance segmentation, to name a few.\nHowever, these methods cannot be applied directly to Chinese character images, since there are great differences between Chinese character images and general images in terms of both image structure features and semantic information.\nTo be specific, (i) Chinese character images are usually space discrete, with the smallest unit stroke, while the general images are continuous with unit pixel, so the random mask may not work. (ii) Chinese characters are human-generated signals that are information dense with highly structured semantics, and every stroke or radical part may have its special informative meaning. (iii) Each Chinese character can be represented as a time series of images that carry information throughout its fixed order of strokes, as shown in Fig. 1. Driven by the above analysis, we propose a stroke-based autoencoder (SAE) to extract the morphological information from the sequences of each Chinese character images. More specifically, our framework consists of two parts: (i) the encoder network, which operates on the image patches of Chinese characters to obtain encoded patches, and (ii) the decoder network, which reconstructs the stroke sequence images of each corresponding Chinese character. The encoder in our SAE pre-training model aims at extracting the semantic information from stroke images, and the decoder learns to predict the sequences of the writing order of Chinese characters.\nSome example results are illustrated in Fig. 2. We choose some Chinese characters, all of which have eight strokes for a neat illustration. The left column (with a yellow background) is the images of Chinese characters ’鸣’, ’图’, ’茄’ and ’迢’ in training dataset, and the right column (with a pale blue background) are images of ’茑’, ’咚’, ’迦’ and ’苕’ in the validation data set. Each Chinese character can be divided into two radical components, as illustrated in the middle column (with a light green background). These characters are made up of seven basic radical components, as illustrated at the bottom of the figure.\nFor each character, the first row is the original stroke sequence images, i.e., their canonical order of strokes, and the second row is the corresponding stroke sequence predicted by our SAE model.\nThe example results demonstrate that our pre-training model can successfully predict and reconstruct the unseen strokes and radicals of Chinese characters. Therefore, Our SAE can be applied to enrich word embeddings for downstream NLP tasks such as Chinese Named Entity Recognition. It can also be applied to explore the application of Chinese character structures, such as zero-shot Chinese character recognition(zero-shot CCR).\nIn this paper, we focus on the morphological structures of Chinese characters and utilize our pre-training models to explore zero-shot Chinese character recognition and word embeddings. we design two different SAE architectures on different forms of stroke images for different tasks.\nThe experimental results validate that our SAE outperforms the previous results4 5 6 on zero-shot recognition of Chinese characters. What is more encouraging is that our SAE is pre-trained on a small and concise dataset with printed Chinese character images, but boosts huge performance in zero-shot recognition on a large and complicated dataset consisting of handwritten Chinese character images.\nMeanwhile, the word embedding generated by our SAE is used to calculate the word similarity of Chinese characters and their radical parts as an intrinsic task. The experiment shows that our SAE can reliably extract rich semantic information from Chinese characters. The main contributions of our work are as follows. (1) We present a stroke-based autoencoder (SAE) pre-training model through self-supervised learning. The pre-trained SAE model successfully captures the morphological and semantic information of Chinese characters. (2) We design two contrasting architecturesc(Vision Transformer vs. Resnet+Transformer) in varying forms of stroke images for different tasks, namely zero-shot Chinese character recognition and semantic enhancement. (3) The pre-trained SAE model is fine-tuned with the existing stroke-based method and outperforms other existing methods in zero-shot recognition. This model can also be applied to enrich Chinese word embeddings from their morphological structures.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Natural language processing (NLP) tasks have achieved great success using self-supervised learning methods.
