      "content": "Paper Title: Beneficial Perturbation Network for designing general adaptive artificial intelligence systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFour major types of methods have been proposed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Type 1: constrain the network weights to preserve performance on old tasks while training the new task    (Fig. 2a); A famous example of type 1 methods is EWC . EWC constrains certain parameters based on how important they are to previously seen tasks. The importance is calculated from their task-specific Fisher information matrix. However, solely relying on constraining the parameters of the core network eventually exhausts the core network’s capacity to accommodate new tasks. After learning many tasks, EWC cannot learn anymore because the parameters become too constrained (see Results). Type 2: dynamic network expansion    [ref]53 creates new capacity for the new task, which can often be combined with constrained network weights for previous tasks (Fig. 2b-c); However, this type is not scalable because it is not parameter efficient (e.g., 11.9% - 60.3% additional parameters per task for dynamically expandable networks [ref]53). Type 3: using an episodic memory    to store a subset of the original dataset from previous tasks, then rehearsing it while learning new tasks to maintain accuracy on the old tasks (Fig. 2d).  However, this type is not scalable because it is neither memory nor parameter efficient. All three approaches attempt to shift the network’s single fixed mapping initially obtained by learning the first task to a new one that satisfies both old and new tasks. They create a new, but still fixed mapping from inputs to outputs across all tasks so far, combined. Type 4: Partition Network: using task-dependent context     or mask matrices [ref]33 [ref]8 [ref]8 1 8 to partition the original network into several small sub-networks (Fig. 2e, flow chart - Fig. S1a). Zeng et al.  used context matrices to partition the network into independent subspaces spanned by rows in the weight matrices to avoid interference between tasks. However, context matrices introduce as many additional parameters as training a separate neural network for each new task (additional 100% parameters per task). To reduce parameter costs, Cheung et al. proposed binary context matrices , further restricted to diagonal matrices with -1 and 1 values. The restricted context matrices  (1 and -1 values) behave similarly to mask matrices [ref]33 (0 and 1 values) that split the core network into several sub-networks for different tasks. With too many tasks, the core network would eventually run out of capacity to accommodate any new task, because there is no vacant route or subspace left. Although type 4 methods create multiple input to output mappings for different tasks, many of these methods are too expensive in terms of parameters, and none of them has enough capacity to accommodate numerous tasks because methods such as PSP run out of unrealized capacity of the core network. In marked contrast to the above artificial neural network methods, here, we propose a fundamentally new fifth type (Fig. 2f, flow chart - Fig. S1 b): We add out-of-network, task-dependent bias units to neural network. Bias units enable a neural network to switch into different modes to process different independent tasks through beneficial perturbations (the memory storage cost of these new bias units is actually lower than the cost of adding a new mask or context matrix). With only an additional 0.3% of parameters per mode 111 Check supplementary discussion for more information about additional parameter costs, this structure allows BPN to learn potentially unlimited task-dependent mappings from inputs to outputs for different tasks. The strengths and weaknesses of each type are in Fig. 2g.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: network’s capacity to accommodate new tasks.
