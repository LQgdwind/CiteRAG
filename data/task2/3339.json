This section is inspired in part by . \nx𝑥xy𝑦yQ𝑄QC𝐶C(Ω,π)Ω𝜋\\left(\\Omega,\\pi\\right)\n The intuition is illustrated on Figure 1, which will guide us for the different notions attached to Mixed Systems. A Mixed System will be a pair, consisting of a probability space (Ω,π)Ω𝜋(\\Omega,\\pi) and a state space Q𝑄Q collecting the configurations of a tuple of state variables (here: x𝑥x and y𝑦y), related by a relation C𝐶C. The probability space is “private”, in that it is not directly exposed to any interaction with the environment. Interactions with the environment only occur through the state variables, thus seen as “visible”. This distinction private/visible is shown on Figure 1 by the outgoing pins x,y𝑥𝑦x,y, which contrast with the absence of outgoing pin for the probabilistic box. We are interested in understanding how Mixed Systems are “executed” (we call this the sampling), and how state properties—which are not by themselves random—can still get some kind of probabilistic evaluation. A Mixed System (or system for short) is a tuple S=(Ω,π,X,C)𝑆Ω𝜋𝑋𝐶S=(\\Omega,\\pi,X,C), where: (Ω,π)Ω𝜋(\\Omega,\\pi) is a probability space; X𝑋X is a finite set of variables with domain Q=∏x∈XQx𝑄subscriptproduct𝑥𝑋subscript𝑄𝑥\\begin{array}[]{c}Q=\\prod_{x\\in{X}}Q_{x}\\end{array}; and C⊆Ω×Q𝐶Ω𝑄C\\subseteq{\\Omega{\\times}{Q}} is a relation. In the sequel, we write to mean (ω,q)∈C𝜔𝑞𝐶(\\omega,q){\\in}C. S𝑆S is called consistent if π​(Ω𝖼)>0𝜋superscriptΩ𝖼0\\pi(\\Omega^{\\sf c})>0, where\nΩ𝖼=def{ω∈Ω∣∃q:ω​C​q}subscriptdefsuperscriptΩ𝖼conditional-set𝜔Ω:𝑞𝜔𝐶𝑞\\Omega^{\\sf c}\\,=_{\\rm def}\\,\\{\\omega{\\in}\\Omega\\mid\\exists{q}:\\omega C{q}\\}.\nIf S𝑆S is consistent, its sampling is well defined and consists in: sampling ω∈Ω𝜔Ω\\omega{\\in}\\Omega according to conditional probability π𝖼superscript𝜋𝖼\\pi^{\\sf c}, where: and, then, nondeterministically selecting q∈Q𝑞𝑄q{\\in}{Q} such that ω​C​q𝜔𝐶𝑞\\omega C{q}. This two-step procedure is denoted by S​⤳​q𝑆⤳𝑞S\\,{\\leadsto}\\,q. If S𝑆S is consistent, its probabilistic semantics is defined as the pair π¯,π¯:2Q→ [ref]1:¯𝜋¯𝜋→superscript2𝑄01\\overline{\\pi},\\underline{\\pi}:2^{Q}\\rightarrow [ref]1, where, for\nany state property A⊆Q𝐴𝑄A\\subseteq{Q}: The following generalized likelihood ℓ:2Q→ [ref]1:ℓ→superscript2𝑄01\\ell:2^{Q}\\rightarrow [ref]1 is also of interest: In the sequel, we shall denote by 𝕊​(X)𝕊𝑋\\mathbb{S}(X) the class of all (possibly inconsistent) Mixed Systems having X𝑋X as their set of variables. □□\\Box π¯¯𝜋\\overline{\\pi} defined by formula (25) is not a probability on Q𝑄Q, but only an outer probability111sometimes called also exterior or upper probability., i.e., a function π¯:2Q→ [ref]1:¯𝜋→superscript2𝑄01\\overline{\\pi}:2^{Q}\\rightarrow [ref]1 such that π¯​(∅)=0¯𝜋0\\overline{\\pi}(\\emptyset)=0, π¯​(Q)=1¯𝜋𝑄1\\overline{\\pi}(Q)=1, and π¯¯𝜋\\overline{\\pi} is sub-additive, meaning that it satisfies Note that (28) resembles (25) if we rewrite the latter as π¯​(A)=∑ω∈Ω∃Aπ𝖼​(ω)¯𝜋𝐴subscript𝜔subscriptΩ𝐴superscript𝜋𝖼𝜔\\overline{\\pi}(A)=\\sum_{\\omega\\in{\\Omega_{{\\exists}A}}}\\pi^{\\sf c}(\\omega). The same comments hold, mutatis mutandis, regarding the inner probability π¯¯𝜋\\underline{\\pi}, which is super-additive. Note that, [Specializing to pure nondeterministic systems]\n A pure nondeterministic system is specified as a subset C^⊆Q^𝐶𝑄\\widehat{C}\\subseteq{Q} of the state space. To reformulate it as a Mixed System, simply take (Ω,π)Ω𝜋(\\Omega,\\pi) trivial, i.e., Ω={ω}Ω𝜔\\Omega=\\{\\omega\\}, a singleton, equipped with the trivial probability such that π​(ω)=1𝜋𝜔1\\pi(\\omega)=1, and define ω​C​q𝜔𝐶𝑞\\omega C{q} iff q∈C^𝑞^𝐶q\\in\\widehat{C}. □□\\Box [Specializing to pure probabilistic systems]\n A pure probabilistic system is specified as a pair (Ω,π)Ω𝜋(\\Omega,\\pi). To reformulate as a Mixed System, take Q=Ω𝑄ΩQ=\\Omega, and let C𝐶C be the diagonal of Ω×QΩ𝑄\\Omega\\times{Q}; finally, let x𝑥x be the variable with domain Q𝑄Q. □□\\Box To capture the blending of nondeterminism and probability, outer probabilities are directly used in the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence   .222Outer and inner probabilities were called upper and lower in  . Outer probabilities do not support key limit theorems for use in statistics, such as the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and more. Hence, whereas the theory of evidence comes with reasoning capabilities, it does not directly support learning or estimation. In formal methods for probabilistic systems (in the context of imperative programming), the blending of probability and nondeterminism was addressed by a number of authors, see, e.g.,       [ref]21 . Nondeterministic choice between alternatives is considered in  and written P⊓P′square-intersection𝑃superscript𝑃′P\\,{\\sqcap}\\,P^{\\prime}, whereas probabilistic choice is specified as P⊕aP′P\\,{{}_{a}\\oplus}\\,P^{\\prime} (P𝑃P is selected with probability a𝑎a and P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} with probability 1−a1𝑎1{-}a) or P⊕baP′P\\,{{}_{a}\\oplus_{b}}\\,P^{\\prime} (P𝑃P is selected with probability at least a𝑎a and P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} with probability at least b𝑏b). The evaluation of formulas must specify how nondeterminism interplays with probabilities. A comprehensive approach was proposed in [ref]21, where demonic and angelic nondeterminisms are seen as adversarial and beneficial, respectively. These notions mirror the outer and inner probabilities used in Dempster theory. Unfortunately, outer and inner probabilities do not bring limit theorems of probability theory (law of large numbers, etc.), which are the core of machine learning. Through formulas (25,26) in Definition 1, the probabilistic semantics of Mixed Systems is defined as the associated outer and inner probabilities. Hence, Mixed Systems offer the calculus of the theory of evidence, and mirror the demonic and angelic types of nondeterminism.\nOn the other hand, since classical probability spaces are first class citizens of the model of Mixed Systems, this model also preserves the apparatus needed for machine learning. In Appendix A.1, we develop a more detailed comparison of the semantics of Mixed Systems versus imperative probabilistic programming with demonic and angelic nondeterminism, following [ref]21. Finally, the generalized likelihood of formula (28) is the basis for inference, estimation, or machine learning, when multiple hypotheses or nuisance parameters are considered —we are not aware of any use of a mirror notion where “min” would be substituted for “max”. □□\\Box [outer probabilities]\n Consider model S1​‖S2‖​S3subscript𝑆1normsubscript𝑆2subscript𝑆3S_{1}\\|S_{2}\\|S_{3} of Section 1.2. Pick an instant n𝑛n and let S=defS​(n,xn−1,fn−1)subscriptdef𝑆𝑆𝑛subscript𝑥𝑛1subscript𝑓𝑛1S\\,=_{\\rm def}\\,S(n,x_{n-1},f_{n-1}) be the Mixed System defined by (5,6,10) for instant n𝑛n and given values for xn−1,fn−1subscript𝑥𝑛1subscript𝑓𝑛1x_{n-1},f_{n-1}. With reference to (11), we wish to evaluate the probability that xn>ymaxsubscript𝑥𝑛subscript𝑦x_{n}>y_{\\max} and yn≤ymaxsubscript𝑦𝑛subscript𝑦y_{n}\\leq y_{\\max} occurs under adversarial nondeterminism. Denoting by Qvsubscript𝑄𝑣Q_{v} the domain of v𝑣v and by 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} the Boolean domain, the underlying probability space of S𝑆S is (Ω,π)Ω𝜋(\\Omega,\\pi), where Ω=Qv×𝔹Ωsubscript𝑄𝑣𝔹\\Omega=Q_{v}{\\times}\\mathbb{B} and π=μ×β𝜋𝜇𝛽\\pi=\\mu{\\times}\\beta, where β𝛽\\beta is Bernoulli(10−6)superscript106(10^{-6}). Domain Q𝑄Q for the variables of S𝑆S is Q=Qx×Qy×Qu×Qv×𝔹×𝔹𝑄subscript𝑄𝑥subscript𝑄𝑦subscript𝑄𝑢subscript𝑄𝑣𝔹𝔹Q=Q_{x}{\\times}Q_{y}{\\times}Q_{u}{\\times}Q_{v}{\\times}\\mathbb{B}{\\times}\\mathbb{B}, and relation C𝐶C is defined by the nonprobabilistic equations of S𝑆S, i.e., (5,10) in which we discard the statement 𝑟𝑓n∼βsimilar-tosubscript𝑟𝑓𝑛𝛽\\mathit{rf}_{n}\\sim\\beta. Finally, let C​(un)𝐶subscript𝑢𝑛C(u_{n}) denote the relation C𝐶C in which the value of unsubscript𝑢𝑛u_{n} is given (u𝑢u is observed). Then\n Inspecting (5,10) shows that the condition defining set W𝑊W rewrites as First, if φ​(un,xn−1)≤ymax𝜑subscript𝑢𝑛subscript𝑥𝑛1subscript𝑦\\varphi(u_{n},x_{n-1})\\leq y_{\\max} holds, then W=∅𝑊W=\\emptyset. We thus assume in the sequel φ​(un,xn−1)>ymax𝜑subscript𝑢𝑛subscript𝑥𝑛1subscript𝑦\\varphi(u_{n},x_{n-1})>y_{\\max}. Thus we need to evaluate with respect to π¯¯𝜋\\overline{\\pi} the predicate Condition fn=Tsubscript𝑓𝑛Tf_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt T} is equivalent to the conjunction of the following two conditions: 1) 𝑏𝑘n=Fsubscript𝑏𝑘𝑛F\\mathit{bk}_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt F} (backup sensor is not available), 2) fn−1=Tsubscript𝑓𝑛1Tf_{n-1}{=}\\mbox{\\tt T} or 𝑟𝑓n=Tsubscript𝑟𝑓𝑛T\\mathit{rf}_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt T}. Recall that the value of fn−1subscript𝑓𝑛1f_{n-1} is given. We thus distinguish the following two cases: fn−1=Tsubscript𝑓𝑛1Tf_{n-1}{=}\\mbox{\\tt T}: then, fn=Tsubscript𝑓𝑛Tf_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt T} whatever the value of 𝑏𝑘nsubscript𝑏𝑘𝑛\\mathit{bk}_{n} is, and, using (34): fn−1=Fsubscript𝑓𝑛1Ff_{n-1}{=}\\mbox{\\tt F}: then, fn=Tsubscript𝑓𝑛Tf_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt T} if and only if 𝑟𝑓n=tsubscript𝑟𝑓𝑛t\\mathit{rf}_{n}{=}\\mbox{{t}} and 𝑏𝑘n=Fsubscript𝑏𝑘𝑛F\\mathit{bk}_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt F}. Thus, chosing 𝑏𝑘n=Fsubscript𝑏𝑘𝑛F\\mathit{bk}_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt F} ensures that: 𝑟𝑓n=tsubscript𝑟𝑓𝑛t\\mathit{rf}_{n}{=}\\mbox{{t}} and ψ​(φ​(un,xn−1),v)≤ymax𝜓𝜑subscript𝑢𝑛subscript𝑥𝑛1𝑣subscript𝑦\\psi(\\varphi(u_{n},x_{n-1}),v)\\leq y_{\\max} together yield yn≤ymaxsubscript𝑦𝑛subscript𝑦y_{n}{\\leq}y_{\\max}. Alternatively, 𝑏𝑘n=Tsubscript𝑏𝑘𝑛T\\mathit{bk}_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt T} prevents the condition yn≤ymaxsubscript𝑦𝑛subscript𝑦y_{n}{\\leq}y_{\\max} from occurring. By definition of the outer probability (25), we finally get, using (34): which corresponds to the probabilistic evaluation of the predicate “xn>ymaxsubscript𝑥𝑛subscript𝑦x_{n}{>}y_{\\max} and yn≤ymaxsubscript𝑦𝑛subscript𝑦y_{n}{\\leq}y_{\\max}” if the nondeterministic alternative 𝑏𝑘n=F/Tsubscript𝑏𝑘𝑛FT\\mathit{bk}_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt F}/\\mbox{\\tt T} is interpreted as demonic [ref]21. □□\\Box Conditioning is generally not considered in the field of probabilistic automata. It is, however, central in probabilistic programming, see, e.g.,   [ref]64 for studies in which conditioning is the main subject. The observe primitive, pervasive in all tools, is used to specify posterior distributions given constraints (as we do in Definition 1). The litterature on probabilistic programming distinguishes between hard (also called deterministic) and soft (also called stochastic) conditioning  [ref]64. In the basics of probability theory, however, the only notion is that of conditional expectation , from which other notions are derived, e.g., conditional probability, transition probability or stochastic kernel, and disintegration (or regular version of conditional expectation). Deriving such notions is straightforward in our case, since we restrict ourselves to discrete probability spaces. We will discuss this further when extending Bayesian networks to Mixed Systems, in Section 2.2. Inconsistency formalizes self-contradiction, for Mixed Systems.\nThe condition “π​(Ω𝖼)>0𝜋superscriptΩ𝖼0\\pi(\\Omega^{\\sf c})>0” in statement 2 of Definition 1 means that Ω𝖼superscriptΩ𝖼\\Omega^{\\sf c} has non-empty intersection with the support of π𝜋\\pi, defined as the set of ω𝜔\\omega’s of positive probability: π​(ω)>0𝜋𝜔0\\pi({\\omega})>0. This simple definition for the support, which is only valid for discrete probabilities, allows us to propose a simple definition for the notion of consistency. When continuous probability spaces are considered (like the Gaussian), the above definition for the support no longer holds. The right definition relies on topological properties. As a consequence, our elementary definition of consistency would no longer apply. This is next illustrated on our running example. [consistency] \nConsider model (18,22). Statement 2 of Definition 1 defines consistency as the existence of a state q𝑞q in relation through C𝐶C with an ω𝜔\\omega belonging to the support of π𝜋\\pi, which is fairly simple. Suppose, for a while, that un,xn,yn,vnsubscript𝑢𝑛subscript𝑥𝑛subscript𝑦𝑛subscript𝑣𝑛u_{n},x_{n},y_{n},v_{n} possess real domain, μ​(d​v)=χ​(v)​d​v𝜇𝑑𝑣𝜒𝑣𝑑𝑣\\mu(dv)=\\chi(v)dv, where d​v𝑑𝑣dv denotes the Lebesgue measure, density χ𝜒\\chi is continuous and everywhere positive, and function v↦ψ​(x,v)maps-to𝑣𝜓𝑥𝑣v\\mapsto\\psi(x,v) is bijective and bicontinuous for every fixed x𝑥x. Then, fixing the value of ynsubscript𝑦𝑛y_{n}, for a given pair (un,xn−1)subscript𝑢𝑛subscript𝑥𝑛1(u_{n},x_{n-1}), will fix the value of vnsubscript𝑣𝑛v_{n} if fn=Tsubscript𝑓𝑛Tf_{n}{=}\\mbox{\\tt T} in the equation defining ynsubscript𝑦𝑛y_{n}. With reference to Example 3, the only difference is that a parallel composition with the statement observe​yobserve𝑦{\\texttt{{\\color[rgb]{0,0,1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,1}observe}}}\\;y was added. So, it still makes sense to consider the two cases 1 and 2 of Example 3. In case 1, we get\nW={(𝑟𝑓,v)∣ψ​(φ​(un,xn−1),v)=yn}𝑊conditional-set𝑟𝑓𝑣𝜓𝜑subscript𝑢𝑛subscript𝑥𝑛1𝑣subscript𝑦𝑛W=\\left\\{(\\mathit{rf},v)\\mid\\psi(\\varphi(u_{n},x_{n-1}),v){=}y_{n}\\right\\}, whence (β×μ)​(W)=0𝛽𝜇𝑊0(\\beta{\\times}\\mu)(W){=}0. Deducing inconsistency would be nonsense, however, since the support of μ𝜇\\mu is ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}. This illustrates that our pedestrian definition of consistency no longer works if real variables and distributions having densities with respect to Lebesgue measure are considered.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: q∈Q𝑞𝑄q{\\in}{Q} such that ω​C​q𝜔𝐶𝑞\\omega C{q}.
