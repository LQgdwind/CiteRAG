      "content": "Paper Title: Morpho-logic from a Topos Perspective: Application to symbolic AI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModal logics have proved useful for many reasoning tasks in symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), such as belief revision, spatial reasoning, among others. On the other hand, mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory for non-linear analysis of structures, that was widely developed and applied in image analysis. In its deterministic setting, its mathematical bases rely on algebra, complete lattices, topology. Strong links have been established between MM and mathematical logics, mostly modal logics. Necessity □□\\Box and possibility ◇◇\\Diamond modalities are then interpreted by the two basic MM operators, namely erosion and dilation   . This interpretation allows for easy formulations of non-classical reasoning, including revision, merging, abduction [ref]3  0 , and spatial reasoning   . Erosion ε𝜀\\varepsilon and dilation δ𝛿\\delta are the two basic operations of MM often defined from a structuring element B𝐵B used to probe spatial structures to either dilate or erode them. More formally, in the set theoretical case, let E𝐸E be a Euclidean space (often ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} or ℤdsuperscriptℤ𝑑\\mathbb{Z}^{d} where d𝑑d is the space dimension). Let B𝐵B (the structuring element) be a subset of E𝐸E, and let Bx={x+b∣b∈B}subscript𝐵𝑥conditional-set𝑥𝑏𝑏𝐵B_{x}=\\{x+b\\mid b\\in B\\} be its translation at a point x∈E𝑥𝐸x\\in E. The dilation of a set X𝑋X by a structuring element B𝐵B is then defined as δ​[B]​(X)={x∈E∣Bˇx∩X≠∅}𝛿delimited-[]𝐵𝑋conditional-set𝑥𝐸subscriptˇ𝐵𝑥𝑋\\delta[B](X)=\\{x\\in E\\mid\\check{B}_{x}\\cap X\\neq\\emptyset\\}, where Bˇˇ𝐵\\check{B} is the symmetric of B𝐵B with respect to the origin of space, and the erosion of X𝑋X is defined as ε​[B]​(X)={x∈E∣Bx⊆X}𝜀delimited-[]𝐵𝑋conditional-set𝑥𝐸subscript𝐵𝑥𝑋\\varepsilon[B](X)=\\{x\\in E\\mid B_{x}\\subseteq X\\}. The structuring element B𝐵B can be equivalently defined as a binary relation on E𝐸E, i.e. where 𝒫​(E)𝒫𝐸\\mathcal{P}(E) is the powerset of E𝐸E. In this setting, the following properties hold111Note that, more generally in MM, algebraic erosions and dilations on lattices are actually defined as operations that commute with the infimum and supremum, respectively (i.e. intersection and union in (𝒫​(E),⊆)𝒫𝐸(\\mathcal{P}(E),\\subseteq)). These more general forms of operators do not necessarily involve structuring elements. The two first properties are then rather definitions in a more general setting.: erosion commutes with intersection and preserves E𝐸E, dilation commutes with union and preserves the empty set, and erosion and dilation defined from the same structuring element are dual operators with respect to complementation. All this means that erosion and dilation are modal operators, that is the tuple (𝒫​(E),∩,∪,_c,∅,E,ε​[B],δ​[B])𝒫𝐸superscript_𝑐𝐸𝜀delimited-[]𝐵𝛿delimited-[]𝐵(\\mathcal{P}(E),\\cap,\\cup,\\_^{c},\\emptyset,E,\\varepsilon[B],\\delta[B]) is a modal algebra. Hence, under this interpretation, modal logic is a tool for talking about spatial transformation, and in this setting, modal logic has been applied efficiently to symbolic artificial intelligence   . Until now, this link between MM and logic has been studied in the set framework (with extensions to fuzzy sets). Since then MM has been extended to a large family of algebraic structures such as graphs 7 8 6 , hypergraphs  , simplicial complexes 9, various logics, etc. All these extensions proved useful for knowledge representation and reasoning, taking into account low level information (points or neighborhood of points), structural information (e.g. based on spatial relations between regions or objects), prior knowledge, semantics, etc. To take into account all of these extensions abstractly, we now propose to deepen this link between binary MM and modal logic from a topos perspective 222All the previous mentioned extensions can be represented by presheaves whose categories are toposes.. Hence, paraphrasing a remark by O. Caramello in 5, every topos embodies a certain domain of reality, susceptible of becoming an object of knowledge (i.e. the idealized instantiations of this reality are the points of that topos). Toposes constitute a categorical structure defined by A. Grothendieck in the early sixties , which generalizes the notions of space, mathematical universe, and for what concerns us here, knowledge representation. The reason why the choice of toposes is natural is\nas follows.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, this choice remains in the spirit of toposes, as developed in , which can be seen as a generalization of geometric propositional logic to predicate logics, and establish in this way a connection between logics, sets and topology. As a categorial version of Lindenbaum’s algebra, they can handle predicates by considering sorts as objects, functional symbols and terms as morphisms, predicates as subobjects. The setting we propose in this paper is based on this view of toposes, and aims at defining and using MM in any spatial structure. The proposed definitions and operations will then enhance the reasoning ability of MM, extending previous work on morphological modal logic  . They will allow, among others, giving morphological semantics to modalities with a topological flavor  conventionally used for spatial reasoning , and which could not be obtained directly from erosions and dilations;\nactually, the properties of these modalities are closer to the morphological operators of opening and closing (in their particular form of composition of erosion and dilation) due to a double quantification ∀/∃for-all\\forall/\\exists in their definition. In , MM has been extended to structuring elements based on a notion of neighborhood close to a similar topological notion. We then propose to extend this first work to the framework of toposes.\nTo obtain the usual expected properties of erosion and dilation in this new framework, we will have to impose a supplementary condition on these new structuring neigbhorhoods which will be an adaptation of the notion of filter, standard in topology and logic, to the framework of topos.\nFrom all this, we will then have an internal CS4-modal algebra according to the meaning given to this notion in  (i.e. an internal interior algebra for erosions and a weaker version of internal closure algebra for dilations because dilations will not distribute over upper bounds (there are therefore not dilations in a strict sense) 333In , the authors have shown that in the intuitionistic setting, this last property could be rejected, motivated by computer applications  2 .). This will then allow us to give a neighborhood semantics to constructive modal logic from a topos perspective. Related extensions can be found, on the logical side, in the context of institutions  and satisfaction systems [ref]3 , thus encompassing many different logics in a federative framework. Applications to typical reasoning problems (revision, abduction, spatial reasoning) were instantiated in this framework. The interpretation of modal logic in toposes has already been approached by others. We can cite  7. To obtain modal operators possessing the right properties (commutativity with the upper and lower bounds, and preservation of the maximum and minimum elements), these works consider adjoints between internal Heyting algebras which therefore have the good properties of preservation and commutation 5. Here, we propose a less general but more constructive definition of modal operators by defining them from erosion and dilation. Some preliminaries on toposes are given in Section 2. We review some concepts, notations and terminology about toposes, more specifically about elementary toposes of Lawvere and Tierney 2. One important contribution of this paper is to rely on the internal language of toposes, based on their logical account, which allows reasoning on them in a way close to reasoning on sets and functions. This is even more relevant in the scope of this paper where the algebraic setting of MM is considered.\nIn Section 3 we formulate the notion of structuring element and two basic operators, dilation and erosion, in the framework of elementary toposes. In Section 4, we further extend the notion of structuring element to the notion of structuring neighborhood system. This notion was first introduced in , and is now generalized in toposes, with the aim of applying MM to logic for reasoning.\nIn Section 5, we propose a new way of considering modalities in propositional modal logic, inspired by the interpretation of these modalities as dilation and erosion with a structuring neighborhood modeling an accessibility relation (useful for instance for spatial reasoning, among others). The proposed extension formalizes constructive modal logic via MM in toposes. This also extends the neighborhood semantics, usually considered on sets 0, to toposes. Syntax and semantics are defined, as well as a sound and complete proof system. Finally, in Section 6, we illustrate the proposed approach on typical examples in symbolic AI and knowledge representation, namely belief revision, merging, abduction, and spatial reasoning. Useful notations are summarized in Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: then interpreted by the two basic MM operators, namely erosion and dilation   .
