Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Robustness Benchmark: Benchmarking the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrently, GRB covers a rich set of baselines for the GML models, attacks, and defenses. Seven GML models: GCN [ref]4, GAT , GIN , APPNP , TAGCN , GraphSAGE , SGCN . Note that these models are not originally designed to increase robustness. Twelve Attacks: Seven modification attacks—RND , DICE , FGA , FLIP [ref]29, NEA [ref]29, STACK , and PGD [ref]34—and five injection attacks—RND, FGSM , PGD [ref]34, SPEIT , and TDGIA . More details can be found in Appendix A.4.2. Five Defenses: GRB adopts RobustGCN (R-GCN) , GNN-SVD , and GNNGuard .\nAdditionally, we find that techniques like layer normalization (LN)  and adversarial training (AT) [ref]34, if properly used in the proposed evaluation scenarios, can significantly increase the robustness of various GML models.\nThe LN can be applied on the input features and after each graph convolutional layer (except for the last one). The idea is to stabilize the dynamics of input and hidden states to alleviate the impact of adversarial perturbations.\nThe AT uses modification/injection attacks during training to make GML models more robust. Note that most of previous works only use AT to perturb the existing graph, however, we find that AT also works well by injecting new nodes during training.\nThese two defenses are general and scalable, and the experiment results show that they outperform previous dedicated methods.\nThus, we include them in GRB as strong baselines for defenses. More details can be found in Appendix A.4.3.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Currently, GRB covers a rich set of baselines for the GML models, attacks, and defenses.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
