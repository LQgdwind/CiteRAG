      "content": "Paper Title: Class-Wise Difficulty-Balanced Loss for Solving Class-Imbalance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), we have seen significant\nadvancement in computer vision research. One of the reasons behind this success\nis\nthe wide availability of large-scale annotated image (e.g., MNIST , CIFAR\n, ImageNet [ref]3) and video (e.g., Kinetics , Something-Something , UCF ) datasets.\nBut unfortunately, most of the commonly used datasets do not resemble the\nreal world data in a number of ways. As a result, performance of state-of-the-art\nDNNs drop significantly in real-world use-cases. One of the major challenges in\nmost\nreal-world datasets is the class-imbalanced data distribution with significantly\nlong\ntails, i.e., a few classes (also known as ‘majority classes’) have much higher\nnumber\nof data samples compared to the other classes (also known as ‘minority\nclasses’).\nWhen DNNs are trained using such real-world datasets, their performance gets\nbiased towards the majority classes, i.e., they perform highly for the majority\nclasses\nand poorly for the minority classes. Several recent works have tried to solve the problem of\nclass-imbalanced training data. Most of the prior solutions can be fairly classified\nunder 3 categories :- (1) Data re-sampling techniques   \n(2) Metric learning and knowledge transfer 0 1 2 3\n(3) Cost-sensitive\nlearning methods 4 5 6 7. Data re-sampling techniques try to balance the number of data\nsamples between the majority and minority classes by either over-sampling from\nthe minority classes or under-sampling from the majority classes or using both.\nGenerating synthetic data samples for minority classes  8 9 from given\ndata is another\nre-sampling technique that tries to increase the number of minority class\nsamples.\nSince the performance of a DNN depends entirely on it’s ability to learn to\nextract\nuseful features from data, “what training data is seen by the DNN” is a very\nimportant\nconcern. In that context, data re-sampling strategies introduce the risks of\nlosing important training data samples by under-sampling from majority classes\nand network\noverfitting due to over-sampling minority classes. Metric-learning\n0 1, on the other hand, aims to learn an\nappropriate representation function that embeds data to a feature space, where\nthe mutual relationships among the data (e.g., similarity/dissimilarity) are\npreserved. It has the risk of learning a biased representation function that has\nlearned more from the majority classes. Hence some works 2\ntend to use sampling techniques with metric learning, which still faces the\nproblems of sampling, as discussed above. Few recent researches have also tried\nto transfer knowledge from the majority classes to the minority classes by\nadding an external memory 0, which is non-trivial and expensive. Due\nto these\nconcerns, the\nwork\nin this paper focuses on cost-sensitive learning approaches. Cost-sensitive\nlearning\nmethods penalize the DNN higher for making errors on certain samples compared\nto others. They achieve this by assigning weights to different samples using\nvarious\nstrategies. Typically, most prior cost-sensitive learning strategies 1 2 5\nassume\nthat the minority classes are always weakly represented. They ensure that the\nsamples of the minority class get higher weights so that the DNN can be\npenalized more\nfor making mistakes on the minority class samples. One such popular strategy is\nto\ndistribute weights in inverse proportion to the class frequencies 1 3.\nHowever, certain minority classes might be fairly represented by a small amount of\nsamples. Fig. 1 gives an example of a class-imbalanced dataset where certain classes such\nas\n‘clean’ and ‘spread’ are sparsely populated but can easily be learned to\ngeneralize by\nthe classifier. Overweighting samples of such classes might lead to biasing the\nDNN’s\nperformance. In such situations, number of available training data per class\nmight\nnot be a good clue to determine sample weights. Instead, we claim that the ‘difficulty’ of a class as perceived by the DNN might\nbe\na more important and helpful clue for weight assignment. The concept of\n‘difficulty’\nhas been previously used by some sample-level weight assigning techniques such\nas focal loss 4 and GHM 7. They reweight each sample individually by\nincreasing weights for hard samples and reducing weights for easy samples. The\nincreasing\npopularity of focal loss 4 in class-imbalanced classification tasks is based\non the\nassumption that minority classes should have more hard samples compared to\nmajority classes. The assumption does stand true if we compare the proportion of\nhard\nsamples for the minority and majority classes. But, in terms of absolute number\nof\nhard samples, the majority classes still might surpass the minority classes\nsimply because they have much more data samples than the minority classes. In\nsuch cases,\ngiving high weights to all hard samples irrespective of their classes might\noverweight\nthe majority classes and therefore still bias the performance of the DNN. We\nbelieve\nthat the above drawback can be solved by considering class-level difficulty\nrather\nthan sample-level. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to\nintroduce\nthe concept of class-level difficulty for solving class-imbalance. Based on the\nanalysis, we develop a novel weighting strategy that dynamically re-balances the\nloss for\neach sample based on the instantaneous difficulty of it’s class as perceived by\na DNN. Such a strategy measures the instantaneous difficulty of each class without\nrelying\non any prior assumptions and then dynamically assigns weights to the samples of\nthe class in proportion to the difficulty of the class. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple datasets indicate that our class-difficulty based dynamic weighting\nstrategy can\nprovide a significant improvement in the performance of the commonly used loss\nfunctions under class-imbalanced situations. The key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose\na way to measure the dynamic difficulty of each class during training and use\nthe class-wise difficulty scores to re-balance the loss for each sample, thereby\ngiving a\nclass-wise difficulty-balanced (CDB) loss. (2) We show that using our weighting\nstrategy can give commonly used loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy) a\nsignificant boost\nin performance on multiple class-imbalanced datasets. We conduct experiments on\nboth image and video datasets and find that our weighting strategy works well\nirrespective of the data type. Our research on quantifying the dynamic\ndifficulty of the\nclasses and using it for weight distribution might prove useful for researchers\nfocusing on class-imbalanced datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: we have seen significant\nadvancement in computer vision research.
