      "content": "Paper Title: RLAD: Reinforcement Learning from Pixels for Autonomous Driving in Urban Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSample-efficient RL algorithms capable of training directly from pixel observations could open up a multitude of real-world applications [ref]11. However, simultaneously training an image encoder and a policy network is a challenging problem due to the strong correlation between samples, sparse reward signal, and degenerated feature representations  [ref]11 . Naive approaches that use a large image encoder result in severe overfitting, and a smaller image encoder usually produces impoverished representations which limit the performance of the agent [ref]11. One way of addressing this problem is to employ auxiliary losses. Shelhamer et al.,  proposed to use several auxiliary losses to enhance the performance of Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic  (A3C)[ref]22. Zhang et al.,  predicted the rewards and dynamics of the environment as auxiliary losses.\nYarats et al.,  proposed SAC+AE, where the authors demonstrated that combining the off-policy RL algorithm Soft Actor-Critic  (SAC) with pixel reconstruction is vital for learning good representations. Following this line, Srinivas et al., [ref]24 proposed CURL â€“ Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for Reinforcement Learning. CURL uses contrastive learning to maximize agreement between an augmented version of the same observation, and to minimize agreement between different observations [ref]24. The authors showed that this method significantly improves the sample efficiency of the algorithm. A different line of research was proposed by Kostrikov et al., [ref]11, where the authors proposed DrQ. This work demonstrated how image augmentations can be applied in the context of model-free off-policy RL algorithms. The authors proved that using image augmentations leads to better results than using auxiliary losses [ref]11. Finally, Yarats et al.,  proposed an improved version of DrQ, named DrQ-V2. This version is the result of several algorithmic changes: (i) changing from SAC to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient  (DDPG), (ii) incorporating multi-step return, (iii) improving the data augmentation technique, (iv) introducing an exploration schedule, (v) selecting better hyper-parameters .\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Sample-efficient RL algorithms capable of training directly from pixel observations could open up a multitude of real-world applications [ref]11.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
