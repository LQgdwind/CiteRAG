      "content": "Paper Title: Sanity Checks Revisited: An Exploration to Repair the Model Parameter Randomisation Test\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe problem of evaluating the quality of an explanation method in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) remains unsolved due to the frequent absence of ground truth explanation labels  [ref]2 . To address this issue, numerous quantitative evaluation methods have been proposed  [ref]5  [ref]2  [ref]5   0 1 2 3  4 [ref]2 5 6.\nAmong these, the Model Parameter Randomisation Test (MPRT) 5 measures the degree to which an explanation deteriorates as the model parameters are progressively randomised, i.e., layer-by-layer, starting from the output. This test posits that a greater difference in the explanation function‚Äôs output, in response to parameter randomisation, signifies a higher quality of the explanation method. In recent years, however, multiple independent research groups have provided constructive observations on the methodological choices in the original MPRT 7 8 9 [ref]20.\nThese encompass the selection of pairwise similarity for measuring explanation difference [ref]20, the order of layer randomisation [ref]20, the choice of explanation preprocessing 7 [ref]20 and the dependency on the model task 9 8. Given the considerable adoption of MPRT in the XAI community and its potential to influence the acceptance or rejection of different explanation methods, these raised concerns deserve a closer examination.\nDo evaluations based on the original MPRT optimally inform us about the quality of an explanation method, or can we improve its reliability? The foundational idea behind MPRT‚Äîthat the explanation function should be sensitive to the model‚Äôs parameters‚Äîis both insightful and important. Our work seeks to build upon this initial work, addressing its shortcomings, namely, the order of layer randomisation and the selection of pairwise similarity measures, discussed in detail in Section 2.1.1 and illustrated in Figure 1.\nWe introduce two MPRT variants, Smooth MPRT (sMPRT) and Efficient MPRT (eMPRT), where the sMPRT mitigates sensitivity to shattering noise (cf. [ref]20) by denoising, i.e., averaging attributions over NùëÅN perturbed inputs and the eMPRT evaluates explanation faithfulness by quantifying the rise in complexity after full parameter randomisation, thus obviating a biased similarity measurement. We release these methods under the existing Quantus  evaluation framework111Code at: https://github.com/understandable-machine-intelligence-lab/Quantus.. Our methods, despite being an iteration, carry substantial importance. To deploy XAI in real-world applications, such as safety-critical domains, we need to focus on developing reliable quantitative evaluation metrics for existing explanation methods. This work contributes to ensuring that the continuous development of XAI methods remains both theoretically sound and empirically valid.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: The problem of evaluating the quality of an explanation method in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) remains unsolved due to the frequent absence of ground truth explanation labels  [ref]2 .
