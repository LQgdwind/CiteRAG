      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning with Feedback Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study RL with feedback graphs in MDPs. In the bandit setting, there is a large body of works on feedback graphs going back to Mannor and Shamir .\nIn stochastic bandits, Caron et¬†al. [ref]7 provided the first regret bound for UCB in terms of clique covering number which was improved by Lykouris et¬†al.  to mas-number.777They assume symmetric feedback graphs and state their results in terms of independence number.\nBoth are gap-dependent bounds as is common in bandits. Simchowitz and Jamieson  recently proved the first gap-dependent bounds in MDPs for an algorithm similar to Algorithm¬†1 without graph feedback. To keep the analysis and discussion to the point, we here provided worst-case problem-independent bounds but we assume that a slight generalization of our technical results could be used to prove similar problem-dependent bounds. While mas-number is the best-known dependency for UCB-style algorithms, Cohen et¬†al. [ref]8 achieved Œ±‚ÄãTùõºùëá\\sqrt{\\alpha T} regret with an elimination algorithm that uniformly visits independence sets in each round. Instead, Alon et¬†al.  explicitly leveraged a dominating set for Œ±‚ÄãTùõºùëá\\sqrt{\\alpha T} regret. Finally, Buccapatnam et¬†al.  also relies on the existence of a small dominating set to achieve problem-dependent regret scaling with Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma. Unfortunately, all these techniques rely on immediate access to each node in the feedback graph which is unavailable in MDPs. Albeit designed for different purposes, the first phase of Algorithm¬†2 is similar to a concurrently developed algorithm  for exploration in absence of rewards. But there is a key technical difference: Algorithm¬†2 learns how to reach each element of the dominating set jointly, while the approach by Jin et¬†al.  learns how to reach each state-action pair separately. Following the discussion in Section¬†5, we hypothesize that by applying our technique to their setting, one could reduce the state-space dependency in the œµ‚àí1superscriptitalic-œµ1\\epsilon^{-1} term of their sample complexity bound from S4/œµsuperscriptùëÜ4italic-œµS^{4}/\\epsilon to S3/œµsuperscriptùëÜ3italic-œµS^{3}/\\epsilon.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: are the first to study RL with feedback graphs in MDPs.
