      "content": "Paper Title: On The Complexity of Distance-𝑑 Independent Set Reconfiguration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we claim that the 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-hard reduction of Hearn and Demaine  for ISR under 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}} can be extended to Dd𝑑dISR (d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3) under 𝖱∈{𝖳𝖲,𝖳𝖩}𝖱𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{R}}\\in\\{{\\mathsf{TS}},{\\mathsf{TJ}}\\}.\nWe now briefly introduce the powerful tool Hearn and Demaine   used as the source problem for proving several hardness results, including the 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-hardness of ISR: the Nondeterministic Constraint Logic (NCL) machine. \n\nD0subscript𝐷0D_{0}D1subscript𝐷1D_{1}D2subscript𝐷2D_{2}D3subscript𝐷3D_{3}D4subscript𝐷4D_{4}D5subscript𝐷5D_{5}D0subscript𝐷0D_{0}D1subscript𝐷1D_{1}D2subscript𝐷2D_{2}D3subscript𝐷3D_{3}D4subscript𝐷4D_{4}D5subscript𝐷5D_{5}D11superscriptsubscript𝐷11D_{1}^{1}D21superscriptsubscript𝐷21D_{2}^{1}D31superscriptsubscript𝐷31D_{3}^{1}222222111(a)112(b)222(c)\n An NCL “machine” is an undirected graph whose edges are assigned with weight 111 (red) or 222 (blue).\nAn (NCL) configuration of this machine is an orientation of the edges such that the sum of weights of in-coming arcs at each vertex is at least two.\nFigure 6(a) illustrates a configuration of an NCL machine.\nTwo NCL configurations are adjacent if they differ in a single edge direction.\nGiven an NCL machine along with two configurations, Hearn and Demaine  proved that it is 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete to determine whether there exists a sequence of adjacent NCL configurations which transforms one into the other. Indeed, even when restricted to And/Or constraint graphs, the above problem remains 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete.\nAn And/Or constraint graph is a NCL machine that contains exactly two type of vertices: “NCL And vertices” and “NCL Or vertices”. More precisely, a vertex of degree three is called an NCL And vertex if its three incident edges have weights 111, 111 and 222.\n(See Figure 6(b).)\nThe “behavior” of an NCL And vertex u𝑢u is similar to a logical and:\nthe weight-222 edge can be directed outward for u𝑢u if and only if both two weight-111 edges are directed inward for u𝑢u.\nNote that, however, the weight-222 edge is not necessarily directed outward even when both weight-111 edges are directed inward.\nA vertex of degree three is called an NCL Or vertex if its three incident edges have weights 222, 222 and 222.\n(See Figure 6(c).)\nThe “behavior” of an NCL Or vertex v𝑣v is similar to a logical or:\none of the three edges can be directed outward for v𝑣v if and only if at least one of the other two edges is directed inward for v𝑣v. For example, the NCL machine in Figure 6(a) is an And/Or constraint graph. Dd𝑑dISR is 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete under 𝖱∈{𝖳𝖲,𝖳𝖩}𝖱𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{R}}\\in\\{{\\mathsf{TS}},{\\mathsf{TJ}}\\} on planar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth for any d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2. We note that Hearn and Demaine ’s proof can be applied with the vertex gadgets shown in Figure 7.\nIndeed, when d=2𝑑2d=2, the gadgets in Figure 7 are exactly those used in .\nWe rephrase their proof here for the sake of completeness.\nFrom now on we consider only 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}} rule.\nWe will see later that in the constructed graph, any token-jump is also a token-slide, and therefore our reduction also holds for 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}}.\nThe maximum degree will also be clear from the construction of gadgets and how they are joined.\nThe final complexity result follows from the result of van der Zanden [ref]21 which combines  and [ref]13: NCL remains 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete even if an input NCL machine is planar and bounded bandwidth. The NCL And and Or vertex gadgets are constructed as in Figure 7(a) and (b).\nThe edges that cross the dashed-line gadget borders are “port” edges.\nA token on an outer port-edge vertex represents an inward-directed NCL edge, and vice versa.\nGiven an And/Or graph and configuration, we construct a corresponding graph for Dd𝑑dISR under 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}}, by joining together And and Or vertex gadgets at their shared port edges, placing the port tokens appropriately. \n\nD0subscript𝐷0D_{0}D1subscript𝐷1D_{1}D2subscript𝐷2D_{2}D3subscript𝐷3D_{3}D4subscript𝐷4D_{4}D5subscript𝐷5D_{5}D0subscript𝐷0D_{0}D1subscript𝐷1D_{1}D2subscript𝐷2D_{2}D3subscript𝐷3D_{3}D4subscript𝐷4D_{4}D5subscript𝐷5D_{5}D11superscriptsubscript𝐷11D_{1}^{1}D21superscriptsubscript𝐷21D_{2}^{1}D31superscriptsubscript𝐷31D_{3}^{1}(a)(b)\n First, observe that no port token may ever leave its port edge.\nChoosing a particular port edge E𝐸E, if we inductively assume that this condition holds for all other port edges, then there is never a legal move outside E𝐸E for its token—another port token would have to leave its own edge first. The And gadget clearly satisfies the same constraints as an NCL And vertex; the upper token can slide in just when both lower tokens are slid out.\nLikewise, the upper token in the Or gadget can slide in when either lower token is slid out—the internal token can then slide to one side or the other to make room.\nIt thus satisfies the same constraints as an NCL Or vertex.\nAs a result, it follows that a sequence of adjacent NCL configurations in a given And/Or graph can indeed be transformed into a 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}}-sequence in the constructed graph and vice versa.\nSince no port token ever leaves its port edge, it follows from the construction of gadgets that in the constructed graph any token-jump is also a token-slide, which means the theorem also holds for 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}}.\nOur proof is complete.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: holds for 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}}.\nThe maximum degree will also be clear from the construction of gadgets and how they are joined.\nThe final complexity result follows from the result of van der Zanden [ref]21 which combines  and [ref]13: NCL remains 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete even if an input NCL machine is planar and bounded bandwidth.
