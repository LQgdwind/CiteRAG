      "content": "Paper Title: Faster Non-Convex Federated Learning via Global and Local Momentum\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo show the efficacy of global momentum in FedGLOMO, we compare it against FedLOMO (recall this has only local momentum and no global momentum; see Appendix¬†E) and the default algorithm of choice for FL, i.e., FedAvg [ref]24 with the standard momentum available in PyTorch applied to its local updates ‚Äì both with and without compression.\nNote that FedAvg with compression is referred to as FedPAQ [ref]29.\nWe call the standard momentum versions of FedAvg and FedPAQ as FedAvg-m and FedPAQ-m henceforth. For quantization, we use the ‚Äúqsgd‚Äù operator proposed in Section 3.1 of [ref]1. In the no-compression heterogeneous case, we also compare against Mime (specifically, ‚ÄúMimeSGDm‚Äù)  which is also shown to attain the improved complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí1.5)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ1.5\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1.5}) but without compressed communication, and is tailored to handle client heterogeneity. We consider the task of classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST  abbreviated as FMNIST henceforth. The model used is a two-layer neural network with ReLU activation in the hidden layers. The size of both the hidden layers is 300/600 for FMNIST/CIFAR-10. We train the models using the categorical cross-entropy loss with ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2}-regularization.\nThe weight decay value in PyTorch (to apply ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2}-regularization) is set to 1e-4. We consider both homogeneous\nand heterogeneous data distribution among the clients. Similar to [ref]24, for the heterogeneous case, we distribute the data among the clients such that each client can have data from either one or (at most) two classes ‚Äì note that this is a high degree of heterogeneity.\nThe exact procedure is described in Appendix¬†D. The number of clients (nùëõn) in all the experiments is set to 50, with each client having the same number of samples. In this set of experiments, the global batch-size rùëür is 25, and the number of local updates per round (i.e., Eùê∏E) is 10. For FedGLOMO, we use a constant value of Œ≤k=0.2subscriptùõΩùëò0.2\\beta_{k}=0.2.\nFor FedAvg-m and FedPAQ-m, the momentum parameter in Pytorch is set to its standard value, i.e., 0.9. As suggested in , we search Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta (momentum hyper-parameter in MimeSGDm) over {0,0.9,0.99}00.90.99\\{0,0.9,0.99\\}. All full gradients in FedGLOMO, FedLOMO and Mime are replaced by stochastic gradients computed on a (per-client) batch size of 256.\nThe learning rates and some other experimental details are in Appendix¬†D. In Fig. 1, we compare FedPAQ-m and FedLOMO with 4 (resp., 8) bits per-round against FedGLOMO with 2 (resp., 4) bits per-round on FMNIST (resp., CIFAR-10) in the heterogeneous and homogeneous cases.\nWe set the number of per-round bits used by FedPAQ-m and FedLOMO to be twice that of FedGLOMO so that all algorithms have the same per-round communication budget. All plots depict results over 3 independent runs; the shaded regions represent ¬±1plus-or-minus1\\pm 1 standard deviation whereas the solid lines are the respective means. Please see the discussion in the figure caption. Having shown the suboptimality of FedLOMO in Fig. 1, we compare FedAvg-m, FedGLOMO without compression and MimeSGDm in the heterogeneous case in Fig. 2. These experiments illustrate the power of global momentum. Also see Section¬†D.1 for additional experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: of global momentum in FedGLOMO, we compare it against FedLOMO (recall this has only local momentum and no global momentum; see Appendix¬†E) and the default algorithm of choice for FL, i.e., FedAvg [ref]24 with the standard momentum available in PyTorch applied to its local updates ‚Äì both with and without compression.\nNote that FedAvg with compression is referred to as FedPAQ [ref]29.\nWe call\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
