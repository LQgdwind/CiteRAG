      "content": "Paper Title: A Measure-Theoretic Axiomatisation of Causality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe stress that our paper should not be understood as a criticism of the existing frameworks, or that somehow our goal is to replace them. On the contrary, we foresee that they will continue to thrive in whatever domains they have been used in, and will continue to find novel application areas. Most prominently, there are the structural causal models (SCMs)  , based most often on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Here, the theory of causality is built around variables and structural equations, and probability only enters the picture through a distribution on the exogeneous variables . Efforts have been made to axiomatise causality based on this framework [ref]21  , but models based on structural equations or graphs inevitably rely on assumptions even for the definitions themselves, such as being confined to a finite number of variables, the issue of solvability in the case of non-recursive (or cyclic) cases, that all common causes (whether latent or observed) are modeled, or that the variables in the model do not causally affect anything outside the model. Hence, these cannot be said to be an \\sayaxiomatic definition in the strictest sense. In a series of examples in Section 4, we highlight cases for which causal spaces have a natural representation but SCMs do not, including common causes, cycles and continuous-time stochastic processes. The potential outcomes framework is a competing model, most often used in economics, social sciences or medicine research, in which we have a designated treatment variable, whose causal effect we are interested in, and for each value of the treatment variable, we have a separate, potential outcome variable  [ref]26. There are other, perhaps lesser-known approaches to model causality, such as that based on decision theory  2, on category theory  , on an agent explicitly performing actions that transform the state space , or settable systems . Perhaps the works that are the most relevant to this paper are those that have already recognised the need for an axiomatisation of causality based on measure-theoretic probability theory. Ortega  uses a particular form of a tree to define a causal space, and in so doing, uses an alternative, Bayesian set-up of probability theory . It has an obvious drawback that it only considers countable sets of \\sayrealisations, clearly ruling out many interesting and commonly-occurring cases, and also does not seem to accommodate cycles. Heymann etÂ al.  define the information dependency model based on measurable spaces to encode causal information. We find this to be a highly interesting and relevant approach, but the issue of cycles and solvability arises, and again, only countable sets of outcomes are considered, with the authors admitting that the results are likely not to hold with uncountable sets. Moreover, probabilities and interventions require additional work to be taken care of. Lastly, Cabreros and Storey  attempt to provide a measure-theoretic grounding to the potential outcomes framework, but thereby confine attention to the setting of a finite number of variables, and even restrict the random variables to be discrete. Finally, we mention the distinction between type causality and actual causality. The former is a theory about general causality, involving statements such as \\sayin general, smoking makes lung cancer more likely. Type causality is what we will be concerned with in this paper. Actual causality, on the other hand, is interested in whether a particular event was caused by a particular action, dealing with statements such as \\sayBob got lung cancer because he smoked for 30 years. It is an extremely interesting area of research that has far-reaching implications for concepts such as responsibility, blame, law, harm  , model explanation  and algorithmic recourse . Many definitions of actual causality have been proposed   , but the question of how to define actual causality is still not settled . The current definitions of actual causality are all grounded on (variants) of SCMs, and though out of the scope of this paper, it will be an interesting future research direction to consider how actual causality can be incorporated into our proposed framework.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: and structural equations, and probability only enters the picture through a distribution on the exogeneous variables .
