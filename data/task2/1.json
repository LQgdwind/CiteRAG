      "content": "Paper Title: Learning and Memorizing Representative Prototypes for 3D Point Cloud Semantic and Instance Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Learning for 3D Point Cloud \nExisting methods for extracting features for 3D point cloud can be roughly categorized into three groups, including voxel-based [ref]39 , multi-view based  [ref]13   and point-based 3    .\n [ref]39 are the pioneering works to transfer irregular points to regular volumetric grids, aiming to efficiently extract feature representation with 3D convolution. To reduce irrelevant operation on void places and save runtime memory usage, many works are proposed  .\nMulti-view based methods extract features in both 2D and 3D domain.  is one of the pioneering multi-view based method, which apply view-pooling over the 2D predictions. 3D-SIS [ref]13, proposed by Hou et al. , combine features from 2D and 3D via explicit spatial mapping in an end-to-end trainable network.\nPointNet 3 is the first deep-learning-based work to operate directly on point sets, which uses shared MLP (multi-layer perceptron) to extract per-point feature. PointNet++  improves the performance by extracting a hierarchical representation.\nMany following works      have been proposed to get a better representation of local context.\nDue to its simplicity, we select PointNet++ as our backbone and leave the choices of other backbones for future work. Instance Segmentation on Point Cloud \nDeep-learning-based instance segmentation for 3D point cloud is rarely studied until huge application potential has been discovered recently.\nSGPN  is the first deep learning based method working on this field. It first splits the whole scene into separate blocks. For every single block, per-point grouping candidates are proposed by predicting a similarity matrix that reflects affinity between each pair of points. A block merging algorithm is conducted for post-processing by taking segmentation results of the overlapped area into consideration.\nHowever, huge memory is needed for storing the pair-wise matrix, which makes it memory-consuming for post-processing. In order to solve this,\nWang et al. proposed ASIS , which utilized a discriminative loss function  to encourage points belonging to the same instance are mapped to a metric space with close distances. Moreover, in order to make the two tasks take advantage of each other, convolution and KNN search are applied for mutual feature aggregation of the two tasks, making it inefficient and time-consuming. Memory Networks \nMemory based approaches have been discussed for solving various problems. NTM  is proposed to improve the generalization ability of the network by introducing an attention-based memory module.\nGong et al.  proposed a memory augmented auto-encoder for detecting anomaly. Anomaly is detected by represented the input with prototypical elements of the normal data maintained in a memory module. Prototypical Network 9 maintains a category-wise templates for the problem of few-shot classification. Liu  proposed an OLTR algorithm to solve the open-ended and long-tail problem by associating a memory feature that can be transfered to both head and tail classes adaptively.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Deep Learning for 3D Point Cloud \nExisting methods for extracting features for 3D point cloud can be roughly categorized into three groups, including voxel-based [ref]39 , multi-view based  [ref]13   and point-based 3    .\n [ref]39 are the pioneering works to transfer irregular points to regular volumetric grids, aiming to efficiently extract feature\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
