      "content": "Paper Title: Almost Optimal Variance-Constrained Best Arm Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven an instance (ν,σ¯2)𝜈superscript¯𝜎2(\\nu,\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}), define the variance-aware hardness parameter Our main result is stated as follows. Given an instance (ν,σ¯2)𝜈superscript¯𝜎2(\\nu,\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}) and confidence parameter δ𝛿\\delta,\nwith probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta,\nVA-LUCB succeeds and terminates in The implied constant in the O-notation can be taken to be no more than 304304304. The mean gap ΔisubscriptΔ𝑖\\Delta_{i} and variance gap ΔivsuperscriptsubscriptΔ𝑖v\\Delta_{i}^{\\mathrm{v}} of arm i𝑖i are indicative of the hardness of ascertaining its optimality and feasibility respectively. It is easy to see that when the threshold σ¯2→∞→superscript¯𝜎2\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}\\to\\infty (in fact, σ¯2≥3/4superscript¯𝜎234\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}\\geq 3/4 suffices), HVAsubscript𝐻VAH_{\\mathrm{VA}} reduces to the hardness parameter H1:=∑i≠i⋆Δi−2assignsubscript𝐻1subscript𝑖superscript𝑖⋆superscriptsubscriptΔ𝑖2H_{1}:=\\sum_{i\\neq i^{\\star}}\\Delta_{i}^{-2} in the conventional (unconstrained) BAI problem . The intuitions for the four terms in HVAsubscript𝐻VAH_{\\mathrm{VA}} are as follows:\nFirstly, to identify the best feasible arm i⋆superscript𝑖⋆i^{\\star}, both of its feasibility and optimality need to be ascertained, which leads to the first term.\nSecondly, for the arms in ℱ∩𝒮ℱ𝒮\\mathcal{F}\\cap\\mathcal{S}, we can identify them once we have established that they are indeed suboptimal, explaining the dependence on Δi−2,i∈ℱ∩𝒮superscriptsubscriptΔ𝑖2𝑖ℱ𝒮\\Delta_{i}^{-2},i\\in\\mathcal{F}\\cap\\mathcal{S}.\nThirdly, since the arms in ℱ¯c∩ℛsuperscript¯ℱ𝑐ℛ\\bar{\\mathcal{F}}^{c}\\cap\\mathcal{R} have larger means than the best feasible arm, the algorithm needs to sample them sufficiently many times to learn they are infeasible, which contributes to the third term in HVAsubscript𝐻VAH_{\\mathrm{VA}}.\nFinally, when either the suboptimality or the infeasibility of the arms in ℱ¯c∩𝒮superscript¯ℱ𝑐𝒮\\bar{\\mathcal{F}}^{c}\\cap\\mathcal{S} is ascertained, we can eliminate them, which explains the last term in HVAsubscript𝐻VAH_{\\mathrm{VA}}.\nThe proof of Theorem (1) is presented in App. (D). We highlight that Algorithm (1) constitutes a convenient framework to tackle any risk-aware BAI problem in the sense that it is compatible with other concentration bounds.\nFor example, one can define alternative confidence radii, different from those specified in (5), based on the (non-asymptotic)\nLaw of the Iterated Logarithms (LIL)    [ref]39.\nWe adopt a simple non-asymptotic LIL concentration bound from Jamieson et al.  to show that different confidence bounds utilized in VA-LUCB (Algorithm (1)) can lead to slightly different upper bounds on the stopping time with high-probability.\nFirst, we replace the unbiased sample variance σ^2​(t)superscript^𝜎2𝑡\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}(t) by a biased counterpart Next, we redefine the the confidence radii α​(t,T)𝛼𝑡𝑇\\alpha(t,T) and β​(t,T)𝛽𝑡𝑇\\beta(t,T) (originally defined in (5)) by respectively, where ϵ∈(0,1)italic-ϵ01\\epsilon\\in(0,1) is a fixed constant.\nThese choices of the confidence radii allow us to avoid using a union bound to bound the probability of the complement of the “good” event E𝐸E in (38). With the above modifications, we show in App. (F) that VA-LUCB is δ𝛿\\delta-PAC (for ϵ=0.9italic-ϵ0.9\\epsilon=0.9 and δ<0.1𝛿0.1\\delta<0.1) and succeeds in where and ψ:x∈ℝ+↦x​ln⁡ln+⁡(x):𝜓𝑥subscriptℝmaps-to𝑥subscript𝑥\\psi:x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\mapsto x\\ln\\ln_{+}(x) with ln⁡ln+:x∈ℝ+↦ln⁡ln⁡(max⁡{e,x}):subscript𝑥subscriptℝmaps-to𝑒𝑥\\ln\\ln_{+}:x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\mapsto\\ln\\ln(\\max\\{e,x\\}).\nNote that HVA(1)superscriptsubscript𝐻VA1H_{\\mathrm{VA}}^{(1)} and HVAsubscript𝐻VAH_{\\mathrm{VA}} are order-wise equal and HVA(3)superscriptsubscript𝐻VA3H_{\\mathrm{VA}}^{(3)} is also of the same order as HVAsubscript𝐻VAH_{\\mathrm{VA}} up to double logarithmic terms in the gaps {(Δi,Δiv)}i∈[N]subscriptsubscriptΔ𝑖superscriptsubscriptΔ𝑖v𝑖delimited-[]𝑁\\{(\\Delta_{i},\\Delta_{i}^{\\mathrm{v}})\\}_{i\\in[N]}. While we only study a generalization of the LUCB-based method [ref]9 for this variance-constrained BAI problem, other confidence bound-based strategies, e.g., Successive Elimination  and lil’UCB , also have the potential to be generalized to solve this problem. We provide some intuitions in the following. Successive Elimination: Denote the set of active arms as 𝒜tsubscript𝒜𝑡\\mathcal{A}_{t} and initialize 𝒜0=[N]subscript𝒜0delimited-[]𝑁\\mathcal{A}_{0}=[N]. At each time step t𝑡t, the algorithm first pulls all active arms once and updates the sample means and sample variances. It then updates the confidence bounds α​(t)𝛼𝑡\\alpha(t) and β​(t)𝛽𝑡\\beta(t) for the means and variances (which are similar to the αtsubscript𝛼𝑡\\alpha_{t} in [6, Alg. 3]). Next, it identifies the empirically best feasible arm it⋆=arg​max⁡{μ^i​(t):i∈𝒜t,Uiv​(t)≤σ¯2}superscriptsubscript𝑖𝑡⋆argmax:subscript^𝜇𝑖𝑡formulae-sequence𝑖subscript𝒜𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑖v𝑡superscript¯𝜎2i_{t}^{\\star}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}\\{\\hat{\\mu}_{i}(t):i\\in\\mathcal{A}_{t},U_{i}^{\\mathrm{v}}(t)\\leq\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}\\}. Finally, it updates the active arm set to be 𝒜t+1={i∈𝒜t:μ^it⋆​(t)−μ^i​(t)<2​α​(t),σ^i2​(t)−σ¯2<β​(t)}subscript𝒜𝑡1conditional-set𝑖subscript𝒜𝑡formulae-sequencesubscript^𝜇superscriptsubscript𝑖𝑡⋆𝑡subscript^𝜇𝑖𝑡2𝛼𝑡superscriptsubscript^𝜎𝑖2𝑡superscript¯𝜎2𝛽𝑡\\mathcal{A}_{t+1}=\\{i\\in\\mathcal{A}_{t}:\\hat{\\mu}_{i_{t}^{\\star}}(t)-\\hat{\\mu}_{i}(t)<2\\alpha(t),\\hat{\\sigma}_{i}^{2}(t)-\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}<\\beta(t)\\}. The algorithm terminates when the active set is empty (which indicates that the instance is infeasible) or the active set contains only the empirically best feasible arm (which is then declared to be the best feasible arm). lil’UCB: The sampling strategy for this algorithm when there is a constraint on variance (or risk) of the arms is obvious. In particular, the algorithm samples arm it=arg​max⁡{Uiμ​(t):Liv​(t)≤σ¯2}subscript𝑖𝑡argmax:superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑖𝜇𝑡superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑖v𝑡superscript¯𝜎2i_{t}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}\\{U_{i}^{\\mu}(t):L_{i}^{\\mathrm{v}}(t)\\leq\\bar{\\sigma}^{2}\\} where Uiμ​(t)superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑖𝜇𝑡U_{i}^{\\mu}(t) and Liv​(t)superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑖v𝑡L_{i}^{\\mathrm{v}}(t) are constructed in view of the LIL. However, the stopping criterion is not straightforward, since the LIL-based stopping rule  cannot be directly utilized. This is an interesting direction for future research.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: other concentration bounds.\nFor example, one can define alternative confidence radii, different from those specified in (5), based on the (non-asymptotic)\nLaw of the Iterated Logarithms (LIL)    [ref]39.\nWe adopt a simple non-asymptotic LIL concentration bound from Jamieson et al.  to show that different confidence bounds utilized in VA-LUCB (Algorithm (1)) can lead to slightly different\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
