      "content": "Paper Title: Perfect Roman Domination and Unique Response Roman Domination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnumeration is wide area of research, as also testified by specialized workshops like [ref]21. For some examples, we refer to the survey . From a practical point of view, enumeration can be interesting if not all aspects of the problem have been satisfyingly modeled. For instance, it is possible to enumerate all (inclusion-wise) minimal dominating sets of a graph of order n𝑛n in time 𝒪​(1.7159n)𝒪superscript1.7159𝑛\\mathcal{O}(1.7159^{n}) . As here only the size of the input graph is taken into consideration, one also speaks of an input-sensitive analysis. In contrast to classical complexity, one can often also give lower-bound examples, which are families of graphs that possess, when taking an n𝑛n-vertex representative thereof, Ω​(1.5704n)Ωsuperscript1.5704𝑛\\Omega(1.5704^{n}) many minimal dominating sets . When lower and upper bounds match, we can consider this type of enumeration as being optimal. However, even such an optimal enumeration algorithm can be dissatisfying for a user, as she might have to wait exponential time between two output solutions. This motivates to study enumeration algorithms from an output-sensitive perspective. The most important notions have been introduced by D. S. Johnson et al. . We focus on the most restricted variant. An enumeration algorithm has polynomial delay if the time between two subsequent outputs of the algorithm can be bounded by some polynomial, as well as the time from the start to the first output and the time between the last output and the termination of the algorithm. This is a very desirable property if two processes work as in a production line: one process generates the solutions, while the other one works on the generated solution. After finishing its work on one solution, the second process does not want to work for a long time to start working on the next solution.\nIt is open since decades if all minimal dominating sets can be enumerated with polynomial delay. We motivate the enumeration of perfect/unique response Roman dominating functions by the main result of F. N. Abu-Khzam et al. [ref]3. There, it is proven that all minimal Roman dominating functions of a graph of order n𝑛n can be enumerated in time 𝒪​(1.9332n)𝒪superscript1.9332𝑛\\mathcal{O}(1.9332^{n}) with polynomial delay. In this case, minimality is defined with respect to a pointwise order, i.e., for f,g:V→{0,1,2}:𝑓𝑔→𝑉012f,g:V\\to\\{0,1,2\\}, f≤g𝑓𝑔f\\leq g if and only if f​(v)≤g​(v)𝑓𝑣𝑔𝑣f(v)\\leq g(v) for all v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V.\nTo ensure polynomial delay for enumerating minimal Roman dominating functions, F. N. Abu-Khzam et al. used polynomial-time solvable extension problems.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Enumeration is wide area of research, as also testified by specialized workshops like [ref]21.
