      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Off-Policy Evaluation Approach for General Value Function\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we characterize the convergence rate and optimality guarantee for GenTD. To this end, we first establish a contraction property for the general Bellman operator (GBO) of interest here. Although the contraction property has been proven in the canonical value function settings  , it is unclear whether such a property still holds for multiple interrelated and high-dimensional GVFs. We will next show that only under a properly chosen norm, such a property holds for both forward and backward GVFs with causal filtering. This is the first result of such a type. Consider the GVFs vector Gπ=[Gπ,1⊤,⋯,Gπ,k⊤]⊤subscript𝐺𝜋superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝐺top𝜋1⋯subscriptsuperscript𝐺top𝜋𝑘topG_{\\pi}=[G^{\\top}_{\\pi,1},\\cdots,G^{\\top}_{\\pi,k}]^{\\top}. We define a norm ∥⋅∥μπ,α\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{\\mu_{\\pi},\\alpha} associated with a weighting vector α=[α1,⋯,αk]∈Δk𝛼subscript𝛼1⋯subscript𝛼𝑘subscriptΔ𝑘\\alpha=[\\alpha_{1},\\cdots,\\alpha_{k}]\\in\\Delta_{k}, where ΔksubscriptΔ𝑘\\Delta_{k} denotes the simplex in k𝑘k-dimensional space, as We also define γmax:=maxi=1​⋯,k⁡γiassignsubscript𝛾subscript𝑖1⋯𝑘subscript𝛾𝑖\\gamma_{\\max}:=\\max_{i=1\\cdots,k}\\gamma_{i}, which is strictly less than 111. For any Gπ,Gπ′∈ℝ|𝒮|​|𝒜|​∑i=1kKi​disubscript𝐺𝜋subscriptsuperscript𝐺′𝜋superscriptℝ𝒮𝒜superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝐾𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖{G}_{\\pi},{G}^{\\prime}_{\\pi}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|\\sum_{i=1}^{k}K_{i}d_{i}}, there exists a weighting vector α𝛼\\alpha such that where γG=(1+γmax)/2subscript𝛾𝐺1subscript𝛾2\\gamma_{G}=(1+\\gamma_{\\max})/2 and 𝒯¯G,πsubscript¯𝒯𝐺𝜋\\bar{\\mathcal{T}}_{G,\\pi} can be either 𝒯G,πsubscript𝒯𝐺𝜋\\mathcal{T}_{G,\\pi} (forward GBO, eq. 3) or 𝒯^G,πsubscript^𝒯𝐺𝜋\\hat{\\mathcal{T}}_{G,\\pi} (backward GBO, eq. 6). Despite the correlations between GVFs, Proposition 1 shows that the contraction property is still preserved under a properly chosen norm for 𝒯G,πsubscript𝒯𝐺𝜋{\\mathcal{T}}_{G,\\pi} and 𝒯^G,πsubscript^𝒯𝐺𝜋\\hat{\\mathcal{T}}_{G,\\pi} in forward and backward GVF settings, respectively. The norm can vary for different GVFs.\nProposition 1 also implies that both forward and backward GVFs (Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi} and G^πsubscript^𝐺𝜋\\hat{G}_{\\pi}) can be identified as unique fixed point of their corresponding GBOs. Based on Proposition 1, we next establish the monotonicity property for our GenTD algorithm, if it takes the population update g​(θ)=Φ⊤​Uπ​(G​(θ)−𝒯¯G,π​G​(θ))𝑔𝜃superscriptΦtopsubscript𝑈𝜋𝐺𝜃subscript¯𝒯𝐺𝜋𝐺𝜃g(\\theta)={\\rm\\Phi}^{\\top}U_{\\pi}(G(\\theta)-\\bar{\\mathcal{T}}_{G,\\pi}G(\\theta)). Consider the globally optimal point θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} defined in eq. 9. There exists a constant λGsubscript𝜆𝐺\\lambda_{G} such that for all θ∈Rθ𝜃subscript𝑅𝜃\\theta\\in R_{\\theta}, we have where λG:=(1−γmax)​min1≤i≤k⁡ζiassignsubscript𝜆𝐺1subscript𝛾subscript1𝑖𝑘subscript𝜁𝑖\\lambda_{G}:=(1-\\gamma_{\\max})\\min_{1\\leq i\\leq k}\\zeta_{i} and ζi:=λmin​(Φi⊤​Uπ​Φi)assignsubscript𝜁𝑖subscript𝜆subscriptsuperscriptΦtop𝑖subscript𝑈𝜋subscriptΦ𝑖\\zeta_{i}:=\\lambda_{\\min}({\\rm\\Phi}^{\\top}_{i}U_{\\pi}{\\rm\\Phi}_{i}). Proposition 2 implies the contraction property of g​(θ)𝑔𝜃g(\\theta). It guarantees that θ𝜃\\theta moves towards a globally optimal point θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} if it is updated along the direction −g​(θ)𝑔𝜃-g(\\theta). Proposition 2 generalizes the monotonicity property to a much broader class of interrelated and multi-dimensional GVF evaluation, which is far more beyond TD learning for the value function evaluation studied in  .\nThe following theorem characterizes the convergence rate of GenTD. Consider the GenTD update in Algorithm 1. Let the stepsize αt=Θ​(t−1)subscript𝛼𝑡Θsuperscript𝑡1\\alpha_{t}={\\rm\\Theta}(t^{-1}) and βt=Θ​(t−1)subscript𝛽𝑡Θsuperscript𝑡1\\beta_{t}={\\rm\\Theta}(t^{-1}). We have where ερ=𝔼𝒟⋅π​[ρ^​(s,a;wρ∗)−ρ​(s,a)]2subscript𝜀𝜌subscript𝔼⋅𝒟𝜋superscriptdelimited-[]^𝜌𝑠𝑎subscriptsuperscript𝑤𝜌𝜌𝑠𝑎2\\varepsilon_{\\rho}=\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}\\cdot\\pi}[\\hat{\\rho}(s,a;w^{*}_{\\rho})-\\rho(s,a)]^{2}} is the approximation error introduced by the density ratio learning, with wρ∗subscriptsuperscript𝑤𝜌w^{*}_{\\rho} being the global optimal point of L​(ρ^,f,η)𝐿^𝜌𝑓𝜂L(\\hat{\\rho},f,\\eta) defined in eq. 11. Theorem 1 shows that GenTD converges to the globally optimal point θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} at a rate 𝒪​(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\mathcal{O}(1/T). The convergence speed of θ𝜃\\theta also depends on the conditional number λGsubscript𝜆𝐺\\lambda_{G}, where the converge becomes faster as λGsubscript𝜆𝐺\\lambda_{G} increases. Specifically, the R.H.S. of eq. 15 consists of three terms. The first term corresponds to the initialization error, which delays as fast as 𝒪​(1/T2)𝒪1superscript𝑇2\\mathcal{O}(1/T^{2}). The second term corresponds to the variance error, which dominates the convergence rate of GenTD to be 𝒪​(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\mathcal{O}(1/T). The last term corresponds to a non-vanishing optimality gap, which is introduced by the function approximation error in the density ratio estimation, and decreases as the expressive power of the approximation function class {ρ^​(wρ):wρ∈Rρ}conditional-set^𝜌subscript𝑤𝜌subscript𝑤𝜌subscript𝑅𝜌\\{\\hat{\\rho}(w_{\\rho}):w_{\\rho}\\in R_{\\rho}\\} increases. The convergence analysis of GenTD is more challenging than that of TD learning  [ref]7  and GTD  [ref]17, as we need to handle an additional approximation error introduced by the dynamically changing density ratio estimator ρ^​(wρt)^𝜌subscript𝑤subscript𝜌𝑡\\hat{\\rho}(w_{\\rho_{t}}). Theorem 1 establishes the convergence of GenTD to the globally optimal point θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} of the objective function in eq. 8, which provides the value estimation G​(θ∗)𝐺superscript𝜃G(\\theta^{*}) for the GVFs. We are then interested in characterizing how close such an estimation is to the ground truth GVF Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi}, which is our ultimate goal of evaluation. We characterize this in the following theorem. Consider θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*} defined in eq. 8. Suppose the same conditions in Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 hold. We have Theorem 2 indicates that the distance between the optimal estimation G​(θ∗)𝐺superscript𝜃G(\\theta^{*}) and the true GVF Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi} is upper bounded by the approximation error of the function class ℱΦsubscriptℱΦ\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi} for the ground truth GVF Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi} (note that ΓℱΦ,μπ​GπsubscriptΓsubscriptℱΦsubscript𝜇𝜋subscript𝐺𝜋{\\rm\\Gamma}_{\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi},\\mu_{\\pi}}G_{\\pi} denotes the projection of Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi} to the function approximation class ℱΦsubscriptℱΦ\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi}). Hence, Theorem 2 guarantees that G​(θ∗)𝐺superscript𝜃G(\\theta^{*}) can be as close as possible to the true GVF Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi}, as long as the function class ℱΦsubscriptℱΦ\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi} is sufficiently expressive. In particular, if ℱΦsubscriptℱΦ\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi} is complete, i.e., there exists Gθ∈ℱΦsubscript𝐺𝜃subscriptℱΦG_{\\theta}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi} such that Gθ=Gπsubscript𝐺𝜃subscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\theta}=G_{\\pi}, then GenTD is guaranteed to converge exactly to the ground truth Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi}. Comparison between GenTD and GTD. If ℱΦsubscriptℱΦ\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi} is complete, GTD performs similarly to GenTD and is guaranteed to converge to the ground truth Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi} (see Section C.2 for the proof). The major difference between GenTD and GTD occurs when ℱΦsubscriptℱΦ\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi} is not complete. In such a case, our GenTD still maintains the desirable performance as guaranteed by Theorem 2, but the optimal point of GTD (i.e., θ^∗superscript^𝜃\\hat{\\theta}^{*} in eq. 7) does not have guaranteed convergence to the ground truth. As shown in   6, even in the value function evaluation setting (a special case of forward GVF evaluation) the approximation error ‖G​(θ^∗)−Gπ‖Dsubscriptnorm𝐺superscript^𝜃subscript𝐺𝜋𝐷||G(\\hat{\\theta}^{*})-G_{\\pi}||_{D} of GTD can be arbitrarily poor even if ℱΦsubscriptℱΦ\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi} can represent the true value function arbitrarily well (but not exactly). Such a disadvantage of GTD is mainly due to the distribution mismatch in its objective function as we discuss in Section 3.3. In the backward GVFs evaluation setting, GTD can perform even worse. As we show in the following example, GTD may fail to learn the ground truth Gπsubscript𝐺𝜋G_{\\pi} even if the function class ℱΦsubscriptℱΦ\\mathcal{F}_{\\rm\\Phi} is complete. Note that for such a case, GenTD converges to the ground truth as guaranteed by Theorem 2. Consider a three-state Markov chain, with transition kernel 𝖯=[[0.1,0.9,0],[0.1,0,0.9],[0,0.1,0.9]]⊤𝖯superscript0.10.900.100.900.10.9top\\mathsf{P}=[[0.1,0.9,0],[0.1,0,0.9],[0,0.1,0.9]]^{\\top}, discount factor γ=0.99𝛾0.99\\gamma=0.99, and the reward function R=[ref]1  [ref]1⊤𝑅superscript101topR=[ref]1  [ref]1^{\\top}.

Suppose GTD is applied to solving the evaluation problem with the parameter space Rθ=ℝsubscript𝑅𝜃ℝR_{\\theta}=\\mathbb{R}.
