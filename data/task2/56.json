      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Graph-based Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo Oracle\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTrajectory prediction is a time-series modeling problem that attempts to understand pedestrians’ motion patterns. Early researches have focused on predicting future trajectories with the linear, constant velocity, and constant acceleration models . However, such a simple model cannot understand intricate motion patterns, thus are not suitable for long-term prediction. For longer prediction horizon, flow-based methods  have been proposed to learn the directional flow from observed trajectories. Subsequently, trajectories are generated by recursively sampling the distribution of future motion derived from the learned directional flow. To better understand pedestrians’ motion patterns, researchers have resorted to several learning-based methods, including Gaussian mixture regression [ref]3, Gaussian processes , random tree searching , hidden Markov models , and DBNs . Among these methods, DBNs have been commonly used since they can easily incorporate context information [ref]26. However, these learning-based methods are nontrivial to handle high-dimensional data. Moreover, it is challenging to design hand-crafted features that are workable in general cases. The recent rise of deep neural networks provides a new solution to understand pedestrians’ motion patterns. Alahi et al.  presented Social-LSTM, which encodes pedestrians’ motion patterns with a shared LSTM. Then, future trajectories were sampled from the encoded embedding in a generative manner. Several GAN-based approaches  have been proposed to produce socially acceptable trajectories by adversarially training a generator and discriminator. Context information has been utilized to improve prediction performance. For example, Xue et al.  and Syed et al. [ref]12 utilized three LSTMs for encoding person, social, and scene scale information and then aggregating them for context-aware trajectory prediction. Ridel et al.  presented a joint representation of the scene and past trajectories by using the Conv-LSTM and LSTM, respectively. Lisotto et al.  improved Social-LSTM by encompassing prior knowledge about the scene as a navigation map that embodies most frequently crossed areas. Salzmann et al.  proposed Trajectron++, which could achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, its performance is highly related to the processing of input data. Giuliari et al.  introduced the Transformer structure to perform precise trajectory prediction. However, it suffers from high space-time complexity. Despite the great progress, few works above has further studied the effects of different time steps in encoding motion patterns. Therefore, the information crucial for trajectory prediction at specific time steps may be covered up due to forgetting gates of LSTMs. Here we introduce a temporal attention-based LSTM to encode each pedestrian’s motion pattern, aiming at highlighting the specific time steps in historical trajectories.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: derived from the learned directional flow.
