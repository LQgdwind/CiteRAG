Such problems arise naturally in many real-world scenarios such as assigning computational resources in a cloud computing environment, air traffic management, dividing business assets, allocation of radio and television spectrum, course assignments, and so on  5  . The fundamental problem of fair division lies at the interface of economics, social science, mathematics, and computer science, and its formal study dates back about seven decades 3 . In the last few decades, the area of fair division has witnessed a flourishing flow of research; see    for excellent expositions. Traditionally, in early literature, fair division has been studied for a single divisible resource, classically known as fair cake cutting. Here, each agent specifies her valuations over a unit interval cake via a probability distribution over  1  and the problem is to divide the cake among agents in a fair manner. The quintessential notion of fairness in this line of work is that of envy-freeness, introduced by Foley 8 and Varian [ref]41. A cake division is said to be envy-free if every agent prefers her own share of the cake over any other agent’s share. Stromquist 9 famously proved that an envy-free cake division (where every agent receives a connected interval of the cake) is always guaranteed to exist, under mild conditions. Later, Su  developed another existential proof using Sperner’s Lemma and established a connection between the notion of envy-freeness and topology. Such strong existential results have arguably placed the notion of envy-freeness as the flagship bearer of fairness in resource allocation settings. On the other hand, Pareto optimality is a standard notion of economic efficiency, which states that it should be impossible to find an allocation that improves some agent’s utility without reducing any other’s. Another important notion of (collective) efficiency measure of an allocation is that of social welfare  which is the sum of all the utilities derived by agents from their assigned bundle. The goal of being fair towards the participating agents and achieving collective (economic) efficiency form the two important paradigms of resource allocation problems. Unfortunately, for an indivisible set of items, an envy-free allocation may not exist. For example, an instance with two agents having positive value for a single item admits no envy-free allocation. A fair division instance consists of a set [n]={1,2​…,n}delimited-[]𝑛12…𝑛[n]=\\{1,2\\dots,n\\} of n𝑛n agents and a set M𝑀M of items. In the most basic setting, every agent i𝑖i has an additive utility function ui:2M→ℝ:subscript𝑢𝑖→superscript2𝑀ℝu_{i}\\colon 2^{M}\\to\\mathbb{R} that specifies her cardinal preferences for the items of a given bundle; in particular, ui​(j)≔ui​({j})≔subscript𝑢𝑖𝑗subscript𝑢𝑖𝑗u_{i}(j)\\coloneqq u_{i}(\\{j\\}) denotes agent i𝑖i’s utility for item j∈M𝑗𝑀j\\in M. We say an allocation is a partition of items into n𝑛n bundles, where every agent is assigned one bundle. The goal of simultaneously achieving fairness and efficiency is challenging for the problem of allocating indivisible items.\nBesides the mentioned fact that an envy-free allocation is not guaranteed to exists, in cases where envy-free allocations do exist, envy-freeness may not be compatible with Pareto optimality . The above discussion suggests that one should consider distributions over allocations (to be referred as allocation lotteries) in order to simultaneously achieve fairness and efficiency guarantees. In the random assignment literature in economics, the idea of constructing a fractional allocation and implementing it as a lottery over deterministic allocations was introduced by Hylland and Zeckhauser 0. Introducing randomness is a typical way of circumventing the non-existence of various solution concepts, especially in computational social choice theory   4 2. In the process of exploring allocation lotteries, we appropriately relax the notion of fairness to ex-ante envy-freeness, which values the random bundles allocated agents in terms of expected utility. Recent works of  3 5 9 deals with various computational aspects of allocation lotteries that are fair and efficient for fair division instances with additive utilities.\nObserve that, allocation lotteries that are just ex-ante envy-free or just ex-ante Pareto-optimal can be trivially computed in polynomial time. For the former, one can solve a linear program, while for the latter, one can assign each bundle to the agent that has the highest utility for it. That is, these notions of fairness and efficiency are tractable if dealt with individually. Therefore, the important question is to understand the computational complexity of computing allocation lotteries that are simultaneously ex-ante envy-free and Pareto-optimal. In this work, we consider this question for the most general setting of fair division, as detailed in the following section.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: over  1  and the problem is to divide the cake among agents in a fair manner.
