      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-view Multi-label Fine-grained Emotion Decoding from Human Brain Activity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmotion decoding from visually evoked human brain activity measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an emerging research area and plays an important role in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Most of the previous emotion decoding studies [ref]1   considered very coarse-grained and limited emotion categories, such as positive, neutral and negative, which can not represent the complex emotions we experience in daily life. Recent studies   have proven that the emotions expressed by human constitute a high-dimensional semantic space which motivates us to study more fine-grained emotion decoding. In addition, a more obvious limitation in previous decoding methods is that they only predicted one emotion category for one brain activity pattern   , which means they only regard emotion decoding as a multi-class, rather than multi-label, decoding problem. However, there is no doubt that multiple human emotions can be elicited simultaneously by emotion stimuli. Fig. 1 shows three video screenshots of emotion-inducing movie clips used in our experimental dataset. Taking the third scene fighting as an example, we may feel angry and disgust for this uncivilized behavior while we are also surprised and confused with the reason for fighting. Besides, it is fearful and anxious for us when we see people fighting on the street, which will make us sad about the injury as well. On the other hand, most previous emotion decoding methods adopted voxel based decoding    which suffers from severe overfitting due to high data dimensionality, small sample size and low signal-to-noise ratio. In order to alleviate overfitting, they barely used simple linear models   or generalized linear models (GLMs)  for decoding, leading to weak expressive ability of the model. Although some of them have involved the use of brain regions of interest (ROI)  or functional cortical  signals for emotion decoding, they essentially are still subject to voxel based decoding in which advanced deep learning algorithms are not easy to use. More importantly, for visually evoked emotion decoding, neuroscience research studies have revealed the discrepancy in emotional expression between the left and right hemispheres despite the common visual input   which can be regarded as the prior knowledge for developing models. Many previous studies have proven that exploiting the bi-hemisphere discrepancy is capable of improving the performance of emotion decoding by using electroencephalogram (EEG) based data  . They employ independent networks to learn features for the left and right hemispheres, and then fuse them for further decoding task. Inspired by these, we regard the left and right hemispheres, and their difference as multiple information resources (views) to explore the interaction between the two hemispheres and take advantage of a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism  for feature level fusion. Taking the above limitations into account, we propose a novel multi-view multi-label hybrid model called ML-BVAE (a hybrid model of Multi-Label classification network with Brain Variational Auto-Encoder) which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithm for fine-grained emotion decoding from human brain activity and can offer great potential for a fine-grained emotion BCI system. To this end, we first propose an fMRI dimensionality reduction method utilizing ROI pooling which can effectively realize noise suppression and dimensionality reduction of the original signal. Then, we raise a multi-view multi-label hybrid model which enables us to not only achieve accurate emotion decoding but also investigate the relationship between emotion categories. An overview of our experimental paradigm can be found in Fig. 2. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose an effective fMRI dimensionality reduction method called ROI pooling which can suppress noise and alleviate overfitting when complex models are used for emotion decoding. We design a tailored BVAE with the PoE mechanism for learning expressive multi-view neural representations while taking the bi-hemisphere discrepancy into account, which is of great importance to emotion decoding studies. We develop a novel multi-label classification network to exploit the relationship between brain activity and emotion labels, and the dependency across emotion labels. For the first time, we realize multi-label emotion decoding from brain activity. Sufficient experiments on two visually evoked emotional datasets demonstrate that ML-BVAE outperforms the compared methods on several evaluation metrics and can achieve fine-grained emotion decoding of up to 80 emotions. Our source code is available in https://github.com/KaichengFu1997/ML-BVAE.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an emerging research area and plays an important role in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).
