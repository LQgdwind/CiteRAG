Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: High Quality Segmentation for Ultra High-resolution Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, we show comparison among our CRM, CascadePSP , Segfix [ref]48, and MGMatting . (SegFix and MGMatting perform better on a rescaled image with a downsample ratio 0.5.) They prove that CRM’s performance is better, and it runs faster on high-resolution.\nAll segmentation refinement models are trained on low-resolution images and tested on high-resolution images. Segfix and MGMatting’s refinement performances are not as good as other methods without a special design for ultra high-resolution images in BIG . CascadePSP  gains more IoU after refinement. Moreover, our CRM produces the highest-quality refinement. Besides, the inference time is essential for the ultra high-resolution task. Tab. 2 shows that CRM takes less than half inference time of CascadePSP  on the whole BIG dataset. FLOPs and parameters are also less. This advantage is due to the simplicity of CRM. The experiments on panoptic segmentation and entity segmentation are illustrated in Tab. 3. After adding CRM to  and [ref]33, their segmentation performance is enhanced. We also report our performance on relabeled Pascal VOC 2012 in Tab. 4. Compared with CascadePSP  and Segfix [ref]48, CRM runs better than Segfix [ref]48 and is comparable with CascadePSP on IoU, but tends to emphasize more on details. These quantitative results show CRM’s general effectiveness on ultra high-resolution images as well as low-resolution ones.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: In Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, we show comparison among our CRM, CascadePSP , Segfix [ref]48, and MGMatting .

They prove that CRM’s performance is better, and it runs faster on high-resolution.\nAll\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
