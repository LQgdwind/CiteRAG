      "content": "Paper Title: Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Detection for Fine-Grained Videos with Hierarchical Atomic Actions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe concept of atomic actions naturally arises when researchers analyze humans’ cognitive perception of actions. Gaidon et al. [ref]10 used a histogram of features representing atomic actions to conduct action detection. Similarly, Lillo et al. [ref]20 modeled human activities as smaller individual components. Recently, Ji et al.  decomposed an action event into atomic spatial-temporal scene graphs, aiming to understand actions as sequences of atomic interactions with the surrounding environments. Visual concept, on the other hand, is often related to promoting models’ interpretability. Chen et al.  showed that InfoGAN encodes disentangled visual concepts such as pose, emotion, and hairstyle. Whitney et al.  learned symbolic representations from video frames. Kim et al.  analyzed how each visual concept of the input image affects the classification prediction. Ghorbani et al. [ref]12 proposed a method that automatically recovers visual concepts and determines their importance without user’s input. Chen et al.  proposed to model prototypical parts in image recognition and combine those parts in final predictions. Those prototypical parts can be viewed as visual concepts. Visual concepts are typically obtained via unsupervised learning [ref]12 . Given that atomic actions are not directly annotated, these works inspire us to use visual concepts to model atomic actions. In the image field, visual concepts usually correspond to small patches of the image for a single subject . In our work, we extend this concept to temporal visual concepts in videos.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: The concept of atomic actions naturally arises when researchers analyze humans’ cognitive perception of actions.
