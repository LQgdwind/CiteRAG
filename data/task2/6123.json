      "content": "Paper Title: Safe Motion Planning with Environment Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMuch research activities about planning under robot state uncertainty have been carried out in the past few years, with applications spanning a variety of areas¬†     [ref]8 [ref]9 . Yet, most approaches assume that the landmarks are fairly well known or are known with little uncertainty. However, in practice, the environment is seldom known with high certainty and hence providing formal guarantees for safe robotic tasks under environment uncertainty is of vital importance.  In this work we explicitly consider uncertainties in the landmark locations and derive the resulting Bayes filter. Several methods exist in the literature to compute collision probability and they differ from one another in different aspects such as (1) the formulation of the collision constraint, (2) assumptions in the shape of the robot and the obstacle, (3) modelling the associated uncertainties. The approach of truncating Gaussian distributions is leveraged to compute risk-aware and asymptotically\noptimal trajectories by¬†.¬† truncate¬† the estimated a priori Gaussian state distributions to consider only the collision free samples. Thus propagating these truncated distributions enable them to compute collision free trajectories.¬† However, it must hold that the propagated distributions are Gaussians and therefore the truncated distributions are approximated to be Gaussian distributions. Though we model uncertainties using Gaussian distribution, we do not truncate them.¬† Bounding volume approaches enlarge the robot by their 3-œÉùúé\\sigma uncertainties. Rectangular bounding boxes for robot and the obstacles are used in¬† to compute an approximate upper bound. In¬† the future state distributions are predicted and the uncertainties are used to compute bounded collision probabilities.¬† use sigma hulls for¬† bounding robot links and compute the signed distance of these hulls to the obstacles to formulate the collision avoidance constraints.¬† These approaches typically overestimate collision probabilities and the computed values tend to be larger than the actual values. The joint distribution between the robot and the obstacle is used to derive the collision constraint in¬† and¬†¬† , giving bounded collision probabilities.¬† The probabilities are obtained by marginalizing the joint distribution. However, since there is no closed form solution to this formulation, an approximate formulation is computed¬† in¬†,¬†. Assuming that the robot radius is negligible the joint distribution can be approximated as the product of the volume occupied by the robot and the conditional\ndistribution of the obstacle evaluated at the robot location.¬† However, as identified by¬†, both the approaches produce tight bounds only when the sizes of objects are relatively very small compared with their position uncertainties. In contrast, we do not assume any approximation and derive an exact expression for collision probability computatation.¬†0, an approximation is computed using Monte Carlo Integration (MCI), which is nonetheless computationally intensive. Another related work that uses a Monte Carlo approach and is real-time compatible is Monte Carlo Motion Planning (MCMP)¬†. They first solve a deterministic motion planning problem with an inflated obstacle and later adjust the inflation to compute the desired safe path. Chance-constrained111A chance-constrained approach finds the optimal sequence of control inputs subject to the constraint that the collision probability must be below a user-specified threshold. This constraint is known as a chance constraint. approaches compute approximate upper bounds by linearizing the collision conditions. In contrast, we compute the exact collsion probability value.¬† employs chance-constraints to ensure that the probability of collision is below a specified threshold. This approach is leveraged to compute bounded collision-free trajectories with dynamic obstacles by¬†, wherein the dynamic obstacles follow a constant velocity model with Gaussian noise. In¬†, a Gaussian Process (GP) based approach is used to learn motion patterns (a mapping from states to trajectory derivatives) to identify possible future obstacles trajectories.¬†3 focus exclusively on obstacle uncertainty. They formalize a notion of shadows, which are the geometric equivalent of confidence intervals for uncertain obstacles. The shadows fundamentally give rise to loose bounds but the computational complexity of bounding the collision probability is greatly reduced. Uncertain obstacles are modelled as polytopes with Gaussian-distributed faces by¬†4. Planning a collision-free path in the presence of risk zones is considered by¬†5 by penalizing the time spent in these zones. Risk contours map, which take into account the risk\ninformation (uncertainties in location, size and geometry of obstacles) in uncertain environments are used by¬†6 to obtain safe paths with bounded risks. A related approach for randomly moving obstacles is presented by¬†7. Formal verification methods have also been used to construct safe plans¬†8 9. Most of the approaches discussed above leverage Boole‚Äôs inequality to compute the collision probability along a path by summing or multiplying the probabilities along different waypoints in the path. However, the additive approach assumes that the probabilities along the waypoints are mutually exclusive and the multiplicative approach treats them as independent. Such approaches tend to be overly conservative and rather than computing bounded collision probabilities along a path, the bound should be checked for each configuration along the path itself.¬† In this work we perform this check for each configuration along the path. Moreover, in most approaches, the collision probability computed along each waypoint is an approximation of the true value. For example, the MCI approach of¬†0 approximates the resulting double summation expression for collision probability to a single summation.¬† compute an approximate upper bound for collision probability by linearizing the collision condition.¬† and¬† assume the volume occupied by the robot to be negligible. On the one hand, such approximations can overly penalize paths and could gauge all plans to be infeasible. On the other hand some approximations can be lower222For example, the approach of¬† computes a lower value than the actual when the robot state covariance is small. than the true collision probability values and can lead to synthesizing unsafe plans.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Much research activities about planning under robot state uncertainty have been carried out in the past few years, with applications spanning a variety of areas¬†     [ref]8 [ref]9 .
