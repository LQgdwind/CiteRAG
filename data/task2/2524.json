      "content": "Paper Title: OSCAR-Net: Object-centric Scene Graph Attention for Image Attribution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual content authenticity methods can be categorized into two camps. The first camp is within digital forensics, and includes techniques such as the ‘blind’ localization of image manipulation , detection of ‘deep fake’ (generative) content 4 based either upon its statistical properties  or its current limitations (e.g. absence of blinking ), and anomaly detection . The second camp uses image attribution tools that trace provenance via embedded metadata  , watermarking    , or hashing 3 1 9 [ref]8 2  . Our work falls in the second camp – a robust visual hash for image attribution. Perceptual hashing has been studied extensively for image similarity 5. Classical approaches sample the spectral domain (e.g. DCT  3 or wavelet  co-efficients), or color-texture features 3 . Compact binary codes may be obtained via random projection  or by learning data-dependent similarity-preserving binary projections such as product quantization (PQ)  . More recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been explored for image similarity. Binary codes may also be learned concurrently with feature learning through two methods: continuous relaxation  9 5 [ref]8 or direct optimization in discrete space 4 7 9 .\nAs we later show, these methods are vulnerable to subtle tampering on complex images thus not suitable for image attribution applications. Scene graph representation is an active research area common in scene understanding 4, image captioning 8, retrieval 0 and synthesis . Graph neural networks (GNN) are either spectral, which distills information via noise filtering in the graph Fourier domain 2 0 8, or non-spectral which operates on the graph directly 8 0  1. Non-spectral GNNs can work on graphs with arbitrary structure and various types of nodes and edges, thus can be adapted to complex design elements such as self-attention 3, autoencoder 0 and manifold learnings 1. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage scene graph hashing for image attribution. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) we setup new benchmarks for safeguarding visual content integrity via image attribution, (ii) we propose a robust tamper-aware binary fingerprinting approach for images “in-the-wild” and (iii) we achieve state-of-art performance compared with existing hash methods.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: limitations (e.g. absence of blinking ), and anomaly detection .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
