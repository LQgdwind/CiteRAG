      "content": "Paper Title: Hyperdimensional Feature Fusion for Out-of-Distribution Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets\nFor our comparisons to existing OOD detectors we use a wide array of popular datasets composed from multiple recent state-of-the-art OOD detectors. We construct our evaluation suite as the combination of datasets from   [ref]28. For our comparison to existing OOD detectors, we use the popular dataset splits for near- and far-OOD detection using CIFAR10 and CIFAR100  as the ID datasets. For our ID sets, we use the 50,000 training examples for training and computation of the class bundles, whilst the 10,000 testing images are used as our unseen ID data. For the near-OOD configurations, the test set of whichever CIFAR dataset is not being used for training will be used as the OOD set. For the far-OOD detection settings, we use a suite of benchmarks: iSUN, TinyImageNet  (cropped and resized: TINc and TINr), LSUN 4 (cropped and resized: LSUNc and LSUNr)111Download links for OOD datasets can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/facebookresearch/odin, SVHN , MNIST , KMNIST , FashionMNIST 3, and Textures . In the interest of brevity, we only show the settings where CIFAR10 is the ID set, the settings of CIFAR100 as ID are provided in the Supplementary Material. Evaluation Metrics\nWe consider the standard metrics 6  for our comparison to existing OOD literature. AUROC: The Area Under The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve corresponds to the area under the ROC curve with true positive rate (TPR) on the y-axis and false positive rate (FPR) on the x-axis. AUROC can be interpreted as the probability that an OOD sample will be given a higher score than an ID sample . FPR95: The FPR95 metric reports the FPR at a critical threshold which achieves a minimum of 95% in TPR. Detection Error: Detection Error indicates the minimum misclassification probability with respect to the critical threshold. F1: F1-score corresponds to the harmonic mean of precision and recall. We make use of F1-score to evaluate the general binarisation performance in our ablations. In the interests of brevity, we only evaluate using the AUROC metric for our evaluations. We provide additional evaluations with FPR95 and Detection Error in the Supplementary Material. Baselines\nWe divide our selected baselines and SOTA comparisons into two evaluation streams, these being; statistics and training. The statistics stream contains methods that are generally applied post-hoc to a pretrained network, requiring no training and only minimal calibration to represent in-distribution data. The training stream contains methods that allow for the retraining of the base network or the training of an auxiliary monitoring network. The distinction between the two streams is important for a fair comparison as the methods in the training stream have a significantly longer calibration (training) time as well as biases towards the OOD data, either explicitly through proxy-OOD training or implicitly through assumptions about the formation of OOD data with a custom loss. In the statistics stream we compare against: maximum softmax probability  (MSP), max logit  (ML), gramian matrices  (Gram) and energy-based model  without calibration on OOD data. For the training stream we compare against: NMD [ref]9, Spectral Discrepancy trained with the 1D Subspaces methodology 6 (1DS), Deep Deterministic Uncertainty 5 (DDU) and MOOD [ref]28. Implementation\nWe follow the evaluation procedure defined in 6 , implementing the standard WideResNet 7 network with a depth of 28 and a width of 10. In the statistics stream, this model is trained to convergence with standard cross-entropy loss. Custom loss objectives are restricted to the training stream. As HDFF is a post-hoc statistics-based method, it is innately orthogonal to the methods contained within the training stream and can be combined with many of them in a post-hoc fashion. To demonstrate the robustness of HDFF we combine it with two of the other state-of-the-art detectors, 1D Subspaces 6 and NMD [ref]9. The HDFF-1DS method applies as described in Section 4 but the base model has been trained with the 1D Subspaces custom objective. The second model HDFF-MLP trains an auxiliary MLP as a binary ID/OOD classifier using the generated HDFF image descriptor vectors 𝐲(i)superscript𝐲𝑖\\mathbf{y}^{(i)} of perturbed (proxy-OOD) and normal (ID) images from the ID training set as input into the MLP alike NMD [ref]9. We re-implement the MSP, ML and Gram detectors for the WideResNet architecture, for all other methods, excluding NMD [ref]9 and MOOD [ref]28, we report the published results on the same architecture. At the time of writing, a publicly available implementation of NMD [ref]9 is unavailable and as such we utilise their published results in the zero-shot OOD scenario on ResNet34 . MOOD [ref]28 is built upon a custom network architecture that enables early exits during inference, we report the published results on this custom architecture due to the unclear applicability of the method to other network architectures. When applying HDFF and Gram  to the WideResNet model we attempt to faithfully recreate the hook locations of Gram from the original architecture. Specifically, features are recorded from the outputs of almost all of the following modules within the network: Conv2d, ReLU, BasicBlock, NetworkBlock and shortcut connections. In total, there are 76 features extracted per sample and hence the same number of semi-orthogonal projection matrices 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} are generated for HDFF. Unless otherwise stated, we operate in a hyperdimensional space of 104superscript10410^{4} dimensions, we ablate this hyperparameter in the Supplementary Material. Before projecting feature maps into the hyperdimensional space as per (5), we apply mean-centering by subtracting the layer-wise mean activations (obtained from the training set) from all 𝐦lsubscript𝐦𝑙\\mathbf{m}_{l}. For pooling we apply max pooling over the spatial dimensions to reduce our feature maps 𝐦lsubscript𝐦𝑙\\mathbf{m}_{l} to a vector representation, we ablate the effect of this choice in the Supplementary Material.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: existing OOD detectors we use a wide array of popular datasets composed from multiple recent state-of-the-art OOD detectors.
