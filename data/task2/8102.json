In the early stages, the emergence of language models like ChatGPT , Claude , and Llama , powered by LLMs such as LLaMA  by Meta , the GPT  family by OpenAI , and Claude by Anthropic [ref]41, among others, were initially used primarily for conversation and generating text due to their strong NLP capabilities. However, recent technological advancements have introduced multimodality capabilities, enabling LLM-powered solutions to process diverse modalities including text, audio, images, and videos . This evolution progressed from using LLMs for simple conversational tasks to automating complex processes and transforming entire fields.\nFor an LLM to generate results, whether in a single modality (text) or multimodality (images, audio, video), its architecture requires extensive knowledge during training and fine-tuning. This training knowledge can span different topics, contexts, areas, and fields [ref]8.\nAnother detail in LLM architecture is the use of transformers, which is extensively explained in . Each word for an LLM, whether learned from the dataset during training or fine-tuning or as user input during a query, is transformed into a numerical representation and embedded into a high-dimensional vector. One must bear in mind that there are different types of LLMs. Each type is designed for specific tasks; some excel in report generation, others in classification, and some in predictive analytics [ref]26. When it comes to automating TA, the operation involves comprehensive data handling, processing, and analysis of digital artefacts, both textually and contextually. This process can be significantly enhanced by employing an LLM trained with cybersecurity, DF, and IR datasets. These datasets consist of reports, journal and conference papers, previous DFIR cases, standards, frameworks, guidelines, and conversations related to the field. Examples include IEEE articles, Wikipedia entries, CTDD, IDS2017 and IDS2018 datasets, ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy) datasets, OpenTitan System-on-Chip (SoC) data, Hack@dac 2021 SoC data, CVE reports, and more [ref]26. Additionally, LLMs capable of generating reports and understanding the nuances of cyber threats, digital artefact analysis, temporal artefact analysis, event correlation, timeline reconstruction, identifying incident root causes, incident scenario simulation, sentiment analysis, and predicting future actions and scenarios are the optimal choice for us.\nTable II summarizes all groundbreaking research. Table V lists the trained LLMs that are benchmarked and suitable for cybersecurity and DFIR tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: recent years.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
