      "content": "Paper Title: Deep or Simple Models for Semantic Tagging? It Depends on your Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, BERT consistently achieves higher F1 scores than other deep models. We, therefore, take a closer look at BERT.\n BERT versus domain SOTA. Our results indicate BERT as the most accurate generic model. We, therefore, compare it with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, which are considered as golden standards for semantic tagging tasks, on individual datasets.\nThese SOTA results (e.g., 0.85 F1 on SUGG from SEMEVAL 2019 champion [ref]31) were obtained by leveraging domain-specific knowledge.\nWe follow the experimental settings and metrics given in published materials.\nSpecifically, we compute the F1 score for SUGG [ref]31, SENT , PARA , HOMO , HETER , EVAL [ref]20, FACT [ref]20, REF [ref]20, QUOTE [ref]20, ARGUE , SUPPORT , AGAINST , and Accuracy for FUNNY* , TV [ref]52 and AUC [ref]52 for BOOK [ref]52. Following the computing process, we directly take the published SOTA results from related publications and perform comparison between SOTA and BERT. As shown in Figure 5, BERT achieves comparable or even better results compared with SOTA methods. Based on these findings, practitioners should really consider using BERT as a base model to replace existing solutions or develop new pipelines for semantic tagging. We also notice that BERT does not outperform SOTA in SENT, FUNNY*, and BOOK. Regarding SENT , we can only obtain partial training set so the F1 scores of BERT and SOTA are not comparable. For FUNNY* , the gap is pretty small (0.04). For BOOK [ref]52, domain tagging extensively leverages the names of characters to identify spoilers, while these names are out of the vocabulary of BERT. Except for these extreme cases, BERT is always the best tagging model on most datasets. \n BERT on representative datasets.\nWe choose HOTEL, FUNNY as the representative datasets for small, large datasets, respectively, and compare BERT with simple models. As shown in Figure 6, BERT achieves higher F1 than LR (0.14) and SVM (0.12) on HOTEL, confirming that BERT indeed significantly improves tagging F1 in some cases. However, in other cases, BERT does not outperform simple models. For example, BERT performs worse than SVM by 0.06 F1 on FUNNY. Simple models can sometimes outperform BERT while taking significantly less time for training.\nFor example, BERT takes 1.4 days to train FUNNY that contains 4.75 million records. Therefore, if considering both F1 improvement and time consumption as evaluation criteria, deep models are not the best choice for semantic tagging in some cases. \n Effect of pre-trained embeddings We conducted experiments to evaluate how much simple models can benefit from pre-trained embeddings. Given that BERT is similar to Word2Vec and Glove that use word vectors, for the convenience, we used BERT that was pre-trained over Wikipedia corpus as the embedder. For each input text, BERT outputs the last-layer [CLS] vector  as the featurization vector. We then ran LR and SVM on all featurization vectors and presented F1s of the most representative datasets (i.e. HOMO, HETER, and QUOTE) in Table 6. The results show that LR can achieve better F1s on small datasets with pre-trained embeddings. F1 improvements of HOMO, Heter, and QUOTE are 0.07, 0.05, and 0.25, respectively. Similarly, SVM also achieves better F1s on these three datasets. The F1 improvements of HOMO, HETER, and QUOTE are 0.04, 0.04, and 0.23, respectively. These results suggest that simple models can benefit from pre-trained embeddings.
