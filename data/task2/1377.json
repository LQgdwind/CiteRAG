      "content": "Paper Title: Voronoi Progressive Widening: Efficient Online Solvers for Continuous State, Action, and Observation POMDPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a flexible mathematical framework for expressing stochastic sequential decision problems.\nPOMDPs can represent a wide range of real world problems such as autonomous driving  , cancer screening , spoken dialog systems , and aircraft collision avoidance .\nA POMDP is an optimization problem in which we aim to find a policy that maps states to actions which will control the state to maximize the expected sum of rewards.\nFinding an optimal POMDP policy is computationally demanding because of the uncertainty introduced by imperfect observations .\nOne of the most popular approaches to deal with this computational challenge is to use online algorithms that look for local approximate policies as the agent interacts with the environment rather than computing a global policy that maps every possible outcome to an action.\nMany online POMDP algorithms are variants of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)  [ref]8 [ref]9 or other tree search variants 0 1. The research presented here concerns continuous space POMDPs, defined as POMDPs with continuous state, action and observation spaces.\nIf tree search is naively applied to continuous space POMDPs, an immediate problem is that the branching factor of the tree will be infinite, preventing evaluation of future consequences of actions deep in the tree.\nThis problem has been thoroughly studied, and the most popular solutions are sparse sampling 5 3 6 and progressive widening (PW) 7 [ref]9, which limit the branching factor by only considering a randomly-selected subset of the states, actions and observations. For continuous states and observations, this random sampling is used to approximate the expectation of the next-step value in Bellman’s equation. Since the Monte Carlo integration needed to approximate these expectations has straightforward and robust convergence guarantees, sparse sampling and PW are sufficient. Continuous action spaces are, however, much more difficult to accommodate.\nInstead of simply estimating expectations, planning in a problem with a continuous action space requires solving a nonconvex optimization problem at each node in the tree.\nPW has been applied to these problems 7 [ref]9, but, since PW considers a randomly sampled set of actions, it wastes a large amount of computation on suboptimal parts of the action space and has only been demonstrated on small action spaces such as one-dimensional intervals of real numbers.\nVoronoi optimistic optimization (VOO) 2 is an approach for sequential decision problems with deterministic and fully-observable dynamics that attempts to focus computation on more promising parts of the action space by partitioning it into Voronoi cells and sampling from cells corresponding to previously successful actions. In this work, we propose Voronoi Progressive Widening (VPW), a versatile technique to modify tree search algorithms to effectively handle continuous or hybrid action spaces.\nVPW generalizes VOO and PW to problems with both transition and observation uncertainties.\nLike PW, it balances exploring previously proposed actions and searching for new action candidates.\nHowever, VPW searches for new candidates in a much more efficient way via VOO, and balances local and global searching without relying on any additional prior information or expert knowledge.\nFurthermore, VPW does not require significant additional computation time and can handle both continuous and hybrid action spaces with relative ease. There are two main contributions in this work.\nFirst, we prove theoretical guarantees about certain parts of the VPW approach via Voronoi Optimistic Weighted Sparse Sampling (VOWSS).\nVOWSS is special case of VPW applied to Partially Observable Weighted Sparse Sampling (POWSS) 3 with fixed number of action samples, which integrates the two convergence guarantees from VOO and POWSS into a single guarantee.\nSpecifically, this is the first known solver to have global convergence guarantees for continuous space POMDPs.\nThis shows that VOO and action PW were extended in a way that VPW not only can handle transition and observation uncertainties, but also combines the two procedures in a theoretically sound way. Second, we propose an efficient VPW-based algorithm: Voronoi Optimistic Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Weighting (VOMCPOW).\nVOMCPOW can also be thought of as a practical extension of VOWSS.\nThe experiments over different domains show the practical effectiveness of VPW for handling continuous and hybrid action space problems.\nVOMCPOW consistently outperforms state-of-the-art continuous space POMDP solvers based on PW, such as Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW) [ref]9 and Bayesian Optimized Monte Carlo Planning (BOMCP) 4 in several simulation experiments.\nTable I summarizes the solvers that are studied in this paper. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows:\nFirst, Sections II and III review preliminary definitions and previous work.\nThen, Section IV introduces the VPW algorithm, and describes its strengths as well as how to efficiently implement it in practice.\nSection V presents the VOWSS algorithm and theoretical analysis justifying VPW.\nFinally, Section VI empirically shows the optimality of VOWSS action selection and the efficiency and robustness of VOMCPOW over three different simulation experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: agent interacts with the environment rather than computing a global policy that maps every possible outcome to an action.\nMany online POMDP algorithms are variants of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)  [ref]8 [ref]9 or other tree search variants 0 1.
