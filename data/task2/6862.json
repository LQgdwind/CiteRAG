      "content": "Paper Title: CLIPN for Zero-Shot OOD Detection: Teaching CLIP to Say No\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nID and OOD Datasets. In this section, we evaluate the performance of our approach and compare it to state-of-the-art OOD detection algorithms. We focus on three different OOD detection tasks. (1) OOD detection on large-scale datasets. Following the prior work  on large-scale OOD detection, we choose ImageNet-1K [ref]20 as the ID dataset. Four OOD datasets (including Texture [ref]42, iNaturalist , SUN , and Places365 ) are used to comprehensively benchmark the algorithms. (2) OOD detection on small-scale datasets. In this setting , CIFAR-100  is set as an ID dataset, and the OOD datasets are CIFAR-10 , ImageNet_R , and LSUN . The data scale of CIFAR-100 is significantly smaller than ImageNet-1K. (3) OOD detection on the in-domain dataset. In addition, ZOC [ref]8 is the first work on the zero-shot OOD detection task. To compare with it, we follow its experimental setting and test our method on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The reported performance is averaged over 5 splits. Evaluation Metrics.\nWe report two widely used metrics, AUROC and FPR95, for performance evaluation. AUROC is a metric that computes the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A higher value indicates better detection performance. FPR95 is short for FPR@TPR95, which is the false positive rate when the true positive rate is 95%. Smaller FPR95 implies better performance. Model Details.\nAll used pre-trained CLIP models are obtained from OpenCLIP . The CLIP based on ViT-B-16 and ViT-B-32 are used for experiments. Previous Methods for Comparison.\nWe compare our method with 5 prior logit-based works on OOD detection and 2 works on zero-shot OOD detection.\nThey are MSP , Energy , MaxLogit , ReAct , ODIN , ZOC [ref]8 (only on the third task) and MCM .\nFor evaluation, ID-ness socres proposed by the above works and this paper (see Eqn. 7 and 9) are used for the calculation of AUROC and FPR95. Reproduction details.\nCLIPN is pre-trained on the CC-3M  dataset for ten epochs, using a batch size of 2048, and trained on a system equipped with 4×4\\timesNVIDIA RTX3090 (24G) and 2×2\\timesIntel Xeon Gold 5118.\nAll experiments involving our proposed algorithms are independently repeated three times, and the reported results are averaged from these three experiments. To ensure fairness and versatility in our evaluation, the model used for performance assessment is the final-epoch model, rather than selecting the optimal model from all epochs.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: OOD detection algorithms.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
