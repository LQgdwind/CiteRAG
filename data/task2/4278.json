      "content": "Paper Title: Target-absent Human Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual search is one of the fundamental human goal-directed gaze behaviors that actively scan the visual environment to find any exemplar of a target-object category [ref]42 [ref]45 . There is an emerging interest in modeling and predicting human gaze during visual search    [ref]38 . Yang et al.  first used inverse reinforcement learning to model target-present search fixations spanning 18 target categories. Most recently,  directly applied reinforcement learning to predict scanpaths in various visual tasks including target-present search. However, their generalizability has never been interrogated for the prediction of target-absent search scanpaths, where no strong target signal is available in the images. Early work showed that target-absent search is not random behavior   but greatly influenced by target-relevant visual features to such an extent that the target category being searched for can be decoded from one’s scanpaths . However, that study used only two target categories and the task was to search through only four non-targets. In this work, we study target-absent gaze behavior from a data-driven perspective. Several recent studies have attempted to model a foveated representation of the input image for predicting human gaze behavior   [ref]38 or solving other visual tasks (e.g., object detection;  9).\nYang et al.  approximated a foveated retina by having a high-resolution center (full-resolution image) surrounded by a degraded visual periphery (a slightly blurred version of the image) at each fixation. A pretrained Panoptic-FPN 2 was applied on the full-resolution and blurred images separately to obtain the panoptic segmentation maps that were finally combined into the final state representation. Instead of approximating the foveated retina as a central-peripheral pairing of high- and low-resolution images, Zelinsky et al.  used a pretrained ResNet-50 6 directly to extract feature maps from foveated images  for the state representation. Notably, both methods apply pretrained networks on blurred images whereas our FFMs are extracted from the full-resolution images, for which the pretrained networks are more robust.\nRashidi et al. [ref]38 proposed a method to directly estimate the foveated detectability of a target object  from eye tracking data.\nHowever, this approach cannot be easily extended to a larger number of target categories because it requires training multiple detectors for each target and manually creating specialized datasets by showing each target at multiple scales against different textured backgrounds.\nIn contrast, our model is able to jointly learn the foveation process at feature level and the networks that predict human scanpaths through back-propagation from human gaze behavior.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Visual search is one of the fundamental human goal-directed gaze behaviors that actively scan the visual environment to find any exemplar of a target-object category [ref]42 [ref]45 .
