This category includes the following planners from OMPL: RRT∗ , Informed RRT∗ , SORRT∗ [ref]38, BIT∗ , RRT##\\# 0, BFMT∗ 1, PRM∗ , and CForest 2.\nIn this class, we additionally include planners that perform informed search (Informed RRT∗, SORRT∗, BIT∗) or use multiple trees in parallel (CForest). We configure these algorithms to sample from a uniform distribution with goal biasing.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: the probability of finding an optimal solution approaches one as the number of samples increases to infinity).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
