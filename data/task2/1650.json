An earlier version of this preprint has also been reviewed and presented at RECOMB-seq 2021 highlights track.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now describe how to replace the randomized linear time construction of the bidirectional BWT index with a deterministic one, so that left extensions and right contractions are supported in O​(log⁡σ)𝑂𝜎O(\\log\\sigma) time. We need only a single-directional subset of the index of Belazzougui and Cunial , consisting of an index on the BWT, augmented with balanced parentheses representations of the topologies of the suffix tree of T𝑇T and of the suffix link tree of the reverse of T𝑇T, such that the nodes corresponding to maximal repeats in both topologies are marked . Belazzougui et al. showed how to construct the BWT of a string O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) deterministic time and O​(n​log⁡σ)𝑂𝑛𝜎O(n\\log\\sigma) bits of space . Their algorithm can be used to construct both the BWT of T𝑇T and the BWT of the reverse of T𝑇T in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time. We can build the bidirectional BWT index [ref]7  by indexing both BWTs as wavelet trees . The bidirectional index can then be used to construct both of the required tree topologies in O​(n​log⁡σ)𝑂𝑛𝜎O(n\\log\\sigma) time using bidirectional extension operations and the counter-based topology construction method of Belazzougui et al. . See the supplement of a paper on variable order Markov models by Cunial et al.  for more details on the construction of the tree topologies. The topologies are then indexed for various navigational operations required by the contraction operation described in . This index enables left extensions in O​(log⁡σ)𝑂𝜎O(\\log\\sigma) time using the BWT of T𝑇T, and right contractions in constant time using the succinct tree topologies as shown by Belazzougui and Cunial . We summarize the result in the lemma below. Given a text T𝑇T of length n𝑛n from an alphabet {1,2,…,σ}12…𝜎\\{1,2,\\ldots,\\sigma\\}, it is possible to construct in O​(n​log⁡σ)𝑂𝑛𝜎O(n\\log\\sigma) deterministic time and O​(n​log⁡σ)𝑂𝑛𝜎O(n\\log\\sigma) bits of space a bidirectional BWT index that supports left extensions in O​(log⁡σ)𝑂𝜎O(\\log\\sigma) time and and right contractions in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time. We note that it may be possible to improve the time of left extensions to O​(log⁡log⁡σ)𝑂𝜎O(\\log\\log\\sigma) by replacing monotone minimum perfect hash functions by slower yet deterministic linear time constructable data structures in all constructions leading to Theorem 6.7 of Belazzougui et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: bits of space .
