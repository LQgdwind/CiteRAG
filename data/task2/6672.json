Non-learning Methods. Although traditional non-learning methods are much less accurate, they are widely used due to their high efficiency. We compare Duet with them to evaluate Duet‚Äôs time efficiency. Sampling. This estimator uniformly samples p%percentùëùp\\% tuples into the memory and applies estimation on those samples. We use the implementation from [ref]6 . Independent (Indep). This estimator assumes that each column is independent and uses the multiplication of each column‚Äôs predicates‚Äô selectivity to estimate cardinality. We use the implementation in [ref]6 . MHist¬† . MHist is an nùëõn-dimensional histogram estimator which is widely used in most databases. We use the implementation in  . Query-driven Models. Query-driven models are the first kind of learned cardinality estimators. They can achieve high accuracy when the evaluation queries have the same distribution as the training data. We choose the most representative and widely used methods as competitors. MSCN¬†. This query-driven estimator uses a multi-set convolutional neural network to deal with multiple tables, joins, and then performs an end-to-end estimation. We use MSCN (bitmaps) as the baseline, which is the most accurate MSCN type¬† and the implementation is in¬† . Data-driven Models. Data-driven models include the most advanced estimation models. We compare both Duet‚Äôs procession and the cost with them. DeepDB¬† . This model learns sum-product networks (SPN) to represent the joint data distribution. This is a novel method that uses SPN, a non-neural deep model, to solve the cardinality estimation problem. Naru¬†[ref]6. Naru is the first method that learns the dataset‚Äôs distribution with a deep autoregressive neural network. Duet is implemented based on Naru‚Äôs code. We also extend its code to support two-sided queries. Therefore, we can compare Duet with it on both single-sided and two-sided queries. We used the recommended hyper-parameter setting described in its documentation¬†. We use the same network architecture as Duet. Hybrid Models UAE¬†[ref]5. UAE is the first method that expands Naru into hybrid training. It revamps the progressive sampling process with the Gumbel-Softmax trick to make Naru‚Äôs estimation process differentiable so they can apply backpropagation to it and improve the model‚Äôs accuracy. We modified its code slightly to adapt our test workload. We use the same network architecture as Duet.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: with them to evaluate Duet‚Äôs time efficiency. Sampling.
