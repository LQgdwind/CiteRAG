      "content": "Paper Title: Tracking Changing Probabilities via Dynamic Learners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provided pointers on relevant work for the tools and techniques we\nused throughout the paper. In this section, we briefly situate our\nwork within the broader context of similar tasks and problem domains,\nand provide a short history. This paper extends our ongoing work on developing large-scale online\nmulticlass learning techniques, for lifelong continual learning when\nthe set of classes is large and dynamic  , in\nparticular in the framework of prediction games for learning a growing\nvocabulary of concepts  [ref]25 . In online\n(supervised) learning, e.g.   , the\nfocus is often on the interaction of the predictors (features) and,\nfor example, on learning a good weighting combination for a linear\nmodel, while we have focused on learning good independent probabilistic\npredictors, akin to the (multiclass) Naive Bayes model\n, as well as the counting techniques for n-gram\nlanguage models , but in a non-stationary setting.\nInvestigating online techniques for learning good mixing weights, also\nhandling the non-stationarities, may prove a fruitful future\ndirection, for instance in the mold of (sleeping) experts algorithms\n  . Our task and solution involves a kind of change detection, and change\ndetection is a diverse subject studied in several fields such as\npsychology (e.g. in human vision) and\nimage processing and time series analysis\n  . Here, we also seek a\nresponse or an adaptation to the change. The online observe-update\ncycle of a semi-distribution has a resemblance to online (belief)\nstate estimation, e.g. in Kalman filters and partially observed Markov\nmodels for control and decision making, in particular with a discrete\nstate space  . Here, the goal is pure\nprediction, though some of the techniques developed here may be\nrelevant, specially when one faces a changing external world.\nStreaming algorithms aim to compute useful summary statistics, such as\nunique counts and averages, while being space and time efficient, in\nparticular often requiring a single pass over a large data set or\nsequence, such as the count-min sketch algorithm\n. Here, we have been interested in computing\nrecent proportions in a non-stationary setting, for continual\nprediction, implemented by each of many (severely) resource-bounded\npredictors. Learning rate decay has been shown beneficial for training on\nbackpropagation-based neural networks, and there is research work at\nexplaining the reasons  4. Here, we\nmotivated decay variants in the context of EMA updates and learning\ngood probabilities fast, and motivated keeping predictand-specific\nrates.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: learning techniques, for lifelong continual learning when\nthe set of classes is large and dynamic  , in\nparticular in the framework of prediction games for learning a growing\nvocabulary of concepts  [ref]25 .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
