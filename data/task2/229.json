      "content": "Paper Title: Heavy-tailed Representations, Text Polarity Classification & Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparison with existing work. We compare GENELIEX¬†with two state of the art methods for dataset augmentation, Wei and Zou  and Kobayashi . Contrarily to these works which use heuristics and a synonym dictionary, GENELIEX¬†does not require any linguistic resource.\nTo ensure that the improvement brought by GENELIEX¬†is not only due to BERT, we have updated the method in  with a BERT language model (see Appendix B.7 for details and Table¬†7 for hyperparameters).\nEvaluation Metrics. Automatic evaluation of generative models for text is still an open research problem. We rely both on perceptive evaluation and automatic measures to evaluate our model through four criteria (C1, C2, C3,C4). C1 measures Cohesion  (Are the generated sequences grammatically and semantically consistent?). C2 (named Sent. in Table 3) evaluates label conservation (Does the expressed sentiment in the generated sequence match the sentiment of the input sequence?). C3 measures the diversity  (corresponding to dist1 or dist2 in Table 3111dist‚Äânùëõn is obtained by calculating the number of distinct nùëõn-grams divided by the total number of generated tokens to avoid favoring long sequences.) of the sequences (Does the augmented dataset contain diverse sequences?). Augmenting the training set with very diverse sequences can lead to better classification performance. C4 measures the improvement in terms of F1 score when training a classifier (fastText [ref]32) on the augmented training set (Does the augmented dataset improve classification performance?). \nDatasets. GENELIEX¬†is evaluated on two datasets, a medium and a large one (see ) which respectively contains 1k and 10k labeled samples. In both cases, we have access to ùíügnsubscriptùíüsubscriptùëîùëõ\\mathcal{D}_{g_{n}} a dataset of 80k unlabeled samples. Datasets are randomly sampled from Amazon and Yelp. \nExperiment description. We augment extreme regions of each dataset according to three algorithms: GENELIEX¬†(with scaling factor ŒªùúÜ\\lambda ranging from 1 to 1.5), Kobayashi , and Wei and Zou . For each train set‚Äôs sequence considered as extreme, 101010 new sequences are generated using each algorithm. Appendix¬†B.7 gathers further details. For experiment C4 the test set contains 104superscript10410^{4} sequences.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Augmenting the training set with very diverse sequences can lead to better classification performance. C4 measures the improvement in terms of F1 score when training a classifier (fastText [ref]32) on the augmented training set (Does the augmented dataset improve classification performance?). \nDatasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
