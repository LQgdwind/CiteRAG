      "content": "Paper Title: Joint covariate-alignment and concept-alignment: a framework for domain generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIf the loss function d​(⋅,⋅)𝑑⋅⋅d(\\cdot,\\cdot) is non-negative, symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality, then for a given representation function f𝑓f: We have: where (4) follows from the reorganization of (4) and the fact that a≤|a|𝑎𝑎a\\leq|a|, ∀afor-all𝑎\\forall a and (7) follows from the definitions of ϵ(u)​(g,l(u))superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑢𝑔superscript𝑙𝑢\\epsilon^{(u)}(g,l^{(u)}), ϵ(s)​(g,l(s))superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑠𝑔superscript𝑙𝑠\\epsilon^{(s)}(g,l^{(s)}), ϵ(s)​(g,l(u))superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑠𝑔superscript𝑙𝑢\\epsilon^{(s)}(g,l^{(u)}) in (1), (2), (3), the symmetry of d​(⋅,⋅)𝑑⋅⋅d(\\cdot,\\cdot), and the triangle inequality d​(g​(𝒛),l(u)​(𝒛))−d​(g​(𝒛),l(s)​(𝒛))≤d​(l(u)​(𝒛),l(s)​(𝒛))𝑑𝑔𝒛superscript𝑙𝑢𝒛𝑑𝑔𝒛superscript𝑙𝑠𝒛𝑑superscript𝑙𝑢𝒛superscript𝑙𝑠𝒛d(g(\\bm{z}),l^{(u)}(\\bm{z}))-d(g(\\bm{z}),l^{(s)}(\\bm{z}))\\leq d(l^{(u)}(\\bm{z}),l^{(s)}(\\bm{z})).\n∎ The bound in (4) characterizes the risk of using a classifier trained on a seen domain but applied to the unseen domain.\nThe bound contains three terms: (a) the first term captures the risk induced by the classifier on a seen domain for a given representation function f𝑓f, (b) the second term measures the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of seen and unseen domains in the latent space corresponding to representation function f𝑓f, and (c) the third term quantifies the mismatch between optimal classifiers for seen and unseen domains for the given f𝑓f. Our bound shares some similarities with the bound proposed by Ben-David et al. 1. Particularly, for any representation function f𝑓f, the following bound holds 1:\n\n where dℋsubscript𝑑ℋd_{\\mathcal{H}} is ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-divergence  and: In 1, the above bound was developed for the DA setting. We have adapted it to the DG setting by identifying “source” domains in DA with “seen” domains in DG and the “target” domain in DA with the “unseen” domain in DG.\nWhile the first two terms of (4) and (8) are quite similar, the main difference comes from the way that the third term is optimized in practice.\nThe practical DA algorithm proposed in 1 ignores optimizing the third term λ𝜆\\lambda of the upper bound in (8) since the second term of the infimum in (9) cannot be estimated during training. Moreover, the first term of the infimum in (9) is already captured in the first term of the upper bound in (8). \nIn the DG setting too, since the unseen domain samples are not available during training, one usually optimizes the bound only over several seen domains as in 3 [ref]1 .\nIn contrast, the third term in (4) measures the mismatch of optimal classifiers between domains and, therefore, can be practically optimized via designing a representation function f𝑓f followed by a classifier g𝑔g that is optimal for all (seen) domains.\nAs will be shown later, finding an optimal classifier over all domains encourages the use of concept-alignment algorithms.\nIndeed, designing a classifier that is optimal over all domains is the principle behind the recently proposed IRM algorithm . It is also worth comparing our bound with the bound proposed by Lyu et al. .\nIndeed, Lemma 1 in  extends the work in 1 to establish a new upper bound on the prediction risk in the unseen domain that is a function of both the representation mapping f𝑓f and the classifier g𝑔g.\nWhile the first two terms of the bound in  are quite similar to our first two terms, their third term is a constant which is completely independent of both f𝑓f and g𝑔g.\nThus, the bound in  does not encourage the use of concept-alignment algorithms. In practice, the proposed algorithms in 1 and  only aim to achieve covariate-alignment, i.e., minimizing the discrepancy of marginal distributions between domains. Next, to explicitly show that Theorem 1 motivates the combination of both covariate-alignment and concept-alignment algorithms, we define the following two terms: and: The first quantity Δ1subscriptΔ1\\Delta_{1} captures the maximum mismatch of marginal distributions between domains in latent space.\nThus, minimizing Δ1subscriptΔ1\\Delta_{1} supports achieving covariate-alignment.\nOn the other hand, the second quantity Δ2subscriptΔ2\\Delta_{2} measures the maximum mismatch of optimal classifiers between domains.\nSince stochastic classifiers are considered, enforcing a small mismatch between classifiers leads to a small discrepancy of conditional distributions p​(Y|Z)𝑝conditional𝑌𝑍p(Y|Z) between domains.\nIn other words,\nminimizing Δ2subscriptΔ2\\Delta_{2} over representation functions supports achieving concept-alignment. Under the settings of Theorem 1, for a given representation function f𝑓f: The proof directly follows by using Theorem 1, the definitions in (10), (11) and the fact that ∫𝒛p(s)​(𝒛)​𝑑𝒛=1subscript𝒛superscript𝑝𝑠𝒛differential-d𝒛1\\int_{\\bm{z}}p^{(s)}(\\bm{z})d\\bm{z}=1.\n∎ If the representation space is compact\nand the distance d​(⋅,⋅)𝑑⋅⋅d(\\cdot,\\cdot) is bounded\nthen\n∫𝒛d​(g​(𝒛),l(u)​(𝒛))​𝑑𝒛subscript𝒛𝑑𝑔𝒛superscript𝑙𝑢𝒛differential-d𝒛\\int_{\\bm{z}}d(g(\\bm{z}),l^{(u)}(\\bm{z}))\\,d\\bm{z} is finite.\nThus, minimizing the risk on seen domain ϵ(s)​(g,l(s))superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑠𝑔superscript𝑙𝑠\\epsilon^{(s)}(g,l^{(s)}) together with the covariate-alignment term Δ1subscriptΔ1\\Delta_{1} and the concept-alignment term Δ2subscriptΔ2\\Delta_{2} encourages the trained classifier g𝑔g to generalize well on the unseen domain.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: term of the upper bound in (8). \nIn the DG setting too, since the unseen domain samples are not available during training, one usually optimizes the bound only over several seen domains as in 3 [ref]1 .\nIn contrast, the third term in (4) measures the mismatch of optimal classifiers between domains and, therefore, can be practically optimized via designing a representation function f𝑓f\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
