      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient and Accurate Adaptive Resolution for Weakly-Compressible SPH\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Taylor-Green problem is a widely used benchmark to study accuracy in\nSPH  . The exact solution for the\nTaylor-Green problem is given by, where the superscript (.)+(.)^{+} indicate dimensional quantity, U∞=1subscript𝑈1U_{\\infty}=1\nm/s, b=−8​π2/R​e𝑏8superscript𝜋2𝑅𝑒b=-8\\pi^{2}/Re, R​e=U​L/ν𝑅𝑒𝑈𝐿𝜈Re=UL/\\nu, and L=1𝐿1L=1 m. In the results we use the\ndimensionless velocities u=u+/U∞𝑢superscript𝑢subscript𝑈u=u^{+}/U_{\\infty} and v=v+/U∞𝑣superscript𝑣subscript𝑈v=v^{+}/U_{\\infty}, pressure\np=p+/ρ0​U∞2𝑝superscript𝑝subscript𝜌0subscriptsuperscript𝑈2p=p^{+}/\\rho_{0}U^{2}_{\\infty}, and distance x=x/L𝑥𝑥𝐿x=x/L and y=y/L𝑦𝑦𝐿y=y/L. The domain\nis a square region [0,L]×[0,L]0𝐿0𝐿[0,L]\\times[0,L] with an inner refinement zone\n[0.1​L,0.5​L]×[0.1​L,0.5​L]0.1𝐿0.5𝐿0.1𝐿0.5𝐿[0.1L,0.5L]\\times[0.1L,0.5L] where the resolution is 2 times higher than\nthe outer resolution. We simulate the problem using the parameters given\nin table 2. We consider two Reynolds numbers 200200200 and 100010001000, and simulate the problem\nusing the adaptive algorithm proposed in this paper with three different minimum\nresolutions L/Δ​xmax𝐿Δsubscript𝑥L/\\Delta x_{\\max} of 50, 100 and 150. We compare the results with the\nexact solution and the non-adaptive simulation with a resolution that matches\nthe minimum resolution of the adaptive case. For the R​e=200𝑅𝑒200Re=200 case we also\ncompare with the Adaptive Particle Refinement (APR) results\nof . Figure 10 shows the velocity magnitude and the pressure particle\nplots for R​e=200𝑅𝑒200Re=200 at t=2.5𝑡2.5t=2.5 s. The velocity and pressure contours show\nless decay than . Specifically, note that the high\nvelocity regions near the interface of the layers are well maintained in the\npresent work. We show the results for R​e=1000𝑅𝑒1000Re=1000\nin fig. 11. It can be seen that the results are as expected\nand the contours do not show any decay or change in shape. We note that there is\na drift in the average pressure and subtract it from the pressure contour\nplots. This drift in pressure is due to errors in the total volume conservation\n, which is computed as follows, Figure 12 shows the error in total volume. We compare the adaptive\nand non-adaptive cases with the non-adaptive δ+superscript𝛿\\delta^{+}-SPH results by\n who simulated the problem with R​e=1000𝑅𝑒1000Re=1000 at a\nresolution L/Δ​x=400𝐿Δ𝑥400L/\\Delta x=400. As can be seen in fig. 12,\nthe errors in the present work for L/Δ​x=150𝐿Δ𝑥150L/\\Delta x=150 are almost five times\nsmaller than the case with L/Δ​x=400𝐿Δ𝑥400L/\\Delta x=400 of\n. However, the adaptive cases have a larger errors\nwhich drop as the resolution increases. Figure 13(a) shows the spatial distribution of the smoothing length\nhℎh. As can be seen the smoothing length is almost constant in the interior of\nthe respective regions. At the interface between the two regions having\ndifferent mass the value is changing gradually. Figure 13(b) show\nthe distribution of number of neighbors of each particle. It can be seen that in\nthe interior of the regions the value is around 303030. Whereas, in the interface\nbetween the two regions it is larger as would be expected. Since bulk of the\nparticles have minimum number of neighbors the method is efficient. In fig. 14 and fig. 15 we plot the maximum velocity\ndecay and the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} error in the velocity for R​e=200𝑅𝑒200Re=200, and R​e=1000𝑅𝑒1000Re=1000\nrespectively with different minimum resolutions. The maximum velocity decay\nshows good agreement with the exact solution. We also compare with the\nnon-adaptive case at different resolutions. Although we do not expect greater\naccuracy than the non-adaptive case due to the presence of lower resolution\nregions, we expect the errors to be of the same order as that of the\nnon-adaptive case. The L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} norms reveal that the errors in the adaptive case\nare almost 2 times the errors in the non-adaptive case for R​e=200𝑅𝑒200Re=200, whereas for\nthe R​e=1000𝑅𝑒1000Re=1000 case, the errors are lower. The increase in the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} error for\nthe adaptive case at R​e=200𝑅𝑒200Re=200 is due to the effect of having an approximately\nconstant number of neighbors in the adaptive region. Normally, the\ndiscretization error due to the viscous operator reduces when the number of\nneighbors is increased. In addition, this error is significant at low Reynolds\nnumbers and hence causes an increase in the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} error. This is consistent with\nthe findings of [ref]39 (figure 11 and table 5), and\n (figure 15). A theoretical proof of this is available in the\nwork of . At R​e=200𝑅𝑒200Re=200 the viscous error dominates, however,\nat R​e=1000𝑅𝑒1000Re=1000 the viscous effect is not dominant and the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} error behaves as\nexpected; the adaptive method has a smaller L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} error than the non-adaptive\ncase. In fig. 16 we show the kinetic energy decay for R​e=200𝑅𝑒200Re=200 and\nR​e=1000𝑅𝑒1000Re=1000 at different minimum resolutions. We compare with the exact,\nnon-adaptive, and the APR simulation of . Our results\nmatch the non-adaptive decay and barring a slight increase the exact decay,\nwhereas the APR scheme shows comparatively large decay. Figure 17\nshows the error in the kinetic energy versus time. For the R​e=200𝑅𝑒200Re=200 case the\nresults show an anomalous behavior as seen from the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} error. The R​e=1000𝑅𝑒1000Re=1000\ncases behave as expected. The above results show that the proposed method is accurate, displays less\ndissipation than other recent techniques proposed for adaptive resolution, and\nrequires minimum number of neighbors for bulk of the particles. This makes the\nproposed method both accurate and efficient.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: number of\nneighbors is increased. In addition, this error is significant at low Reynolds\nnumbers and hence causes an increase in the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} error. This is consistent with\nthe findings of [ref]39 (figure 11 and table 5), and\n (figure 15). A theoretical proof of this is available in the\nwork of .
