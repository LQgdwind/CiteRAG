      "content": "Paper Title: Cognitive Accident Prediction in Driving Scenes: A Multimodality Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRoad accidents account for a significant portion of the annual number of fatalities in the world, especially among young people [ref]1.\nIn order to avoid such accidents, traffic accident prediction aims to forecast the future traffic accident in advance, and make timely decisions for successful collision avoidance. Facing this goal, current autonomous driving and assisted driving systems have devoted more and more efforts to predict the status of road participants in surroundings, such as the trajectory prediction     , action prediction   , and behavioral intention prediction  , etc.\nHowever, one inherent challenge still remains: traffic accidents often occur in a very short time window and at extraordinary regions. Learning such clues demands mining the sparse spatial-temporal semantics of accidents and being aware of the sudden inconsistent shifts from the normal condition to an accident situation, as shown in Fig. 1.\nIn addition, the varying weather and light conditions, highly-imbalanced accident types, and numerous occasions increase the prediction difficulty. Recently, a number of traffic accident prediction models in dashcam videos have emerged   [ref]15 to predict the occurrence label of the beginning time of an accident with the preference of larger Time-to-Accident (TTA). Scrutinizing these models, the common paradigms concentrate on the consistency or correlation of the object tracklets  [ref]15 or visual context [ref]16   in deep learning. The spatial interaction model is commonly adopted to explore the visual context, such as the spatial-temporal attention networks [ref]16  that take the primary pipeline for video inference for accident situations. However, it is common sense that accidents are more likely to occur in the severe environment conditions, during which the target objects are difficult to be detected or tracked, and the feasibility of these mainstream methods is limited. Most recently, Bao and Kong  propose a deep reinforced accident anticipation model with fixation guidance, while they pre-train the driver attention map offline, and do not explore the text description that is promising for cognition-inspired video reasoning problems 0 1 2 3. In this work, we explore human cognition clues to assist accident prediction in driving videos. In particular, we explore the text description before the accident, as well as the driver attention in driving situations to boost the accuracy and the explainability of the accident prediction model, which has the apparent semantic guidance for the object to be involved in the accident and helps to find the crashing object efficiently. From Fig. 1, without the textual description and the driver attention guidance, the pedestrian is hard to be found. Actually, as investigated by the gaze data-based exploratory study 4, AI models and humans can collaboratively improve road safety in conditional automation but effective computation models are under-explored. In order to fulfill this purpose, we extend the self-collected DADA-2000 benchmark  (with driver attention map for each frame) with text description for the video frames before the accident, as well as the label at the beginning time of the collision.\nIn addition, we also partition each video sequence into different accident categories. The extended factual description before the accident and the driver attention map is adopted to learn a Cognitive Accident Prediction (CAP) model.\nIn addition to DADA-2000, we also construct a new large-scale accident benchmark (named CAP-DATA) for performance evaluation in this work. It contains 11,727 in-the-wild dashcam videos with 2.19 million frames.\nWe annotate the fact-effect-reason-introspection description for each accident video, which consists of the factual description before the accident, the categorical accident description, the accident reason description, and the preventive advice description. To our best knowledge, this is the largest accident prediction benchmark in driving scenarios. Based on the new benchmarks, we introduce a new vision-text fusion model, called Cognitive Accident Prediction (CAP). In particular, the proposed CAP model consists of three core modules: attentive text-to-vision shift fusion module, attentive semantic context transfer module, and driver attention guided accident prediction module. It is worth noting that we learn the coherence of text-vision semantics by cascade attentive networks, where each attentive module fulfills the core semantic learning for accident prediction, and contributes human-inspired cognitive modeling. Attentive text-to-vision shift fusion (Sec. IV-A) is modeled by inferring the coherently semantic relation of text and video for accident prediction. Besides, the text-to-video shift strategy aims to leverage the semantic knowledge in the text to video, so as to adapt to the practical testing phase only with the video data. The attentive semantic context transfer module (Sec. IV-B) encodes the scene context that is modeled by the Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which imitates the ability of human beings for historical and contextual memory learning. Finally, the driver attention guided accident prediction module (Sec. IV-C) forecasts the beginning time of the accident and reconstructs the driver attention map simultaneously. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can obtain a more accurate prediction with a larger Time-to-Accident (TTA) than other state-of-the-art methods 111The code, CAP-DATA, and all results will be released in https://github.com/JWFanggit/LOTVS-CAP. The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Sec. II briefly reviews the related works. CAP-DATA is presented in Sec. III, and the proposed method in Sec. IV. We evaluate the proposed method and analyze the results in Sec. V followed by the conclusion in Sec. VI.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Road accidents account for a significant portion of the annual number of fatalities in the world, especially among young people [ref]1.\nIn order to avoid such accidents, traffic accident prediction aims to forecast the future traffic accident in advance, and make timely decisions for successful collision avoidance.
