      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Generalization in Meta-Learning via Meta-Gradient Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost meta-learning methods can be summarized into a two-loop framework  [ref]10 [ref]11. The outer loop first involves sampling a batch of tasks {𝒯t}t=1T∼p​(𝒯)similar-tosubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝒯𝑡𝑇𝑡1𝑝𝒯\\{\\mathcal{T}_{t}\\}^{T}_{t=1}\\sim p(\\mathcal{T}), and then updating meta-parameters based on feedback derived from the inner loop over these tasks. In each inner loop, with the given meta-parameter ω𝜔\\omega and fine-tuning policy ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, the base parameters are updated from θ​(ω)𝜃𝜔\\theta(\\omega) to θt​(ω)subscript𝜃𝑡𝜔\\theta_{t}(\\omega) on support samples Dtssubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑠𝑡D^{s}_{t} for the t𝑡t-th task: Afterwards, the feedback is usually defined as the loss on query sample Dtqsubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑞𝑡D^{q}_{t} derived from the fine-tuned θt​(ω)subscript𝜃𝑡𝜔\\theta_{t}(\\omega). Let ℒo​u​t​e​rsubscriptℒ𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑟\\mathcal{L}_{outer} denote the loss function in the outer loop, and meta-parameters are finally optimized by minimizing empirical risk, i.e., arg⁡minω∑tℒo​u​t​e​r​(θt​(ω),Dtq)subscript𝜔subscript𝑡subscriptℒ𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑟subscript𝜃𝑡𝜔subscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑞𝑡\\mathop{\\arg\\min}_{\\omega}\\sum_{t}\\mathcal{L}_{outer}(\\theta_{t}(\\omega),D^{q}_{t}). Without loss of generality, using the gradient descent, meta-update in the o𝑜o-th outer-loop can be further formalized as where β𝛽\\beta is the meta-learning rate, t𝑡t and T𝑇T are the index and number of tasks, respectively. Note that different meta-parameter deployments θ​(ω)𝜃𝜔\\theta(\\omega) and fine-tuning algorithms ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} motivate different branches of meta-learning methods. The well-known gradient-based meta-learning (GBML)  [ref]34 takes ω𝜔\\omega as the initialization of base parameters θ𝜃\\theta and fine-tunes them by gradient descent, such as MAML  , Meta-SGD   etc. Formally, let ℒi​n​n​e​rsubscriptℒ𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑟\\mathcal{L}_{inner} denotes the loss in the inner loop, then ℱ≜arg⁡minθℒi​n​n​e​r​(θ​(ω),Dts)≜ℱsubscript𝜃subscriptℒ𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑟𝜃𝜔subscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑠𝑡\\mathcal{F}\\triangleq\\mathop{\\arg\\min}_{\\theta}\\mathcal{L}_{inner}(\\theta(\\omega),D^{s}_{t}). Similarly, after the o𝑜o-th outer loop, the initialization and the i𝑖i-th update of the base learner are as follows: where α𝛼\\alpha is the base learning rate. Clearly, GBML expects to meta-learn good initialization to adapt quickly to unseen tasks. An alternative metric-based meta-learning (MBML)   meta-learns feature extractors and freezes them in inner loops, i.e., θt​(ω)=θ​(ω)=ωsubscript𝜃𝑡𝜔𝜃𝜔𝜔\\theta_{t}(\\omega)=\\theta(\\omega)=\\omega. The query prediction is determined by the similarity between the support feature and the query feature, where the similarity is calculated by a non-parametric metric such as Euclidean distance or cosine distance. This paper focuses on these two meta-learning branches, but our MGAug can also be used for other branches and methods  [ref]10 derived from this two-loop framework, such as R222-D222   and MetaOptNet  .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Most meta-learning methods can be summarized into a two-loop framework  [ref]10 [ref]11.
