The rank of a hyperplane arrangement is defined as the dimension of n.span​(𝒜)n.span𝒜\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A}). Every polyhedral set P⊂ℝn𝑃superscriptℝ𝑛P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} admits a irredundant realization as the intersection of finitely many closed half-spaces, P=H1+∩…​Hm+𝑃superscriptsubscript𝐻1…superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑚P=H_{1}^{+}\\cap\\ldots H_{m}^{+}, such that P𝑃P is not equal to the intersection of any proper subset of {H1+,…,Hm+}superscriptsubscript𝐻1…superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑚\\{H_{1}^{+},\\ldots,H_{m}^{+}\\} ([5, Sec. 26]). If P𝑃P is n𝑛n-dimensional, this irredundant realization is unique: the boundaries of these half-spaces are the affine hulls of the (n−1)𝑛1(n-1)-dimensional faces of P𝑃P. Let P⊂ℝn𝑃superscriptℝ𝑛P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} be a polyhedral set (of arbitrary dimension). Define the normal span of P𝑃P, denoted n.span​(P)n.span𝑃\\textrm{n.span}(P), to be the linear space spanned by the set of all vectors v𝑣v that are normal to some hyperplane H𝐻H such that H∩P=∅𝐻𝑃H\\cap P=\\emptyset. Define the rank of P𝑃P, denoted rank​(P)rank𝑃\\textrm{rank}(P), to be the dimension of n.span​(P)n.span𝑃\\textrm{n.span}(P) The following well-known lemma asserts that any redundant inequality in a system of linear inequalities with non-empty solution set is a non-negative linear combination of the other linear inequalities in the system: (Farkas’ Lemma III, [14, Prop. 1.9])\nLet A∈ℝm×d𝐴superscriptℝ𝑚𝑑A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}, z∈ℝm𝑧superscriptℝ𝑚z\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}, a0∈ℝdsubscript𝑎0superscriptℝ𝑑a_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}, z0∈ℝsubscript𝑧0ℝz_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}.\nThen a0T​x≤z0superscriptsubscript𝑎0𝑇𝑥subscript𝑧0a_{0}^{T}x\\leq z_{0} is valid for all x∈ℝd𝑥superscriptℝ𝑑x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} with A​x≤z𝐴𝑥𝑧Ax\\leq z if and only if at least one of the following hold: there exists a row vector c≥0→𝑐→0c\\geq\\vec{0} such that c​A=a0T𝑐𝐴superscriptsubscript𝑎0𝑇cA=a_{0}^{T} and c​z≤z0𝑐𝑧subscript𝑧0cz\\leq z_{0} there exists a row vector c≥0→𝑐→0c\\geq\\vec{0} such that c​A=0→𝑐𝐴→0cA=\\vec{0} and c​z<0𝑐𝑧0cz<0 All inequalities in Farkas’ Lemma III should be interpreted coordinate-wise. Condition (i) is the statement that the inequality a0T​x≤z0superscriptsubscript𝑎0𝑇𝑥subscript𝑧0a_{0}^{T}x\\leq z_{0} is redundant and can be expressed as a positive linear combination of the other inequalities in the system A​x≤z𝐴𝑥𝑧Ax\\leq z; condition (ii) implies that the polyhedral set determined by A​x≤z𝐴𝑥𝑧Ax\\leq z is empty. Let P𝑃P be a polyhedral set of dimension n𝑛n in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Then n.span​(P)=n.span​(𝒜)n.span𝑃n.span𝒜\\textrm{n.span}(P)=\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A}) where 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is the hyperplane arrangement If F𝐹F is an (n−1)𝑛1(n-1)-face of P𝑃P, then parallel translating aff​(F)aff𝐹\\textrm{aff}(F) along the normal vector to the hyperplane aff​(F)aff𝐹\\textrm{aff}(F) in the direction “away” from P𝑃P yields a hyperplane disjoint from P𝑃P. Hence n.span​(𝒜)⊂n.span​(P)n.span𝒜n.span𝑃\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A})\\subset\\textrm{n.span}(P). Farkas’ Lemma III gives the reverse containment, n.span​(𝒜)⊃n.span​(P)n.span𝑃n.span𝒜\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A})\\supset\\textrm{n.span}(P).\n∎ Let P𝑃P be a polyhedral set, and let F𝐹F be a proper face of P𝑃P. Then n.span​(P)=n.span​(F)n.span𝑃n.span𝐹\\textrm{n.span}(P)=\\textrm{n.span}(F). Let P=H1+∩…∩Hk+𝑃superscriptsubscript𝐻1…superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑘P=H_{1}^{+}\\cap\\ldots\\cap H_{k}^{+} be a realization of P𝑃P as an intersection of half-spaces and, for each i𝑖i, let v→isubscript→𝑣𝑖\\vec{v}_{i} be a vector normal to Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}. Farkas’ Lemma then tells us that n.span​(P)=span​{v→1,…,v→k}n.span𝑃spansubscript→𝑣1…subscript→𝑣𝑘\\textrm{n.span}(P)=\\mbox{span}\\{\\vec{v}_{1},\\ldots,\\vec{v}_{k}\\}. Note that is immediate from Definition 5.19 that n.span​(P)⊆n.span​(F)n.span𝑃n.span𝐹\\textrm{n.span}(P)\\subseteq\\textrm{n.span}(F). To see that n.span​(F)⊆n.span​(P)n.span𝐹n.span𝑃\\textrm{n.span}(F)\\subseteq\\textrm{n.span}(P), note that F=P∩H′𝐹𝑃superscript𝐻′F=P\\cap H^{\\prime} for H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} a supporting hyperplane of P𝑃P containing aff​(F)aff𝐹\\textrm{aff}(F), and therefore is a realization of F𝐹F as an intersection of half-spaces. Let ±v→plus-or-minus→𝑣\\pm\\vec{v} be a nonzero vector normal to H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} in the direction of (H′)±superscriptsuperscript𝐻′plus-or-minus(H^{\\prime})^{\\pm}. Since H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} is a supporting hyperplane of P𝑃P, at least one of H′±v→plus-or-minussuperscript𝐻′→𝑣H^{\\prime}\\pm\\vec{v} is disjoint from P𝑃P, so v∈n.span​(P)𝑣n.span𝑃v\\in\\textrm{n.span}(P). We then conclude that as desired.\n∎ Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, and let P1,P2subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2P_{1},P_{2} be cells of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. If P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} and P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} share a common face F𝐹F, then n.span​(P1)=n.span​(P2)n.spansubscript𝑃1n.spansubscript𝑃2\\textrm{n.span}(P_{1})=\\textrm{n.span}(P_{2}). By Lemma 5.23, n.s​p​a​n​(P1)=n.s​p​a​n​(F)=n.s​p​a​n​(P2)formulae-sequence𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛subscript𝑃1𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝐹𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛subscript𝑃2n.span(P_{1})=n.span(F)=n.span(P_{2}).\n∎ The following is now immediate: Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a connected polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Then n.span​(C)n.span𝐶\\textrm{n.span}(C) is independent of C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\mathcal{C}. In view of Lemma 5.25, we can formulate the following definition: For 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} a connected polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, define for any cell C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\mathcal{C}. The conclusion of Lemma 5.25 may not hold if 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is not connected. For example, consider the polyhedral complex in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} consisting of the infinite strip C1≔[ref]0 ×ℝ≔subscript𝐶101ℝC_{1}\\coloneqq[ref]0 \\times\\mathbb{R} and the square C2≔ [ref]3× [ref]3≔subscript𝐶22323C_{2}\\coloneqq [ref]3\\times [ref]3, along with all the faces of C1subscript𝐶1C_{1} and C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}. Then n.span​(C1)=ℝ×0n.spansubscript𝐶1ℝ0\\textrm{n.span}(C_{1})=\\mathbb{R}\\times 0 and n.span​(C2)=ℝ2n.spansubscript𝐶2superscriptℝ2\\textrm{n.span}(C_{2})=\\mathbb{R}^{2}. Let P⊂ℝn𝑃superscriptℝ𝑛P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} be a polyhedral set of dimension n𝑛n. Then P𝑃P is pointed if and only if rank​(P)=nrank𝑃𝑛\\textrm{rank}(P)=n. Without loss of generality, we may assume P𝑃P contains the origin.\nDenote the polar dual of P𝑃P by P∗superscript𝑃P^{*}: We have By Theorem 9.1 of 2, P∗superscript𝑃P^{*} is a polyhedron and P∗∗=Psuperscript𝑃absent𝑃P^{**}=P.\nBy Corollary 9.1a of 2, P∗∗superscript𝑃absentP^{**} is pointed.\n∎ Lemma 5.28 has the following immediate corollary: Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a connected polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. If rank​(𝒞)=nrank𝒞𝑛\\textrm{rank}(\\mathcal{C})=n then every cell of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is pointed; otherwise every cell of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is unpointed. Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a n𝑛n-dimensional, connected polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Let 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} be the hyperplane arrangement Then For any (n−1)𝑛1(n-1)-cell F∈𝒞𝐹𝒞F\\in\\mathcal{C}, normal vectors to aff​(F)aff𝐹\\textrm{aff}(F) are contained in n.span​(F)n.span𝐹\\textrm{n.span}(F). By Lemma 5.25, n.span​(F)=n.span​(𝒞)n.span𝐹n.span𝒞\\textrm{n.span}(F)=\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{C}). Hence n.span​(𝒜)⊂n.span​(𝒞)n.span𝒜n.span𝒞\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A})\\subset\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{C}). For the converse, fix any n𝑛n-cell C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\mathcal{C}. Then Lemma 5.22 implies where ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is the hyperplane arrangement Since ℋ⊂𝒜ℋ𝒜\\mathcal{H}\\subset\\mathcal{A}, this yields n.span​(𝒞)⊂n.span​(𝒜)n.span𝒞n.span𝒜\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{C})\\subset\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A}).\n∎ A decomposition like the one shown in Figure 6 is not a counterexample to Corollary 5.29, because it is not a polyhedral decomposition of ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} (c.f. Section 2). Specifically, C2∩C3subscript𝐶2subscript𝐶3C_{2}\\cap C_{3} is not a face of C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}, as it cannot be written as C2∩Hsubscript𝐶2𝐻C_{2}\\cap H for a supporting hyperplane H𝐻H of C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}.\nSimilarly, C2∩C4subscript𝐶2subscript𝐶4C_{2}\\cap C_{4} is not a face of C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}. Recall that the essentialization (see e.g. 3) of a hyperplane arrangement 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} is the hyperplane arrangement in the linear space n.span​(𝒜)⊂ℝnn.span𝒜superscriptℝ𝑛\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A})\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}.\nDenoting by n.span​(𝒜)⟂n.spansuperscript𝒜perpendicular-to\\text{n.span}(\\mathcal{A})^{\\perp} the orthogonal complement of n.span​(𝒜)n.span𝒜\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A}) in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, it follows immediately from the definition that H′∈ess​(𝒜)superscript𝐻′ess𝒜H^{\\prime}\\in\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{A}) if and only if H′⊕n.span​(𝒜)⟂∈𝒜direct-sumsuperscript𝐻′n.spansuperscript𝒜perpendicular-to𝒜H^{\\prime}\\oplus\\text{n.span}(\\mathcal{A})^{\\perp}\\in\\mathcal{A} (3). We define the essentialization of an unpointed polyhedral decomposition of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}: Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a connected polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Define the essentialization of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} to be the family of sets An immediate consequence of Corollary 5.29 is that every cell of ess​(𝒞)ess𝒞\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C}) is pointed. Furthermore, Corollary 5.29 implies that if all cells of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} are pointed, then ess​(𝒞)=𝒞ess𝒞𝒞\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C})=\\mathcal{C}. The reader may verify the following result: For any connected polyhedral complex 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, the essentialization of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, ess​(𝒞)ess𝒞\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C}), is a polyhedral complex and |ess​(𝒞)|=n.span​(𝒞)∩|𝒞|ess𝒞n.span𝒞𝒞|\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C})|=\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{C})\\cap|\\mathcal{C}|. Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a connected polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}.\nThen there is a strong deformation retraction r:|𝒞|×[ref]0 →|ess​(𝒞)|:𝑟→𝒞01ess𝒞r:|\\mathcal{C}|\\times[ref]0 \\to|\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C})| such that If C𝐶C is a k𝑘k-cell of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, r​(C)𝑟𝐶r(C) is a (k−n+rank​(𝒞))𝑘𝑛rank𝒞(k-n+\\textrm{rank}(\\mathcal{C}))-cell of ess​(𝒞)ess𝒞\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C}). The cellular map 𝒞→ess​(𝒞)→𝒞ess𝒞\\mathcal{C}\\to\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C}) given by C↦r​(C)maps-to𝐶𝑟𝐶C\\mapsto r(C) is a poset-preserving bijection. r​(C)⊂C𝑟𝐶𝐶r(C)\\subset C for all C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\mathcal{C}. Let π:ℝn→n.span​(𝒞):𝜋→superscriptℝ𝑛n.span𝒞\\pi:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{C}) denote orthogonal projection onto n.span​(𝒜)n.span𝒜\\textrm{n.span}(\\mathcal{A}). Then the linear contraction r​(x,t)≔x​t+π​(x)​(1−t)≔𝑟𝑥𝑡𝑥𝑡𝜋𝑥1𝑡r(x,t)\\coloneqq xt+\\pi(x)(1-t) has the desired properties.\n∎ We are now ready to define the canonical polytopal complex associated to a polyhedral complex imbedded in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a connected polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. The canonical polytopal complex 𝒦​(𝒞)𝒦𝒞\\mathcal{K}(\\mathcal{C}) associated to 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is the polytopal complex If every cell in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is pointed, ess​(𝒞)=𝒞ess𝒞𝒞\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C})=\\mathcal{C}, so the canonical polytopal complex 𝒦​(𝒞)𝒦𝒞\\mathcal{K}(\\mathcal{C}) is just com.part​(𝒞)com.part𝒞\\textrm{com.part}(\\mathcal{C}) from Definition 5.4. Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a connected polyhedral complex in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Then there is a strong deformation retraction H:|𝒞|→|𝒦​(𝒞)|:𝐻→𝒞𝒦𝒞H:|\\mathcal{C}|\\to|\\mathcal{K}(\\mathcal{C})| that induces a surjective cellular map from 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} to the canonical polytopal complex 𝒦​(𝒞)𝒦𝒞\\mathcal{K}(\\mathcal{C}) that preserves the face poset relation. Lemma 5.35 gives a strong deformation retraction from the arbitrary polyhedral complex 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} to the pointed polyhedral complex ess​(𝒞)ess𝒞\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C}) that induces a surjective cellular map that preserves the face poset relation. Proposition 5.8 then applies to the strong deformation retraction of ess​(𝒞)ess𝒞\\textrm{ess}(\\mathcal{C}) onto its compact part.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: The conclusion of Lemma 5.25 may not hold if 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is not connected.
