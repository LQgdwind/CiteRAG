      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion Video Autoencoders: Toward Temporally Consistent Face Video Editing via Disentangled Video Encoding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen editing a given real video, it is essential to preserve temporal consistency. First, Lai et al. [ref]14 consider editing global features of videos such as artistic style transfer, colorization, image enhancement, etc. To encourage temporal consistency, they train sequential image translator with temporal loss defined as the warping error between the output frames. Different from this work, our target task is to edit facial attributes of human face video. In other words, we aim to change face-related attributes such as eyeglasses, beards, etc. For this task, Yao et al. [ref]41 are the first that propose the editing pipeline: 1) align and crop the target face area, 2) encode these frames to latent features, manipulate and decode them, and 3) unalign and paste the edited frames to the original video. However, every step of this pipeline is conducted independently for each frame. For the manipulation step, they try to find disentangled editing directions for a desired attribute and take the same step for every frame, while expecting the disentanglement brings consistency automatically. However, the results show inconsistency and we conjecture that both latent space and learned direction are still entangled with many other attributes.\nNext, Tzaban et al.  additionally fine-tune the pretrained StyleGAN  to enhance reconstructability. Meanwhile, they assume that temporal consistency would be preserved when applying the same editing step to the latent features of the original frames. However, their assumption is not always true for all attributes, especially for beards and eyeglasses as shown in Fig. 1. Alauf et al.  also try to avoid temporal inconsistency by smoothing latent features. While the methods in the previous paragraph handle inconsistency implicitly, several works [ref]39 try to solve it more directly. After per-frame editing, Xu et al.  further optimize latent codes and the pretrained StyleGAN to enhance consistency between the frame pairs defined by involving bi-directional optical flow. On the other hand, Xia et al. [ref]39 propose to learn the dynamics of inverted GAN latent codes of video frames. The learned dynamics are used to generate the subsequent latent features after editing only the first frame. Additionally, although Skorokhodov et al.  mainly target to generate video, they also demonstrate manipulation results of the generated video. They model the video with a time-invariant content code and per-frame motion codes. Based on this modeling, the generated video can be manipulated with a target text by optimizing its content vector with CLIP loss. However, they cannot edit the real videos due to the absence of an encoding method. In contrast, our proposed method is capable of encoding and manipulating realistic face videos.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: When editing a given real video, it is essential to preserve temporal consistency.
