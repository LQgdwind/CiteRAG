Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

The reward is defined as while the safety cost where Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta is the deviation of the pole angle from the upright position. Effectively, we want to force the pendulum to swing up from one side. See Figure¬†3a. We use several safety gym environments¬†[ref]37. We use the benchmark environments PointGoal1, PointButton1, PointPush1, CarGoal1, CarPush1 (see Figures¬†3c-3h), but we also use a custom-made one from¬†[ref]51 (the environment is schematically depicted in Figure¬†3b.). In the custom-made environment called static point goal, a large static hazard region is placed in front of the goal. This is similar to our motivational example in Figure¬†1. This environment confirms our intuition. We use two robots, the point robot has 464646 states and 222 actions, while the car robot has 565656 states and 222 actions. Code base and hyper-parameters. Our code is based on two repositories: safety starter agents¬†[ref]37, and PID Lagrangian¬†. We have implemented the safety state augmentation following the description in¬†. We use default parameters for both code bases unless stated otherwise. We performed a parameter search where we set the batch size for all the environments to 512512512. We then tried a few runs with Ki‚àà[0.001,0.005,0.01,0.05]subscriptùêæùëñ0.0010.0050.010.05K_{i}\\in[0.001,0.005,0.01,0.05] and determined that Ki=0.05subscriptùêæùëñ0.05K_{i}=0.05 generally performs better for the goal and button tasks, while Ki=0.01subscriptùêæùëñ0.01K_{i}=0.01 appears to perform well for the push tasks. We then tested Kp‚àà[0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5,1,5]subscriptùêæùëù0.010.050.10.515K_{p}\\in[0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5,1,5] and our best results are presented in Table¬†A1. The simmering schedule changes the safety budget every 200200200 epochs, where the length of the epoch depends on the batch size and is presented in Table¬†A1.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Our first environment is a safe pendulum swing-up defined in¬†[ref]16 and built upon the Open AI Gym environment¬†.
