Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep View Synthesis via Self-Consistent Generative Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOn Multi-PIE and KITTI,\nwe compare SCGN with several state-of-the-art methods, including View Synthesis by Appearance Flow (VSAF) \n, Deep View Morphing (DVM) , View Independent Generative Adversarial Network (VI-GAN) [ref]24, Multi-Scale Adversarial Correlation Matching (MS-ACM) , and Extreme View Synthesis (EVS) 2.\nSince the source code of DVM, MS-ACM and VI-GAN are not public, we reimplement DVM and MS-ACM on TensorFlow 0 and VI-GAN on PyTorch . We also consider the widely used image-content-based method Encoder-Decoder (ED)  in the comparisons. ED is inspired by the Encoder-Decoder Network (EDN) in DVM. We employ the ED as a baseline to evaluate the content-based method. To this end, we modify the outputs and architecture of the decoders in the EDN to have the same input and output settings as our method.\nWe also extend the adversarial training scheme to DVM  and obtain its GAN-based variant, called adversarial DVM (ADVM). Furthermore, to demonstrate the excellent performance of our method, we further compare SCGN with some generative methods, e.g., Pix2Pix  and CycleGAN , and geometry-based methods that leverage known camera poses or plane-sweep volumes, e.g., Multi2Novel  and StereoMagnification , on KITTI.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: compare SCGN with several state-of-the-art methods, including View Synthesis by Appearance Flow (VSAF) \n, Deep View Morphing (DVM) , View Independent Generative Adversarial Network (VI-GAN) [ref]24, Multi-Scale Adversarial Correlation Matching (MS-ACM) , and Extreme View Synthesis (EVS) 2.\nSince the source code of DVM, MS-ACM and VI-GAN are not public, we reimplement DVM and MS-ACM on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
