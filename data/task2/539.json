      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Learned Indexes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile index structures are one of the most well-studied components of database management systems, recent work   provided a new perspective on this decades-old topic, showing how machine learning techniques can be used to develop so-called learned index structures. Unlike their traditional counterparts (e.g., [ref]20 [ref]16    ), learned index structures build an explicit model of the underlying data to provide effective indexing. Since learned index structures have been proposed, they have been criticized  .\nThe main reasons for these criticisms were the lack of an efficient open-source implementation of the learned index structure, inadequate data-sets, and the lack of a standardized benchmark suite to ensure a fair comparison between the different approaches. Even worse, the lack of an open-source implementation forced researchers to re-implement the techniques of , or only use back-of-the-envelop calculations, to compare against learned index structures.\nWhile not a bad thing per se, it is easy to leave the baseline unoptimized, or make other unrealistic assumptions, even with the best of intentions, potentially rendering the main takeaways void. For example, recently Ferragina and Vinciguerra proposed the PGM index [ref]13, a learned index structure with interesting theoretical properties, which is recursively built bottom-up. Their experimental evaluation showed that the PGM-index was strictly superior to traditional indexes as well as their own implementation of the original learned index . This strong result surprised the authors of , who had experimented with bottom-up approaches and usually found them to be slower to execute (see Section 3.4 for a discussion why this may be case). This motivated us to investigate if the results of [ref]13 would hold against tuned implementations of the original learned index  and other structures. Further complicating matters, learned structures have an “unfair” advantage on synthetic datasets, as synthetic datasets are often surprisingly easy to learn.\nHence, it is often easy to show that a learned structure outperforms the more traditional approaches just by using the right kind of data.\nWhile this is also true for almost any benchmark, it is much more pronounced for learned algorithms and data structures as their entire goal is to automatically adjust to the data distribution and even the workload. In this paper, we try to address these problems on three fronts: (1) we provide a first open-source implementation of RMIs for researchers to compare against and improve upon, (2) we created a repository of several real-world datasets and workloads for testing, and (3) we created a benchmarking suite, which makes it easy to compare against learned and traditional index structures.\nTo avoid comparing against weak baselines, our open-source benchmarking suite  contains implementations of index structures that are either widespread, tuned by their original authors, or both. Understanding learned indexes. In addition to providing an open source benchmark for use in future research, we also tried to achieve a deeper understanding of learned index structures, extending the work of . First, we present a Pareto analysis of three recent learned index structures (RMIs , PGM indexes [ref]13, and RS indexes ) and several traditional index structures, including trees, tries, and hash tables. We show that, in a warm-cache, tight-loop setting, all three variants of learned index structures can provide better performance/size tradeoffs than several state-of-the-art traditional index structures. We extend this analysis to multiple dataset sizes, 32 and 64-bit integers, and different search techniques (i.e., binary search, linear search, interpolation search). Second, we analyze why learned index structures achieve such good performance. While we were unable to find a single metric that fully explains the performance of an index structure (it seems intuitive that such a metric does not exist), we offer a statistical analysis of performance counters and other properties. The single most important explanatory variable was cache misses, although cache misses alone are not enough for a statistically significant explanation. Surprisingly, we found that branch misses do not explain why learned index structures perform better than traditional structures, as originally claimed in . In fact, we found that both learned index structures and traditional index structures use branching efficiently. Third, we analyze the performance of a wide range of index structures in the presence of memory fences, cold caches, and multi-threaded environments, to test their behavior under more realistic settings. In all scenarios, we found that learned approaches perform surprisingly well. However, our study is not without its limitations. We focused only on read-only workloads, and we tested each index structure in isolation (e.g., a lookup loop, not with integration into any broader application).\nWhile this certainly does not cover all potential use cases, in-memory performance is increasingly important, and many write-heavy DBMS architectures are also moving towards immutable read-only data-structures (for example, see LSM-trees in RocksDB  ). Hence, we believe our benchmark can still guide the design of many systems to come and, more importantly, serve as a foundation to develop benchmarks for mixed read/write workloads and the next generation of learned index structures which supports writes  [ref]13 .\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: provided a new perspective on this decades-old topic, showing how machine learning techniques can be used to develop so-called learned index structures.
