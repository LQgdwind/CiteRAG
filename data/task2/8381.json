      "content": "Paper Title: Words Matter: Leveraging Individual Text Embeddings for Code Generation in CLIP Test-Time Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTest-Time Adaptation.‚ÄÉ Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses the problem of adapting on-line a pre-trained model to a stream of unlabeled data points from a specific target domain, with no access to source domain samples    . Existing approaches for TTA in more traditional deep models can be roughly categorized into: i) normalization-based methods, which leverage the statistics of the test data to adjust the BatchNorm statistics of the model  ; ii) entropy-based approaches   , where the model is adapted optimizing the Shannon entropy of the predictions; and iii) pseudo-label strategies , which employ the test-time generated labels for supervising the model. With the advent of VLMs, several works have attempted to accommodate some of these techniques to adapt large pre-trained foundation models, particularly CLIP [ref]34   , which mainly differs on the different parameter groups updated during adaptation, i.e., prompt tuning [ref]34   or layer-norm   strategies. Test-Time Prompt Tuning (TPT) [ref]34 fine-tunes only the input text prompts, which are optimized by minimizing the marginal entropy of the model predictions. To achieve this, TPT generates multiple random augmented views for each test image, incurring additional costs due to performing multiple forward passes through the CLIP vision encoder for each image. Furthermore, TPT is largely an unimodal approach, which restricts a multi-modal model like CLIP from fully exploiting its multi-modal capabilities for adaptation. Vision-Text-Space Ensemble (VTE) , uses an ensemble of different prompts as input to the CLIP text encoder, where both text and visual encoders remain frozen. Nonetheless, keeping the vision encoder frozen makes it difficult for the model to adapt to images with severe noise effectively. Most recently, ClipART  and WATT  propose to fine-tune the normalization layers instead, resorting to pseudo-labels computed from image-to-image and text-to-text similarities. Clustering for unsupervised representation learning.‚ÄÉ Jointly learning how to adapt a set of learnable parameters of the deep network and identify the class assignments can be viewed as clustering and unsupervised representation learning. Thus, our work is closely related to recent literature on deep clustering-based approaches   [ref]3 5   7 [ref]4. In , kùëòk-means assignments are leveraged as pseudo-labels to learn visual representations, strategy that is later employed in [ref]3 to pre-train standard supervised deep models. Nevertheless, applying naive kùëòk-means risks collapsing to only a few imbalanced clusters, making it ineffective. The label assignment task is cast as an instance of the optimal transport problem in , which stresses that the formulation presented in  is not principled, since potential degenerate solutions are avoided via specific implementation choices. Caron et al. [ref]4 propose to enforce consistency between cluster assignments produced for different image views, or augmentations, which avoids expensive pairwise comparisons typically performed in contrastive learning. While we consider a similar formulation to some of these works, there exist several vital differences. In particular, all these works, e.g., [ref]3  ) are used in the context of unsupervised representation learning, and thus the prototypes are learned from the data distribution. In contrast, our approach leverages the text representations to enhance the cluster assignments. Note that text embeddings are accessible for free in language-vision models, and this does not incur additional supervision, as the test image label remains unknown. A natural benefit from this strategy is that we do not need to resort to additional augmentation or ‚Äúmulti-views‚Äù strategies [ref]4, which introduce a computational burden. Indeed, we can leverage individual text templates as ‚Äúaugmented views‚Äù, enhancing the representation learning of the adapted model without incurring additional costs. In fact, these embeddings are computed only once offline, whereas image augmentation or ‚Äúmulti-views‚Äù strategies must create the additional images online, and perform one forward pass per new augmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: labels for supervising the model.
