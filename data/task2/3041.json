      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Objective Optimization for Value-Sensitive and Sustainable Basket Recommendations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSustainable Development Goals   (SDG) have been proposed by the United Nations (UN) to describe several sustainability criteria in form of goals, tasks, and scenarios.\nEnvironment and society related sustainability goals can be broken down to numerous constraints and objectives   [ref]8 that affect everyday decisions,\nsuch as the reduction of CO2 emission with everyday activities.\nMaking a desired decision with respect to such constraints and objectives often introduces potential trade-offs, e.g. making a decision that minimizes CO2 emissions of a certain activity may increase the corresponding water footprint.\nIncluding personal values, such as preference/taste or budget constraints may introduce even more trade-offs and make the decision process more challenging.\nSeveral decision-support methods that tackle such problems are considered under the umbrella term of Artificial Intelligence (AI)    [ref]1.\nAI is expected to play a key role   in solving complex challenges arising from SDGs.\nNevertheless, applying AI may also inhibit sustainability challenges relevant to value-sensitive design, namely challenges related to:\n(i) unequal distribution of resources, (ii) loss individual of autonomy and privacy, and (iii) increased emissions from calculations   .\nValue-sensitive design of AI systems aims to address such challenges  [ref]47, by including personal and societal values as objective or constraints of the AI system. Existing macroscopic simulation and control models are used to estimate environmental impact but often do not deal or represent real-world data on individual/microscopic level.\nSuch models mostly rely on theoretical economical and climate models, which evaluate sustainability on a macroscopic or societal level   .\nA welfare objective function that includes analytical terms representing satisfaction from consumption and environmental pollution is often optimized   .\nThe optimization outcomes of such models are then used in analysis and policy making.\nAlthough macroscopic and/or centralized models can provide useful insights on decision-making at organizational level,\nit may not be possible to anticipate for errors in estimation of individual objective functions and system state.\nIndividual consumption is one of the main driving factors of industrial production, and thus has great environmental and societal impact  .\nEvery day, consumers are urged to take several decisions to fulfill their personal goals and values, mainly originating from individual needs and wishes.\nCriticism on centralized models often focuses on poor practical applications and potential high estimation errors  , as well as potential challenges to addressing personal values and morals  .\nIt may prove rather challenging to simulate and estimate individual or personalized recommendations that assist sustainable decision-making in a centralized macroscopic manner.\nData-oriented approaches that focus on individual/microscopic level can be directly applied in real-world scenarios in the form of mobile applications and website recommender systems  ,\nwhich can assist individuals in achieving more sustainable consumption   consciously.\nRelevant recommender systems and analyses mainly focus on diets or single product recommendations  [ref]1  . Shopping decisions often aim to satisfy several criteria, such as the taste, the ability of purchased products to be combined together, available consumer budget, and health implications of consuming the product.\nTrade-offs arise when optimizing for personal values, e.g. when a consumer needs to decide between a healthier and cheaper product.\nSuch trade-offs are mainly addressed by multi-objective optimization in modern recommender systems    9 .\nValue-sensitive design can be applied to create systems that support individual decisions when resolving these trade-offs  .\nFollowing a value-sensitive design indicates that personal values can be incorporated in the system design, often introducing new constraints and objectives to the optimization.\nThus, combining value-sensitive design and sustainable decision-making results in even more complex and challenging trade-off optimization problems.\nAlthough the effect of sustainable recommendations on individual purchases is often observed  6 , there is seemingly less quantitative analysis on the collective impact of more sustainable decisions on emissions, pollution, resource usage, and personal values. The main contributions of the current article are to: (i) propose and formalize a real-world multi-objective optimization problem for recommendations of personalized sustainable baskets, (ii) create and analyze a novel synthetic dataset based on sustainability and consumer real-world data, (iii) propose effective existing baselines for this problem, and (iv) design and implement a novel deep learning framework for mixed integer programming and multi-objective optimization problems.\nIn Section 2 an explicit formalization of the proposed optimization problem is presented.\nTherein constraints, trade-offs, and objectives originating from value-sensitive design and SDGs are combined to form a multi-objective optimization problem.\nThe proposed dataset structure can be used to evaluate similar real-world datasets by online retailers to enable value-sensitive sustainable recommendations.\nSection 3.1 introduces a novel deep learning architecture, termed gradient guided genetic algorithm (G3A), which combines the ability of evolutionary algorithms to solve complex multi-objective problems and the ability of Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Control (NODEC)   to efficiently and timely control complex processes, such as genetic evolution.\nSection 4 presents the results of experimental evaluation of G3A and other multi-objective optimization algorithms on the problem discussed in Section 2.\nSection 5 concludes the article.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: to describe several sustainability criteria in form of goals, tasks, and scenarios.\nEnvironment and society related sustainability goals can be broken down to numerous constraints and objectives   [ref]8 that affect everyday decisions,\nsuch as the reduction of CO2 emission with everyday activities.\nMaking a desired decision with respect to such constraints and objectives often introduces\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
