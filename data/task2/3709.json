      "content": "Paper Title: Disentangling Object Motion and Occlusion for Unsupervised Multi-frame Monocular Depth\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D environmental information is crucial for autonomous vehicles, robots, and AR/VR applications. Self-supervised monocular depth prediction [ref]9 [ref]10 [ref]12  provides an efficient solution to retrieve 3D information from a single camera without requiring expensive sensors or labeled data. In recent years these methods are getting more and more popular in both the research and industry communities. Conventional self-supervised monocular depth prediction methods [ref]9 [ref]10 [ref]12 take a single image as input and predicts the dense depth map. They generally use a re-projection loss which constraints the geometric consistency between adjacent frames in the training loss level, but they are not capable of geometric reasoning through temporal frames in the network prediction level, which limits their overall performance. Temporal and spatially continuous images are available in most real-world scenarios like autonomous vehicles  0 or smart devices  . Recent years multi-frame monocular depth prediction methods  7 8 2 4  are proposed to utilize the temporal image sequences to improve the depth prediction accuracy. Cost-volume-based methods 7 8 adopted the cost volume from stereo match tasks to enable the geometric reasoning through temporal image sequences in the network prediction level, and achieved overall state-of-the-art depth prediction accuracy while not requiring time-consuming recurrent networks. However, both the re-projection loss function and the cost volume construction are based on the static environment assumption, which does not hold for most real-world scenarios. Object motion will violate this assumption and cause re-projection mismatch and occlusion problems. The cost volume and loss values in the dynamic object areas are unable to reflect the quality of depth hypothesis and prediction, which will mislead the model training.\nRecent work  [ref]10   attempted to optimize depth prediction of dynamic object areas and achieved noticeable improvements, but they still have several drawbacks. (1) They only solve the mismatch problem at the loss function level, still cannot reason geometric constraints through temporal frames for dynamic objects, which limits its accuracy potential. (2) The occlusion problem introduced by object motions is still unsolved. (3) Redundant object motion prediction networks increased the model complexity and does not work for the motions of non-rigid objects. Pursuing accurate and generic depth prediction, we propose DynamicDepth, a self-supervised temporal depth prediction framework that disentangles the dynamic object motions. First, we predict a depth prior from the target frame and project to the reference frames for an implicit estimation of object motion without rigidity assumption, which is later disentangled by our Dynamic Object Motion Disentanglement (DOMD) module. We then build a multi-frame occlusion-aware cost volume to encode the temporal geometric constraints for the final depth prediction. In the training level, we further propose a novel occlusion-aware re-projection loss to alleviate the occlusion from the object motions, and a novel cycle consistent learning scheme to enable the final depth prediction and the depth prior prediction to mutually improve each other. To summarize, our contributions are as follows: We propose a novel Dynamic Object Motion Disentanglement (DOMD) module which leverages an initial depth prior prediction to solve the object motion mismatch problem in the final depth prediction. We devise a Dynamic Object Cycle Consistent training scheme to mutually reinforce the Prior Depth and the Final Depth prediction. We design an Occlusion-aware Cost Volume to enable geometric reasoning across temporal frames even in object motion occluded areas, and a novel Occlusion-aware Re-projection Loss to alleviate the motion occlusion problem in training supervision. Our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the Cityscapes  and KITTI 0 datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: 3D environmental information is crucial for autonomous vehicles, robots, and AR/VR applications.
