      "content": "Paper Title: Data Engineering for Data Analytics: A Classification of the Issues, and Case Studies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn anomaly can be defined as ‚Äúa pattern that does not conform\nto expected normal behaviour‚Äù [ref]31. Since anomalies\ncan potentially bias models to wrong conclusions from the data,\nidentifying and possibly repairing these values becomes critical\nduring the wrangling process. Anomalies arise in the data\nfor a variety of reasons, from systematic errors in measurement\ndevices to malicious activity or fraud. Anomaly detection is such an\nimportant topic that in many problems the detection of anomalies in a\ndataset is the analytical challenge itself (e.g.¬†fraud detection or intruder detection). Multiple statistical approaches exist for anomaly detection, which can\nbe grouped under the nature of the problem to be solved. Supervised\nanomaly detection requires a test dataset with labelled instances\nof anomalous entries. Classification machine learning algorithms are\nusually employed in this setting, where we consider that we are\nprovided with an unbalanced dataset¬† (we expect a lower fraction of\nanomalies). Unsupervised anomaly\ndetection assumes that no labels exists for the anomalous\ndata¬†. Clustering approaches are usually\nemployed in this setting, assuming that most of the data is normal,\nand that instances not fitting the distribution of the rest of the\ndata are anomalous. Finally, Semi-supervised anomaly detection\napproaches assume that training data is normal, builds a model over\nit, and tests the likelihood of a new instance being generated from\nthe learnt model¬†.\n\\justifyDetection: Anomaly detection is in principle harder than missing\ndata detection, since anomalies are not normally encoded explicitly in the\ndata. Approaches to anomaly detection can be classified as\nunivariate (based only on an individual feature) or\nmultivariate (based on multiple features). At a univariate\nlevel, a cell might be anomalous for syntatic reasons, e.g.¬†that the observed value ‚ÄúError‚Äù is not consistent with the known\ntype (e.g.¬†integer) of the variable666 In the database\nliterature this is termed a domain constraint.\n. Another cause of anomaly is\nsemantic, e.g.¬†that for an integer field representing months\nonly the values 1-12 are valid, and hence an entry 13 would be\nanomalous. A further class of anomaly is statistical, where\na model is built for the clean distribution of a feature, and\nanomalies are detected by being low-probability events under the clean\ndistribution. For multivariate statistical anomaly detection, one should distinguish between\nrow outlier detection (where a whole data instance is declared to\nbe an outlier, and discarded), and cell outlier detection, where only\none or more cells in the row are identified as anomalous777Our\nterminology here follows ..\nSome classical algorithms for unsupervised row outlier detection\ninclude Isolation Forests¬† and One Class\nSVMs¬†. More recently deep learning models have been\nused for cell outlier\ndetection, see e.g. ,. A multivariate approach to anomaly detection from the databases\ncommunity makes use of rule-based integrity constraints, such as\nfunctional dependencies or conditional functional dependencies,\nsee e.g.¬†. One example of such a constraint is that a\npostal code should entail the corresponding city or state, and one\ncan check for inconsistencies. Any violation of an integrity\nconstraint in the data would be identified as an error that needs to\nbe repaired. Practical example: A univariate statistical approach was followed in¬† to remove anomalous entries in the Tundra dataset. The observations were grouped by a certain taxon (e.g.¬†species, genus or site) and then a threshold was chosen based on eight times the standard deviation of a trait under the taxon (8‚ÄãœÉ8ùúé8\\sigma), flagging as anomalous every observation that deviated from the mean of the taxon more than the threshold. This procedure was employed for all the traits except ‚Äúplant height‚Äù and ‚Äúleaf area‚Äù, based on the recommendations of the domain experts.\n\\justifyRepair: anomaly repair techniques are similar to missing data repair. Normally, data scientists either remove the anomalous entries completely or, when locating anomalous values under a feature, they substitute those values by other sensible values. Practical example: in the Tundra dataset, the anomalous entries detected with the approach mentioned above were removed from the data, in order to avoid introducing biases into the model.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: An anomaly can be defined as ‚Äúa pattern that does not conform\nto expected normal behaviour‚Äù [ref]31.
