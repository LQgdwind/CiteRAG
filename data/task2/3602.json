      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Robustness of Neural-Statistical Features in Detection of Generative Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the well-known neural approaches to detection of text generated by Transformer neural networks is known as ‚ÄúGrover‚Äù . Grover is itself a generative text model, with an identical Transformer architecture to the original GPT-2, with the difference of using nucleus sampling rather than t‚Äão‚Äãpùë°ùëúùëùtop-kùëòk sampling for selecting the next word during generation. Grover was trained specifically trained on a corpus of internet news articles known as the RealNews dataset. Grover‚Äôs authors demonstrated the model is adept at detecting its own generated text. In this process, a classification token [CLS] is appended to the input text and the final output state vector for this token is used as the input to a linear layer of neurons that is used to classify text samples: a common approach in sequence classification using Transformer models . Analysis of detection of computer generated text has determined that a bi-directional Transformer model (RoBERTa) substantially outperforms Grover models of equivalent parameter size for detection of GPT-2 text . Discriminators from generative models such as Grover do, however, demonstrate improved performance when trained against the output of a smaller architecture (e.g., the GPT-2 355M parameter variant) and tested against a larger architecture (e.g., the GPT-2 1.5B parameter variant) . Grover has also been found to underperform compared to other fine-tuned Transformers when classifying computer-generated text generated by other models than Grover itself [ref]24.\nThis should be unsurprising ‚Äì it would be unreasonable to expect that the discriminator of a GPT-2 model trained on a specific news dataset (i.e., Grover‚Äôs detector) would outperform a discriminator not limited to that domain.\nPreliminary research into detection of computer-generated text has already confirmed that adversarial attacks are effective against Grover . In light of this, despite Grover‚Äôs association with detection of computer-generated text due to targeting a perceived high-risk niche (i.e., ‚Äúfake news‚Äù), it is unreasonable and unfounded to expect Grover to perform well as a general-purpose detector for computer-generated text in any other number of myriad domains. Neural approaches for broad detection of computer-generated text should then focus on the broader landscape of neural language models, including the Transformer models currently composing state-of-the-art.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: 1.5B parameter variant) . Grover has also been found to underperform compared to other fine-tuned Transformers when classifying computer-generated text generated by other models than Grover itself [ref]24.\nThis should be unsurprising ‚Äì it would be unreasonable to expect that the discriminator of a GPT-2 model trained on a specific news dataset (i.e., Grover‚Äôs detector) would outperform a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
