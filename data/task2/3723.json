First, we show that f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-GCAI and -GCDI are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the target size |A+|+|A−|superscript𝐴superscript𝐴|A^{+}|+|A^{-}|. To do this, we give ILP formulations for these problems very similar to the ones constructed by [53, Theorem 9]. The number of variables in the ILP formulations will be bounded by a function of |A+|+|A−|superscript𝐴superscript𝐴|A^{+}|+|A^{-}|. This allows us to apply the algorithm by . f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-Group Control by Adding Individuals and f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-Group Control by Deleting Individuals are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to |A+|+|A−|superscript𝐴superscript𝐴|A^{+}|+|A^{-}|. We first consider the GCAI problem. Let (N,φ,A+,A−,T,ℓ)𝑁𝜑superscript𝐴superscript𝐴𝑇ℓ(N,\\varphi,A^{+},A^{-},T,\\ell) be an instance of f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-GCAI with |N|=n𝑁𝑛|N|=n, |A+|=qsuperscript𝐴𝑞|A^{+}|=q and |A−|=dsuperscript𝐴𝑑|A^{-}|=d. Let (a1,a2,…,an)subscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2…subscript𝑎𝑛(a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}) be an arbitrary but fixed order of N𝑁N.\nNow we fix a permutation λ𝜆\\lambda of the set A:=A+∪A−assign𝐴superscript𝐴superscript𝐴A:=A^{+}\\cup A^{-} such that A={aλ​(1),…,aλ​(q),aλ​(q+1),…,aλ​(q+d)}𝐴subscript𝑎𝜆1…subscript𝑎𝜆𝑞subscript𝑎𝜆𝑞1…subscript𝑎𝜆𝑞𝑑A=\\{a_{\\lambda(1)},\\ldots,a_{\\lambda(q)},a_{\\lambda(q+1)},\\ldots,a_{\\lambda(q+d)}\\} where 1≤λ​(i)<λ​(j)≤n1𝜆𝑖𝜆𝑗𝑛1\\leq\\lambda(i)<\\lambda(j)\\leq n for every 1≤i<j≤q1𝑖𝑗𝑞1\\leq i<j\\leq q and for every q+1≤i<j≤q+d𝑞1𝑖𝑗𝑞𝑑q+1\\leq i<j\\leq q+d. Also, we require that A+={aλ​(1),…,aλ​(q)}superscript𝐴subscript𝑎𝜆1…subscript𝑎𝜆𝑞A^{+}=\\{a_{\\lambda(1)},\\ldots,a_{\\lambda(q)}\\} and A−={aλ​(q+1),…,aλ​(q+d)}superscript𝐴subscript𝑎𝜆𝑞1…subscript𝑎𝜆𝑞𝑑A^{-}=\\{a_{\\lambda(q+1)},\\ldots,a_{\\lambda(q+d)}\\}. For every ai∈Nsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑁a_{i}\\in N, let φ​(ai,A)𝜑subscript𝑎𝑖𝐴\\varphi(a_{i},A) denote the vector ⟨φ​(ai,aλ​(1)),φ​(ai,aλ​(2)),…,φ​(ai,aλ​(q+d))⟩𝜑subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆1𝜑subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆2…𝜑subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑞𝑑\\big{\\langle}\\varphi(a_{i},a_{\\lambda(1)}),\\varphi(a_{i},a_{\\lambda(2)}),\\ldots,\\varphi(a_{i},a_{\\lambda(q+d)})\\big{\\rangle}. For every (q+d)𝑞𝑑(q+d)-dimensional {−1,1}11\\{-1,1\\}-vector β𝛽\\beta, let Nβ={ai∈N∖T:φ​(ai,A)=β}subscript𝑁𝛽conditional-setsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑁𝑇𝜑subscript𝑎𝑖𝐴𝛽N_{\\beta}=\\{a_{i}\\in N\\setminus T:\\varphi(a_{i},A)=\\beta\\} be the set of all individuals we could add whose opinions over A+∪A−superscript𝐴superscript𝐴A^{+}\\cup A^{-} exactly match the vector β𝛽\\beta. Let nβ=|Nβ|subscript𝑛𝛽subscript𝑁𝛽n_{\\beta}=|N_{\\beta}| and let β​[i]𝛽delimited-[]𝑖\\beta[i] denote the i𝑖i-th component of a vector β𝛽\\beta. For the ILP formulation, let 𝔅𝔅\\mathfrak{B} denote the set of all (q+d)𝑞𝑑(q+d)-dimensional {−1,1}11\\{-1,1\\}-vectors. For every β∈𝔅𝛽𝔅\\beta\\in\\mathfrak{B}, we create a variable xβsubscript𝑥𝛽x_{\\beta} that indicates how many individuals from Nβsubscript𝑁𝛽N_{\\beta} we include in the solution U𝑈U. This makes for a total of 2(q+d)superscript2𝑞𝑑2^{(q+d)} variables. We now formulate the following restrictions: For every β∈𝔅𝛽𝔅\\beta\\in\\mathfrak{B}, we need to ensure that no less than zero and no more than nβsubscript𝑛𝛽n_{\\beta} individuals can be included in U𝑈U, thus Also, we must ensure that U𝑈U can consist of at most ℓℓ\\ell individuals, thus We need all individuals in A+superscript𝐴A^{+} to be socially qualified in the final profile: For every aλ​(i)∈A+subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖superscript𝐴a_{\\lambda(i)}\\in A^{+} where 1≤i≤q1𝑖𝑞1\\leq i\\leq q and φ​(aλ​(i),aλ​(i))=1𝜑subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖1\\varphi(a_{\\lambda(i)},a_{\\lambda(i)})=1 For every aλ​(i)∈A+subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖superscript𝐴a_{\\lambda(i)}\\in A^{+} where 1≤i≤q1𝑖𝑞1\\leq i\\leq q and φ​(aλ​(i),aλ​(i))=−1𝜑subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖1\\varphi(a_{\\lambda(i)},a_{\\lambda(i)})=-1 Also, we need all individuals in A−superscript𝐴A^{-} to be socially disqualified in the final profile: For every aλ​(i)∈A−subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖superscript𝐴a_{\\lambda(i)}\\in A^{-} where q+1≤i≤q+d𝑞1𝑖𝑞𝑑q+1\\leq i\\leq q+d and φ​(aλ​(i),aλ​(i))=1𝜑subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖1\\varphi(a_{\\lambda(i)},a_{\\lambda(i)})=1 For every aλ​(i)∈A−subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖superscript𝐴a_{\\lambda(i)}\\in A^{-} where q+1≤i≤q+d𝑞1𝑖𝑞𝑑q+1\\leq i\\leq q+d and φ​(aλ​(i),aλ​(i))=−1𝜑subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖1\\varphi(a_{\\lambda(i)},a_{\\lambda(i)})=-1 Recall that Tφ1​(a)subscriptsuperscript𝑇1𝜑𝑎T^{1}_{\\varphi}(a) [resp. Tφ−1​(a)subscriptsuperscript𝑇1𝜑𝑎T^{-1}_{\\varphi}(a)] denotes the set of individuals who qualify [resp. disqualify] the individual a𝑎a. The inequality [3.1] ensures that all a∈A+𝑎superscript𝐴a\\in A^{+} who qualify themselves are qualified by at least s𝑠s individuals, and the inequality [3.2] ensures that all a∈A+𝑎superscript𝐴a\\in A^{+} who disqualify themselves are disqualified by at most t−1𝑡1t-1 individuals in the final profile. Likewise, the inequality [4.1] ensures that all a∈A−𝑎superscript𝐴a\\in A^{-} who qualify themselves are qualified by at most s−1𝑠1s-1 individuals, and the inequality [4.2] ensures that all a∈A−𝑎superscript𝐴a\\in A^{-} who disqualify themselves are disqualified by at least t𝑡t individuals in the final profile. Now we consider the GCDI problem. Let (N,φ,A+,A−,ℓ)𝑁𝜑superscript𝐴superscript𝐴ℓ(N,\\varphi,A^{+},A^{-},\\ell) be an instance of f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-GCDI with |N|=n𝑁𝑛|N|=n, |A+|=qsuperscript𝐴𝑞|A^{+}|=q and |A−|=dsuperscript𝐴𝑑|A^{-}|=d. We give an ILP formulation similar to the one shown above for GCAI. This time, for every β∈𝔅𝛽𝔅\\beta\\in\\mathfrak{B}, we use N¯β={ai∈N∖A:φ​(ai,A)=β}subscript¯𝑁𝛽conditional-setsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑁𝐴𝜑subscript𝑎𝑖𝐴𝛽\\overline{N}_{\\beta}=\\{a_{i}\\in N\\setminus A:\\varphi(a_{i},A)=\\beta\\} to denote the set of all individuals we could delete whose opinions over A+∪A−superscript𝐴superscript𝐴A^{+}\\cup A^{-} exactly match the vector β𝛽\\beta. Let n¯β=|N¯β|subscript¯𝑛𝛽subscript¯𝑁𝛽\\overline{n}_{\\beta}=|\\overline{N}_{\\beta}|. For every β∈𝔅𝛽𝔅\\beta\\in\\mathfrak{B}, we create a variable yβsubscript𝑦𝛽y_{\\beta} that indicates how many individuals from N¯βsubscript¯𝑁𝛽\\overline{N}_{\\beta} we delete. Thus, we again have 2(q+d)superscript2𝑞𝑑2^{(q+d)} variables in total. We then formulate the following restrictions: For every β∈𝔅𝛽𝔅\\beta\\in\\mathfrak{B}, we need to ensure that no less than zero and no more than n¯βsubscript¯𝑛𝛽\\overline{n}_{\\beta} individuals can be deleted, thus Also, we can only delete at most ℓℓ\\ell individuals in total, thus We need all individuals in A+superscript𝐴A^{+} to be socially qualified in the final profile: For every aλ​(i)∈A+subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖superscript𝐴a_{\\lambda(i)}\\in A^{+} where 1≤i≤q1𝑖𝑞1\\leq i\\leq q and φ​(aλ​(i),aλ​(i))=1𝜑subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖1\\varphi(a_{\\lambda(i)},a_{\\lambda(i)})=1 For every aλ​(i)∈A+subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖superscript𝐴a_{\\lambda(i)}\\in A^{+} where 1≤i≤q1𝑖𝑞1\\leq i\\leq q and φ​(aλ​(i),aλ​(i))=−1𝜑subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖1\\varphi(a_{\\lambda(i)},a_{\\lambda(i)})=-1 Also, we need all individuals in A−superscript𝐴A^{-} to be socially disqualified in the final profile: For every aλ​(i)∈A−subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖superscript𝐴a_{\\lambda(i)}\\in A^{-} where q+1≤i≤q+d𝑞1𝑖𝑞𝑑q+1\\leq i\\leq q+d and φ​(aλ​(i),aλ​(i))=1𝜑subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖1\\varphi(a_{\\lambda(i)},a_{\\lambda(i)})=1 For every aλ​(i)∈A−subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖superscript𝐴a_{\\lambda(i)}\\in A^{-} where q+1≤i≤q+d𝑞1𝑖𝑞𝑑q+1\\leq i\\leq q+d and φ​(aλ​(i),aλ​(i))=−1𝜑subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖subscript𝑎𝜆𝑖1\\varphi(a_{\\lambda(i)},a_{\\lambda(i)})=-1 For both ILP formulations, the number of variables is bounded by a function of |A+|+|A−|superscript𝐴superscript𝐴|A^{+}|+|A^{-}|. Hence, we can conclude that f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-GCAI and f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-GCDI are FPT with respect to |A+|+|A−|superscript𝐴superscript𝐴|A^{+}|+|A^{-}|   . Analogous to the constructive case (see Proposition 1), for all problems with a budget parameter ℓℓ\\ell, there exist trivial XP-algorithms with respect to ℓℓ\\ell: The problems f𝑓f-Group Control by Adding Individuals, f𝑓f-Group Control by Deleting Individuals, f𝑓f-Group Bribery and f𝑓f-$Group Bribery can be solved in time 𝒪​(nℓ+2)𝒪superscript𝑛ℓ2\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\ell+2}). \nf𝑓f-Group Microbribery and f𝑓f-$Group Microbribery can be solved in time 𝒪​(n2​ℓ+2)𝒪superscript𝑛2ℓ2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2\\ell+2}). Below, we present the proofs for fLSRsuperscript𝑓LSRf^{\\text{LSR}}-$Group Bribery and fLSRsuperscript𝑓LSRf^{\\text{LSR}}-$Group Microbribery. The proofs for the other problems work similarly. (fLSRsuperscriptfLSRf^{\\text{LSR}}-$GB)  \nGiven an fLSRsuperscriptfLSRf^{\\text{LSR}}-$GB instance (N,φ,A+,A−,ρ,ℓ)NφsuperscriptAsuperscriptAρℓ(N,\\varphi,A^{+},A^{-},\\rho,\\ell) with n=|N|nNn=|N|, we guess the subset of individuals we must bribe to make everyone A+superscriptAA^{+} socially qualified and everyone in A−superscriptAA^{-} socially disqualified. To do that, we iterate over all subsets U⊆NUNU\\subseteq N of size |U|≤ℓUℓ|U|\\leq\\ell. For each subset U⊆N𝑈𝑁U\\subseteq N, we obtain an altered profile φ′superscript𝜑′\\varphi^{\\prime} by bribing the individuals in U𝑈U to qualify themselves and everyone in A+superscript𝐴A^{+} and to disqualify all other individuals. We then check if ρ​(U)≤ℓ𝜌𝑈ℓ\\rho(U)\\leq\\ell, A+⊆fLSR​(N,φ′)superscript𝐴superscript𝑓LSR𝑁superscript𝜑′A^{+}\\subseteq f^{\\text{LSR}}(N,\\varphi^{\\prime}), and A−∩fLSR​(N,φ′)=∅superscript𝐴superscript𝑓LSR𝑁superscript𝜑′A^{-}\\cap f^{\\text{LSR}}(N,\\varphi^{\\prime})=\\emptyset. If we find a subset U𝑈U that satisfies these conditions, the instance is a YES-instance. Otherwise, we know that bribing any group of up to ℓℓ\\ell individuals is not sufficient to achieve the strategic objective. Since ρ𝜌\\rho assigns a positive integer price to each individual, it follows that bribing any group of individuals with cost at most ℓℓ\\ell is not sufficient to achieve the strategic objective. Therefore, the instance must be a NO-instance. The checks for any subset U⊆N𝑈𝑁U\\subseteq N can be done in time 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}). As there are (n≤ℓ)∈𝒪​(nℓ)binomial𝑛absentℓ𝒪superscript𝑛ℓ\\binom{n}{\\leq\\ell}\\in\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\ell}) subsets to consider, we get a total running time of 𝒪​(nℓ+2)𝒪superscript𝑛ℓ2\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\ell+2}). (fLSRsuperscriptfLSRf^{\\text{LSR}}-$GMB)  \nGiven an fLSRsuperscriptfLSRf^{\\text{LSR}}-$GMB instance (N,φ,A+,A−,ρ,ℓ)NφsuperscriptAsuperscriptAρℓ(N,\\varphi,A^{+},A^{-},\\rho,\\ell) with n=|N|nNn=|N|, we guess the subset of pairs of individuals whose valuations we need to change. To do that, we iterate over all subsets M⊆N×NMNNM\\subseteq N\\times N of size |M|≤ℓMℓ|M|\\leq\\ell. For each subset M⊆N×N𝑀𝑁𝑁M\\subseteq N\\times N, we obtain an altered profile φ′superscript𝜑′\\varphi^{\\prime} by flipping the valuations for all pairs (a,b)∈M𝑎𝑏𝑀(a,b)\\in M, i.e. if φ​(a,b)=1𝜑𝑎𝑏1\\varphi(a,b)=1 then φ′​(a,b)=−1superscript𝜑′𝑎𝑏1\\varphi^{\\prime}(a,b)=-1, and if φ​(a,b)=−1𝜑𝑎𝑏1\\varphi(a,b)=-1 then φ′​(a,b)=1superscript𝜑′𝑎𝑏1\\varphi^{\\prime}(a,b)=1. We then check if ρ​(M)≤ℓ𝜌𝑀ℓ\\rho(M)\\leq\\ell, A+⊆fLSR​(N,φ′)superscript𝐴superscript𝑓LSR𝑁superscript𝜑′A^{+}\\subseteq f^{\\text{LSR}}(N,\\varphi^{\\prime}), and A−∩fLSR​(N,φ′)=∅superscript𝐴superscript𝑓LSR𝑁superscript𝜑′A^{-}\\cap f^{\\text{LSR}}(N,\\varphi^{\\prime})=\\emptyset. If we find a subset M𝑀M that satisfies these conditions, the instance is a YES-instance. Otherwise, we know that flipping the valuations for any set of up to ℓℓ\\ell pairs is not sufficient to achieve the strategic objective. Since ρ𝜌\\rho assigns a positive integer price to each pair, it follows that changing the valuations for any set of pairs with cost at most ℓℓ\\ell is not sufficient to achieve the strategic objective. Therefore, the instance must be a NO-instance. The checks for any subset M⊆N×N𝑀𝑁𝑁M\\subseteq N\\times N can be done in time 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}). As there are (n2≤ℓ)∈𝒪​(n2​ℓ)binomialsuperscript𝑛2absentℓ𝒪superscript𝑛2ℓ\\binom{n^{2}}{\\leq\\ell}\\in\\mathcal{O}(n^{2\\ell}) subsets to consider, we get a total running time of 𝒪​(n2​ℓ+2)𝒪superscript𝑛2ℓ2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2\\ell+2}). Finally, we look at combinations of the parameters ℓℓ\\ell, s𝑠s and t𝑡t. [10, Corollary 3] show that f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-GB is W[ref]1-hard with respect to ℓ+tℓ𝑡\\ell+t even if s=1𝑠1s=1 and also W[ref]1-hard with respect to ℓ+sℓ𝑠\\ell+s even if t=1𝑡1t=1. Naturally, these hardness results also extend to f(s,t)superscript𝑓𝑠𝑡f^{(s,t)}-$GB. When parameterized by just s𝑠s and/or t𝑡t, the problem remains para-NP-hard as [10, Observation 3] show that the problem is NP-hard even for s=1𝑠1s=1 and t=2𝑡2t=2 (and also for s=2𝑠2s=2 and t=1𝑡1t=1). Assuming P≠NPPNP\\text{P}\\neq\\text{NP} and FPT≠W[ref]1FPTW[ref]1\\text{FPT}\\neq\\text{W[ref]1}, this effectively rules out any further XP or FPT algorithms with these parameters (as we discussed in Section 5.3.2). Figure 3 provides an overview of the parameterized complexity of GB and $GB for the consent rules with different parameter combinations.
