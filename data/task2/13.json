For every vertically (resp. horizontally) consecutive pairs (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) and (i+1,j)𝑖1𝑗(i+1,j) (resp. (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) and (i,j+1)𝑖𝑗1(i,j+1)) we add a half-graph H​(i→i+1,j)𝐻→𝑖𝑖1𝑗H(i\\rightarrow i+1,j) (resp. H​(i,j→j+1)𝐻→𝑖𝑗𝑗1H(i,j\\rightarrow j+1)) with bipartition H​(i¯→i+1,j)∪H​(i→i+1¯,j)𝐻→¯𝑖𝑖1𝑗𝐻→𝑖¯𝑖1𝑗H(\\underline{i}\\rightarrow i+1,j)\\cup H(i\\rightarrow\\underline{i+1},j) (resp. H​(i,j¯→j+1)∪H​(i,j→j+1¯)𝐻→𝑖¯𝑗𝑗1𝐻→𝑖𝑗¯𝑗1H(i,\\underline{j}\\rightarrow j+1)\\cup H(i,j\\rightarrow\\underline{j+1})).\nBoth sets H​(i¯→i+1,j)𝐻→¯𝑖𝑖1𝑗H(\\underline{i}\\rightarrow i+1,j) and H​(i,j¯→j+1)𝐻→𝑖¯𝑗𝑗1H(i,\\underline{j}\\rightarrow j+1) are in one-to-one correspondence with the vertices of Ai,jsubscript𝐴𝑖𝑗A_{i,j}, while the set H​(i→i+1¯,j)𝐻→𝑖¯𝑖1𝑗H(i\\rightarrow\\underline{i+1},j) is in one-to-one correspondence with the vertices of Ai+1,jsubscript𝐴𝑖1𝑗A_{i+1,j}, and H​(i,j→j+1¯)𝐻→𝑖𝑗¯𝑗1H(i,j\\rightarrow\\underline{j+1}), with the vertices of Ai,j+1subscript𝐴𝑖𝑗1A_{i,j+1}.\nWe denote by hi¯→i+1,j​(x,y)subscriptℎ→¯𝑖𝑖1𝑗𝑥𝑦h_{\\underline{i}\\rightarrow i+1,j}(x,y) (resp. hi→i+1¯,j​(x′,y′)subscriptℎ→𝑖¯𝑖1𝑗superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′h_{i\\rightarrow\\underline{i+1},j}(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime})) the vertex corresponding to ai,j​(x,y)subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑦a_{i,j}(x,y) (resp. ai+1,j​(x′,y′)subscript𝑎𝑖1𝑗superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′a_{i+1,j}(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime})).\nSimilarly we denote by hi,j¯→j+1​(x,y)subscriptℎ→𝑖¯𝑗𝑗1𝑥𝑦h_{i,\\underline{j}\\rightarrow j+1}(x,y) (resp. hi,j→j+1¯​(x′,y′)subscriptℎ→𝑖𝑗¯𝑗1superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′h_{i,j\\rightarrow\\underline{j+1}}(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime})) the vertex corresponding to ai,j​(x,y)subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑦a_{i,j}(x,y) (resp. ai,j+1​(x′,y′)subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗1superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′a_{i,j+1}(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime})).\nEvery vertex in a half-graph H​(i→i+1,j)𝐻→𝑖𝑖1𝑗H(i\\rightarrow i+1,j) or H​(i,j→j+1)𝐻→𝑖𝑗𝑗1H(i,j\\rightarrow j+1) is made adjacent to its corresponding vertex in Ai,j∪Ai+1,j∪Ai,j+1subscript𝐴𝑖𝑗subscript𝐴𝑖1𝑗subscript𝐴𝑖𝑗1A_{i,j}\\cup A_{i+1,j}\\cup A_{i,j+1}.\nThus ai,j​(x,y)subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑦a_{i,j}(x,y) is linked to hi¯→i+1,j​(x,y)subscriptℎ→¯𝑖𝑖1𝑗𝑥𝑦h_{\\underline{i}\\rightarrow i+1,j}(x,y), hi−1→i¯,j​(x,y)subscriptℎ→𝑖1¯𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑦h_{i-1\\rightarrow\\underline{i},j}(x,y), hi,j¯→j+1​(x,y)subscriptℎ→𝑖¯𝑗𝑗1𝑥𝑦h_{i,\\underline{j}\\rightarrow j+1}(x,y), and hi,j−1→j¯​(x,y)subscriptℎ→𝑖𝑗1¯𝑗𝑥𝑦h_{i,j-1\\rightarrow\\underline{j}}(x,y).\nNote that underlined numbers are used to distinguish names, and to give information on its neighborhood.\nWe call vertical half-graph an H​(i→i+1,j)𝐻→𝑖𝑖1𝑗H(i\\rightarrow i+1,j), and horizontal half-graph an H​(i,j→j+1)𝐻→𝑖𝑗𝑗1H(i,j\\rightarrow j+1).\nWe now precise the order of the half-graphs.\nIn vertical half-graphs, we put an edge between hi¯→i+1,j​(x,y)subscriptℎ→¯𝑖𝑖1𝑗𝑥𝑦h_{\\underline{i}\\rightarrow i+1,j}(x,y) and hi→i+1¯,j​(x′,y′)subscriptℎ→𝑖¯𝑖1𝑗superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′h_{i\\rightarrow\\underline{i+1},j}(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}) whenever y<y′𝑦superscript𝑦′y<y^{\\prime}.\nIn horizontal half-graphs, we put an edge between hi,j¯→j+1​(x,y)subscriptℎ→𝑖¯𝑗𝑗1𝑥𝑦h_{i,\\underline{j}\\rightarrow j+1}(x,y) and hi,j→j+1¯​(x′,y′)subscriptℎ→𝑖𝑗¯𝑗1superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′h_{i,j\\rightarrow\\underline{j+1}}(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}) whenever x<x′𝑥superscript𝑥′x<x^{\\prime}. We then add a global clique C𝐶C of size q−k2𝑞superscript𝑘2q-k^{2}.\nWe attach k2superscript𝑘2k^{2} private neighbors to each vertex of C𝐶C.\nAmong the q−k2𝑞superscript𝑘2q-k^{2} vertices of C𝐶C, we arbitrarily distinguish 33 vertices: a set D={d1,…,d18}𝐷subscript𝑑1…subscript𝑑18D=\\{d_{1},\\ldots,d_{18}\\} of size 18, and three sets C′,C−,C+superscript𝐶′superscript𝐶superscript𝐶C^{\\prime},C^{-},C^{+} each of size 5.\nWe fully link dzsubscript𝑑𝑧d_{z} to every Bi,jsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑗B_{i,j} if z𝑧z takes one of the following values: 3​(j​ mod ​3−1)+i​ mod ​3,3𝑗 mod 31𝑖 mod 33(j\\text{ mod }3-1)+i\\text{ mod }3, succ​(3​(j​ mod ​3−1)+i​ mod ​3),succ3𝑗 mod 31𝑖 mod 3\\text{succ}(3(j\\text{ mod }3-1)+i\\text{ mod }3), 3​(i​ mod ​3−1)+j​ mod ​3+9,3𝑖 mod 31𝑗 mod 393(i\\text{ mod }3-1)+j\\text{ mod }3+9, succ​(3​(i​ mod ​3−1)+j​ mod ​3+9),succ3𝑖 mod 31𝑗 mod 39\\text{succ}(3(i\\text{ mod }3-1)+j\\text{ mod }3+9), where the modulos are always taken in {0,1,2}012\\{0,1,2\\}, and succ​(x):=x+1assignsucc𝑥𝑥1\\text{succ}(x):=x+1 if x𝑥x is not dividable by 333 and succ​(x):=x−2assignsucc𝑥𝑥2\\text{succ}(x):=x-2 otherwise (see Figure 5).\nNote that each Bi,jsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑗B_{i,j} is linked with dzsubscript𝑑𝑧d_{z} for two successive (indicated by the operator succ​(x)succ𝑥\\text{succ}(x)) integers z𝑧z in the range of   [ref]3,    or   \ndepending on the coordinate j𝑗j modulo 333. Likewise, each Bi,jsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑗B_{i,j} is linked with dzsubscript𝑑𝑧d_{z} for two successive integers z𝑧z in the range of 0 210120 2, 3 513153 5 or 7 817187 8\ndepending on the coordinate i𝑖i modulo 333. We observe that Bi,jsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑗B_{i,j} and Bi+1,jsubscript𝐵𝑖1𝑗B_{i+1,j} are linked to exactly one common dzsubscript𝑑𝑧d_{z} (z∈8𝑧delimited-[]18z\\in8), and we fully link the half-graph H​(i→i+1,j)𝐻→𝑖𝑖1𝑗H(i\\rightarrow i+1,j) to D∖{z}𝐷𝑧D\\setminus\\{z\\}.\nSimilarly we fully link the half-graph H​(i,j→j+1)𝐻→𝑖𝑗𝑗1H(i,j\\rightarrow j+1) to D∖{z}𝐷𝑧D\\setminus\\{z\\} where z𝑧z is the unique integer of 8delimited-[]188 such that dzsubscript𝑑𝑧d_{z} is fully linked to both Bi,jsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑗B_{i,j} and Bi,j+1subscript𝐵𝑖𝑗1B_{i,j+1}.\nWe fully link each Ai,jsubscript𝐴𝑖𝑗A_{i,j} to C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime}, each H​(i¯→i+1,j)𝐻→¯𝑖𝑖1𝑗H(\\underline{i}\\rightarrow i+1,j) and H​(i,j¯→j+1)𝐻→𝑖¯𝑗𝑗1H(i,\\underline{j}\\rightarrow j+1) to C−superscript𝐶C^{-}, and each H​(i→i+1¯,j)𝐻→𝑖¯𝑖1𝑗H(i\\rightarrow\\underline{i+1},j) and H​(i,j→j+1¯)𝐻→𝑖𝑗¯𝑗1H(i,j\\rightarrow\\underline{j+1}) to C+superscript𝐶C^{+}.\nThis is just to prevent that one uses a vertex of a Bi,jsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑗B_{i,j} or of a half-graph as a center.\nAs we will see, intended solutions have all their centers in C∪⋃i,j∈[k]Ai,j𝐶subscript𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑘subscript𝐴𝑖𝑗C\\cup\\bigcup_{i,j\\in[k]}A_{i,j}. This ends our polytime construction.\nWe denote by G𝐺G the obtained graph.\nWe ask for a b𝑏b-chromatic core achieving color q𝑞q.\nThis polytime construction is of polynomial size in the k𝑘k-by-k𝑘k Grid Tiling-instance, and q𝑞q is a computable function of k𝑘k.\nWe thus only need to show that the reduction is correct.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: (see Figure 5).\nNote that each Bi,jsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑗B_{i,j} is linked with dzsubscript𝑑𝑧d_{z} for two successive (indicated by the operator succ​(x)succ𝑥\\text{succ}(x)) integers z𝑧z in the range of   [ref]3,    or   \ndepending on the coordinate j𝑗j modulo 333.
