      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Learning and Self-Training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile the focus of UDA was initially on classification, interest in UDA for semantic segmentation has grown rapidly in the last few years. Since this work investigates UDA for semantic segmentation, the following literature review will mainly focus on this topic. In addition, we give a short review on self-ensembling and contrastive learning. Adversarial Learning:\nAT can be applied to align the distributions of two domains in pixel space, feature space, and output space. In pixel space, the main idea is to transfer the appearance of one domain to the style of other. Thus, it is assumed that the geometric structure in both domains is approximately the same and the difference is mainly in texture and color. A very common approach uses a CycleGan-based architecture  to transfer source images to the style of the target domain   6. Since the transformation does not change the content, the source labels can be reused to train the model on target-like images in a supervised manner. Similarly, [ref]7 uses adaptive instance normalization  in combination with a single Generative Adversarial Network  to augment source images into different target-like styles. Another option is to use adversarial training to minimize the discrepancy between feature distributions. In this case, the discriminator takes on the role of a domain classifier, which must decide whether the features belong to the source or target domain. For semantic segmentation, this approach was first proposed in  and is also used in  6 . In , this approach is extended by additionally giving each class its own domain classifier, which further matches the individual class distributions between domains.  0  use adversarial training to align the output spaces on pixel-level and patch level, respectively. Meanwhile, aligning the output distributions with adversarial training is also used in several publications as either a basic component or for warm-up   . Self-Training:\nIn ST, the target predictions are converted into pseudo-labels, which are then used to minimize the cross-entropy. Since the quality of the pseudo-labels is\ncrucial to this approach,  combines the predictions of three models and iteratively repeats the training of the models, followed by the recalculation of the pseudo-labels. Similarly,  improves their quality by averaging the predictions of two different outputs of the same network. Another commonly used strategy tries to convert only the correct target predictions into pseudo-labels. , for example, attempts to find them by combining the output of two discriminators with the confidence of a segmentation classifier.  does this by considering the pixel-wise uncertainty of the predictions, which is estimated during training.  converts predictions into pseudo-labels only if the target features are within a certain range of the nearest category-wise source feature mean.     use the softmax output as confidence measure and incorporate only predictions above a certain threshold into the training process. In doing so, they assume that a higher prediction probability is associated with higher accuracy. In order to make self-training less sensitive to incorrect pseudo-labels,  uses soft pseudo-labels and smoothed network predictions. Unlike the previously mentioned approaches, 0 and  do not explicitly create pseudo-labels but exploit entropy minimization and a maximum squares loss to conduct self-training. Again, both methods can further improve performance when only confident samples are considered. Self-Ensembling:\nAn ensemble considers the outputs of multiple independent models for the same input sample to arrive at a more reliable prediction. The basic idea is that different models make different errors, which can be compensated for in the majority. Ensembling can be employed in ST to create better pseudo-labels for the next training stages . In semi-supervised learning, a special variant called self-ensembling has shown remarkable results  5. In this case, there is usually only one trainable model that minimizes an additional consistency loss between two different predictions of the same sample. While one prediction remains the output of the trainable network, current methods differ mainly in the creation of the second prediction.  uses an exponential moving average (EMA) to combine predictions generated at different times during training. This is also known as temporal ensemble.  also proposes to generate the second prediction with the same model using a different dropout mask and augmentations. 5 extends this idea and proposes a Mean Teacher (MT) framework where there is a second (non-trainable) model whose weights are updated with an EMA over the actual trainable weights. While  extends the former idea to UDA for classification, [ref]7  7 apply the MT framework to UDA for semantic segmentation. Contrastive Learning:\nCL  is a framework that learns representations by contrasting positive pairs against negative pairs. It has recently dominated the field of self-supervised representation learning    . Contrastive learning encourages representations of positive pairs (typically different augmentations from an image, preserving semantic information) to be similar and negative pairs (different image instances) to be apart.\nIn the area of domain adaptation (DA) for classification  , CL has been applied to align the feature space of different domains. Positive pairs are generated by using samples of the same class, but different domains. Negative pairs are chosen so that they belong to different classes and potentially different domains. In , the contrastive loss is realized through minimizing a Frobenius norm.  modifies the maximum mean discrepancy 1 to correspond to a contrastive loss. Whereas existing ideas in DA compute the contrastive loss in the feature space, recent work   shows that using a separate projection space for the contrastive loss is very beneficial in the setting of self-supervised representation learning.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the style of the target domain   6. Since the transformation does not change the content, the source labels can be reused to train the model on target-like images in a supervised manner. Similarly, [ref]7 uses adaptive instance normalization  in combination with a single Generative Adversarial Network  to augment source images into different target-like styles.
