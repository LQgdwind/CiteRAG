      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse GPU Kernels for Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section evaluates the performance of our kernels relative to the recently proposed techniques of  and . The SpMM kernel provided by  only supports problems with batch sizes divisible by 32.  wrote SpMM and SDDMM kernels for batch size 32 and 128 and also require that the number of rows in the sparse matrix be divisible by 256. Given these constraints, we opt to benchmark these kernels on a dataset of problems from recurrent neural networks, where the problem configurations supported by the kernels from  and  are realistic for deep neural networks. We benchmark each kernel on RNN, gated recurrent unit (GRU) , and long short-term memory network (LSTM) [ref]41 problems with sparse weights. We generated sparse matrices with random uniform sparsity. We benchmarked problems with state sizes 1k, 2k, 4k, and 8k, sparsities 70%, 80%, and 90% and batch sizes 32 and 128. All benchmarks were performed on an Nvidia V100 in single-precision. We do not include the time require for the pre-processing step used by the Adaptive Sparse Tiling (ASpT) approach of  in our benchmarks. We benchmark the row-splitting kernel from , as all of our benchmarks are beyond the threshold of average row length that the authors use to select between their row-splitting and nonzero-splitting kernels. Benchmark results are presented in Figure 10. For SpMM, our approach significantly outperforms other methods. Our approach achieves geometric mean speedups of 1.56×\\times, 1.59×\\times, and 3.47×\\times over MergeSpmm, ASpT, and cuSPARSE respectively. For SDDMM, our approach significantly outperforms cuSPARSE and achieves performance on-par with ASpT. Our approach achieves geometric mean speedups of 2.69×\\times over cuSPARSE and 92% of the throughput of ASpT on average. While ASpT achieves good performance for SDDMM, it has a number of limitations. First, including the original CSR matrix, ASpT requires 3×\\times the memory to store the re-ordered matrix as well as meta-data needed for tiled execution.\nSecond, the author’s implementation uses different re-orderings of the sparse matrix for SpMM and SDDMM problems. For deep learning applications, this means that gradients calculated with respect to a sparse matrix will be in a different order than the sparse matrix used in the forward pass. In order to perform gradient updates or continue backpropagation, applications must pay the cost of re-ordering the sparse matrix on every training iteration.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: configurations supported by the kernels from  and  are realistic for deep neural networks.
