      "content": "Paper Title: Attention, please! A survey of Neural Attention Models in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first attention interfaces’ use in DL were limited to NLP and computer vision domains to solve isolated tasks. Currently, attentional interfaces are studied in multimodal learning. Sensory multimodality in neural networks is a historical problem widely discussed by the scientific community  . Multimodal data improves the robustness of perception through complementarity and redundancy. The human brain continually deals with multimodal data and integrates it into a coherent representation of the world. However, employing different sensors present a series of challenges computationally, such as incomplete or spurious data, different properties (i.e. dimensionality or range of values), and the need for data alignment association. The integration of multiple sensors depends on a reasoning structure over the data to build a common representation, which does not exist in classical neural networks. Attentional interfaces adapted for multimodal perception are an efficient alternative for reasoning about misaligned data from different sensory sources. The first widespread use of attention for multimodality occurs with the attentional interface between a convolutional neural network and an LSTM in image captioning . In this model, a CNN processes the image, extracting high-level features, whereas the LSTM consumes the features to produce descriptive words, one by one. The attention mechanism guides the LSTM to relevant image information for each word’s generation, equivalent to the human visual attention mechanism. The visualization of attention weights in multimodal tasks improved the understanding of how architecture works. This approach derived from countless other works with attentional interfaces that deal with video-text data  [ref]63 , image-text data  , monocular/RGB-D images  [ref]68 , RADAR [ref]68, remote sensing data    , audio-video [ref]74 , and diverse sensors   , as shown in Figure 3. Zhang et al.  used an adaptive attention mechanism to learn to emphasize different visual and textual sources for dialogue systems for fashion retail. An adaptive attention scheme\nautomatically decided the evidence source for tracking dialogue states\nbased on visual and textual context. Dual Attention Networks  presented attention mechanisms to capture the fine-grained interplay between images and textual information. The mechanism allows visual and textual attention to guide each other during collaborative inference. HATT [ref]63 presented a new attention-based hierarchical fusion to explore the complementary features of multimodal features progressively, fusing temporal, motion, audio, and semantic label features for video representation. The model consists of three attention layers. First, the low-level attention layer deals with temporal, motion, and audio features inside each modality and across modalities. Second, high-level attention selectively focuses on semantic label features. Finally, the sequential attention layer incorporates hidden information generated by encoded low-level attention and high-level attention. Hori et. al. [ref]74 extended simple attention multimodal fusion. Unlike the simple multimodal fusion method, the feature-level attention weights can change according to the decoder state and the context vectors, enabling the decoder network to pay attention to a different set of features or modalities when predicting each subsequent word in the description. Memory Fusion Network  presented the Delta-memory Attention module for multi-view sequential learning. First, an LSTM system, one for each of the modalities, encodes the modality-specific dynamics and interactions. Delta-memory attention discovers both cross-modality and temporal interactions in different memory dimensions of LSTMs. Finally, Multi-view Gated Memory (unifying memory) stores the cross-modality interactions over time. Huang et al.  investigated the problem of matching image-text by exploiting the bi-directional attention with fine-granularity correlations between visual regions and textual words. Bi-directional attention connects the word to regions and objects to words for learning mage-text matching. Li et. al.  introduced Long Short-Term Memory with Pointing (LSTM-P) inspired by humans pointing behavior , and Pointer Networks . The pointing mechanism encapsulates dynamic contextual information (current input word and LSTM cell output) to deal with the image captioning scenario’s novel objects. Liu et. al.  proposed a cross-modal attention-guided erasing approach for referring expressions. Previous attention models focus on only the most dominant features of both modalities and neglect textual-visual correspondences between images and referring expressions. To tackle this issue, cross-modal attention discards the most dominant information from either textual or visual domains to generate difficult training samples and drive the model to discover complementary textual-visual correspondences. Abolghasemi et al.  demonstrated an approach for augmenting a deep visuomotor policy trained through demonstrations with Task Focused Visual Attention (TFA). Attention receives as input a manipulation task specified in natural language text, an image with the environment, and returns as output the area with an object that the robot needs to manipulate. TFA allows the policy to be significantly more robust from the baseline policy, i.e., no visual attention. Pu et al.  adaptively select features from the multiple CNN layers for video captioning. Previous models often use the output from a specific layer of a CNN as video features. However, this attention model adaptively and sequentially focuses on different layers of CNN features.\n\nReference markers found: [63]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]63: weights in multimodal tasks improved the understanding of how architecture works.
