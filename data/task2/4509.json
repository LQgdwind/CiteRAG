      "content": "Paper Title: Proof-of-Learning is Currently More Broken Than You Think\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThreat Model: Previous attacks by Zhang et al.¬† assumed that the adversary has knowledge of (1) the training data, (2) the parameters used for creating the proof e.g., the checkpointing interval kùëòk, and (3) the verification threshold Œ¥ùõø\\delta). Regarding (2), the adversary is also assumed to have the capability to modify the checkpointing interval kùëòk, which is unrealistic: this value should be set by the verifier. Regarding (3), we note that this assumption violates the threat model initially stated in Jia et al.¬†[ref]2: indeed, there is no reason for the verifier to reveal the parameters used for verification to the provers and adversaries, yet alone let them set the values of these parameters. Overall, these three assumptions make for an unrealistic threat model, which at times violates the threat model initially stated by Jia et al.¬†[ref]2. Instead, we introduce in our work attacks that can be mounted within a simpler threat model. Customized Attacks: The attack by Zhang et al.¬† are tailored to the CIFAR10 dataset: they were found to perform significantly worse on CIFAR100 despite extensive hyperparameter tuning. Instead, we propose attacks that are independent of the training setup (such as the model architecture and dataset). Our adversaries only assume knowledge of the parameters of the model which they aim to spoof the proof for. Formal Analysis: While prior work by Zhang et al.¬† identified limitations of PoL empirically, in a threat model whose limitations we identified above, we are the first to systematically study the assumptions needed to prove PoL‚Äôs robustness. We accordingly taxonomize the vulnerabilities and corresponding attacks along the assumptions being exploited: (a) reproducibility, and (b) representativeness (refer Section¬†4). We further show that validating these assumptions reduces to solving fundamental open questions in deep learning theory. Out of the two types of vulnerabilities, Zhang et al.¬† only focused on empirically exploiting the vulnerability caused by the reproducibility assumption. Some computationally expensive components of their attacks are unnecessary for exploiting this. Furthermore, they did not account for the vulnerability caused by the representativeness assumption. Therefore, our analysis is also the first attempt to explore this previously unexamined aspect of PoL vulnerability. Attack Performance: Our attack is more effective because it exploits the aforementioned vulnerabilities we uncovered. To create an update whose magnitude is lesser than a certain threshold, Zhang et al.¬† ‚Äôs attack relies on expensive optimization procedures. Instead, our attack uses a small learning rate in the proof it produces to achieve the same effect in an inexpensive manner. Apart from being independent of the training setup, (a) we achieve more than 40x speedup in all scenarios since our attack does not require any form of training, and (b) the normalized reproduction error of our attack is consistently smaller on CIFAR10, and even outperforms Zhang et al.¬† ‚Äôs attack by more than 10x on CIFAR100. In addition, we also proposed a novel attack exploiting the assumption that the correctness of larger training updates (in terms of magnitude) may imply the correctness of the entire training. This attack is computationally efficient and exploits a newly discovered vulnerability not discussed by previous work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the checkpointing interval kùëòk, which is unrealistic: this value should be set by the verifier.
