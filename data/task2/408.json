      "content": "Paper Title: From Symmetric to Asymmetric Asynchronous Byzantine Consensus\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe recall the notion of randomized Byzantine consensus here and its implementation by Mostéfaoui et al. . In a consensus primitive, every correct process proposes a value v𝑣v by invoking propose​(v)propose𝑣\\textsl{propose}(v), which typically triggers the start of the protocol among processes; it obtains as output a decided value v𝑣v through a decide​(v)decide𝑣\\textsl{decide}(v) event. There are no assumptions made about the faulty processes. Observe that when working with randomized consensus, one has to formulate the termination property probabilistically. In round-based consensus algorithms, the termination property is formulated with respect to the round number r𝑟r that a process executes. It requires that the probability that a correct process decides after executing infinitely many rounds approaches 1. A protocol for asynchronous strong Byzantine consensus satisfies: Every correct process pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} decides with probability 111, in the sense\nthat A correct process only decides a value that has been proposed by some correct process. No correct process decides twice. No two correct processes decide differently. The probabilistic termination and integrity properties together imply that every correct process decides exactly once, while the agreement property ensures that the decided values are equal. Strong validity asks that if all correct processes propose the same value v𝑣v, then no correct process decides a value different from v𝑣v. Otherwise, a correct process may only decide a value that was proposed by some correct process . In a binary consensus protocol, as considered here, only 0 and 1 may be proposed. In this case, strong validity is equivalent to the more commonly used property of weak validity. The implementation of the randomized consensus algorithm Mostéfaoui et al.  delegates its probabilistic choices to a common coin abstraction  , a random source observable by all processes but unpredictable for an adversary. A common coin is invoked at every process by triggering a release-coin event. We say that a process releases a coin because its value is unpredictable before the first correct process invokes the coin. The value s∈ℬ𝑠ℬs\\in\\mathcal{B} of the coin with tag r𝑟r is output through an event output-coin. A protocol for common coin satisfies the following properties: Every correct process eventually outputs a coin value. Unless at least one correct process has released the coin, no process has any information about the coin output by a correct process. With probability 1 every correct process outputs the same coin value. The distribution of the coin is uniform over ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}. Common-coin primitives may be realized directly by distributed protocols or with the help of a trusted entity using secret sharing  or threshold cryptography [ref]4. In the remainder of this section, we recall the implementation of strong Byzantine consensus according to Mostéfaoui et al.  in the PODC-14 version, shown in Algorithm 1. A correct process proposes a binary value b𝑏b by invoking rbc-propose​(b)rbc-propose𝑏\\textsl{rbc-propose}(b); the consensus abstraction decides for b𝑏b through an rbc-decide​(b)rbc-decide𝑏\\textsl{rbc-decide}(b) event. The algorithm proceeds in rounds. In each round, an instance of bv-broadcast is invoked. A correct process pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} executes bv-broadcast and waits for a value b𝑏b to be bv-delivered, identified by a tag characterizing the current round. When such a bit b𝑏b is received, pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} adds b𝑏b to values and broadcasts b𝑏b through an aux message to all processes. Whenever a process receives an aux message containing b𝑏b from pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j}, it stores b𝑏b in a local set aux​[j]auxdelimited-[]𝑗\\textit{aux}[j]. Once pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} has received a set B⊆values𝐵valuesB\\subseteq\\textit{values} of values such that every b∈B𝑏𝐵b\\in B has been delivered in aux messages from at least n−f𝑛𝑓n-f processes, then pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} releases the coin for the round. Subsequently, the process waits for the coin protocol to output a binary value s𝑠s through output-coin​(s)output-coin𝑠\\textsl{output-coin}(s), tagged with the current round number. Process pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} then checks if there is a single value b𝑏b in B𝐵B. If so, and if b=s𝑏𝑠b=s, then it decides for value b𝑏b. The process then proceeds to the next round with proposal b𝑏b. If there is more than one value in B𝐵B, then pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} changes its proposal to s𝑠s. In any case, the process starts another round and invokes a new instance of bv-broadcast with its proposal. Note that the protocol appears to execute rounds forever.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: the coin is uniform over ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}.
