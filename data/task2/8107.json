      "content": "Paper Title: LibMOON: A Gradient-based MultiObjective OptimizatioN Library in PyTorch\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA number of multiobjective libraries exist before our work. The difference between LibMOON and previous libraries is that LibMOON is designed to support gradient-based MOO methods. Comparisons with previous is provided in Table 1. LibMTL . LibMTL is a Python-based library for multitask learning. The key difference between LibMOON and LibMTL is that LibMTL focuses on finding a single network to benefit all tasks, such as calculating a benign updating direction or optimizing a network architecture. In contrast, LibMOON addresses inherent trade-offs in machine learning problems, where improving one objective inevitably worsens others, and explores the distribution of Pareto solutions. jMetal [ref]28. jMetal is a comprehensive Java framework designed for multi-objective optimization, leveraging the power of metaheuristics. It offers a highly flexible and extensible platform, making it accessible for users across various domains. With its user-friendly interface and robust architecture, jMetal has become a popular choice for researchers and practitioners in diverse application areas. Pymoo .\nPymoo is a Python-based framework for multiobjective optimization problems with many local optima. Pymoo supports mainstream MOEA methods such as NSGA-II , NSGA-III  , MOEA/D , and SMS-EMOA [ref]34. Pymoo allows flexible algorithm customization with user-defined operators and includes tools for exploratory analysis and data visualization. It also offers multi-criteria decision-making strategies to help users select optimal solutions from the Pareto set. PlatEMO .\nPlatEMO is a MATLAB-based multiobjective optimization tool supporting over 160 evolutionary algorithms and a comprehensive set of test problems. It supports diverse problem types, including sparse, high-cost, large-scale, and multimodal. PlatEMO includes performance metrics for evaluating optimization efficacy and offers tools for visualization and interaction during the optimization process. Pagmo .\nPagmo, a C++ library, executes massively parallel multiobjective global optimization using efficient evolutionary algorithms and gradient-based techniques like simplex, SQP, and interior-point methods. It supports concurrent algorithm execution and inter-algorithm collaboration through asynchronous generalized island models, addressing a wide range of optimization challenges, including constrained, unconstrained, single-objective, multiobjective, continuous, integer, stochastic, and deterministic problems. EvoTorch [ref]35 and EvoX .\nEvoTorch accelerates evolutionary algorithms in PyTorch, while EvoX scales them to large, complex problems with GPU-accelerated parallel execution for single and multiobjective tasks, including synthetic and reinforcement learning. These libraries highlight a trend toward using GPU parallelization to manage larger problem scales and decision variables, which is also of the interest of this paper. This work focuses on creating a platform for efficient gradient-based multiobjective methods to solve large-scale machine learning problems in PyTorch.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: In contrast, LibMOON addresses inherent trade-offs in machine learning problems, where improving one objective inevitably worsens others, and explores the distribution of Pareto solutions. jMetal [ref]28. jMetal is a comprehensive Java framework designed for multi-objective optimization, leveraging the power of metaheuristics.
