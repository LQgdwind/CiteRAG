      "content": "Paper Title: PAC: Assisted Value Factorisation with Counterfactual Predictions in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCooperative multi-agent decision-making often suffers from exponential joint state and action spaces. Multiple approaches including independent Q-learning and mean-field games have been considered in the literature, while they do not perform well in challenging tasks or require homogeneous agents . A paradigm of centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) has been proposed for scalable decision-making . QPLEX  takes a duplex dueling network architecture to factorize the joint value function. Some of the key CTDE approaches include value function decomposition and multi-agent policy gradient methods. Policy Gradient methods are considered to have more stable convergence compared to value-based methods [ref]28  [ref]13 and can be extended to continuous action problems easily. A representative multi-agent policy gradient method is COMA , which utilizes a centralized critic module for estimating the counterfactual advantage of an individual agent. DOP  uses factorized policy gradients with architecture similar to Qatten. However, as pointed out in  , multi-agent policy-based methods like MADDPG are still outperformed by value-based methods StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) . Decomposed actor-critic methods, which combine value function decomposition and policy gradient methods with the use of decomposed critics rather than centralized critics, are introduced to guide policy gradients. VDAC  combined the structure of actor-critic and QMIX for the joint state-value function estimation, while DOP [ref]33 directly uses a network similar to Qatten  for policy gradients with off-policy tree backup and on-policy TD. The authors of [ref]33 pointed out that decomposed critics are limited by restricted expressive capability and thus cannot guarantee the convergence of global optima; even though the individual policies may converge to local optima [ref]13. Extensions of the monotonic mixing function have also been considered, e.g., QTRAN  and weighted QMIX . But solving tasks that require significant coordination remains a key challenge. Another related topic is representational learning in reinforcement learning. A VAE-based forward model is proposed in   to learn the state representations in the environment.  considers a model to learn Gaussian embedding representations of different tasks during meta-testing. The authors in  proposed a recurrent VAE model which encodes the observation and action history and learns a variational distribution of the task. NDQ  encodes the state information as communication messages between agents.  use an inference model to represent the decision-making of the opponents. RODE  uses an action encoder to learn the action representations in restricting the role action spaces for a reduced policy search space. MAR  learns the metarepresentation for generalization problems. Unlike previous work, our method focuses on learning information from counterfactual predictions that are explicitly assistive for local estimation and efficient factorization.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: CTDE approaches include value function decomposition and multi-agent policy gradient methods.
