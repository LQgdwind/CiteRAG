      "content": "Paper Title: Spectral Adversarial Training for Robust Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile adversarial perturbations are initially used to construct adversarial examples and fool the neural networks, the same sword can be utilized by defenders to improve the robustness of their models against adversarial attacks . Adversarial training (AT) on graph data is inspired by research in computer vision, where the perturbations are constructed in continuous input domains. So far, a variety of works    employ virtual adversarial training on node features, to enforce the smoothness of the models’ output distributions against adversarial inputs. In particular, Deng et al.  propose batch virtual AT to smooth the outputs of GNNs, Feng et al.  devise a dynamic regularizer encouraging GNN models to learn representations that are robust to perturbations. In the ensuing work, Hu et al. [ref]32 design neighbor perturbations to restrict the perturbation directions on node features and prevent the propagation of perturbed neighbors. Jin et al.  apply AT on the latent representations of the nodes to improve the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs. The aforementioned works are typically feature-based AT. However, the structural information has not been fully exploited during training. The structure-based AT perturbs the graph by adding or dropping edges or nodes, which is also an effective way to defend against attacks. Dai et al. [ref]8 propose to randomly drop edges during each training step. Such a simple strategy has shown its effectiveness in improving the GNNs’ robustness. One step further, Xu et al. [ref]13 design an optimization-based AT, where adversarial edges are generated by a topology attack. The presented work has demonstrated the effectiveness of employing structural AT on graph data. To facilitate adversarial training via practical adversarial examples, a growing number of researchers  [ref]13 seek to employ attack-oriented perturbations, which are generated based on existing network adversarial attacks of PGD [ref]13 and Metattack . Although these works attempt to handle similar problems, i.e., improving the robustness of GNNs via practical adversarial training, they either require substantial costs to construct adversarial examples in the discrete graph domain (structure-based AT) or discard the graph topology that is crucial for GNNs (feature-based AT). In light of these challenges, our work attempts to employ AT on the graph spectrum. Specifically, it is able to approximate the structure perturbations in terms of the changes of the eigenpairs. Thus, the discrete optimization problem is transformed into a continuous one and the computational overhead is greatly alleviated.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: virtual AT to smooth the outputs of GNNs, Feng et al.  devise a dynamic regularizer encouraging GNN models to learn representations that are robust to perturbations.
