A preliminary abstract of this paper appeared in the proceedings of SWAT 2012 [14].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we prove that Induced Disjoint Paths is polynomial-time solvable on\na large class of graphs, namely\nthe class of asteroidal triple-free graphs (or AT-free graphs), even if kùëòk is part of the input. An asteroidal triple is a set of three mutually non-adjacent vertices, such that each two of them are joined by a path that avoids the neighbourhood of the third; AT-free graphs are exactly those graphs that contain no such triple¬†.\nThe class of AT-free graphs is easily recognized in polynomial time, widely studied (see e.g.¬† [ref]26   ), and contains many well-known classes, such as cobipartite graphs, cocomparability graphs, cographs, interval graphs, permutation graphs, and pùëùp-trapezoid graphs (cf.¬†).\nIn contrast to these subclasses, AT-free graphs miss the advantage of having a known geometric intersection model (which can be exploited for the design of polynomial-time algorithms).\nThe class of AT-free graphs is incomparable to chordal graphs, circular-arc graphs,\nand graphs of bounded mim-width,\nwhich were covered by previous work, as mentioned above. Hence, with our main result, we make significant progress on answering the research question. It is interesting to observe here that Induced Disjoint Paths seems to behave substantially different from Disjoint Paths. Generally, the induced variant of a containment relation problem is computationally just as hard or even harder than its non-induced variant.\nFor example, Matching can be solved in polynomial time, but Induced Matching is NPNP\\operatorname{NP}-hard\neven for bipartite graphs¬†.\nIn contrast,\nDisjoint Paths is NPNP\\operatorname{NP}-complete on split graphs¬†, but Induced Disjoint Paths is polynomial-time solvable on the strictly larger class of chordal graphs¬†. Similarly, Disjoint Paths is NPNP\\operatorname{NP}-complete on interval graphs¬†, but Induced Disjoint Paths is polynomial-time solvable on the strictly larger classes of circular-arc graphs¬†5 and chordal graphs¬†. With our main result, we now add the strictly and\nsubstantially\nlarger class of AT-free graphs to the list of classes for which Induced Disjoint Paths is polynomial-time solvable, but Disjoint Paths is not¬†, unless P==NPNP\\operatorname{NP}. In order to solve Induced Disjoint Paths in polynomial time on AT-free graphs, we first apply some general preprocessing rules (Section¬†3.1). We then provide a thorough exploration of the structure of AT-free graphs, in particular in relation to the Induced Disjoint Paths problem (Section¬†3.2). Finally, we use these structural results for a\ndynamic programming algorithm (Section¬†3.3). Here we heavily rely on the fact that AT-free graphs have a path that dominates the graph and that AT-free graphs cannot contain long induced cycles, so that we can always focus on the neighbourhood of a constant number of vertices in the graph. Our approach is substantially different from the approach of Belmonte¬†et al.¬† for solving this problem in polynomial time on chordal graphs, as it appears that the tree-decomposition-based approach of¬† does not work for AT-free graphs.\nOur proof techniques are also quite different from the irrelevant vertex technique used by\nKobayashi and Kawarabayashi¬† for planar graphs, which only work for fixed kùëòk\nin contrast to our result,\nand from the proof techniques for claw-free graphs¬†3 6.\nThe latter techniques are based on the characterization of claw-free graphs of Chudnovsky and Seymour¬† and also only work when kùëòk is\na fixed constant instead of being part of the input.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: the neighbourhood of the third; AT-free graphs are exactly those graphs that contain no such triple¬†.\nThe class of AT-free graphs is easily recognized in polynomial time, widely studied (see e.g.¬† [ref]26   ), and contains many well-known classes, such as cobipartite graphs, cocomparability graphs, cographs, interval graphs, permutation graphs, and pùëùp-trapezoid graphs (cf.¬†).\nIn contrast to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
