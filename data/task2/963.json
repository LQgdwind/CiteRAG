      "content": "Paper Title: Invertible Manifold Learning for Dimension Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConfigurations of datasets.  The NLDR performance and its inverse process are verified on both synthetic and real-world datasets. As shown in Tab. A1, we list the type of the dataset, the class number of clusters, the input dimension m𝑚m, the target dimension s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime}, the intrinsic dimension d𝑑d which is only an approximation for the real-world dataset, the number of train and test samples, and the logistic classification performance on the raw input space. Among them, Swiss roll serves as an ideal example of information-lossless NLDR; Spheres, whose target dimension s′superscript𝑠′s^{{}^{\\prime}} is lower than the intrinsic dimension s𝑠s, serves as an extreme case of NLDR compared to Half-spheres; four image datasets with increasing difficulties are used to analyze complex situations in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the lower bound and upper bound of the intrinsic dimension of real-world datasets are approximated by  and AE-based INN . Specifically, the upper bound can be found by the grid search of different bottlenecks of the INN, and we report the bottleneck size of each dataset when the reconstruction MSE loss is almost unchanged. Hyperparameter values.  Basically, i-ML-Enc is trained with Adam optimizer  and learning rate l​r=0.001𝑙𝑟0.001lr=0.001 for 800080008000 epochs. We set the layer number L=8𝐿8L=8 for most datasets but L=6𝐿6L=6 for COIL-20. The bound in push-away loss is set B=3𝐵3B=3 in most datasets but removed in Spheres and Half-spheres.\nWe set the hyperparameter based on two intuitions: (1) the implementation of sparse coordinate transformation should achieve DR on the premise of maintaining homeomorphism; (2) NLDR should be achieved gradually from the first to (L−1)𝐿1(L-1)-th layer because NLDR is impossible to achieve by a single nonlinear layer. Based on (1), we decrease the extra heads weights γ𝛾\\gamma linearly for epochs from 200020002000 to 800080008000, while linearly increase the orthogonal loss weights α𝛼\\alpha for epochs from 500500500 to 200020002000. Based on (2), we approximate the DR trend by exponential series. For the extra heads, the target dimension decrease exponentially from m𝑚m to s′superscript𝑠′s^{{}^{\\prime}} for the 222-th to (L−1)𝐿1(L-1)-th layer, and the push-away loss weights μ𝜇\\mu increase linearly. Similarly, the padding weight β𝛽\\beta should increase linearly. Because the intrinsic dimension is different from each real-world dataset, we adjust the prior hyperparameters according to the approximated intrinsic dimension. Results on toy datasets.  The Tab. A2 compares the i-ML-Enc with other methods in 9 performance metrics on Swiss roll and Half-spheres datasets in the case of s=s′=d𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑑s=s^{\\prime}=d. Eight methods for manifold learning: Isomap [ref]28, t-SNE , RR , and ML-Enc [ref]16 are compared for NLDR; four AE-based methods AE , VAE , GRAE , TopoAE , and ML-AE [ref]16 are compared for reconstructible manifold learning. We report the L𝐿L-th layer of i-ML-Enc (the first stage) for the NLDR quality and the (L−1)𝐿1(L-1)-th layer (the second stage) for the invertible NLDR ability. ML-Enc performs best in Trust, K𝐾Kmin, K𝐾Kmax, and l𝑙l-MSE on Swiss roll which shows its great embedding abilities. Based on ML-Enc, i-ML-Enc achieves great embedding results in the second stage on Half-spheres, which shows its advantages of preserving topological and geometric structures in the high-dimensional case. And i-ML-Enc outperforms other methods in its invertible NLDR property of the first stage. Results on real-world datasets.  The Tab. A3 compares the i-ML-Enc with other methods in 9 performance metrics on USPS, FMNIST and COIL-20 datasets in the case of s>s′𝑠superscript𝑠′s>s^{\\prime}. Six methods for manifold learning: Isomap, t-SNE, and ML-Enc are compared for NLDR; three AE-based methods AE, ML-AE, and TopoAE are compared for reconstructible manifold learning. Three methods for inverse models: INN , i-RevNet , and i-ResNet [ref]1 are compared for bijective property. The visualization of NLDR and its inverse process of i-ML-Enc are shown in Fig. A1, together with the NLDR results of Isomap, t-SNE and, ML-Enc. The target dimension for visualization is s′=2superscript𝑠′2s^{{}^{\\prime}}=2, and the high-dimensional latent space is visualized by PCA. Compared with NLDR algorithms, the representation of the L𝐿L-th layer of i-ML-Enc nearly achieves the best NLDR metrics on FMNIST, and ranks second place on USPS and third place on COIL-20. The drop of performance between the (L−1)𝐿1(L-1)-th and L𝐿L-th layers of i-ML-Enc are caused by the sub-optimal linear transformation layer, since the representation of its first stage is quite reliable. Compared with other inverse models, i-ML-Enc outperforms in all the NLDR metrics and inverse metrics in the first stage, which indicates that a great low-dimensional representation of data manifolds can be learned by a series of equidimensional layers. However, i-ML-Enc shows larger NME on FMNIST and COIL-20 compared with inverse models, which indicates that i-ML-Enc is more unstable dealing with complex datasets in the first stage. Besides, the reconstruction samples from six image datasets including COIL-100  show the inverse quality of i-ML-Enc in Fig. A2.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the i-ML-Enc with other methods in 9 performance metrics on Swiss roll and Half-spheres datasets in the case of s=s′=d𝑠superscript𝑠′𝑑s=s^{\\prime}=d.
