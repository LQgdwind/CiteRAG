      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamics-Adaptive Continual Reinforcement Learning via Progressive Contextualization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL)  is a major learning paradigm in machine learning for sequential decision making tasks. It aims to train a competent policy for an agent that properly maps states to actions to maximize the cumulative reward by interacting with an environment in a trial-and-error manner.\nTraditional RL algorithms, such as Q-learning and SARSA[ref]3, have been widely studied as tabular methods and successfully applied to Markov decision processes (MDPs) with finite discrete state-action spaces. The emergence of advanced function approximation techniques based on deep neural networks (DNNs) enables RL to have a higher level of understanding of the physical world [ref]4, and solve high-dimensional tasks ranging from playing video games [ref]5     0 to making real-time decisions on continuous robot control tasks\n1 2. The progresses of RL have been predominantly focused on learning a single task with the assumption of a stationary111A stationary environment is an environment whose dynamics normally represented by the reward and state transition functions of the MDP do not change over time. and fully-explorable environment for sampling observations.\nNevertheless, in the real-world, environments are often non-stationary and characterized by ever-changing dynamics such as shifts in the terrain or weather conditions, changes of the target position in robot navigation3, and different traffic inflow rates and demand patterns at different times of a day (e.g., peak and off-peak hours) in vehicular traffic signal control4.\nThese scenarios demand competent RL agents that can continually adapt to new environmental dynamics while retaining performance when the previous environment is encountered again.\nUnfortunately, the above requirements are difficult for existing RL methods to fulfill. On the one hand, storing all past experiences may result in a constant growth in memory consumption and computational power. On the other hand, if the size of the replay buffer is limited, the agent may inevitably suffer from the phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting5 6 7, incapable of retaining the knowledge and skills learned in previously encountered situations. Continual RL (CRL)8 9 0 1 has been investigated as an effective solution for adaptation to dynamic environments and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting.\nIn this setting, the dynamic environment can be considered as a stream of stationary tasks on a certain timescale where each task corresponds to the specific environmental dynamics during the associated time period. As shown in Fig. 1, the previously learned policy (e.g., œÄŒ∏t‚àí1‚àósubscriptùúãsuperscriptsubscriptùúÉùë°1‚àó\\pi_{\\theta_{t-1}^{\\ast}} over [M1,M2,‚Ä¶,Mt‚àí1]subscriptùëÄ1subscriptùëÄ2‚Ä¶subscriptùëÄùë°1[M_{1},M_{2},\\dots,M_{t-1}]) is used for the initialization of the new policy (e.g., œÄŒ∏tsubscriptùúãsubscriptùúÉùë°\\pi_{\\theta_{t}} on MtsubscriptùëÄùë°M_{t}), and it is subsequently updated to fit in the current task during the learning period in a continual fashion, retaining previously learned abilities.\nIn other words, CRL is capable of developing proper behaviors for new tasks while keeping the overall performance across all learned tasks. Such features of continual learning are highly desirable for intelligent systems in real-world applications where the environments are subject to consistent changes. Existing CRL methods assume a decomposition of the original problem into disjoint sub-domains of similar dynamics (also called ‚Äúcontext‚Äù) and their boundaries are known in advance. Consequently, previous studies mainly focus on how to construct effective mechanisms to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting among contexts, largely ignoring the challenge of automatic context inference during the learning process.\nFor the alleviation of catastrophic interference caused by data distribution drift in the single-task RL, Zhang et al.1 employ sequential K-Means clustering to achieve automatic context inference, given the number of contexts (kùëòk) in advance.\nThis method works well because it is feasible to acquire an approximate estimate of the state distribution with sufficient exploration and predetermine the value of kùëòk in a single task.\nHowever, significant challenges are expected in dynamic environments, where it is impractical to accurately determine the number of environmental contexts in advance as the changes of environmental dynamics are usually infinite and highly uncertain.\nAs a result, it is more rational for the agent to infer and instantiate environmental contexts in a fully online and incremental manner during the CRL process. In this article, we investigate CRL in dynamic environments to achieve continual context inference and necessary adaptation. The ultimate objective is to maximize the overall performance of the agent in the whole environment.\nTo this end, we propose a novel dynamics-adaptive continual reinforcement learning scheme (DaCoRL) with progressive contextualization, which incrementally clusters a stream of stationary tasks in dynamic environment into a series of contexts and opts for an expandable multihead neural network to learn a context-conditioned policy.\nThe progressive contextualization contains two core modules:\nThe first one is the incremental context detection procedure for automatically detecting the environmental changes and clustering a set of tasks with similar dynamics into a same context.\nThe second one is the joint optimization procedure to train the policy online for each unique context using an expandable multihead neural network and a knowledge distillation regularization term. To detect the changes of environmental dynamics over time, we introduce the online Bayesian infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM)2 to cluster environment features in a latent context space, where each cluster corresponds to a separate context. We employ the online Bayesian inference to update the model of contexts in a fully incremental manner, assuming that the prior distribution over the contexts is a Chinese restaurant process (CRP)3.\nWith this online incremental clustering technique, DaCoRL can incrementally instantiate new contexts according to the concentration parameter222It is a hyperparameter in CRP denoted by Œ±ùõº\\alpha in this article to control the likelihood of new contexts. of CRP as needed, without requiring any external information of environmental changes such as the predetermined number of contexts in 1.\nDuring the joint optimization procedure, we introduce an expandable multihead neural network whose output heads can be adaptively expanded according to the number of instantiated contexts. Compared with the fixed-structured networks, this approach can eliminate unnecessary redundancy of network structure and improve learning efficiency. The contributions of this article are summarized as follows. An incremental context detection strategy is introduced for CRL in dynamic environments. It formalizes context inference as an online Bayesian IGMM clustering procedure, enabling the agent to properly identify changes in environmental dynamics in an online manner without any prior knowledge of contexts. A dynamics-adaptive CRL training scheme called DaCoRL is proposed for dynamic environments in continuous spaces. By employing an expandable multihead neural network and a knowledge distillation regularization term, DaCoRL can effectively alleviate the catastrophic forgetting and ensure competitive capacity of RL agents for continual learning in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on a suite of continuous control tasks ranging from robot navigation to MuJoCo locomotion are conducted to validate the overall superiority of our method over baselines in terms of the stability, overall performance and generalization ability. In the rest part of this article, Section II reviews the related work and Section III introduces CRL problem statement and relevant concepts. In Section IV, the framework of DaCoRL is presented, with details on its mechanism and implementation. Experimental results and analyses on several robot navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks are presented in Section V, and this article is concluded in Section VI with some discussions and directions for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: an agent that properly maps states to actions to maximize the cumulative reward by interacting with an environment in a trial-and-error manner.\nTraditional RL algorithms, such as Q-learning and SARSA[ref]3, have been widely studied as tabular methods and successfully applied to Markov decision processes (MDPs) with finite discrete state-action spaces.
