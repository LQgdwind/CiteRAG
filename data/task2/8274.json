The most famous of this kind is the P vs NP question in complexity theory. This paper aims at further investigating the frontier between determinism and non-determinism in automata theory. Although Non-deterministic and Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA and DFA) are known to be equivalent in terms of expressive power, many subtle questions remain about the cost of determinism, and a deep understanding of non-determinism will be needed to solve them. One of the approaches investigating non-determinism in automata is the study of History-Deterministic (HD) automata, introduced in [HP06] under the name Good-For-Games (GFG) automata. An automaton is HD if, when reading input letters one by one, its non-determinism can be resolved on-the-fly without any need to guess the future. This constitutes a model that is intermediary between non-determinism and determinism, and can sometimes bring the best of both worlds. Like deterministic automata, HD automata on infinite words retain good properties such as their soundness with respect to composition with games, making them appropriate for use in Church synthesis algorithms [HP06]. On the other hand, like non-deterministic automata, they can be exponentially more succinct than deterministic ones [KS15].\nThere is a very active line of research trying to understand the various properties of HD automata, see e.g. [AK22, BKLS20, BL22, Cas23] for some of the recent developments.\nThe terminology history-deterministic, was introduced originally in the theory of regular cost functions [Col09]. The name ‚Äúhistory-deterministic‚Äù corresponds to the above intuition of solving non-determinism on-the-fly, while the earlier name of ‚Äúgood-for-games‚Äù refers to sound composition with games. These two notions may actually differ in some quantitative frameworks, but coincide on boolean automata [BL21], and have been used interchangeably in most of the literature on the topic. In this paper, since we are mainly interested in resolving the non-determinism on-the-fly, we choose the HD denomination to emphasize this aspect111This departs from earlier practices consisting in using HD and GFG in a way coherent with their contexts of introduction: HD for cost functions and GFG for boolean automata. Hence most of the papers cited here use GFG.. The goal of this paper is to pursue this line of research by introducing and studying the class of explorable automata on finite and infinite words.\nThe intuition behind explorability is to limit the amount of non-determinism required by the automaton to accept its language, in a more permissive way than HD automata. If k‚àà‚Ñïùëò‚Ñïk\\in\\mathbb{N}, an automaton is kùëòk-explorable if when reading input letters, it suffices to keep track of kùëòk runs to build an accepting one, if it exists. An automaton is explorable if it is kùëòk-explorable for some k‚àà‚Ñïùëò‚Ñïk\\in\\mathbb{N}.\nThis can be seen as a variation on the notion of HD automaton, which corresponds to the case k=1ùëò1k=1.\nThe present work can be compared to [KM19], where a notion related to kùëòk-explorability (called width) is introduced and studied, see Section 2.4. In particular, some results of [KM19] also apply to kùëòk-explorability, notably ExpTime-completeness of deciding kùëòk-explorability of an NFA if kùëòk is part of the input. Surprisingly however, the techniques used in [KM19] are quite different from the ones we need here. This shows that fixing a bound kùëòk for the number of runs leads to very different problems compared to asking for the existence of such a bound. One of the motivations to introduce the notion of explorability is to tackle one of the important open questions about HD automata: what is the complexity of deciding whether an automaton is HD? We explain in the following why explorability is relevant for this question, and show obstructions to some of our initial hopes in this direction. Recognizing HD automata is known to be in PTime for B√ºchi [BK18] and coB√ºchi [KS15] automata, but even for 333 parity ranks, the only known upper bound is ExpTime via the naive algorithm from [HP06].\nWe show how explorable automata can simplify this question: if the input automaton is explorable, then the problem becomes PTime for any fixed acceptance condition. Therefore, the question of recognizing HD automata can be shifted to: how hard is it to recognize explorable automata? We then proceed to study the decidability and complexity of the explorability problem: deciding whether an input automaton on finite or infinite words is explorable.\nFor this, we establish a connection with the population control problem studied in [BDG+19]. This problem asks, given an NFA with an arbitrary number of tokens in the initial state, whether a controller can choose input letters, thereby forcing every token to reach a designated state, even if tokens are controlled by an opponent.\nIt is shown in [BDG+19] that the population control problem is ExpTime-complete, and we adapt their proof to our setting to show that the explorability problem is ExpTime-complete as well, already for NFAs. We also show that a direct reduction is possible, but at an exponential cost, yielding only a 222-ExpTime algorithm for the NFA explorability problem. In the case of infinite words, we adapt the proof to the B√ºchi case, thereby showing that the B√ºchi explorability problem is in ExpTime as well.\nWe also remark that, as in [BDG+19], the number of tokens needed to witness explorability can go as high as doubly exponential in the size of the automaton. This ExpTime-completeness result means that we unfortunately cannot directly use the intermediate notion of explorable automata to improve on the complexity of recognizing HD automata in full generality, as could have been the hope. However, there can also be some frameworks where we can guarantee to obtain an explorable automaton, and therefore easily decide whether it is HD. A recent example of this from [BL22] is detailed in Section 2.5.2. More generally, we believe that this explorability notion is of interest towards a better understanding of non-determinism in automata theory. Notice that interestingly, from a model-checking perspective, our approach is dual to [BDG+19]: in the population control problem, an NFA is well-behaved when we can ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù it by forcing arbitrarily many runs to simultaneously reach a designated state, via an appropriate choice of input letters. On the contrary, in our approach, the input letters form an adversarial environment, and our NFA is well-behaved when its non-determinism is limited, in the sense that it is enough to spread finitely many runs to explore all possible behaviors. We also establish the expressivity of explorable automata, through reduction to or from deterministic parity automata. Surprisingly, the expressivity hierarchy of the explorable automata collapse, just as the hierarchy of non-determinist automata, albeit one step later. The general case is reached with parity- [ref]3 explorable automata, which can recognize all regular languages. On infinite words, we push further the notion of explorability, by remarking that for some automata, even following a countably infinite number of runs is not enough. This leads to defining the class of œâùúî\\omega-explorable automata, as those automata on infinite words where non-determinism can be resolved using countably many runs.\nWe show that œâùúî\\omega-explorable automata form a non-trivial class even for the safety acceptance condition (but not for reachability), and give an ExpTime algorithm recognizing œâùúî\\omega-explorable automata, encompassing the safety and coB√ºchi conditions. We also show ExpTime-hardness of this problem, by adapting the ExpTime-hardness proof of [BDG+19] to the setting of œâùúî\\omega-explorability. Summary of the contributions.\nWe show that given an explorable parity automaton of fixed parity index, it is in PTime to solve its HDness problem, i.e. decide whether it is HD. The idea was already used in [BK18], and in [BL22] for quantitative automata.\nThe algorithm used for B√ºchi HDness in [BK18] is conjectured to work for any acceptance condition (this is the ‚ÄúG2subscriptùê∫2G_{2} conjecture‚Äù), and it is in fact this algorithm that is shown here to work on any explorable parity automaton. We show that given an NFA or a parity automaton with parities ‚äÜ[ref]0 absent02\\subseteq[ref]0 , it is decidable and ExpTime-complete to check whether it is explorable. We also study the expressivity in terms of recognized languages of the different parity classes of explorable automata.\nOur proof of ExpTime-completeness for NFA explorability uses techniques developed in [BDG+19], where ExpTime-completeness is shown for the NFA population control problem. We generalize this result to ExpTime explorability checking for parity [ref]0  automata, requiring further adaptations. We also give a black box reduction using the result from [BDG+19]. This is enough to show decidability of the NFA explorability problem, but it yields a 222-ExpTime algorithm. As in [BDG+19], the ExpTime algorithm yields a doubly exponential tight upper bound on the number of tokens needed to witness explorability. We show that deciding the explorability of parity  [ref]3 automata amounts to deciding the explorability of automata in the general parity case. On infinite words, we show that any reachability automaton is œâùúî\\omega-explorable, but that this is not the case for safety automata.\nWe show that both the safety and coB√ºchi œâùúî\\omega-explorability problems are ExpTime-complete.\nWe also show that the B√ºchi‚ÄÑcase corresponds to the general case : any non-deterministic parity automaton can be converted in PTime to a B√ºchi‚ÄÑautomaton with same œâùúî\\omega-explorability status. Related Works.\nMany works aim at quantifying the amount of non-determinism in automata.\nA survey by Colcombet [Col12] gives useful references on this question.\nLet us mention for instance the notion of ambiguity, which quantifies the number of simultaneous accepting runs. Similarly to [KM19], we can note that ambiguity is orthogonal to kùëòk-explorability. Remark however that our finite/countable/uncountable explorability hierarchy is reminiscent of the finite/polynomial/exponential ambiguity hierarchy (see e.g. [WS91]). In [HKK+00], several ways of quantifying the non-determinism in automata are studied from the point of view of complexity, including notions such as the number of advice bits needed. Another approach is studied in [PSA17], where a measure of the maximum non-deterministic branching along a run is defined and compared to other existing measures. Following the HD approach, a hierarchy of non-determinism and an analysis of this hierarchy via probabilistic models is given in [AKL21]. The idea of kùëòk-explorability stems from the approach in [BK18], using games with tokens to tackle the HDness problem for B√ºchi automata. In this previous work, the idea of following a finite number of runs in parallel plays a central role in the proof. Remark however that the notion of explorability as studied here is stronger than what is needed in [BK18]. The kùëòk-explorability (and explorability) property was explicitly defined under the name kùëòk-History-Determinism in [BL22], as a proof tool to decide the HDness of LimInf and LimSup automata. The work [BL22] is part of a research effort to understand how partial determinism notions such as HDness play out in quantitative automata, see survey [Bok22].\nOur goal here is to investigate explorability as defining a natural class of automata on finite and infinite words, somehow giving it an ‚Äúofficial status‚Äù not restricted to an intermediate proof tool. History of this work.\nIt is traditional in our community to present results as a finished product, abstracting away the path that led to it. This paragraph is an experiment: we believe that in addition to this practice, it can be interesting for the reader to have access to a history of how ideas developed. The interest we took in the explorability notion originated in the fact that it makes deciding HDness much easier, and the hope was that by using this notion as an intermediate, we could obtain an algorithm improving on the ExpTime upper bound for deciding GFGness of parity automata of fixed index, e.g. to PSpace. As we described above, we ended up showing that this approach cannot yield an algorithm below ExpTime (at least not in full generality). However, although this was initially only a tool for this decision problem, explorability turns out to be a natural generalisation of HD automata, and an interesting class to study in itself. The first investigation of this notion, and in particular of its decidability, was the object of a short research internship by Milla Valnet under the supervision of the third author. It was expected that decidability of explorability would be a reachable goal for such a short internship, but it turned out that this was overly optimistic. The internship yielded preliminary results, and in particular was useful to introduce and study the notion of ‚Äúcoverability‚Äù. This version of the problem does not take acceptance conditions into account, but only asks that at any point of the run, every state that could be reached is actually occupied by a token. After the internship, we continued to use this coverability notion as a stepping stone towards an understanding of explorability. However, after more preliminary results and unsuccessful attempts at obtaining decidability, we discovered the connection between explorability and population control from [BDG+19], that rendered the intermediate notion of coverability useless for our purposes, and we then focused on exploiting that link. We chose to leave coverability out of the present exposition, as it feels like a ‚Äúwatered-down‚Äù version of explorability, but it could be useful in some contexts, hence we briefly mention it in this chronological account. Let us just informally state here that it is straightforward to modify our proofs in order to show that deciding whether an NFA is coverable is ExpTime-complete as well.\nThe first results were obtained during the PhD of Emile Hazard, and published in [HK23]. Some new results, namely ExpTime algorithm for coB√ºchi and [ref]0 02[ref]0 -explorability, and expressivity results, were obtained during the internship of Olivier Idir. This paper, extending [HK23], aims at gathering what we currently know about explorable automata.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Surprisingly, the expressivity hierarchy of the explorable automata collapse, just as the hierarchy of non-determinist automata, albeit one step later.
