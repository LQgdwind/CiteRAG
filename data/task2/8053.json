      "content": "Paper Title: Quasi-Monte Carlo Beyond Hardy-Krause\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe problem of numerical integration is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Without loss of generality, this is equivalent to integrating a function f𝑓f over the unit cube,111For arbitrary domains and densities, one can apply standard transformations and subsume them in the integrand f𝑓f.\nSee [DP10, Owe13] and the references therein for more details. i.e., computing f¯:=∫[ref]0 [ref]1df​(𝐱)​𝑑𝐱assign¯𝑓subscriptsuperscript01𝑑𝑓𝐱differential-d𝐱\\overline{f}:=\\int_{[ref]0 [ref]1^{d}}f(\\mathbf{x})d\\mathbf{x}.\nOften, an exact computation is impossible as f𝑓f might be too complicated or may only be accessible via evaluations.\nA classical approach for estimating f¯¯𝑓\\overline{f} is the Monte Carlo method (MC) – pick n𝑛n i.i.d. uniformly random samples 𝐱1,⋯,𝐱n∈[ref]0 [ref]1dsuperscript𝐱1⋯superscript𝐱𝑛superscript01𝑑\\mathbf{x}^{1},\\cdots,\\mathbf{x}^{n}\\in[ref]0 [ref]1^{d} and output the estimate f¯​(X):=∑jf​(𝐱j)/nassign¯𝑓𝑋subscript𝑗𝑓superscript𝐱𝑗𝑛\\overline{f}(X):=\\sum_{j}f(\\mathbf{x}^{j})/n.\nAs is well-known, the estimation error ϵ=|f¯​(X)−f¯|italic-ϵ¯𝑓𝑋¯𝑓\\epsilon=|\\overline{f}(X)-\\overline{f}| scales as where σ​(f)𝜎𝑓\\sigma(f) is the standard deviation of f𝑓f, i.e., we need n≈σ​(f)2/ϵ2𝑛𝜎superscript𝑓2superscriptitalic-ϵ2n\\approx\\sigma(f)^{2}/\\epsilon^{2} for accuracy ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon.\nAs Monte Carlo methods only require random samples, they are powerful, flexible and widely applicable, and have been considered to be among the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century [DS00]. In practice, obtaining samples or even evaluating f𝑓f is often expensive – e.g., a sample may be a random person from a population and f𝑓f the output of a medical treatment.\nFor this reason, techniques to improve the tradeoff in (1) between n𝑛n and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon\nhave been studied extensively.\nBroadly, one approach is to reduce σ​(f)𝜎𝑓\\sigma(f) using variance reduction techniques such as importance sampling, stratified sampling and antithetic variables [HH64, CPR04, Liu01]. These methods usually require some information about f𝑓f.\nSee the textbooks [Gla04, Fis06] for more details. Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods.\nAnother approach, and our focus here,\nare quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, that target the convergence rate with n𝑛n and improve it to O~d​(1/n)subscript~𝑂𝑑1𝑛\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1/n).222Throughout the paper, O~​(⋅)~𝑂⋅\\widetilde{O}(\\cdot) hides O​(𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(log⁡n))𝑂𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛O(\\mathsf{poly}(\\log n)) factors; and O~d​(⋅)subscript~𝑂𝑑⋅\\widetilde{O}_{d}(\\cdot) hides O​(𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(logO​(d)⁡n))𝑂𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒superscript𝑂𝑑𝑛O(\\mathsf{poly}(\\log^{O(d)}n)) factors. To achieve this, they abandon the flexibility of using random samples and instead output f¯​(X)=∑jf​(𝐱j)/n¯𝑓𝑋subscript𝑗𝑓superscript𝐱𝑗𝑛\\overline{f}(X)=\\sum_{j}f(\\mathbf{x}^{j})/n for a set of carefully-chosen deterministic points X={𝐱1,⋯,𝐱n}𝑋superscript𝐱1⋯superscript𝐱𝑛X=\\{\\mathbf{x}^{1},\\cdots,\\mathbf{x}^{n}\\}. These methods can give large speedups for moderate dimensions, typically d≤10𝑑10d\\leq 10 [SW92, DKPS13], and are used extensively in finance [Gla04, CV15], physics [BH10, DKPS13], graphics [Kel04, DBB06] and machine learning [GC15, BB12].\nWe describe these briefly next, but refer to the texts [Lem09, DKPS13, Owe13] for details, and to [Mat09] for a more theory-friendly introduction. The core idea underlying QMC methods is an exact characterization of the numerical integration error for any set X𝑋X and any function f𝑓f [Kok42, Hla61, Zar68]. For illustrative purposes, let us consider 1-d (see Lemma 2.1 for general d𝑑d). Here, the Hlawka-Zaremba formula333The formula (2) requires mild smoothness assumptions. states that the error is exactly where D(x):=nx−|[0,x]∩X]|D(x):=nx-|[0,x]\\cap X]| measures the “continuous discrepancy” between the size of the interval [0,x]0𝑥[0,x] and the number of points x1,⋯,xnsuperscript𝑥1⋯superscript𝑥𝑛x^{1},\\cdots,x^{n} contained in it. Koksma-Hlawka Inequalities.\nThis directly gives several classical Koksma-Hlawka inequalities, that bound the error by the continuous discrepancy of X𝑋X and certain measures of variations of f𝑓f.\nE.g., in 111-d, applying Cauchy-Schwartz to (2) gives the following ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-Koksma-Hlawka inequality:444The ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-Koksma-Hlawka inequality is also known as Zaremba’s inequality. Here, D2∗​(X):=(∫01D​(x)2​𝑑x)1/2assignsuperscriptsubscript𝐷2𝑋superscriptsuperscriptsubscript01𝐷superscript𝑥2differential-d𝑥12D_{2}^{*}(X):=(\\int_{0}^{1}D(x)^{2}dx)^{1/2} is the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-discrepancy for prefixes, and\nσ𝖧𝖪​(f):=(∫01|f′​(x)|2​𝑑x)1/2assignsubscript𝜎𝖧𝖪𝑓superscriptsuperscriptsubscript01superscriptsuperscript𝑓′𝑥2differential-d𝑥12\\sigma_{\\mathsf{HK}}(f):=(\\int_{0}^{1}|f^{\\prime}(x)|^{2}dx)^{1/2} is the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} variation of f𝑓f in the sense of Hardy and Krause (see Section 2.1 for general d𝑑d). Similarly, one has the ℓ∞/ℓ1subscriptℓsubscriptℓ1\\ell_{\\infty}/\\ell_{1} version of the Koksma-Hlawka inequality where D∗​(X):=maxx⁡|D​(x)|assignsuperscript𝐷𝑋subscript𝑥𝐷𝑥D^{*}(X):=\\max_{x}|D(x)| is the ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-continuous discrepancy (or star discrepancy) and V𝖧𝖪​(f):=∫01|f′​(x)|​𝑑xassignsubscript𝑉𝖧𝖪𝑓superscriptsubscript01superscript𝑓′𝑥differential-d𝑥V_{\\mathsf{HK}}(f):=\\int_{0}^{1}|f^{\\prime}(x)|dx is the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-Hardy-Krause variation.555We consider both these versions later, but the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-version is cleaner to work with as the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-Hardy-Krause variation admits an explicit formula in terms of the Fourier coefficients of f𝑓f, which allows for clean comparisons. These Koksma-Hlawka inequalities are sharp [Wika, Mat09, KN12, Owe13] in the sense that for any point set {x1,…,xn}subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\} there is a function f𝑓f for which they hold with equality. This suggests that the only room for getting better bounds might be by improving the discrepancy terms. Indeed, most of the works on QMC methods have been on designing low-discrepancy point sets X𝑋X,\nand starting from the seminal work of van der Corput [vdC35a, vdC35b], numerous ingenious constructions have been found.\nThese constructions are often very delicate and subtle,\nwith the best-known bounds being O~d​(1)subscript~𝑂𝑑1\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1) for all versions of continuous discrepancy.\nWe discuss these in some more detail in Appendix A, but refer the reader to the excellent textbooks [Nie92, DP10, Mat09, Owe13] for these constructions and the fascinating mathematics and history behind them. Limitations of QMC. Despite its tremendous success, however, “QMC is not a panacea …” [Wikb] and it also has drawbacks and limitations. The most outstanding ones include: The variation σ𝖧𝖪​(f)subscript𝜎𝖧𝖪𝑓\\sigma_{\\mathsf{HK}}(f) in (3) can be much larger than σ​(f)𝜎𝑓\\sigma(f) in (1), and hence QMC may perform much worse than MC in certain regimes.\nE.g., for f​(x)=sin⁡(k​x)𝑓𝑥𝑘𝑥f(x)=\\sin(kx), it is easily checked that σ​(f)=Θ​(1)𝜎𝑓Θ1\\sigma(f)=\\Theta(1) while σ𝖧𝖪​(f)=Θ​(k)subscript𝜎𝖧𝖪𝑓Θ𝑘\\sigma_{\\mathsf{HK}}(f)=\\Theta(k) (as f′=k​cos⁡k​xsuperscript𝑓′𝑘𝑘𝑥f^{\\prime}=k\\cos kx).\nHence QMC is outperformed by MC when k=Ω​(n)𝑘Ω𝑛k=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}). In many applications, one might only have access to random samples, and it may be impossible to pick the specific points required by explicit QMC constructions.666Recall the example where samples are people. Here, choosing the person corresponding to a specific point x𝑥x is infeasible, and typically one can only sample random subjects from a population. Consequently, this significantly limits the flexibility and applicability of QMC. Using the same deterministic point sets for different experiments might suffer from worst-case outcomes; more problematically, they don’t allow for error estimates statistically. There have been numerous attempts to address these limitations\nby considering\nRandomized QMC methods, detailed in [Lem09, Mat09, DP10, Owe13]. However, in contrast to the remarkable progress in constructing low-discrepancy QMC sets, the success here has been relatively limited. We discuss these works below in the context of our results and also in Appendix A.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: arbitrary domains and densities, one can apply standard transformations and subsume them in the integrand f𝑓f.\nSee [DP10, Owe13] and the references therein for more details. i.e., computing f¯:=∫[ref]0 [ref]1df​(𝐱)​𝑑𝐱assign¯𝑓subscriptsuperscript01𝑑𝑓𝐱differential-d𝐱\\overline{f}:=\\int_{[ref]0 [ref]1^{d}}f(\\mathbf{x})d\\mathbf{x}.\nOften, an exact computation is impossible as f𝑓f might be too\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
