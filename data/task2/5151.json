      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Joint Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Image Transmission\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDL techniques for JSCC and its various wireless communication applications have attracted a lot of attention in the past decade      [ref]7  .\nThe first work employing DNNs in wireless image transmission, called DeepJSCC, was proposed in . The authors used an autoencoder architecture to represent a wireless communication system that is composed of an encoder, a non-trainable channel and a decoder. The encoder/decoder pair is jointly trained such that the encoder learns a function that maps the source image directly to continuous channel inputs and the decoder learns to reconstruct the image from its noisy observations. They demonstrated in  that DeepJSCC outperforms classical separation schemes with compression  and channel coding 0, and it shows success in adapting to different source or channel types and avoiding the cliff effect. DeepJSCC has later been extended to different channel models  [ref]7 as well as to video transmission . However, previous JSCC approaches mostly focus on the rate-distortion trade-off in terms of classical pixel-wise distortion metrics, and often disregard human perception.\nIn [ref]7, the authors study JSCC combined with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to cope with multi-path fading. The authors adopt a GAN formulation to combine the MSE loss with the adversarial loss of a discriminator network, which distinguishes whether the image is original or generated by the decoder. The generator network of [ref]7 is jointly trained with the encoder by following the traditional adversarial training approach. However, GAN-generated image quality relies heavily on the range of the generator. The generator network of [ref]7 cannot achieve the perceptual image quality of the SotA StyleGAN generator, which follows the methodology of progressive growing GANs 1, and hence produces remarkably high-quality images. Moreover, it has been shown that the traditional distortion metrics, e.g., MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, also used in [ref]7, are not as successful in representing human judgments compared to the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) metric 2. Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently shown immense perceptual quality, which refers to being perceived by humans as a valid (natural) sample . Therefore, another line of DNN-based JSCC work has utilized well-known DGMs, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), GANs, and etc., in wireless image transmission [ref]10 3 4 5. The idea behind these JSCC approaches comes from the similarity between the wireless communication systems and inverse problems, in which an unknown signal, image or a multi-dimensional volume is reconstructed from its observations 6. In this analogy, the observations are obtained from a forward process, e.g., an encoder and a noisy channel, which are then inverted by a decoder in a supervised manner to reconstruct the original signal. Hence, a wireless communication system is optimized to learn an identity function such that the reconstructed message matches the source message. This supervised inverse problem approach is similar to denoising autoencoders 7, which was incorporated into the wireless communication setting in [ref]10. The authors propose a VAE-based JSCC scheme for a binary symmetric channel and a binary erasure channel system, later extended to wiretap channel scenario by 5. Despite their exceptional generative capability, GANs have only been considered in a JSCC scheme in the context of secure image transmission 4, where generative adversarial training is used for image reconstruction at the receiver. Despite utilizing DGMs, these approaches still do not incorporate the SotA DGM structures into the wireless communication problem in order to reconstruct high perceptual quality images. Unsupervised inverse problems, on the other hand, do not rely on a matched dataset of the input images and measurements, since the input images are not available at test time 6. Instead, they estimate the best potential input image that goes through the known forward process and matches with the observed measurements. However, prior assumptions on the input image distribution, e.g., sparsity assumption in classical compressed sensing 8 are needed. Pre-trained DGM-based approaches have recently received great attention due to their immense capacity of input data representation 9 0 1. The first DGM-based inverse problem approach, called CSGM, was proposed in 9. The authors solved the classical compressed sensing problem, i.e., A​x+noise=y𝐴𝑥noise𝑦Ax+\\text{noise}=y, by assuming that the input image x𝑥x is in the range of a pre-trained DGM. Their results show that CSGM outperforms traditional compressed sensing solutions for denoising, inpainting, and compressed sensing, when the input image is in the range of a pre-trained VAE or GAN generator. Later, 0 improved CSGM by including a regularization term that limits the latent input of the generator network to a spherical ball. PULSE 0 also used a pre-trained StyleGAN-2 generator .\nAnother work that uses GAN priors for inverse problems is proposed in 1, namely intermediate layer optimization (ILO). As its name suggests, ILO solves the classical compressed sensing objective by optimizing the intermediate layers of a pre-trained StyleGAN-2 generator. The algorithm first applies CSGM to find the best initialization for the latent input of the GAN generator, then the objective is optimized by solving projected gradient descent for each intermediate layer recursively. ILO 1 significantly outperforms the previous approaches, hence it is the SotA inverse problem solution that uses GAN priors. To the best of our knowledge, unsupervised inverse problems, which show exceptional denoising performance, have not been studied in the context of wireless communication. For both supervised and unsupervised methods, there is a demand in the field to incorporate the generative capabilities of SotA DGMs into wireless image transmission problems.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: DL techniques for JSCC and its various wireless communication applications have attracted a lot of attention in the past decade      [ref]7  .\nThe first work employing DNNs in wireless image transmission, called DeepJSCC, was proposed in .
