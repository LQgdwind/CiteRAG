In the CV domain, we select the MNIST dataset, the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. In the NLP domain, we select the IMDB dataset. For different datasets, we apply different models. For the MNIST dataset, we use a simple two-layer CNN network as the feature extractor. For CIFAR-10, we add two max pooling layers after the CNN layers. For CIFAR-100, we use ResNet-18. We use a bidirectional LSTM neural network as the feature extractor for the IMDB dataset. For the classifier part, all datasets use two fully connected layers as the mapping layers fπf_{\\pi} and one fully connected layer as the classification layer fωf_{\\omega}. The size of vector passed to the classification layer for all models is 128. We use PyTorch to implement the FedDW framework and various comparison experiments. To ensure fairness in comparison, we use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and all other parameters are set to their PyTorch default values in all experiments. The hyperparameters of different frameworks are chosen to be as consistent with the original papers as possible. In the CV domain, the batch size is 128, while in NLP it is 512. All experimental results are averaged over five runs. It is also worth noting that FedDW requires removing the bias term parameters of the classification layer. This operation is only applied to FedDW, meaning that the classification layers of other frameworks remain as normal linear layers. We tune\nμ\\mu from {0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100}. To simulate heterogeneous data distribution, we use the popular Dirichlet distribution\nD​i​r​(β)Dir(\\beta) to form non-IID data distribution, where the parameter β\\beta controls the degree of data heterogeneity. The smaller the β\\beta, the greater the degree of heterogeneity.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: We conduct a comprehensive comparison between FedDW and 10 popular FL frameworks including FedAvg[ref]4, FedUV[ref]39, MOON[ref]20, FedBABU,FedProto, FedProx, FedRep, FedALA, Per-FedAvg, and FedPer.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
