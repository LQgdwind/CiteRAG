      "content": "Paper Title: MERGE - A Bimodal Dataset For Static Music Emotion Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRegarding data collection, researchers typically collect audio clips and song lyrics from music platforms, e.g., AllMusic111AllMusic is “a popular music database that provides professional reviews and metadata for albums, songs and artists” . URL: https://www.allmusic.com/, and lyrics web crawlers, e.g., lyrics.com, ChartLyrics222http://www.chartlyrics.com/, MaxiLyrics333http://www.lyricsmania.com/maxi_lyrics.html or MusixMatch444http://https://www.musixmatch.com/, respectively. Such platforms usually offer Application Programming Interfaces (API). The collected audio clips and song lyrics are then pre-processed, e.g., to uniformize audio samples in terms of sampling, frequency, bit depth, and number of channels, remove noise or bad quality clips, clean lyrics for grammatical or metadata and other descriptions inside the text (e.g., name of the artist, title, identification of the chorus), etc. One important constraint associated with data collection in MER is that the music files and song lyrics are usually subject to very restrictive copyright laws. This issue limits the public distribution of datasets to their annotations and extracted features. Although some authors assume that audio samples under 30 seconds can be shared as “fair use” without copyright obligation, the subject is complex555https://smallbusiness.chron.com/copyright-laws-30-seconds-music-61149.html and many datasets remain private. Due to this, numerous studies had to invest limited resources to build and use private datasets, making it harder to compare to their peers’ work. Other works, including our own, e.g.,  provide the URL from where to obtain the corresponding songs (song lyrics, in this example). After data collection, song annotation (the most challenging part) must be performed. To this end, different approaches have been employed in the literature , e.g., manual annotation or annotation based on social tagging, music platforms, or annotation games. In manual annotation, each song is annotated by several subjects (typically more than 10), and the most prevalent opinion is selected. Manual annotations require hiring subjects, which can be expensive in terms of financial cost and time. Moreover, the process is time-consuming, tedious, and, thus, error-prone . To minimize the impact of low-quality annotations, several strategies are employed, e.g., discarding outlier annotators and songs with low annotator agreement using statistical tools (e.g., average and standard deviation metrics)  and inter-coder agreement metrics such as the Krippendorph’s alpha . To reduce the impact of tiredness or lack of commitment related to manual annotation, another method to annotate emotions in songs is through collaborative games on the web, also termed Games With A Purpose (GWAP), e.g., MoodSwings . The idea of these games is to increase the commitment and motivation of annotators through the context of games. Another alternative to tackle the difficulties with manual annotation is to employ social tags obtained directly from music social networks such as Last.fm, e.g., [ref]4.\nCompared to manual annotation, this method makes collecting the ground truth data easier and faster. However, there are several problems with the obtained social tags: sparsity due to the cold-start problem and popularity bias, multiple spellings of tags, malicious tagging or ad-hoc labeling techniques . For example, when a subject uses the tag “hate” in Last.fm, this might either mean that the song is about “hate” or that the person hates the song. Compared to the previous approach, a potentially more robust alternative is to employ annotations provided by music platforms such as AllMusic . For example, through the AllMusic web service, we can obtain song clips (typically 25 to 30-second excerpts) and their respective emotion tags (AllMusic defines 289 distinct emotion tags). However, these tags are not part of any known supported taxonomy. In addition, the annotation process in AllMusic is unclear: all we know is that the employed tags were “created and assigned to music works by professional editors” .\nAlso, the audio clips provided by the platform often contain noise (e.g., claps or silence) or segments that do not match the assigned emotion labels. Hence, both the provided music excerpts and the associated emotion tags require post-processing and validation. To partly overcome the described limitations, in , we proposed a semi-automatic data collection and annotation strategy based on AllMusic annotations. The basic idea was to map the provided multi-label annotations of each to a single emotion quadrant (according to Russell’s model). In this article, we adapt our original approach, as described in Section III.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: through the context of games.
