      "content": "Paper Title: Scene Consistency Representation Learning for Video Scene Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the process of video creation, to make the story more compelling, the editor will use various editing techniques, such as montage, one shot to the end, etc. Quickly switching between stories and scenes makes the movie plot tighter, e.g. inserting outdoor battle scenes into indoor dialogue scenes, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), making the scene transition more intriguing and unpredictable, thus the task of Video Scene Segmentation turns out to be rather challenging.\nHence, it is essential to understand the high-level semantic information of each scene in the long-term video. There has been extensive studies dealing with video understanding tasks on datasets where the individual video clip is typically short, while requiring a lot of labor to segment uncurated videos into short videos by category. Although some studies focus on splitting the long video into smaller segments, e.g., the methods of Action Spotting [ref]2 [ref]3   aim to locate the positions of the beginning and ending of the action, however, they are the category-aware approaches. By contrast, Video Scene Segmentation is a category-agnostic task that only the scene boundary label is available, and itâ€™s very confusing to classify a scene fragment taxonomically. Since a long-term video is inherently structured in a specific way, a sequence of frames can be divided into shots or scenes in terms of the granularity of semantics  . More specifically, a shot contains only continuous frames taken by the camera without interruption, and a scene is composed of successive shots and describes the same short story. For detecting shot boundaries,   split a video into many separate shots using lower-level visual context. Based on this, many mainstream approaches of Video Scene Segmentation    [ref]1 determine scene boundaries by exploring semantic correlations among the adjacent shots. While computer vision tasks suffer from the high cost of manual annotation, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) based methods         are proposed to train a general feature extractor using unlabeled data.\nBy leveraging a small amount of annotated data for training, these SSL methods can achieve appealing feature representation to even rival some supervised learning methods.\nFor Video Scene Segmentation, [ref]1 proposes to narrow the feature representation distance of the most similar shot pair in a local region, it significantly surpasses the supervised learning method  by employing a mere MLP classifier.\nHowever, in current SSL methods on the task of Video Scene Segmentation, the strategy of positive sample selection, pretraining protocol, evaluation metric and downstream model are not well discussed or addressed. To achieve this goal, we propose a self-supervised learning\nscheme to learn better representations, as well as the evaluation metric for the task of Video Scene Segmentation. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: A representation learning scheme based on Scene Consistency is proposed to obtain better shot representations on the unlabeled long-term video. A simple yet effective temporal model with less inductive bias is proposed to assess the quality of the shot representation for the downstream Video Scene Segmentation task. A benchmark that is more fair and reasonable is introduced for both pretraining and evaluation.\nMore importantly, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under all the protocols, and can significantly improve the performance of existing supervised methods without bells and whistles.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: a lot of labor to segment uncurated videos into short videos by category.
