Leveraging high-capacity function approximators such as neural networks, Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging domains, from video games  to robotic control [ref]18. Actor-critic algorithms are among the most popular approaches in DRL, e.g. DDPG , TRPO [ref]18, TD3 [ref]6 and SAC . These methods are based on policy iteration, which alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement . Actor-critic methods jointly optimize the value function (critic) and the policy (actor) as it is often impractical to run either of these to convergence . In DRL, both the actor and critic use deep neural networks as the function approximator. However, DRL is known to assign unrealistically high values to state-action pairs represented by the Q-function. This is detrimental to the quality of the greedy control policy derived from Q . Mnih et al. [ref]14 proposed to use a target network to mitigate divergence. A target network is a copy of the current Q function that is held fixed to serve as a stable target within the TD error update. The parameters of the target network are either infrequently copied [ref]14 or obtained by Polyak averaging . A limitation of using a target network is that it can slow down learning due to delayed function updates. We propose an approach that reduces the need for a target network in DRL while still ensuring stable learning and good performance in high-dimensional domains. We add a self-regularization term to encourage small changes to the target value while minimizing the Temporal Difference (TD)-error . Evolution Strategies (ES) are a family of black-box optimization algorithms which are typically very stable, but scale poorly in high-dimensional search spaces, (e.g. neural networks) . Gradient-based DRL methods are often sample efficient, particularly in the off-policy setting when, unlike evolutionary search methods, they can continue to sample previous experiences to improve value estimation. But these approaches can also be unstable and highly sensitive to hyper-parameter tuning . We propose a novel policy improvement method which combines both approaches to get the best of both worlds. Specifically, after the actor network first outputs an initial action, we apply the Cross Entropy Method (CEM)    to search the neighborhood of the initial action to find a second action associated with a higher Q value. Then we leverage the second action in the policy improvement stage to speed up the learning process. To mitigate the overestimation issue in Q learning , Fujimoto et al. [ref]6 proposed Clipped Double Q-Learning in which the authors learn two Q-functions and use the smaller one to form the targets in the TD-Learning process. This method may suffer from under-estimation [ref]6. In practice, we also observe that the discrepancy between the two Q-functions can increase dramatically which hinders the learning process. We propose Max-min Double Q-Learning to address this discrepancy. Our main contribution in this work is a self-regularized TD-learning method to address divergence without requiring a target network that may slow down learning progress. In addition, we propose a self-guided policy improvement method which combines policy-gradients and zero-order optimization. This helps to speed up learning and is robust to local noise in the Q function approximation. Taken together, these components define GRAC, a novel self-guided and self-regularized actor critic algorithm. We evaluate GRAC on six continuous control domains from OpenAI gym , where we achieve or outperform state of the art result in every environment tested. We run our experiments across a large number of seeds with fair evaluation metrics , perform extensive ablation studies, and open source both our code and learning curves.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: function approximators such as neural networks, Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging domains, from video games  to robotic control [ref]18.
