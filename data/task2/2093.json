      "content": "Paper Title: Multiplierless MP-Kernel Machine For Energy-efficient Edge Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proposed design has been implemented on Artix-7 (xc7a25tcpg238-3), manufactured at 28 nm technology node, a low-powered, highly efficient FPGA. Artix-7 family devices have been extensively used in edge device applications like automotive sensor processing. This makes it ideal for us to showcase our design capability on this device. Our design is capable of running at a maximum frequency of 200 MHz. The design supports both inference and on-chip training. It consumes about 9874 LUTs, 9788 FFs, along with 35 BRAMs (36 Kb). The design does not utilize any complex arithmetic module such as multiplier. For processing a sample, the proposed MP-kernel machine consumes 8024 clock cycles for computing a (256√ó12561256\\times 1) kernel vector ùêä‚àísuperscriptùêä{\\bf K}^{-} (Stage 1). Stage 2 consumes 5256 and 5710 clock cycles during inference and learning, respectively. Stage 3, which is active during learning, consumes 524 clock cycles. In top level, the proposed design has two sections : section 1, executes stage 1 and section 2, executes stage 2 and stage 3. Two sections work in pipeline fashion. In real time applications, when pipe is full, it can generate one output after 8024 clock cycles. We compare our system with similar SVM systems in the literature. From Table II, it is clear that our system consumes the least amount of energy of 13.4 pJ compared to similar SVM systems with online training capability. Based on the type and number of operations used in each design and the energy consumed by each type of operator, using  as the reference, we arrive at the energy consumption of each system. Our system can process an input vector size of 32, which is higher than other systems, and at the same time consumes lower RAM bits with no DSP usage making it resource efficient. The amount of training cycles required by our system is lowest, i.e, around 2054K, providing lower latency and higher throughput. A traditional SVM inference algorithm is also implemented on the PYNQ board (xc7z020clg400-1), manufactured at 28 nm technology node, to compare resource utilization and power consumption with the proposed MP kernel machine algorithm. We used linear kernel for this implementation as non-linear kernel was complex for implementation. The hardware design for the traditional SVM algorithm consumed a higher number of resources, and due to this, we were unable to fit the design in the same FPGA part used for the kernel machine design. To obtain a fair comparison, we implemented our design on the same PYNQ board. The design parameters for both designs are the same to make a direct comparison and bring out the efficiency of our system. The maximum operating frequency of the traditional SVM design is limited to 62 MHz. The power and efficiency of our system, which includes training and inference, is compared to this traditional SVM implementation having only an inference engine in Table III. We see that our MP kernel machine consumes a fraction of the power and about half of the LUTs (including the training engine) in comparison to the traditional SVM. Due to the multiplierless design, we see no DSPs consumed compared to 192 DSPs in traditional SVM design. For edge devices, the requirement of a small footprint and low power is fulfilled by our system.

[t] We used datasets from different domains for classification to benchmark our system. We used the occupancy detection dataset from the UCI ML repository  , which detects whether a particular room is occupied or not based on different sensors like light, temperature, humidity, and C‚ÄãO2ùê∂subscriptùëÇ2CO_{2}. We also verified our system on the Activity Recognition dataset (AReM) . We used a one versus all approach on the AReM dataset for binary classification using this system. We chose two of the activities as positive cases, i.e., bending and lying activities, to verify the classification the capability of our system. Free Spoken Digits Dataset (FSDD) was used to showcase the capability of our system for speech applications . Here, we used this dataset for the speaker verification task. We identified a speaker named Jackson among 3 other speakers. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is used as a feature extractor for this classification. Since our hardware currently supports 256 input samples, we truncated the datasets to 256 inputs. We performed a k-fold cross-validation to generate 256 separate train and test samples per fold from the original dataset to arrive at the results. This was repeated to cover the entire size of the dataset and get the average accuracy results across separate runs.A MATLAB model of the proposed architecture is developed to determine the datapath precision. We can see from Fig.11, that the dataset‚Äôs accuracy remains more or less constant as we reduce the bit width precision up to 12-bit. Below 12-bit, accuracy starts degrading due to quantization error. Hence, we used 12-bit precision for implementing the datapath. The accuracy degradation between full precision MATLAB model and fixed point (12-bit) RTL versions were minimal, as shown in Table IV. We compared the results of traditional SVM from independent works using the same datasets with our MP-based system. Despite being an approximation, we can get the accuracy results of our system comparable to the traditional SVM systems with minimal degradation in accuracy in some cases. From these results, our system demonstrates its capability in classification tasks, and also, with minor changes to the hardware, it can adapt to any application.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: [t]\n\n\n\n\n Datasets\nFull Precision\n\n\n\nFixed Point\n\n(12-bit)\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional\n\nSVM*\n\n\n\n\nMP\n\nSVM\n\n\n\n\nMP\n\nSVM\n\n\n\n\n\nTrain\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n\n\nTrain\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n\n\nTrain\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy\n\nDetection\n\n98.6 [ref]46\n97.8 [ref]46\n98\n94\n97.9\n93.8\n\n\n\n\nFSDD\n\nJackson\n\n99 \n99 \n97.5\n96\n97\n96\n\n\n\n\nAReM\n\nBending\n\n96 \n96 \n96\n94.1\n96\n93.2\n\n\n\n\nAReM\n\nLying\n\n96 \n96 \n96\n94.7\n95.9\n94\n\n These values are reported in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
