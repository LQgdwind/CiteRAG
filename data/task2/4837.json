      "content": "Paper Title: Token-Label Alignment for Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent developments of vision transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized the computer vision field and set new state-of-the-arts in a variety of tasks, such as image classification [ref]16 [ref]40 [ref]29 , object detection  3  , and semantic segmentation   1 .\nThe successful structure of alternative spatial mixing and channel mixing in ViTs also motivates the arising of high-performance MLP-like deep architectures     and promotes the evolution of better CNNs   .\nIn addition to architecture designs, an improved training strategy can also greatly boost the performance of a trained deep model    . The training of modern deep architecture almost all adopts data mixing strategies for data augmentation      0, which have been proven to consistently improve the generalization performance.\nThey randomly mix two images as well as their labels with the same mixing ratio to produce mixed data.\nAs the most commonly used data mixing strategy, CutMix  performs a copy-and-paste operation on the spatial domain to produce spatially mixed images.\nWhile data mixing strategies have been widely studied for CNNs   , few works have explored their compatibilities with ViTs .\nWe find that self-attention in ViTs causes a fluctuation of the original spatial structure.\nUnlike the translation equivalence that ensures a global label consistency for CNNs, self-attention in ViTs undermines this global consistency and causes a misalignment between the token and label.\nThis misalignment induces a different mixing ratio in the output tokens.\nThe training targets computed by the original data mixing strategies can then be inaccurate, resulting in less effective training. To address this, we propose a token-label alignment (TL-Align) method for ViTs to obtain a more accurate target for training.\nWe present an overview of our method in Figure 1.\nWe first assign a label to each input token in the mixed image according to the source of the token.\nWe then trace the correspondence between the input tokens and the transformed tokens and align the labels accordingly.\nWe assume that only the spatial self-attention and residual connection operation alter the presence of input tokens since channel MLP and layer normalization process each token independently.\nWe reuse the computed attentions to linearly mix the labels of input tokens to obtain those of transformed tokens.\nThe token-label alignment is performed iteratively to obtain a label for each output token.\nFor class-token-based classification (e.g., ViT [ref]16 and DeiT [ref]40), we directly use the aligned label for the output class token as the training target.\nFor global-pooling-based classification (e.g., Swin [ref]29), we similarly average the labels of output tokens as the training target.\nThe proposed TL-Align is only used for training to improve performance and introduces no additional workload for inference.\nWe apply the proposed TL-Align to various ViT variants with CutMix including plain ViTs (DeiT [ref]40) and hierarchical ViTs (Swin [ref]29).\nWe observe a consistent performance boost across different models on ImageNet-1K .\nSpecifically, our TL-Align improves DeiT-S by 0.8% using the same training recipe.\nWe evaluate the ImageNet-pretrained models on various downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, objection detection, and transfer learning.\nExperimental results also verify the robustness and generalization ability of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: The recent developments of vision transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized the computer vision field and set new state-of-the-arts in a variety of tasks, such as image classification [ref]16 [ref]40 [ref]29 , object detection  3  , and semantic segmentation   1 .\nThe successful structure of alternative spatial mixing and channel mixing in ViTs also motivates the arising of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
