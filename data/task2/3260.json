      "content": "Paper Title: DIAL: Deep Interactive and Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUncertainty quantification, or confidence estimation, is a long-standing problem in machine learning and has many applications such as out-of-distribution (OoD) samples detection [ref]14, the decision to trust the model or to defer to a human expertise in fields like healthcare or the detection of new classes in class-incremental learning [ref]40. Notably, it can also be used in active learning to determine which samples should be sent to the oracle for annotation. Many methods to estimate the uncertainty in deep neural networks have been recently proposed, and they often fall into one of these four categories. The first category of methods uses the probabilities from the softmax output space of the neural networks. Indeed, [ref]41 propose a simple yet strong baseline using the maximum class probability as an uncertainty estimation and apply to outliers detection. However, it is now well-established that softmax probabilities are prone to different issues such as poor calibration  and not fit to differentiate in- from out-of-distribution samples [ref]41. To overcome these issues, [ref]14 propose ODIN to detect outliers with a tempered softmax and with adversarial inputs to better distinguish inliers from outliers. Similarly,  perturbs their inputs but instead uses the representation space before the softmax layer and the Mahanabolis distance to do the split. Due to its intuitive concept and ease of implementation, another popular class of methods estimate the confidence associated to a sample by measuring the disagreement of different models. This model ensembling can either be explicit and use different models  or implicit to be less computationally greedy with one stochastic model using dropout  (MC Dropout) or batch normalization . However, all these methods inherently require several forward propagation and are thus relatively slow, making them not engaging for interactive interpretation. Other recent approaches design an auxiliary model to learn the uncertainty of the downstream model. While   mostly focuses on OoD detection,  addresses failure prediction and proposes ConfidNet, a neural network to predict if the prediction from the downstream network is accurate or not. These methods do not require to retrain the downstream network and can thus be easily plugged into any pre-trained architecture. However, they are computationally heavy and require a new training phase for each new task and model. In remote sensing,  successfully applies the ConfidNet method for land cover segmentation. Finally, some works design a specific loss to learn the uncertainty directly during training. For instance,  trains a model to predict the loss associated to a prediction and  proposes a loss which regularizes the class probabilities to better estimate uncertainty. These methods are computationally efficient and model agnostic but require a full training from scratch and can’t be plugged in a pre-trained model. We compare different methods from these categories in the present work to optimally guide the agent toward relevant areas to annotate. We focus on the three first categories since an adapted loss is less tailored for our use-case as it would require training new models from scratch.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Uncertainty quantification, or confidence estimation, is a long-standing problem in machine learning and has many applications such as out-of-distribution (OoD) samples detection [ref]14, the decision to trust the model or to defer to a human expertise in fields like healthcare or the detection of new classes in class-incremental learning [ref]40.
