      "content": "Paper Title: Bridging the Gap between Object and Image-level Representations for Open-Vocabulary Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOpen-vocabulary detection (OVD) aims to generalize beyond the limited number of base classes labeled during the training phase. The goal is to detect novel classes defined by an unbounded (open) vocabulary at inference. Owing to the challenging nature of the OVD task, different forms of weak-supervision for novel categories are typically used, e.g., extra image-caption pairs to enlarge the vocabulary , image-level labels on classification datasets [ref]2 and pretrained open-vocabulary classification models like CLIP . The use of weak-supervision to enlarge the vocabulary is intuitive as the cost of annotating large-category detection datasets is monumental while the image-text/label pairs are readily available via large classification datasets  or internet sources  [ref]5. One of the major challenges with enlarging vocabulary via image-level supervision (ILS) or pretrained models learned using ILS is the inherent mis-match between region and image-level cues. For instance, pretrained CLIP embeddings used in the existing OVD models  [ref]2 do not perform well in locating object regions  since the CLIP model is trained with full scale images. Similarly, weak supervision on images using caption descriptions or image-level labels does not convey the precise object-centric information. For label grounding in images, the recent literature explores expensive pretraining with auxiliary objectives  or use heuristics such as, the max-score or max-size boxes [ref]2. In this paper, we set out to bridge the gap between object and image-centric representations within the OVD pipeline. To this end, we propose to utilize high-quality class-agnostic and class-specific object proposals via the pretrained multi-modal vision transformer (ViT) [ref]8.\nThe class-agnostic object proposals are then used to distill region-specific information in the CLIP visual embeddings, making them suitable for local objects. Furthermore, the class-specific proposal set allows us to visually ground a larger vocabulary, thereby aiding in generalization to novel categories. Next, the final and important question is how to make visual-language (VL) mapping amenable to local object-centric information. For this purpose, we introduce a region-conditioned weight transfer process which closely ties together image and region VL mapping. In a nut-shell, the proposed approach connects the image, region and language representations to generalize better to novel open-vocabulary objects. The major contributions of this work include: We propose region-based knowledge distillation to adapt image-centric CLIP embeddings for local regions, thereby improving alignment between region and language embeddings. We show that the resulting well-aligned representations aid in improving the overall performance of our text driven OVD pipeline. In order to visually ground weak image labels, our approach performs pseudo-labeling using the high-quality object proposals from pretrained multi-modal ViTs. This helps in enlarging the class vocabulary and therefore generalizes better to new object classes. The above contributions mainly target the visual domain. In order to preserve the benefits of object-centric alignment in the language domain, we also propose to explicitly condition the (pseudo-labeled) image-level VL mapping on the region-level VL mapping via a novel weight transfer function. In this manner, we are the first to simultaneously integrate object-centric visual and language alignment within a single architecture for OVD. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the improved OVD capability of the proposed approach. On COCO and LVIS benchmarks, our method achieves absolute gains of 8.2 and 5.0 AP on novel and rare classes over the current SOTA methods. Further generalizability is demonstrated by our cross-dataset evaluations performed on COCO, OpenImages and Objects365, leading to consistent improvements compared to existing methods.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the OVD task, different forms of weak-supervision for novel categories are typically used, e.g., extra image-caption pairs to enlarge the vocabulary , image-level labels on classification datasets [ref]2 and pretrained open-vocabulary classification models like CLIP .
