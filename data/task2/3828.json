      "content": "Paper Title: Enabling High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Databases with Hardware/Software Cooperation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use and heavily extend state-of-the-art transactional and analytical engines to\nimplement various single- and multiple-instance HTAP configurations.\nWe use DBx1000   as the starting point for\nour transactional engine, and we implement an in-house analytical engine\nsimilar to C-store .\nOur analytical engine supports key physical\noperators for relational analytical queries (select, filter, aggregate and join), and\nsupports both NSM and DSM layouts, and dictionary encoding   .\nFor consistency, we implement both snapshotting (similar to software\nsnapshotting , with snapshots taken\nonly when dirty data exists) and MVCC (adopted from DBx1000 ). Our baseline single-instance HTAP system\nstores the single data replica in main memory.\nEach transactional query randomly performs reads or writes on a few randomly-chosen tuples from a randomly-chosen\ntable. Each analytical query uses select and join on randomly-chosen tables and columns.\nOur baseline multiple-instance HTAP system models a similar system as our single-instance baseline,\nbut provides the transactional and analytical engines with separate replicas\n(using the NSM layout for transactions, and DSM with dictionary encoding for analytical queries).\nAcross all baselines, we have 4 transactional\nand 4 analytical worker threads. We simulate Polynesia using gem5 [ref]193,\nintegrated with DRAMSim2  to model\nan HMC-like 3D-stacked DRAM .\nTable 1 shows our system configuration.\nFor the analytical island,\neach vault of our 3D-stacked memory contains\nfour PIM cores and three fixed-function accelerators (update gathering and shipping unit,\nupdate application unit, copy unit).\nFor the PIM core, we model a core\nsimilar to the ARM Cortex-A7 , as in prior works [ref]44 . We model the in-order cores and specialized accelerators in gem5 using a methodology similar to    [ref]22. Similar to prior works   [ref]22, we implement a simple fine-grained coherence technique between PIM cores. Updates between islands are propagated using our update propagation mechanism and shared memory. The updates are stored in shared memory.  To allow coordination, ordering, and synchronization between different parts of islands, we need to provide coherence between CPU cores and PIM logic. We employ a simple fine-grained coherence technique (MESI ), which uses a local PIM-side directory  in the logic layer to maintain coherence between PIM cores and to enable low-overhead fine-grained coherence between PIM logic and the CPUs.  We open-source Polynesia and the complete source code of our evaluation . Experimental Setup Validation. We validate our experimental setup, including our workloads and gem5-based simulation, in two ways. First, to implement our HTAP system, we adopt prior transactional (DBx1000) and analytical (C-store) engines. Similarly, we tailor our consistency models based on prior works  . We validate the correctness of each model modification we make by comparing the outputs after modifications with the outputs before modifications. Second, to model the hardware components of our system, we use an already validated simulator (i.e., gem5). While we expect to see similar results when Polynesia is implemented on top of high-end HTAP systems, it is currently very challenging for us to confirm that in real hardware since Polynesia requires hardware modifications that are costly to realize or prototype using available tools and frameworks.555While PiDRAM  and MEG  are potential promising FPGA-based platforms to emulate the functional correctness of proposed PIM designs, they are not useful for our studies because (1) neither can model the performance and energy usage of PIM, (2) PiDRAM does not support the 3D-stacked memories used by Polynesia, and (3) the MEG framework is not available at the time of writing.\n\nReference markers found: [193]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]193: NSM layout for transactions, and DSM with dictionary encoding for analytical queries).\nAcross all baselines, we have 4 transactional\nand 4 analytical worker threads.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
