      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchically Composing Level Generators for the Creation of Complex Structures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProcedural content generation (PCG) is a research field focused on automatically generating game content, such as levels, maps and music . PCG has several benefits: it is often cheaper than manually designing content , and it allows for significantly more content to be generated than would otherwise be possible through human creation  .\nPCG has recently garnered more attention [ref]5, leading to impressive results in numerous games   [ref]8. However, much of the research done in the field of PCG focuses on simple, 2D tilemap games, such as Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, and maze games [ref]9 0 [ref]8 1 2. While these are useful testbeds, they are often very simple, and do not exhibit complex structures. This focus on simplicity makes it non-trivial to generalise these methods to more complex and modern games. Furthermore, few methods focus on, or excel at, generating large and complex levels, which is a necessary step for PCG to become more mainstream 3. This has led to recent research that applies PCG to more complex titles 4 5 6 7, particularly Minecraft. Minecraft is a 3D, discrete voxel-based game, making it amenable to grid-based PCG methods originally developed for 2D tilemaps. It is also more complex than these aforementioned games and thus provides a useful domain to bridge the gap between traditional and modern games. Despite progress in the field, there are still several shortcomings to current methods.\nSome rely on a developer manually designing level components 8, which can be costly  and difficult to transfer to new games 0. Other approaches generate levels that lack core functional requirements, such as being playable 4. Lastly, some methods generate relatively small and simple structures 6 7, limiting their applicability to complex games. Our work aims to address these limitations by proposing an approach that decomposes the problem of generating a complex and large-scale level into smaller, but manageable pieces. For instance, it is simple to generate an abstract, high-level layout of a town (by considering houses, roads and gardens as the individual building blocks) while ensuring all houses are reachable via roads. Similarly, it is relatively straightforward to learn to generate a single house, garden, or farm. Composed together, however, these simple generators can easily generate a fully-fledged, and functional, town. In our method, multiple generators are hierarchically composed to generate large and complex structures. This is inspired by hierarchical reinforcement learning 9, where a complex task is broken down into smaller components and an agent learns how to optimally perform each subcomponent. We break the construction of a high-level structure (e.g., a town) into simple subtasks (e.g., houses, gardens, etc.) and train independent agents to generate these individual components.\nFurthermore, instead of manually designing level elements, our method allows a designer to specify an objective function, i.e., what constitutes a “good” component. This approach has three main benefits: (1) due to the independence,  users can modify the creation of each component (at different levels of abstraction) in isolation; (2) the combinatorial explosion in the number of levels that can be generated 0; and (3) the ability to specify the desired structure by referencing subcomponents, allowing easier generation of complex levels compared to normal, non-hierarchical methods. We extend PCGNN [ref]9, a recent method which uses neuroevolution and novelty search to evolve diverse level generators, by hierarchically composing these independent generators to create large and complex structures in tile-based games. We demonstrate that using composition makes it significantly easier to generate complex structures compared to using a single, non-compositional generator, an effect which becomes more pronounced as we increase the complexity of the low-level structures. Furthermore, we can automatically generate large-scale towns and cities by specifying a few, simple objectives.111Code is available at https://github.com/Michael-Beukman/MCHAMR\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: than manually designing content , and it allows for significantly more content to be generated than would otherwise be possible through human creation  .\nPCG has recently garnered more attention [ref]5, leading to impressive results in numerous games   [ref]8.
