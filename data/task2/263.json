      "content": "Paper Title: Bodies at Rest: 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation from a Pressure Image using Synthetic Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans spend a large part of their lives resting. While resting, humans select poses that can be sustained with little physical exertion. Our primary insight is that human bodies at rest can be modeled sufficiently well to generate synthetic data for machine learning. The lack of physical exertion and absence of motion makes this class of human activities amenable to relatively simple biomechanical models similar to the ragdoll models used in video games [ref]39. We apply this insight to the problem of using a pressure image to estimate the 3D human pose and shape of a person resting in bed. This capability would be useful for a variety of healthcare applications such as bed sore management , tomographic patient imaging , sleep studies , patient monitoring [ref]11, and assistive robotics [ref]14. To this end, we present the PressurePose dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of 3D human body poses and shapes with pressure images (Fig. 1, left). We also present PressureNet, a deep learning model that estimates 3D human body pose and shape from a low-resolution pressure image (Fig. 1, right). Prior work on the problem of human pose estimation from pressure images  [ref]14    has primarily used real data that is challenging to collect. Our PressurePose dataset has an unprecedented diversity of body shapes, joint angles, and postures with more thorough and precise annotations than previous datasets (Table 1). While recent prior work has estimated 3D human pose from pressure images,  [ref]14, to the best of our knowledge PressureNet is the first system to also estimate 3D body shape. Our synthetic data generation method first generates diverse samples from an 85 dimensional human pose and shape space. After rejecting samples based on self-collisions and Cartesian constraints, our method uses each remaining sample to define the initial conditions for a series of two physics simulations. The first finds a body pose that is at rest on a simulated bed. Given this pose, the second physics simulation generates a synthetic pressure image. Our method uses SMPL  to generate human mesh models and a capsulized approximation of SMPL  to generate articulated rigid-body models. The first physics simulation drops a capsulized articulated rigid-body model with low-stiffness, damped joints on a soft-body model of a bed and pressure-sensing mat. Once the articulated body has settled into a statically stable configuration, our method converts the settled capsulized model into a particle-based soft body without articulation. This soft body model represents the shape of the body, which is important for pressure image synthesis. The second physics simulation drops this soft-body model from a small height onto the soft-body bed and sensor model. Once settled, the simulated sensor produces a pressure image, which is stored along with the settled body parameters. Our deep learning model, PressureNet, uses a series of two networks modules. Each consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on [ref]14, a kinematic embedding model from  that produces a SMPL mesh , and a pressure map reconstruction (PMR) network. The PMR network serves as a model of pressure image generation. It is a novel component that encourages consistency between the mesh model and the pressure image input. Without it, we found that our deep learning models would often make mistakes that neglected the role of contact between the body and the bed, such as placing the heel of a foot at a location some distance away from an isolated high pressure region. When given a mesh model of the human body, the PMR network outputs an approximate pressure image that the network can more directly compare to the pressure image input. These approximate pressure images are used in the loss function and as input to a second residual network trained after the first network to correct these types of errors and generally improve performance. In our evaluation, we used a commercially available pressure sensing mat (BodiTrak BT-3510 ) placed under the fitted sheet of an Invacare Homecare Bed . This sensing method has potential advantages to line-of-sight sensors due to occlusion of the body from bedding and other sources, such as medical equipment. However, the mat we used provides low-resolution pressure images (64×\\times27) with limited sensitivity and dynamic range that make the estimation problem more challenging. We only trained PressureNet using synthetic data, yet it performed well in our evaluation with real data from 20 people, including successfully estimating poses that have not previously been reported in the literature, such as supine poses with hands behind the head. To improve the performance of the model with real data, we used custom calibration objects and an optimization procedure to match the physics simulation to the real world prior to synthesizing the training data. We also created a noise model in order to apply noise to the synthetic pressure images when training PressureNet. Our contributions include the following: A physics-based method to generate simulated human bodies at rest and produce synthetic pressure images.
