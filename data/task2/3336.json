      "content": "Paper Title: Lifelong Dynamic Optimization for Self-Adaptive Systems: Fact or Fiction?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany software systems are highly-configurable, thereby making them flexible to different needs. When operating under dynamic and uncertain environment, those systems are capable of changing their own configuration at runtime with an aim to achieve the best of their performance objective, e.g., higher throughput or smaller latency [ref]1 [ref]2 — a typical type of self-adaptive systems (SASs) that we consider in this work. For example, Apache Storm, a stream processing framework, can change some adaptation options (e.g., num_counters and num_splitters) at runtime to react to the changing batch of the jobs with different types and workloads [ref]3 . In SAS, a crucial problem is planning    ,\ni.e., what is the next best adaptation plan to take under time-varying environments? From the literature, a promising research direction for tackling this challenges is relying on the paradigm of Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE), where a search algorithm is used to continuously find the optimal plan for SASs        . Indeed, search and optimization is at the fundamental part of the planning, and it is complementary to the other approaches, such as control theoretical    and learning-based      . Yet, apart from the exponentially growing search space and non-linear interaction between the options, what makes the planning particularly difficult is the presence of high sparsity in highly-configurable systems. That is, as shown by Nair et al. [ref]3 and Jamshidi et al. , the neighboring adaptation plans can also have drastically different performance given an environment, leading to a highly complex search landscape. For example, we see a rather rugged landscape from Figure 1 on the case of Storm under the WordCount environment, where there are many local optima — the sub-optimal adaptation plans for which all the neighboring plans have worse performance — that can easily trap the planner. As a result, the produced plans may be far away from the global optimum, especially considering that the planner needs to produce a plan efficiently with little overhead. As we will show in Section III-A, the landscape can differ following dynamic environmental changes, which further complicates the SAS planning. In this paper, we tackle the above challenge by proposing LiDOS, a framework that implements the concept of lifelong and truly dynamic optimization for SAS planning. By designing a mechanism that takes the characteristics of SAS planning into account, the “dynamic” we consider refers to the case that the changes are explicitly captured as the search in the planner proceeds, which is the exact definition of dynamic optimization coined by Nguyen et al. , hence the useful information for planning after the change can be preserved to better overcome local optima. As such, the search and optimization in LiDOS runs continuously, terminating only when the SAS is taken offline or all search space has been covered under an environment — the true lifelong optimization. In this way, we hope to make the lifelong dynamic optimization more factual for SASs. This differs from previous SBSE work for SAS planning where dynamic optimization is more “fictional”, such that the planner is pseudo-dynamic because, although it runs continuously, the true “dynamic” is not explicitly considered in the search, but a vanilla search algorithm is directly adopted and hoping that the changes will eventually be coped with via the re-evaluated fitness    ; it can also be distinguished from the stationary planners, in which the planning is restarted from scratch upon an environmental change or based on a fixed frequency   . Both the pseudo-dynamic and stationary planners are not ideal given the rugged landscape and the need of timely planning for SAS. The key novelty of this work is that we formulate the lifelong dynamic optimization for SAS as a multi-modal optimization problem. This was inspired by our observation that, for highly-configurable systems, the global optimum of performance in an environment is likely to be (or very close to) a local optimum in the other. Our aim is to continuously preserve as many local optima as possible without losing the tendency towards achieving the global optimum, hence the planning can better deal with the complex landscape even under environmental changes. The core of LiDOS for tackling the multi-modal optimization problem is a refined MMO — the meta multi-objectivization model proposed by Chen and Li at FSE’21 , because (1) it is simple; (2) it fits the needs of a multi-modal optimization problem; and (3) it has been shown to be promising in mitigating local optima traps for highly-configurable systems. In a nutshell, our contributions are: We formulate the lifelong dynamic optimization for SAS planning as a multi-modal optimization problem motivated by characteristics of the highly-configurable systems. To solve the multi-modal optimization problem, we refine the MMO with a new auxiliary objective that can be easily measured, and no normalization is required, thereby eliminating the need of tuning the weight, which has been shown as a highly sensitive parameter in MMO . We design an architecture that uses a hierarchical feedback loop to realize the concept of lifelong dynamic optimization for SASs, where the search in planning runs continuously and the dynamic changes that occur during the run are explicitly handled. Through experiments on three real-world SASs of different performance objectives, scales, complexity, and under six environments, we evaluate LiDOS against its stationary variant (for ablation analysis), as well as state-of-the-art pseudo-dynamic   and stationary planners . The results are encouraging: we observe that when comparing with its stationary variant, LiDOS produces considerably better adaptation plans in general (with p<0.05𝑝0.05p<0.05 and high effect size) and up to 10×10\\times improvement. LiDOS also performs significantly better overall than the state-of-the-art planners with greater efficiency: it shows 1.4×1.4\\times to 5×5\\times speedup of planning over the pseudo-dynamic planners and 2.5×2.5\\times to 10×10\\times speedup on the stationary one. This proves that lifelong (truly) dynamic optimization for SAS planning is more of a fact than fiction.
