      "content": "Paper Title: A Deep Learning Approach to Nonconvex Energy Minimization for Martensitic Phase Transitions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPhysics-informed deep learning methods         [ref]40 have recently achieved great success in solving PDE problems arising in different fields of STEM. This entails using deep neural networks to approximate the solution of PDEs, often in many dimensions, leading to a mesh-free numerical method in place of more established schemes, such as finite-element or finite-difference methods. In this approach  , the loss function to be minimized is the mean square of the PDE residual. This method is rigorously known to converge for linear elliptic and parabolic problems [ref]40, and is successful with a number of nonlinear PDEs  . It is not clear how it would perform in situations where there are weak solutions of the PDE that suffer from reduced smoothness. Examples are hyperbolic conservation laws, as in nonlinear elastodynamics, and solid-solid phase transitions described by nonconvex gradient energy functions in nonlinear elastostatics   . In the latter case, the associated Euler-Lagrange equations change type and lose ellipticity at some values of the solution gradient . In these situations, there are weak solutions with discontinuous gradient across interfaces which are unknown a priori but are part of the solution. Another type of interface problem involves heterogeneous media whose properties have a priori specified high-contrast or discontinuous features, such as PDEs whose coefficients are discontinuous across a fixed interface, where solutions suffer a loss of smoothness. A number of sophisticated finite element and finite difference methods for interface problems have been developed  0 7   6 8. These methods are quite accurate, but they often require special treatment of the interface and jump conditions across it in creating the finite element mesh and/or associated basis functions for elements that intersect it. Recently, deep learning was used to solve interface problems involving linear elliptic PDE systems with discontinuous coefficients and/or discontinuous forcing , motivated from biomechanics .\nThe problems studied in  are solved by energy minimization. The energy functional is strictly convex, and a weak solution of the PDE (Euler-Lagrange equation) is its unique minimizer. The interface is fixed at the location of the jump in the coefficients of the PDE. The Deep Ritz method  used in  approximates solutions by a deep neural network (DNN) and minimizes the energy as a function of the DNN parameters (weights and biases). The DNN method is mesh-free and does not require any special structure to capture the location of the interface inside the domain spontaneously and accurately. In phase transition problems, interfaces separating parts of the body in different phases (solid and liquid, or austenite and martensite) are free boundaries whose position or shape is not known a priori. Rather, they are part of the solution and can evolve in time-dependent problems. Phase boundaries (domain walls, twin boundaries, etc. in different physical settings) are characterized by a jump discontinuity or narrow transition layer of the unknown scalar or vector field (e.g., order parameter, deformation, polarization) or its spatial derivatives. To identify the unknown phase boundary, special augmented models have been developed, notably the phase field and level set methods. The prototypical phase field models are described by the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations. An essential ingredient of most continuum models of phase transitions is a nonconvex, multiwell energy density function. The DNN approach has been used to solve free boundary problems of the Stefan type  and to describe phase boundaries in the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations 3 . The method uses standard DNNs without any modification to identify phase boundaries. Martensitic phase transitions    are often modeled using a free energy density that is a nonconvex, multi-well potential depending on the gradient of the unknown deformation field. In fact, the martensitic phase itself involves two or more symmetry-related variants, known as twins, that correspond to different energy wells. (a) (b) (c) The fact that the energy depends on the gradient of the unknown function (deformation) introduces special challenges. Local energy minimizers involve phase boundaries separating parts of the body in different phases. Across these interfaces, the deformation field remains continuous, but its gradient jumps. Continuity of the deformation field imposes restrictions on the jump of its gradient (Hadamard compatibility conditions  ). In many crystalline alloys, the austenite and martensite energy wells violate these conditions, which are nonetheless satisfied between martensitic twin variants. As a result, there is no absolute energy minimum achievable . Instead, the energy tends to its infimum in the limit, along a sequence of deformations with a laminated microstructure of parallel twin interfaces. Such minimizing sequences involve a larger and larger number of twin boundaries, and converge to a limit state compatible with austenite . Such laminates are observed in experiments, Fig. 1(a).\nThis microstructure is called finely twinned martensite; it can also occur because of incompatibility between twins of different orientations and/or rigid (null Dirichlet) boundary conditions, Fig. 1. Near an incompatible boundary, twin layers taper into needles, and often an individual layer is observed splitting into two or more needles in experiments, Fig. 1(a) 0 . This is known as twin branching and has been studied analytically 5 1 0 9 and numerically 9 1 0 2 as a mechanism for attainment of an energy minimum in the presence of interfacial energy. In order to capture this complex behaviour, it is possible to consider some lower-dimensional problems. Many of these have an energy of the form\n where Ω⊂ℝnΩsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}, u:Ω→ℝm:𝑢→Ωsuperscriptℝ𝑚u:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m} and n=2𝑛2n=2 or 333, while m=n𝑚𝑛m=n or m=1𝑚1m=1 for the vector and scalar case, respectively. In all cases, W:ℝm×n→ℝ:𝑊→superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛ℝW:\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\to\\mathbb{R} is a nonconvex function with multiple wells.\nLetting the derivative of W𝑊W be S:ℝm×n→ℝm×n:𝑆→superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛S:\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}, the Euler-Lagrange equation of (1) are Because of loss of rank one convexity   for values of ∇u∇𝑢\\nabla u between wells, this PDE system loses ellipticity. Because of ellipticity loss, (2) has weak solutions with phase boundaries, across which ∇u∇𝑢\\nabla u jumps discontinuously from phase to phase  and second derivatives fail to exist. This precludes using the physics-informed neural network method (PINN), which requires the strong form of (2) to be valid . An added problem is the extensive loss of uniqueness of weak solutions of (2) , many of which are energetically unstable (not even local energy minima). The alternative is to minimize the energy (1)  5 2 9 1. We use the Deep Ritz method , namely energy minimization in terms of DNNs. An additional advantage is that piecewise smooth local minimizers of (1) are also weak solutions of (2) which are at least metastable, in contrast to some solutions of (2). Here we demonstrate that the Deep Ritz method spontaneously captures complex microstructures, such as the finely twinned one, including gradient jumps across multiple curved interfaces and splitting/tapering topological transitions near boundaries 0 5 1 2 9 1 . Notably, the method is mesh-free; this allows it to accurately describe curved interfaces of arbitrary orientation, in contrast to FEM and other mesh dependent methods 9. No special structure of the DNN is required for this, except a specially designed activation function whose form is suggested by the structure of solutions to simple problems. The outline of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the Deep Ritz method for energy minimization in the setting of nonlinear elasticity, and apply it to various problems in one and two dimensions, involving nonconvex potentials of the deformation gradient. A crucial role is played by the activation function. Our first choice is guided by the observation that in the simplest one-dimensional problem, an exact solution is provided by the piecewise linear ReLU activation function. We then consider a regularization of the problem, by including the second derivative of the deformation in the energy . Minimizers are smooth, with transition layers replacing derivative jumps. This motivates our introduction of a smoothened version of the ReLU activation function, which we call SmReLU. In two-dimensional problems, use of SmReLU captures spatially complex microstructures with fine twinning and twin branching, Fig. 1(c), whereas traditional activation functions fail.\nSection 3 reports on extensive numerical computations. A discussion of our results, their significance, and comparison to previous work is in Section 4.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Physics-informed deep learning methods         [ref]40 have recently achieved great success in solving PDE problems arising in different fields of STEM.
