      "content": "Paper Title: CCGL: Contrastive Cascade Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now introduce the basic settings and describe the necessary preliminaries.\nInformation cascade is a behavior of information adoption by people , in various applications such as social networks of Twitter and Weibo, academic networks of authors and papers. The sequence of adoptions over time forms information cascade. If we have the diffusion path of each adoption, then the cascade graph   can be constructed, formally defined as: Information Cascade Graph.\nGiven an information item III, e.g., a tweet or a paper, published at time t0subscriptt0t_{0}, over a period of time, item III receives several adoptions, e.g., MMM retweets or citations, then the sequence of adoptions composes an information cascade CI​(t)subscriptCItC_{I}(t)={(uj,tj)|j∈[1,M],tj<t}absentconditional-setsubscriptujsubscripttjformulae-sequencej1Msubscripttjt=\\{(u_{j},t_{j})|j\\in[1,M],t_{j}<t\\}, where user ujsubscriptuju_{j} adopts the item III at time tjsubscripttjt_{j}. Then a cascade graph can be defined as a diffusion tree 𝒢​(t)={𝒱,ℰ}𝒢t𝒱ℰ\\mathcal{G}(t)=\\{\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}\\}, where 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} denotes the set of users in CI​(t)subscriptCItC_{I}(t) and ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} denotes the adoption relationship between users, e.g., retweeting or citing. In this paper, we focus on the temporal-structural modeling of information cascades, i.e., given a sequence of cascade graphs, we aim to learn effective representations of cascade graphs for downstream cascade applications, e.g., outbreak prediction, recommendation, rumor detection, and user activation prediction. Most of this study focuses on information cascade popularity prediction : Information Cascade Popularity Prediction.\n\nGiven an observed cascade graph 𝒢i​(to)subscript𝒢isubscriptto\\mathcal{G}_{i}(t_{o}) at observation time tosubscripttot_{o}, the popularity prediction problem aims to predict the future popularity (or size) Pi​(tp)subscriptPisubscripttpP_{i}(t_{p}) of this cascade (graph) at a prediction time tp≫tomuch-greater-thansubscripttpsubscripttot_{p}\\gg t_{o}. Additional experiments conducted on another downstream task outbreak prediction can be found in Section 5.5.\nOther modalities of information cascades, e.g., global structures, individual user/item features, and content of texts/images, are not studied and left for future work. In order to explore and understand which parts of an unsupervised learning framework can benefit the learning of cascade representations, we concentrate on answering the following three questions. Q1: Will unlabeled data improve the learning of cascade graph representation and prediction?\nMost of the supervised models are not possible to benefit from unlabeled data. In the context of graph-based cascade understanding, unlabeled graphs can be obtained at their early evolving stage, which is not able to make meaningful predictions. In traditional prediction models, these graphs are simply filtered out from training and evaluation  2 4.\nSelf-supervised approaches emphasize the importance of learning effective representations from a large amount of unlabeled data in an unsupervised and task-agnostic way. Unlabeled data can be easily obtained from one [ref]23 or multiple datasets [ref]28 for learning generic representations. Therefore, we believe that we can improve the cascade graph learning by incorporating unlabeled cascades in CCGL. Q2: Will data augmentation improve the cascade prediction and if so, how can we design augmentation strategies for cascade graphs?\nSince graph augmentation procedures have no analogues to texts or images due to the non-Euclidean, complex structures of graphs, how to design new strategies for graph data to improve model generalization ability and to benefit downstream prediction tasks becomes critical both for graph and contrastive learning.\nAs we discussed earlier, previous graph data augmentation techniques mainly focus on graph neural networks and node/graph classifications   , and most of them only consider edge and feature manipulations while ignore node handling. This calls for an urgent research to devise cascade graph-specific augmentation strategies . In CCGL, we propose a novel strategy for cascade graph data augmentation:\nwe simulate the mechanism of information diffusion in social networks (or other similar networks, e.g., news and academics), where we first traverse every node in the graph in their adoption time order, and then for each node we compute its attractiveness probability. Depends on their degrees in the cascade graph, current nodes can attract new adopters or lose existing followers. Q3: Will contrastive self-supervised learning framework improve the cascade learning and prediction?\nPre-training models has recently received a great deal of attention and achieved good performance in both linguistic and visual tasks. However, their applicability on information cascades is still underexplored by research community, to the best of our knowledge. In this study, based on the idea of pre-training   , we develop CCGL where the selection of cascade graph encoder network is generic. Any graph representation learning models and graph neural networks, or other specifically designed cascade learning models (e.g., DeepCas , VaCas 4, Coupled-GNNs 5) can be used as cascade graph encoders.\nWe implement and compare these techniques in CCGL, aiming at shedding some light on the ability of unsupervised cascade representation learning and seeking additional performance improvement for downstream cascade prediction tasks. We finish this section with a summary of the symbols that will be used in the rest of the paper, presented in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: emphasize the importance of learning effective representations from a large amount of unlabeled data in an unsupervised and task-agnostic way. Unlabeled data can be easily obtained from one [ref]23 or multiple datasets [ref]28 for learning generic representations. Therefore, we believe that we can improve the cascade graph learning by incorporating unlabeled cascades in CCGL.
