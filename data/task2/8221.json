      "content": "Paper Title: HG2P: Hippocampus-inspired High-reward Graph and Model-Free Q-Gradient Penalty for Path Planning and Motion Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGoal-reaching and navigation tasks are common problems in many sequential decision-making and control tasks. For example, robotic assembly tasks can generally be decomposed into three subtasks: fetching an object, navigating to a specified position, and then putting it over there. Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) aims to solve this problem by breaking the final target into a series of subgoals. Recent successes with goal-conditioned HRL to complex and long-horizon tasks have been driven by well-designed subgoal-generating mechanisms, containing the kùëòk-step adjacency constraint  , contrastive triplet loss-based subgoal representations   , and graph-based planning 4 8  . Notably, recent studies in psychology and neuroscience reveal that integrating graph-based planning into model-free RL may potentially be associated with brain mechanisms in decision-making and memory  . For example, representations of place cells and grid cells in the rodent hippocampus can be viewed as the cognitive maps for spatial memory and navigation  . Inspired by the mechanisms of the brain, recent advances   in episodic RL support the idea that experience should be stored in the form of the graph structure for more efficient recall and reconstruction, imitating the netlike connected engrams in the human brain. In the memory graph, each node corresponds to a visited state, each edge corresponds to an action, with the state-action value attributed to the edge. Under near-deterministic settings, researchers  focused on updating the edge attributes along the valuable paths to reinforce memory, thereby improving sample efficiency. Recent neuroimaging findings       have demonstrated the underlying rationale for selective memory enhancement. Specifically, hippocampal replay activity, particularly the reverse replay during rest, is biased toward highly rewarded places, where high reward value enhances memory retention by selectively enhancing the reactivation and accelerating reorganization of the hippocampal spatial map. Additionally, novel experiences are also known to induce and increase replay activity, enhancing the acquisition and consolidation of new information. The effects of novelty or fear are tied to emotional (up or down) states, modulated by the noradrenergic system . Based on existing neurobiological studies and findings, we can effectively link the existing goal-conditioned HRL with graph-based planning to brain mechanisms, proposing a dual-controller hypothesis. Indeed, Chersi et al.  were the first to propose a minimal cognitive architecture for spatial navigation, a minimal circuit composed of the hippocampus and striatum. Additionally, recent studies   have argued that two particular controllers should be integrated: one associated with the hippocampus, which provides the cognitive map for goal-directed decision-making, and the other associated with the ventral striatum, which learns stimulus-response associations. Inspired by this , our dual-controller hypothesis based on the hippocampus-striatum system is illustrated in Fig.¬†1. Based on such a hypothesis, we argue that the following studies are biologically plausible for accelerated learning: HIGL 8 proposed novelty-based sampling; ACLG [ref]39 decoupled the loss terms of HIGL to enable direct competition between the graph-based (hippocampus-like) controller and the model-free (striatum-like) controller. However, previous studies on graph-based planning neglect the high-reward preferences observed in hippocampal replay. To address this, we propose adopting a high-return sampling strategy to replace random sampling when constructing memory graphs, as shown in Fig.¬†2. The high-return sampling strategy will assign larger weights to high-return experiences. This is also inspired in part by instance-based decision theory, i.e., the performance of the target policy is anchored on the performance of the behavior policy. Therefore, learning from high-performing policies‚Äô trajectories holds the potential to achieve greater policy improvement over the behavior policy. Meanwhile, we note that Wang et al. [ref]39 derived a model-inferred upper bound of Q-function‚Äôs Lipschitz constant w.r.t. actions, aiming at suppressing sharp lower-level Q-function gradients. The underlying reason is that the lower-level policy interacts directly with the environment, and reinforcing its robustness can prevent catastrophic failures. Also, Lipschitz‚Äôs continuous constraints of lower-level Q-function make the goal-reaching distance estimation based on value function 4 more reliable, avoiding overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) states. Nevertheless, approximating the environment dynamics to derive the upper bound is particularly costly and impractical for complex dynamical environments with high-dimensional observations. In this paper, we strategically propose a model-free Q-gradient penalty by deriving the upper bound of the lower-level Q-function‚Äôs Lipschitz constant w.r.t. input states and subgoals. Interestingly, this upper bound is associated with the higher-level policy, promoting inter-level coordination. All in all, in this paper, we propose a novel goal-conditioned HRL framework, which primarily introduces two crucial extensions to existing frameworks: 1) high-return sampling for graph construction, simulating the high-reward preferences observed in hippocampal replay; 2) a model-free Q-gradient penalty, providing an alternative approach to model-based penalty [ref]39. The first extension relates to the Hippocampus-inspired High-reward Graph, and the second to model-free Gradient Penalty, so the proposed method is called HG2P.\nWe integrate these extensions into a state-of-the-art framework, ACLG [ref]39, and evaluate the effectiveness of the novel framework on a set of complex and long-horizon tasks, including both maze-related navigation tasks and robot manipulation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework contributes to improved training stability and higher sample efficiency. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: It is the first attempt to interpret landmark-based planning through the hippocampus-striatum-like dual-controller hypothesis. Inspired by such hypothesis and instance-based theory, we propose a high-return (HR) sampling strategy that emphasizes the importance of high-return episodic memory in constructing memory graphs, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. To eliminate dependence on models, we propose a model-free Q-gradient penalty (MF-GP) module that serves as an alternative to the model-based Q-gradient penalty used in prior work [ref]39. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows:\nSection 2 introduces the preliminaries on HRL, adjacency constraint, landmark-based planning, and the prior state-of-the-art approaches, i.e., HIGL and its variant ACLG. Section 3 briefly introduces the related works, focusing on sampling in episodic memory and local Lipschitzness. Section 4 describes two crucial components of the proposed framework, providing a detailed explanation and formulation. In Section 5, we describe the experimental environments, conduct ablation studies to explore the impact of different parameters, present the main results, and discuss the principal findings. Section 6 summarizes the concluding remarks of this article and outlines potential directions for future research.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: system is illustrated in Fig.¬†1.
