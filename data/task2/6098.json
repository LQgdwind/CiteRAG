      "content": "Paper Title: Smaller3d: Smaller Models for 3D Semantic Segmentation Using Minkowski Engine and Knowledge Distillation Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, 3D semantic segmentation has gained significant attention in computer vision due to its broad application range in various fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, medical imaging, and many more. 3D semantic segmentation aims to extract meaningful information from 3D point clouds, by label assignments of every point in the point cloud. The scene understanding of 3D with deep learning became popular by PointNet (Qi, C. R., Su, H., Mo, K., & Guibas, L. J. (2017)) . After that, in 2019 4d spatio-temporal convnets: MinkowskiNets(Choy, C., Gwak, J., & Savarese, S. (2019)) [ref]2 and SparseConvNets (Graham, B., Engelcke, M., & Van Der Maaten, L. (2018))[ref]3 were purposed which hit state-of-the-art results on release by overpassing other methods with huge margin, by suggesting to use Sparse Convolutional NNs for this task, which are working for any D dimensional tasks. This approach was quite useful because convolutional NNs are faster than other approaches like transformers, recurrent NNs, 3D convolutions and etc. These new Sparse Convolutional NNs enable to make the learning process much faster and more efficient. Studies of Sparse Neural Networks show, that in 3D sparsity of data is very vivid, and with a voxel size of 20cm around 78% and with a voxel size of 2.5cm around 98% of data is empty. It becomes much clear, that whenever we are using well-known 3D convolutions or any other methods that do not consider Sparsity, a lot of weights of neural networks are just learning empty space, and they discard the neural networks to learn from informative data. After that, a new technique was added on top of MinkowskiEngine, called Mix3D (Nekrasov, A., Schult, J., Litany, O., Leibe, B., & Engelmann, F. (2021, December))[ref]4 which purposed using augmentation technique to mix different indoor scenes together. It proved to be much better, as this technique was working well against overfitting, and started to help models to better understand the general context and local geometry and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Scannet V2 dataset. However, those models are still quite big and require a lot of resources (GPU, TPU) to run or test with current regular machines. In this paper, we propose the Knowledge Distillation method, which enables us to get almost the same results as state-of-the-art methods, while using much less computation and resources, and also keeping performance. We are a purposing mix of different Knowledge Distillation Loss Functions, which include using different feature map losses (See 1) and also Logit loss with temperature like . Those Losses are explained in 2.\nIn this paper, we aim to replicate the Mix3D[ref]4 results with a voxel size of 5cm. Then by keeping the architecture and reducing the number of neurons, use knowledge distillation to transfer teacher network info to smaller student networks. Our studies show a minimum loss in % of mIoU(around 2%). Through all studies, the evaluations are done on the ScanNet V2 dataset, which is concentrated on indoor 3D scans. We compare our results with different approaches, and also our own different student networks, learned by numerous loss functions. Our studies show that generalizing some tasks is done much better with a smaller model on some specific tasks, which are shown on Experiences(See 5). We have tested our studies with 2 different networks with the structure of Res16UNet34C, by using half, or a quarter of neurons, to symmetrically reduce the sizes. We also show that this approach helps to keep the architecture and transfer original knowledge from different layers of the network, by giving us control during distillation.\nExperiments also show that using additional loss along with Knowledge Distillation standard techniques relatively speeds up learning and makes the process stable and helps student models to directly move towards teacher models and use a much higher learning rate. Our contributions are summarized as: Apply different Knowledge Distillation methods to 3D Semantic Segmentation tasks. As a result, we achieved making relative mean intersection over union (mIoU) score, compared with the teacher network(by minimizing the network size 4 and 16 times). With this, we show that Knowledge Distillation makes training and inference complexity lower and faster while maintaining performance. Purpose a new architecture for Knowledge Distillation models for student-teacher distillation training. As a result, the student Network is able to learn from the teacher network, not only by the last layer but also through feature maps of intermediate layers. Purpose a new loss function, that combines Encoder, Decoder, and classic Knowledge Distillation losses. It gives much control over the training process, and hence with this new loss function, we achieve training process stability. We have included all in our code and models, which were developed on top of Mix3D augmentation techniques, at https://github.com/madanela/smaller3d\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: learning became popular by PointNet (Qi, C.
