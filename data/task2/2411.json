      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Adversarial Imitation Learning using Variational Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to autonomously learn by interacting with the environment presents a promising approach for learning diverse skills. However, reward specification has remained a major challenge in the deployment of RL in practical settings  [ref]2 . The ability to imitate humans or other expert trajectories allows us to avoid the reward specification problem, while also circumventing challenges related to task-specific exploration in RL. Visual demonstrations can also be a more natural way to teach robots various tasks and skills in real-world applications. However, this setting is also fraught with a number of technical challenges including representation learning for visual observations, sample complexity due to the high dimensional observation spaces, and learning instability [ref]4 [ref]5  due to lack of a stationary learning signal.\nWe aim to overcome these challenges and to develop an algorithm that can learn from limited demonstration data and scale to high-dimensional observation and action spaces often encountered in robotics applications. Behaviour cloning (BC) is a classic algorithm to imitate expert demonstrations , which uses supervised learning to greedily match the expert behaviour at demonstrated expert states. Due to environment stochasticity, covariate shift, and policy approximation error, the agent may drift away from the expert state distribution and ultimately fail to mimic the demonstrator .\nWhile a wide initial state distribution  or the ability to interactively query the expert policy  can circumvent these difficulties, such conditions require additional supervision and are difficult to meet in practical applications. An alternate line of work based on inverse RL 0 1 and adversarial imitation learning 2 3 aims to not only match actions at demonstrated states, but also the long term state visitation distribution of the expert 4. Adversarial imitation learning approaches explicitly train a GAN-based classifier 5 to distinguish the visitation distribution of the agent from the expert, and use it as a reward signal for training the agent with RL. While these methods have achieved substantial improvement over behaviour cloning without additional expert supervision, they are difficult to deploy in realistic scenarios for multiple reasons: (1) the objective requires on-policy data collection leading to high sample complexity; (2) the reward function changes as the RL agent learns; and (3) high-dimensional observation spaces require representation learning and exacerbate the optimization challenges. Our main contribution in this work is the development of a new algorithm, variational model-based adversarial imitation learning (V-MAIL), which aims to overcome each of the aforementioned challenges within a single framework.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, V-MAIL trains a variational latent-space dynamics model and a discriminator that provides a learning reward signal by distinguishing latent rollouts of the agent from the expert.\nThe key insight of our approach is that variational models can address these challenges simultaneously by (a) making it possible to collect on-policy roll-outs inside the model without environment interaction, leading to an efficient and stable optimization process and (b) providing a rich auxiliary objective for efficiently learning compact state representations and which regularizes the discriminator.\nFurthermore, the variational model also allows V-MAIL to perform zero-shot transfer to new imitation learning tasks. By generating on-policy rollouts within the model, and training the discriminator using these rollouts along with demonstrations of a new task, V-MAIL can learn policies for new tasks without any additional environment interactions. Through experiments on vision-based locomotion and manipulation tasks, we find that V-MAIL can successfully learn visuomotor control policies from limited demonstrations. In particular, V-MAIL exhibits stable and near-monotonic learning, is highly sample efficient, and asymptotically matches the expert level performance on most tasks. In contrast, prior algorithms exhibit unstable learning and poor asymptotic performance, often achieving less that 20% of expert performance on these vision-based tasks.\nWe further show the ability to transfer the model to novel tasks, acquiring qualitatively new behaviors using only a few demonstrations and no additional environment interactions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: with the environment presents a promising approach for learning diverse skills.
