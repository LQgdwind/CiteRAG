Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Tensorformer: Normalized Matrix Attention Transformer for High-quality Point Cloud Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer is a convolution-free method, using attention weight to substitute convolution weight in feature aggregation. At the beginning, it[ref]8 is applied in NLP to capture long-term word tokens relation and achieves excellent performance. Later, the computer vision community notices the transformer’s potential for vision task. Large number of works has emerged in last 2 years related to computer vision. Vision Transformer(ViT)[ref]9 applies transformer in image classification by partitioning the image into fixed patches and using transformer to pass information between different patch. DETR[ref]21 uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to predict bounding box. Pyramid Vision Transformer extracts different resolution feature by transformer and establishes an unified backbone for varied vision task. Swin Transformer uses shifted window to make information flow in different patch and also establishes a backbone for varied vision task. In 3D vision, Point Transformer  and Point Cloud Transformer almost appear at the same time. They apply transformer to point cloud processing, and achieve state of the art on classification and segmentation task. Due to the calculation complexity, some other works try to reduce the computation cost by modifying the attention mechanism. ,  explore selective\nor sparse attention to previous layer tokens which updating\neach next layer token. All the methods mentioned above use dot-product scalar attention or vector attention.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Transformer is a convolution-free method, using attention weight to substitute convolution weight in feature aggregation.
