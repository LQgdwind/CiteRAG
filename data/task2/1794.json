SNIP [ref]27 proposed to prune weights that are the least salient for the loss in the one-shot manner. GraSP [ref]40 further exploited the second-order information of the loss at initialization and prune the weights that affect gradient flows least. [ref]38 unified these methods under a newly proposed invariant measure called synaptic saliency, and showed that pruning iteratively instead of in one-shot is essential for avoiding layer collapse. The authors then propose an iterative pruning method called SynFlow based on synaptic saliency that requires no access to data. However, it is observed in  that vanilla magnitude-based pruning  is as competitive as the above carefully designed pruning methods in most cases, yet all are inferior to IMP by clear margins. The pruning-at-initialization methods such as SNIP and GraSP were suggested to identify no more than a layer-wise pruning ratio configuration. That was because the SNIP/GraSP masks were found to be insensitive to mask shuffling within each layer, while LTH masks were impacted a lot by the same. Those suggest that existing early-pruning methods are not yet ready to replace IMP. Instead of searching for static sparse subnetworks, another line of influential works, called dynamic sparse training (DST), focuses on training sparse subnetworks from scratch while dynamically changing the connectivity patterns. DST was first proposed in . Following works improve DST by parameter redistribution   and gradient-based methods  . A recent work  suggested that successful DST needed to explore the training of possible connections sufficiently.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: the pruning of networks at either the initialization or the early stage of training , so that the resulting subnetworks can achieve close performance to the dense model when fully trained.
