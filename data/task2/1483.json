      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Low-Cost Time-Domain Audio Separation Using Globally Attentive Locally Recurrent Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAudio separation is a fundamental problem in signal processing, and the most typical problem is called “cocktail party problem”  including multi-talker speech separation, overlapped speech-music separation, etc.\nRecent advances in deep learning models [ref]2    have drastically advanced state-of-the-art speech separation performances on several benchmark datasets.\nCurrently, one outstanding category of the best-performing solutions is based on the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet) [ref]6, which takes mixture waveforms as inputs and directly reconstruct sources by computing time-domain loss with permutation invariant training (PIT)  . In particular, there were several types of TasNets: the initially proposed bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) based TasNet [ref]6, the time convolutional network (TCN) based Conv-TasNet [ref]9 0, the dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN) [ref]2 and the recently proposed dual-path Transformer network (DPTNet) 1. These TasNet-based prior work has proven that a smaller window size improves the separation performance at the cost of a significantly longer 1-D feature sequence [ref]2 1. To provide a more concrete illustration, we take a 444-second 161616Hz sample rate waveform input as an example in Fig. 1, where the resultant feature sequence that a TasNet (with a window size of 222 samples and hop size of 111 sample) needs to model would be as long as 640006400064000. Learning such long-term sequential dependency poses special challenges to various conventional sequential modeling networks, including attention models2 3, CNNs 4 0, and RNNs (e.g., LSTMs5 and GRUs 6), each with respective difficulties as discussed below. Attention models 7 has superiority in learning context-aware long-term dependencies, e.g., in BERT 8 for natural language processing tasks. Most recently, a series of research has also attempted to apply self-attention in speech signal processing, but generally to remarkably shorter feature sequences than a raw input, e.g., frame-level acoustic features for speech recognition 9   , layer features in a U-Net architecture 2 or short-time Fourier transform (STFT) features for speech enhancement 3. Nevertheless, attention models have been hardly applied to time-domain source separation tasks as we discussed above because its complexity and memory consumption per layer is quadratic to the sequence length and become unacceptable for very long sequential modeling.\n1-D CNNs with fixed receptive fields that are smaller than the very long sequence length, unlike RNNs that have dynamic receptive fields, are not able to fully utilize the sequence-level dependency [ref]9.\nRNNs are also limited by its nature of recursively processing and memorizing context   . To mitigate the long sequence modeling problem for RNNs, Luo et al. [ref]2 introduced DPRNN, in which the long signal sequence is divided into shorter segments and interleave two RNNs, an inter-segment RNN and an inter-segment RNN, for local and global modeling, respectively. To provide a better panorama about how a sequential context a TasNet (e.g., DPRNN) is dealing with looks, we plot the 4s raw waveform mixture in the upper in Fig. 1, where one of the two overlapping utterances, saying “Settle, no matter how, but settle”, has been marked in red. Under the dual-path setting, it is segmented into 512 segments, each with length 250. The lower plot zooms in on the \\nth385 segment to show the details inside a segment around the lateral phoneme of /l/ in the second “settle”. As we can see, high temporal correlation, acoustic signal structure, and continuities occur in inter-segment sequences, whilst strong discontinuities occur in inter-segment sequences. As revealed by Khandelwal et al. , RNNs are far more sensitive to the nearby elements than to the distant ones, and the model is capable of using about 200200200 tokens of context on average, but sharply distinguishes nearby context (recent 505050 tokens) from the distant history. This suggests that RNNs are ideally suited for inter-segment modeling, but not necessarily so for inter-segment modeling. Moreover, Ravanelli et al.  discovered that RNNs reset the stored memory to avoid bias towards an “unrelated” history. However, unlike language modeling where information could be safely discarded when moving from one text to another semantically unrelated text, we argue that for specific tasks such as audio separation, faraway memory could potentially be important. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, the first “settle” (\\nth20- \\nth65 segment), which is very distant from the second “settle” (\\nth360- \\nth405 segment), could be more useful than nearby elements. In contrast, one strength of attention mechanisms over RNNs lies in a fully connected sequence processing strategy, where every element is connected to other elements in a sequence via a direct path without any recursively processing, memorizing reset, or update mechanisms like RNNs. Given the above example, for the second “settle”, a self-attention model would have readily placed more importance to the first “settle”, despite the faraway context beyond 200200200 segments. Motivated by the above observation, our work revises TasNets and DPRNN to better address long-range context modeling for audio separation, leading to a lower-cost, higher-performance structure called globally attentive locally recurrent (GALR) network. We resort to the self-attention mechanism 7 for inter-segment computation to model context-aware global dependencies. Meanwhile, we keep using RNNs for modeling local dependencies at the lower inter-segment context level, e.g., signal continuity, signal structure, etc, which are inherently important for waveform reconstruction. The contribution of this paper is four-fold: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly leverages the attention and recurrent mechanisms in an alternate and iterative manner, and most importantly, allows the system to take advantage of both techniques, which are complementary at modeling global long-range context and local detail dependencies, respectively. Our work elegantly solves the critical bottleneck of self-attention networks due to unacceptable computational and memory cost for modeling very long sequences, as we can control the global sequence length via the dual-path structure [ref]2. Related similar work includes R-Transformer  and DPTNet 1. Nevertheless, R-Transformer has the attention mechanism at the middle-level directly applied to the whole sequence, thus its computational cost is still quadratic to the sequence length, which hinders its application to TasNet; DPTNet also applied a dual-path setting like DPRNN to a Transformer-based architecture, but both inter-segment and inter-segment sequences are processed by a combination of attention model and RNN, leading to additional computational cost much heavier than DPRNN and our proposed GALR, which we will discuss in more details in Section 3.2.4. The proposed GALR model has a significantly lower cost with 42.3% reduction in model-size and with a 36.1% reduction in runtime memory cost and a 49.4% reduction in computational operations, while achieving comparable or better performance comparing to DPRNN.\nMoreover, unlike RNNs and DPRNN, the global attentive structure can further reduce training and inference time via parallelization, as the attention can be computed for all segments in parallel and allows parallel computation for aggregating information across segments over long audio sequences. Finally, results show consistently higher performance over DPRNN in terms of SI-SNRi and SDRi across three different datasets, while still maintaining a lower cost.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: and the most typical problem is called “cocktail party problem”  including multi-talker speech separation, overlapped speech-music separation, etc.\nRecent advances in deep learning models [ref]2    have drastically advanced state-of-the-art speech separation performances on several benchmark datasets.\nCurrently, one outstanding category of the best-performing solutions is based on the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
