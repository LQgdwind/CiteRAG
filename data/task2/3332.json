Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Large batch training and periodic communication reduce the communication rounds. From the framework level, works like BlueConnect  and PLink  design a network topology-aware framework to optimize the communication pattern. SSP relaxes synchronization requirements to minimize the synchronization cost. Poseidon overlaps the communication with the computation and ByteScheduler further designs a generic framework with the tensor partitioning and scheduling.\nOther works also explore the optimization for model parallelism, such as GPipe [ref]19 and PipeDream . Resource Management in Deep Learning Clusters. Besides the switch memory, other resources like GPUs and network bandwidth also need carefully scheduling to guarantee resource efficiency and job performance     9  . Gandiva 5 manage the resource in GPU clusters via time-sharing and Migration. Optimus  is an online resource scheduler which is further optimized for the dynamically workload by building the resource-performance model. Tiresias [ref]14 obverses that a DLT job’s execution time is often ignostic and proposes the Discretized TwoDimensional Gittins index and Discretized Two-Dimensional LAS to minimize the average JCT.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Communication Optimization in DLT.\nBesides the closely related INA discussed in the §§\\S2, many other solutions are proposed to optimize the DLT communication [ref]39   .\nFor example, from the application level, gradient sparsification and quantization reduce the communication volume in one iteration.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
