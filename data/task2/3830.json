      "content": "Paper Title: Real or Virtual: A Video Conferencing Background Manipulation-Detection System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNowadays, people’s lives are made easier by various video conferencing applications (e.g., Zoom, Google-Meet, Microsoft Teams), especially during the pandemic. Smart working, online meetings, and virtual conferencing platforms have - and continue to be - widely adopted solutions to connect people, while preserving social distancing. On the other hand, the wide spread use and popularity of such solutions have also brought the need for privacy-preserving and security measures against several attacks such as JPEG compression and various post-processing operations intended to forge images . In video conferencing platforms, replacing a real background with a virtual one enables the users to conceal their real location, remove distractions, or hide other people present in the environment. However, a worker might also want to fool his/her employer by changing the real background image or consider a video with a virtual background [ref]4. This possibility also paves the way for creating forged videos with people pretending to be in different locations. Therefore, developing robust detectors that identify real from virtual background is an interesting emerging, yet a challenging task in the world of multimedia authentication. To that end, there is a need to develop such a tool that can distinguish a real background from a virtual background.\n In the past decade, the recent development of machine and deep learning approaches has significantly enhanced the detection of forged videos [ref]5. However, the identification and the computation of robust video features that enable flawless detection is still a challenging research issue. In particular, the attacker can fool the detector by faking his virtual background that seems to be a real background. The technique proposed in  achieves a considerably high detection rate by creating color co-occurrence matrices of the presented background as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The authors obtained outstanding performance for a variety of manipulation operations by training the CNN using co-occurrence matrices generated from the input image, instead of the co-occurrence matrices that are extracted from noise residuals. The authors considered two different Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) image datasets that are based on unpaired image-to-image translations, the styleGAN [ref]7 and the starGAN . In multimedia forensics, residual images are frequently used in calculating the co-occurrence matrices to identify or localize the detection  ; and these approaches often consider the SPAM features , or the CSRMQ  features, which were initially suggested for steganalysis. In , the color components are used to generate co-occurrence matrices from high-pass filtering residuals, as well as for each truncated residual image. Then, the co-occurrences are obtained by combining the color channels into a feature to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM).\n The solutions in   achieve outstanding results by feeding six co-occurrence matrices (hereafter, we referred to as six co-mat) into CNN from spatial and spectral bands. Additionaly, they are applied on highly fake image quality that is produced by the GAN. This approach computes co-occurrence matrices by considering cross-band co-occurrences (spectral) and co-occurrences (spatial) on the grey-level computed separately on the single bands. Although targeting ProGAN  and StyleGAN  datasets mainly, the authors argue that it can be employed in any multimedia forensics detection task. Compared to the three co-occurrence matrices approach that has spatial features , the six co-occurrence matrices approach with both spatial and spectral features significantly enhance the resilience against various types of post-processing and laundering attacks .\n Inspired by the later approach, we are motivated to understand the usability of such method on videoconferencing systems and other related applications against robust adversarial attacks. More specifically, we investigate the security implications of videoconferencing systems and build a detector tool that can distinguish a real background from video with a virtual background. To classify the virtual from real background, our proposed method searches for inconsistencies in co-occurrence matrices frame-by-frame. Consequently, the aware detector achieved high performance for revealing JPEG compressed frames compared to the existing approaches so far.\n Furthermore, we perform additional experiments to verify the robustness of our proposed methods against several common attacks focusing on Macbook-Pro camera. For this, we also captured different videos in other cameras to test the detector. Based on the results that we achieved in MSI GF65 10UX laptop (low quality) and Apple IPAD Pro (high quality), we find that if the main component of a camera fingerprint are close to each other, our detector is robust in terms of detection. Additionally, we found that if we want the detector to operate against different cameras (video conferencing), a fine-tuning of the detector is needed or another methodology should be used for detecting different camera model identification based on sensor pattern noise . The experimental results show that our aware model detector performs well over a wide variety of attack scenarios that we considered in this study .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: or hide other people present in the environment.
