In the planning phase, how do constraint-satisfaction heuristics compare to tree-decomposition solvers? In the execution phase, how do ADDs compare to tensors as the underlying data structure? Are project-join-tree-based weighted model counters competitive with state-of-the-art tools? To answer RQ1, we build two implementations of the planning phase: HTB (for Heuristic Tree Builder, based on [ref]26) and LG (for Line Graph, based on [ref]25).\nHTB implements Algorithm 1 and so is representative of the constraint-satisfaction approach.\nHTB contains implementations of four clustering heuristics (BE-List, BE-Tree, BM-List, and BM-Tree) and nine cluster-variable-order heuristics (Random, MCS, InvMCS, LexP, InvLexP, LexM, InvLexM, MinFill, and InvMinFill).\nLG implements Algorithm 2 and so is representative of the tree-decomposition approach.\nIn order to find tree decompositions, LG leverages three state-of-the-art heuristic tree-decomposition solvers: FlowCutter , htd , and Tamaki .\nThese solvers are all anytime, meaning that LG never halts but continues to produce better and better project-join trees when given additional time.\nOn the other hand, HTB produces a single project-join tree.\nWe compare these implementations on the planning phase in Section 6.1. To answer RQ2, we build two implementations of the execution phase: DMC (for Diagram Model Counter, based on [ref]26) and tensor (based on [ref]25).\nDMC uses ADDs as the underlying data structure with CUDD .\ntensor uses tensors as the underlying data structure with NumPy .\nWe compare these implementations on the execution phase in Section 6.2.\nSince LG is an anytime tool, each execution tool must additionally determine the best time to terminate LG and begin performing the valuation.\nWe explore options for this in Section 6.2. To answer RQ3, we combine each implementation of the planning phase and each implementation of the execution phase to produce model counters that use project-join trees.\nWe then compare these model counters with the state-of-the-art tools Cachet , c2d 9, d4 , and miniC2D  in Section 6.3. We use a set of 1976 literal-weighted model counting benchmarks from [ref]26.\nThese benchmarks were gathered from two sources.\nFirst, the Bayes class333https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/Cachet/ModelÀôCountingÀôBenchmarks\nconsists of 1080 CNF benchmarks444excluding 11 benchmarks double-counted by [ref]26\nthat encode Bayesian inference problems .\nAll literal weights in this class are between 0 and 1. Second, the Non-Bayes class555http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/KC/benchmarks.html\nconsists of 896 CNF benchmarks666including 73 benchmarks missed by [ref]26\nthat are divided into eight families: Bounded Model Checking (BMC), Circuit, Configuration, Handmade, Planning, Quantitative Information Flow (QIF), Random, and Scheduling 5   .\nAll Non-Bayes benchmarks are originally unweighted.\nAs we focus in this work on weighted model counting, we generate weights for these benchmarks.\nEach variable xùë•x is randomly assigned literal weights: either Wx‚Äã({x})=0.5subscriptùëäùë•ùë•0.5W_{x}(\\left\\{x\\right\\})=0.5 and Wx‚Äã(‚àÖ)=1.5subscriptùëäùë•1.5W_{x}(\\varnothing)=1.5, or Wx‚Äã({x})=1.5subscriptùëäùë•ùë•1.5W_{x}(\\left\\{x\\right\\})=1.5 and Wx‚Äã(‚àÖ)=0.5subscriptùëäùë•0.5W_{x}(\\varnothing)=0.5.\nGenerating weights in this particular fashion results in a reasonably low amount of floating-point underflow and overflow for all model counters.\n We ran all experiments on single CPU cores of a Linux cluster with Xeon E5-2650v2 processors (2.60-GHz) and 30 GB of memory.\nAll code, benchmarks, and experimental data are available in a public repository (https://github.com/vardigroup/DPMC).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: project-join-tree-based weighted model counters competitive with state-of-the-art tools? To answer RQ1, we build two implementations of the planning phase: HTB (for Heuristic Tree Builder, based on [ref]26) and LG (for Line Graph, based on [ref]25).\nHTB implements Algorithm 1 and so is representative of the constraint-satisfaction approach.\nHTB contains implementations of four clustering\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
