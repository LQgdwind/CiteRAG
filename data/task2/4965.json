High-utility SPM (HUSPM for short) plays an important role in decision-making. To date, a series of relevant algorithms have been developed. The SPM was originally proposed by Agrawal and Srikant  to address the challenge of discovering meaningful subsequences in a collection of sequences. In terms of utility-based issues, Ahmed et al.  introduced two algorithms in 2010: UtilityLevel, which applies the method of candidate generation and testing, and UtilitySpan, which uses a pattern growth approach. Yin et al.  then developed a generic framework called USpan to address the HUSPM problem. A lexicographic quantitative sequence tree and two concatenation mechanisms were also proposed . To improve the efficiency, several advanced algorithms with new data structures and new pruning strategies, such as HUS-Span , ProUM [ref]32, HUSP-ULL  have been proposed. In addition to efficiency, the effectiveness is also the key issue of data mining algorithms, thus some studies focus on mining top-kùëòk HUSPs   [ref]34, incremental HUSPM , HUSPM over data streams , HUSPM with negative item values , mining multi-dimensional HUSPs using MDUSEM and MDUSSD ¬†, and on-shelf availability for HUSPM ¬†. Additionally, MAHUSP  employed memory-adaptive mechanisms by taking advantage of the upper bound of memory, and the MAS-tree was also designed to maintain potential HUSPs. Other related works of utility-driven SPM and advanced utility mining tasks can be referred to the review literature .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Frequency-based sequential pattern mining  [ref]6 has attracted a lot of attention in the past decades.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
