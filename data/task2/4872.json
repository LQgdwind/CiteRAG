To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FreeGEM is the only parameter-free method in this task, with high accuracy and efficiency. Know-Evolve [ref]28 and HTNE  model interactions as multivariate point processes and Hawkes processes, respectively.\nWang et al. 0 propose a co-evolutionary process to model the co-evolving nature of users and items.\nShchur et al. [ref]22 propose to directly model the conditional distribution of inter-event times.\nDSPP  incorporates topology and long-term dependencies into the intensity function. RRN 2 models user and item interaction sequences with separate RNNs.\nTime-LSTM  proposes time gates to represent the time intervals.\nLatentCross  incorporates contextual data into embeddings.\nDeepCoevolve  and JODIE 4 generate node embeddings using two intertwined RNNs. JODIE 4 can also estimate user embeddings trajectories.\nDeePRed 3 employs non-recursive mutual RNNs to model interactions. TDIG-MPNN  captures the global and local information on the graph.\nDGCF 6 uses three update mechanisms to update users and items.\nSDGNN  takes the state changes of neighbor nodes into account.\nMRATE  combines different relations to realize multi-relation awareness.\nOGN 1 updates nodes in an online fashion with a constant memory cost.\nTCL  proposes a graph-topology-aware transformer to learn the representations of nodes.\nCoPE 7 uses an ordinary differential equation-based GNN to model the evolution of network.\nTGL 9 proposes a unified framework for large-scale temporal GNN training.\nMetaDyGNN 4 proposes a model based on\na meta-learning framework for few-shot link prediction in dynamic networks.\nTREND 1 uses Hawkes process-based GNN for temporal graph representation learning.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: etc., which need time-consuming training process.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
