      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Neural Network Bandits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContemporary bandit optimization approaches consider problems on large or continuous domains and have successfully been applied to a significant number of machine learning and real-world applications, e.g., in mobile health, environmental monitoring, economics, and hyperparameter tuning, to name a few. The main idea behind them is to exploit the correlations between the rewards of “similar” actions. This in turn, has resulted in increasingly rich models of reward functions (e.g., in linear and kernelized bandits [ref]37 ), including several recent attempts to harness deep neural networks for bandit tasks (see, e.g,  ). A vast majority of previous works only focus on standard input domains and obtaining theoretical regret bounds. Learning on graph-structured data, such as molecules or biological graph representations, requires designing sequential methods that can effectively exploit the structure of graphs. Consequently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have received attention as a rapidly expanding class of machine learning models. They deem remarkably well-suited for prediction tasks in applications such as designing novel materials [ref]20, drug discovery [ref]22, structure-based protein function prediction , etc. This rises the question of how to bridge the gap, and design bandit optimization algorithms on graph-structured data that can exploit the power of graph neural networks to approximate a graph reward. In this paper, we consider bandit optimization over graphs and propose to employ graph neural networks with one convolutional layer to estimate the unknown reward. To scale to large graph domains (both in the number of graphs and number of nodes), we propose practical structural assumptions to model the reward function. In particular, we propose to use permutation invariant additive kernels. We show a novel connection between such kernels and the graph neural tangent kernel (GNTK) that we define in Section 3. Our main result are GNN confidence bounds that can be readily used in sequential decision-making algorithms to achieve sublinear regret bounds (see Section 4.3). Related Work.\nOur work extends the rich toolbox of methods for kernelized bandits and Bayesian optimization (BO) that work under the norm bounded Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space assumption [ref]37   ).\nThe majority of these methods are designed for general Euclidean domains and rely on kernelized confidence sets to select which action to query next.\nThe exception is , that consider the spectral setting in which the reward function is a linear combination of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian and the bandit problem is defined over nodes of a single graph.\nIn contrast, our focus is on optimizing over graph domains (i.e., set of graphs), and constructing confidence sets that can quantify the uncertainty of graph neural networks estimates. This work contributes to the literature on neural bandits, in which a fully-connected   , or a single hidden layer convolutional network  is used to estimate the reward function. These works provide sublinear cumulative regret bounds in their respective settings, however, when applied directly to graph features (as we demonstrate in Section 4.3), these approaches do not scale well with the number of graph nodes. Due to its important applications in molecule design, sequential optimization on graphs has recently received considerable attention.\nFor example, in , the authors propose a kernel to capture similarities between graphs, and at every step, select the next graph through a kernelized random walk. Other works (e.g.,    ) encode graph representations to the (continuous) latent space of a variational autoencoder and perform BO in the latent space. While practically relevant for discovering novel molecules with optimized properties, these approaches lack theoretical guarantees and deem computationally demanding. A primary focus in our work is on embedding the natural structure of the data, i.e., permutation invariance, into the reward model.\nThis is inspired by the works of   that consider invariances in kernel-based supervised learning.\nConsequently, the graph neural tangent kernel plays an integral role in our theoretical analysis. Du et al.  provide a recursive expression\nfor the tangent kernel of a GNN, without showing that the obtained expression is the limiting tangent kernel as defined in Jacot et al.  (i.e., as in LABEL:{eq:gntk_def}). In contrast, we analyze the learning dynamics of the GNN and properties of the GNTK by exploiting the connection between the structure of a graph neural network and that of a neural network (in Section 3). We recover that the graph neural tangent kernel also encodes additivity. Additive models for bandit optimization have been previously studied in  and , however, these works only focus on Euclidean domains and standard base kernels. Finally, we build upon the recent literature on elimination-based algorithms that make use of maximum variance reduction sampling      .\nOne of our proposed algorithms, GNN-PE, employs a phased elimination strategy together with our GNN confidence sets. Main Contributions. We introduce a bandit problem over graphs and propose to capture prior knowledge by modeling the unknown reward function using a permutation invariant additive kernel.\nWe establish a key connection between such kernel assumptions and the graph neural tangent kernel (Proposition 3.2).\nBy exploiting this connection, we provide novel statistical confidence bounds for the graph neural network estimator (Theorem 4.2).\nWe further prove that a phased elimination algorithm that uses our GNN-confidence bounds (GNN-PE) achieves sublinear regret (Theorem 4.3).\nImportantly, our regret bound scales favorably with the number of graphs and is independent of the number of graph nodes (see Table 1).\nFinally, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms baselines across a range of problem instances.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: them is to exploit the correlations between the rewards of “similar” actions.
