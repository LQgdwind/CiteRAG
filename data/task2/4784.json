      "content": "Paper Title: On the Effectiveness of Hybrid Pooling in Mixup-Based Graph Learning for Language Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to its effectiveness in graph-structured data processing and the promising performance on graph-specific downstream tasks, e.g., graph classification, GNN has recently received considerable attention. Meanwhile, as a sophisticated data augmentation method, Mixup  was initially proposed and implemented within the domain of image classification . Due to its remarkable efficacy in classification tasks, it has subsequently been gradually applied to NLP  [ref]40 and source code learning [ref]10. In the NLP, Guo et al. [ref]40 proposed two basic strategies of Mixup for augmenting data. One was wording embedding-based, and another was sentence embedding-based. After these two different kinds of embedding, the feature of input data can be mixed to synthesize the new data in vector space. To solve the difficulty in mixing text data in the raw format, Sun et al. [ref]41 mixed text data from transformer-based pre-trained architecture. Chen et al.  increased the size of augmented samples by interpolating text data in hidden space. Zhang et al.  generated extra labeled sequences in each iteration to augment the scale of training data. Unlike previous work, some researchers considered the raw text itself to augment the input data. Yoon et al.  synthesized the new text data from two raw input data by span-based mixing to replace the hidden vectors. In source code learning, Dong et al. [ref]10 proposed a mixup-based data augmentation method that linearly interpolates the features of a pair of programs as well as their labels for the GNN model training. In our work, we do not simply employ Mixup for graph-structured data classification. Instead, we explore how different graph pooling operators affect the effectiveness of Mixup.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Mixup  was initially proposed and implemented within the domain of image classification .
