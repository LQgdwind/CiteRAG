      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Expert-Level Medical Question Answering with Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe advent of transformers [ref]5 and large language models (LLMs) [ref]6  has renewed interest in the possibilities of AI for medical question-answering tasks–a long-standing “grand challenge”   [ref]10. A majority of these approaches involve smaller language models trained using domain specific data (BioLinkBert , DRAGON , PubMedGPT , PubMedBERT , BioGPT ), resulting in a steady improvement in state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as MedQA (USMLE) , MedMCQA , and PubMedQA . However, with the rise of larger general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-3  and Flan-PaLM   trained on internet-scale corpora with massive compute, we have seen leapfrog improvements on such benchmarks, all in a span of a few months (Figure 1). In particular, GPT 3.5  reached an accuracy of 60.2% on the MedQA (USMLE) dataset, Flan-PaLM reached an accuracy of 67.6%, and GPT-4-base  achieved 86.1%. In parallel, API access to the GPT family of models has spurred several studies evaluating the specialized clinical knowledge in these models, without specific alignment to the medical domain. 2 evaluated the diagnostic and triage accuracies of GPT-3 for 48 validated case vignettes of both common and severe conditions and compared to lay-people and physicians. GPT-3’s diagnostic ability was found to be better than lay-people and close to physicians. On triage, the performance was less impressive and closer to lay-people. On a similar note, 3, 4, and 5 studied GPT-3 performance in genetics, surgery, and ophthalmology, respectively. More recently, Ayers et al. 6 compared ChatGPT and physician responses on 195 randomly drawn patient questions from a social media forum and found ChatGPT responses to be rated higher in both quality and empathy. With Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2, we take a “best of both worlds” approach: we harness the strong out-of-the-box potential of the latest general-purpose LLMs and then use publicly available medical question-answering data and physician-written responses to align the model to the safety-critical requirements of the medical domain. We introduce the ensemble refinement prompting strategy to improve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM. This approach is closely related to self-consistency 7, recitation-augmentation 8, self-refine 9, and dialogue enabled reasoning 0. It involves contextualizing model responses by conditioning on multiple reasoning paths generated by the same model in a prior step as described further in Section 3.3. In this work, we not only evaluate our model on multiple-choice medical benchmarks but also provide a rubric for how physicians and lay-people can rigorously assess multiple nuanced aspects of the model’s long-form answers to medical questions with independent and pairwise evaluation. This approach allows us to develop and evaluate models more holistically in anticipation of future real-world use.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: The advent of transformers [ref]5 and large language models (LLMs) [ref]6  has renewed interest in the possibilities of AI for medical question-answering tasks–a long-standing “grand challenge”   [ref]10.
