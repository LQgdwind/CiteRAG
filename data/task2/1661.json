A common choice uses an observational (conditional) distribution to occlude redundant features XS¯∉Ssubscript𝑋¯𝑆𝑆X_{\\bar{S}}\\notin S, i.e., One then identifies the first Shapley term S=𝒳\\{Xj}𝑆\\𝒳superscript𝑋𝑗S=\\mathcal{X}\\backslash\\left\\{X^{j}\\right\\} with the PredDiff relevance m¯Xj|xSfsubscriptsuperscript¯𝑚𝑓conditionalsuperscript𝑋𝑗subscript𝑥𝑆\\bar{m}^{f}_{X^{j}|x_{S}}. This reveals an intimate connection between both formalisms.\nHowever, there is an ongoing debate whether one should replace the observational by an interventional (marginal) distribution, see   . This would break the previous correspondence. In general, marginal distributions generate illegitimate, out-of-distributions samples, questioning the reliability of resulting attributions. Additionally, ignoring feature dependencies unavoidably leads to simple adversarial attack strategies  4. Turning to feature interactions, we consider the relation to the ’Shapley Interaction Index’ , which was proposed as an explicit measure for interactions based on game theory .\nInterestingly, we can map PredDiff’s shielded joint effect onto their central object, a discrete second order derivative, i.e., for S=𝒳\\Y​Z𝑆\\𝒳𝑌𝑍S=\\mathcal{X}\\backslash{YZ} and Y𝑌Y/Z𝑍Z restricted to a single feature each.\nIn the same setting, PredDiff’s shielded main effects, such as m¯Y\\Z|xfYsubscriptsuperscript¯𝑚superscript𝑓𝑌conditional\\𝑌𝑍𝑥\\bar{m}^{f^{Y}}_{Y\\backslash Z|x}, can be identified with the second Shapley term. This reiterates the close connection between both formalisms, which we expect to hold at higher orders as well.\nA different proposed interaction measure within the Shapley value formalism is the ’Shapely Taylor Interaction Index’ 7.\nIt is centered around a general discrete derivative formula, which allows incorporating arbitrary interaction orders.\nHere, we point out that these discrete derivatives are identical to the general decomposition underlying Eq. 5 up to a global sign, see Sec. G.1 for details.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Shapley values are a popular tool for local model-agnostic attribution [ref]35 6 based on game theory 2.\nIn general, Shapley values are given by The remaining ambiguity is to specify a connection between a model f𝑓f, an instance x𝑥x and the value function v​(S)𝑣𝑆v(S).
