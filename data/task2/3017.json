      "content": "Paper Title: Physics-informed neural networks for understanding shear migration of particles in viscous flow\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPhillips et al.  proposed an insightful phenomenological model for the shear-induced migration of particles in a low-Reynolds-number flow . Specifically, they posited that the distribution of particles, accounted for by the volume fraction ϕ​(𝒙,t)italic-ϕ𝒙𝑡\\phi(\\bm{x},t) of the fluid–particle suspension, obeys a conservation law  : In Eq. (1), the material derivative of the left-hand side represents the unsteady transport of particles by a flow 𝒖𝒖\\bm{u}, while 𝑱𝑱\\bm{J} on the right-hand side represents a spatial flux arising from the hydrodynamic interactions of particles. Consequently, Eq. (1) is often referred to as a diffusive-flux model in the literature. Phillips et al.  decomposed the flux as 𝑱=𝑵c+𝑵η+𝑵B𝑱subscript𝑵𝑐subscript𝑵𝜂subscript𝑵𝐵\\bm{J}=\\bm{N}_{c}+\\bm{N}_{\\eta}+\\bm{N}_{B}, where they posited that 𝑵csubscript𝑵𝑐\\bm{N}_{c}, 𝑵ηsubscript𝑵𝜂\\bm{N}_{\\eta} and 𝑵Bsubscript𝑵𝐵\\bm{N}_{B} represent the particle fluxes due to the variations in the particle collision frequency, the spatial variations of the viscosity of the suspension (due to the nonuniform particle distribution  ), and the spatial variations of the concentration (responsible for Brownian diffusion, by Fick’s law), respectively.\nFor unidirectional flows, D​ϕ/D​t=∂ϕ/∂t𝐷italic-ϕ𝐷𝑡italic-ϕ𝑡{D\\phi}/{Dt}={\\partial\\phi}/{\\partial t} . Specifically, Phillips et al.  proposed the following “constitutive laws” for the diffusive fluxes: where Kcsubscript𝐾𝑐K_{c} and Kηsubscript𝐾𝜂K_{\\eta} are a priori unknown constants of order unity, which are found from experimental data (by fitting/calibration). Therefore, Eq. (1), with the fluxes given in Eqs. (2), becomes a parameterized partial differential equation (PDE).\nHere, apsubscript𝑎𝑝a_{p} is a particle’s radius, D𝐷D is its Brownian diffusivity (in principle, known from the Stokes–Einstein relation D=kB​T/6​π​ηs​ap𝐷subscript𝑘𝐵𝑇6𝜋subscript𝜂𝑠subscript𝑎𝑝D=k_{B}T/{6\\pi\\eta_{s}a_{p}} with T𝑇T being temperature and kBsubscript𝑘𝐵k_{B} being Boltzmann’s constant), η𝜂\\eta is the non-constant dynamic viscosity of the suspension, which may depend on many parameters 9, ηssubscript𝜂𝑠\\eta_{s} is the carrier Newtonian fluid’s viscosity, and γ˙​(𝒙,t)˙𝛾𝒙𝑡\\dot{\\gamma}(\\bm{x},t) is the non-uniform shear rate in the flow. For a general flow field 𝒖=𝒖​(𝒙,t)𝒖𝒖𝒙𝑡\\bm{u}=\\bm{u}(\\bm{x},t), the shear rate is evaluated as the magnitude of the rate-of-strain tensor 𝑬=12​(∇𝒖+∇𝒖⊤)𝑬12bold-∇𝒖bold-∇superscript𝒖top\\bm{E}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\bm{\\nabla}\\bm{u}+\\bm{\\nabla}\\bm{u}^{\\top}), i.e., γ˙=2​𝑬:𝑬˙𝛾:2𝑬𝑬\\dot{\\gamma}=\\sqrt{2\\bm{E}:\\bm{E}}. At steady state, ∂(⋅)/∂t=0⋅𝑡0\\partial(\\,\\cdot\\,)/\\partial t=0. Then, Eq. (1) can be integrated once in space over some domain 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V}, with the constant of integration set to zero by imposing a no-flux condition on the domain’s boundary ∂𝒱𝒱\\partial\\mathcal{V}. Therefore, the resulting governing physics equation at steady-state is which is a transport equation expressing the conservation of particles. Equation (3) also implies that if the initial particle volume fraction is such that ∫𝒜ϕ​(𝒙,0)​𝑑𝒙=ϕb=c​o​n​s​t.subscript𝒜italic-ϕ𝒙0differential-d𝒙subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑏𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡\\int_{\\mathcal{A}}\\phi(\\bm{x},0)\\,d\\bm{x}=\\phi_{b}=const. across any cross-section 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, then ∫𝒜ϕ​(𝒙,t)​𝑑𝒙=ϕbsubscript𝒜italic-ϕ𝒙𝑡differential-d𝒙subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑏\\int_{\\mathcal{A}}\\phi(\\bm{x},t)\\,d\\bm{x}=\\phi_{b} for any t>0𝑡0t>0. Additionally, the flow field 𝒖𝒖\\bm{u} obeys the low-Reynolds-number (inertialess) flow momentum equation , which takes the form (using a more standard  sign convention and definition of 𝑬𝑬\\bm{E} as above): where ηrsubscript𝜂𝑟\\eta_{r} (dimensionless) is the contribution from the suspension to be introduced below, and p​(𝒙)𝑝𝒙p(\\bm{x}) is the hydrodynamic pressure. We will consider only neutrally buoyant suspensions, and so body forces are neglected in Eq. (4). The velocity field is additionally incompressible, ∇⋅𝒖=0bold-⋅bold-∇𝒖0\\bm{\\nabla}\\bm{\\cdot}\\bm{u}=0, but this relation is automatically satisfied by the unidirectional flows considered herein , so it is not a physical constraint that we need to enforce explicitly. The fluid mechanics of particulate suspensions remains a frontier problem , and the diffusive-flux model of Phillips et al.  is not without its criticisms . Nevertheless, although much more sophisticated models of suspensions exist  , including the suspension balance model     [ref]29 , the two-fluid model  , even direct numerical simulation , Eqs. (1)–(2) remain a popular model through which to study shear-induced particle migration in suspensions   . “Disentagling” the individual effects of shear-induced fluxes in Eq. (3) has been of particular interest in the suspensions literature . (Note that although Merhi et al.  also included a fourth, “curvature-induced” flux in Eq. (3), its origin has been disputed by Bricker and Butler .) Machine learning is a viable approach toward processing experimental data to disentangle the relative strengths of the fluxes in Eq. (3). To this end, in Section 2, we apply the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach of Raissi et al. 6 towards understanding particle migration in shear flow. Specifically, we propose to constrain the neural network using the model given by Eqs. (3) and (4). In Section 3, we validate this approach on the classical Couette cell experiments (and modeling) of Phillips et al. . Then, in Section 4, we apply the PINN approach to the more challenging case of Poiseuille channel flow. In doing so, we re-interpret experiments on pressure-driven flows of both non-Brownian (Section 4.2) and Brownian (Section 4.3) suspensions, uncovering new aspects of the shear-induced migration model. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5. Additional data preprocessing and verification details (regarding the PINN calculations) are provided in Appendices A and B, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: the diffusive-flux model of Phillips et al.  is not without its criticisms .
