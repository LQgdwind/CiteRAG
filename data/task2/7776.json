Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Top element:\nTarski‚Äôs relational algebra¬†[ref]40 contains the addition,\nmulitiplication, and identity operation of KA;\nin addition, relational algebra also include a top element.\nHence attempts to incorporat Kleene star into relational algebra\neffectively create a super theory of TopKAT.\nUnfortuantly, several attempts at these algebras turn out to be undecidable\nbecause of the presence of intersection and\nconverse operations¬† 2.\nWith the intersection and converse operators removed,\ntop element is proven to be individually useful in Kleene algebra:\nfor example, Mamouras¬† uses the top element to forget program states,\nand Antonopoulos et al.¬†\nuses top to design forward simulation rules for relational verification,\nand claim that relational incorrectness logic¬†9\ncan be encoded using BiKAT extended with top.\nThe completeness and decidability of TopKAT was first studied by Zhang et al.¬†[ref]41,\nand concluded that TopKAT is not complete with relational models.\nLater, Pous et al.¬†4 5 showed that\nboth TopKA and TopKAT is complete with relational model with one additional axiom: p‚ä§p‚â•ptopùëùùëùùëùp\\top p\\geq p,\nand the theory remains PSPACE-complete, like KAT and TopKAT.\nIn this paper, we showed that TopKAT without the additional axiom is complete\nfor a specific form of inequalities, namely when top only appears in the front or the end of the term.\nAlthough this form of inequalities seem restrictive,\nthey are enough to encode both Hoare and incorrectness logic¬†[ref]41. Domain in KAT:\nThe study of axiomatizing (co)domain in KAT has a long and rich history.\nDomain semiring¬†0\nand Kleene algebra with domain¬†\nwere two popular yet different axiomatizations of (co)domain in Kleene algebra with tests.\nThese two axiomitizations turn out to coincide in a large class of semirings¬†2.\nVarious applications for domain in KAT have been discovered, including modeling\nprogram correctness, predicate transformers, temporal logics,\ntermination analysis, and many more¬†.\nMany of these applications can even be efficiently automated¬†5.\nHowever, although the free relational model of these theories has been characterized¬†8,\nthe search for general complete interpretation remains unfruitful.\nThe complexity of these theories was recently shown to be EXPTIME-complete¬†7,\na worse complexity class than PSPACE-complete for TopKAT.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: our new perspective on reduction could potentially lead to streamlining of various previous proofs,\nand more general proofs of completeness results.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
