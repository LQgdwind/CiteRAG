      "content": "Paper Title: A unified framework for dataset shift diagnostics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn machine learning applications, it is conventionally assumed that training data originates from the distribution of interest. We say a dataset shift has happened when that assumption does not hold. Formally, we have dataset shift when the joint distribution of features (𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}) and labels (Y𝑌Y) associated with the training sample, also known as the source distribution, P𝐗,Y(1)subscriptsuperscript𝑃1𝐗𝑌P^{(1)}_{\\mathbf{X},Y}, and the distribution of interest, also known as the target distribution, P𝐗,Y(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃2𝐗𝑌P^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X},Y}, are different. Real-world applications, spanning fields like finance , health , technology [ref]23, and physics , often grapple with the challenges posed by dataset shifts. Unfortunately, dataset shift may substantially decrease the predictive power of machine learning models if it is not adequately addressed . When labeled data from the target distribution is scarce, addressing dataset shifts typically necessitates assumptions about the relationship between the source and target distributions. Different assumptions are translated into different types of shift , and every kind of shift demands specific adaptation methods [ref]36  . For instance, if P𝐗(1)≠P𝐗(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃1𝐗subscriptsuperscript𝑃2𝐗P^{(1)}_{\\mathbf{X}}\\neq P^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X}} but PY|𝐗(1)=PY|𝐗(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃1conditional𝑌𝐗subscriptsuperscript𝑃2conditional𝑌𝐗P^{(1)}_{Y|\\mathbf{X}}=P^{(2)}_{Y|\\mathbf{X}}, dataset shift adaptation can be performed by using importance weighting on the training data   .\nSimilarly, if PY(1)≠PY(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃1𝑌subscriptsuperscript𝑃2𝑌P^{(1)}_{Y}\\neq P^{(2)}_{Y} but P𝐗|Y(1)=P𝐗|Y(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃1conditional𝐗𝑌subscriptsuperscript𝑃2conditional𝐗𝑌P^{(1)}_{\\mathbf{X}|Y}=P^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X}|Y}, dataset shift adaptation can be performed by importance weighting  or re-calibrating posterior probabilities via Bayes’ theorem [ref]36 [ref]45. Therefore, to successfully adapt prediction algorithms in a dataset shift setting, practitioners need to know not only if dataset shift occurs but also which type of shift happens for the data at hand. This study introduces DetectShift, a novel unified framework capable of accurately quantifying and testing for diverse types of dataset shifts. This framework provides valuable insights to practitioners on optimally handling changes in the data, particularly in scenarios where labeled samples from the target domain are scarce. By using our framework, practitioners can detect specific types of shifts. Consequently, they can use that information to use both source and target data to retrain or adapt their predictors, which is especially appealing in situations where naive model retraining using only data points from P𝐗,Y(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃2𝐗𝑌P^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X},Y} is not feasible333See [ref]36    for some examples on how to retrain or adapt predictors using not only target samples. . In Section 4, we show in practice one example of how the insights provided by DetectShift can help practitioners in a prediction task in which target-labeled samples are not used to retrain the classifier. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Firstly, in Section 2, we provide an overview of recent works relevant to our research, highlighting our contributions to the existing literature. Moving on to Section 3, we present our framework called DetectShift, explaining its conceptual basis and rationale. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various scenarios, we apply DetectShift to both artificial and real data in Section 4. Finally, in the concluding sections, we thoroughly discuss our findings, contributions, limitations, and potential avenues for further exploration.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: of interest, also known as the target distribution, P𝐗,Y(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃2𝐗𝑌P^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X},Y}, are different.
