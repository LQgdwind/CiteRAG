      "content": "Paper Title: Policy Gradient for Rectangular Robust Markov Decision Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough some previous works use gradient methods to learn robust policies, they seek empirical robustness to adversarial behavior rather than robust MDP solutions  [ref]29 . In that sense, our study differs from adversarial RL as we explicitly optimize the max-min objective to find a robust optimal policy. Accordingly, the risk-averse approach focuses on the internal uncertainty due to the stochasticity of the system, whereas robust RL addresses the external uncertainty of the system’s dynamics. As a result, common risk-averse objectives can be reformulated as robust problems with specific uncertainty sets . Previous studies that did aim to derive robust policy-based methods are  2 0. These are summarized in Table 1, which also displays the complexity of existing approaches.  established RPG for s𝑠s-rectangular reward-robust MDPs, i.e., robust MDPs with uncertain reward but given kernel. Although it applies to general norms, their result does not account for transition perturbation. Differently, in 2, the authors introduced RPG for r𝑟r-contaminated MDPs, i.e., robust MDPs with uncertainty set 𝒰:={R0}×[(1−r)​P0+r​Δ𝒮𝒮×𝒜]assign𝒰subscript𝑅0delimited-[]1𝑟subscript𝑃0𝑟superscriptsubscriptΔ𝒮𝒮𝒜\\mathcal{U}:=\\{R_{0}\\}\\times[(1-r)P_{0}+r\\Delta_{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{S}}}^{\\operatorname{\\mathcal{S}}\\times\\operatorname{\\mathcal{A}}}]. Although it has similar complexity as non-robust PG, by construction, their setting is limited to (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a)-rectangularity with known reward and mixed transition. As such, the proof techniques in 2 are tailor-made to the r𝑟r-contamination framework and do not apply to more general robust MDPs. In fact, we remark that the r𝑟r-contamination setting is equivalent to the action robustness approach introduced in [ref]29, which emphasizes its limitation to action perturbation. Differently, our RPG holds whenever the worst kernel is a rank-one perturbation of the nominal transition function (see Lemma 4.4). The work [ref]16 provides a convergence proof of robust policy mirror-descent in the (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a)-rectangular case, whereas we study robust policy optimization for s𝑠s-rectangular uncertainty sets. In fact, its restriction to the (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a)-case prevents us from transposing the analysis to our setting. This is due to the fact that the standard robust Bellman operator on Q𝑄Q-functions can no longer be applied on s𝑠s-rectangular sets.\nTo address generic robust MDPs, 0 recently introduced RPG for general uncertainty sets. Their gradient update has a complexity of O​(S6​A4​ϵ−4)𝑂superscript𝑆6superscript𝐴4superscriptitalic-ϵ4O(S^{6}A^{4}\\epsilon^{-4}), which is more expensive than non-robust PG by a factor of S4​A3​ϵ−4superscript𝑆4superscript𝐴3superscriptitalic-ϵ4S^{4}A^{3}\\epsilon^{-4}. Both works [ref]16 0 additionally assume access to an oracle gradient of the robust return with respect to the transition model. Avoiding this oracle assumption naturally leads to even higher time complexity in 0 which is not scalable. At the same time, the two works [ref]16 0 guarantee global convergence of projected robust gradient iterates, thus establishing the potential promise of RPG. In fact, equipped with RPG convergence, the remaining challenge in making it practical is to efficiently estimate the gradient. This represents the main focus of our study: We aim to explicit an RPG method that generalizes existing results on specific uncertainty sets  2 while holding for s𝑠s-rectangular robust MDPs.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Although some previous works use gradient methods to learn robust policies, they seek empirical robustness to adversarial behavior rather than robust MDP solutions  [ref]29 .
