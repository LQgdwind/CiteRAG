      "content": "Paper Title: Anti-Backdoor Learning: Training Clean Models on Poisoned Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAttack Configurations. We consider 10 backdoor attacks in our experiments, including four dirty-label attacks: BadNets , Trojan attack [ref]23, Blend attack 1, Dynamic attack 8, two clean-label attacks: Sinusoidal signal attack(SIG)  and Clean-label attack(CL) , and four feature-space attacks: Feature collision (FC) , Deep Feature Space Trojan Attack (DFST) , Latent Backdoor Attack (LBA) , and Composite Backdoor Attack (CBA) . We follow the settings suggested by 0 and the open-sourced code corresponding to their original papers to configure these attack algorithms. All attacks are evaluated on three benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 , GTSRB  and an ImageNet subset , with two classical model structures including WideResNet (WRN-16-1)  and ResNet-34 . No data augmentations are used for these attacks since they hinder the backdoor effect 2. To keep their original configurations of dataset and parameter settings, here we only run the four feature-space attacks on CIFAR-10 dataset. We also omit some attacks on GTSRB and ImageNet datasets due to a failure of reproduction following their original papers. The detailed settings of the 10 backdoor attacks are summarized in Table 5 (see Appendix A.2). Defense and Training Details. We compare our ABL with three state-of-the-art defense methods: Fine-pruning (FP) , Mode Connectivity Repair (MCR) , and Neural Attention Distillation (NAD) 0. For FP, MCR and NAD, we follow the configurations specified in their original papers, including the available clean data for finetuning/repair/distillation and training settings. The comparison with other data isolation methods are shown in Section 4.3. For our ABL, we set T=100𝑇100T=100, Tt​e=20subscript𝑇𝑡𝑒20T_{te}=20, γ=0.5𝛾0.5\\gamma=0.5 and an isolation rate p=0.01𝑝0.01p=0.01 (1%) in all experiments. The exploration of different Tt​esubscript𝑇𝑡𝑒T_{te}, γ𝛾\\gamma, and isolation rates p𝑝p are also provided in Section 4.1. Three data augmentation techniques suggested in 0 including random crop (padding = 4), horizontal flipping, and cutout, are applied for all defense methods. More details on defense settings can be found in Appendix A.3. Evaluation Metrics. We adopt two commonly used performance metrics: Attack Success Rate (ASR), which is the classification accuracy on the backdoor test set, and Clean Accuracy (CA), the classification accuracy on clean test set.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Attack Configurations. We consider 10 backdoor attacks in our experiments, including four dirty-label attacks: BadNets , Trojan attack [ref]23, Blend attack 1, Dynamic attack 8, two clean-label attacks: Sinusoidal signal attack(SIG)  and Clean-label attack(CL) , and four feature-space attacks: Feature collision (FC) , Deep Feature\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
