The complexity of the DNN models continues to grow along with its computational cost and memory requirements, making it difficult to support them on conventional computer systems. Accelerators adopting a systolic array architecture such as TPU  from Google, have proven to be efficient hardware implementations to perform DNN inference   . The systolic array architecture  , which was designed for massive parallelization and data reuse, is especially effective for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) since the weights of a layer are shared across a large number of sliding windows and can be reused multiple times. In addition, there has been a plethora of recent proposals to further optimize CNN inference [ref]9  [ref]11. However, CNNs are just a subset of DNNs with very specific characteristics. Therefore, techniques targeting CNNs do not necessarily achieve similar benefits for other DNN architectures. Our proposal is motivated by the fact that state-of-the-art models for sequence-to-sequence problems are either Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [ref]1  or very deep Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) such as the Transformer , which are both composed of fully-connected (FC) layers. FC layers exhibit different characteristics with respect to CNNs: weights are not reused by different neurons and the compute to memory access ratio is significantly smaller, i.e., FC layers are more memory intensive. FC layer computation mainly consists of dot products between a vector of inputs and a matrix of weights. The inputs are generated dynamically while the weights are static and learned during the training phase. Current DNN model sizes are in the hundreds of megabytes (MB) and require billions of floating-point (FP) computations to perform inference. Linear quantization   is a highly popular technique used to compress the weights of the model and reduce the complexity of the computations. Quantization maps a continuous set of values to a discrete set, which as a side effect favors the appearance of repeated weights. Our work is based on the observation that, on average, more than 80% of the inputs among different FC layers of a set of DNNs are multiplied by less than 646464 unique weights. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution of unique weights per input of DeepSpeech2 (DS2) , GNMT [ref]1, Transformer , Kaldi  and PTBLM , which are popular models for speech recognition, machine translation, and language modeling. The average number of unique weights per input is 444444 when applying an 8-bit quantization, and can never be higher than 256. In this paper, we show how to efficiently exploit the spatial locality of repeated weights on FC layers. We first propose a mechanism (CREW) that dynamically computes and stores the partial products of each input by their associated unique weights in a given layer. This first step removes redundant multiplications due to repeated weights and their associated memory reads. Similar to sparse architectures    and their pruning mechanisms  , the weight repetition patterns are irregular, making it very challenging to achieve net benefits due to the sparse accesses and extra metadata that are required. The partial products stored by this mechanism have to be indexed similar to sparse algorithms. Since the unique weights are known statically, the indexation table can be generated offline. The second step of our mechanism produces the final outputs of a FC layer by accessing the partial products with the associated indices and adding all the required values for each output. The main advantage of our mechanism is that the size of the indices depends on the number of unique weights of each input. As previously described, the number of unique weights is typically lower than 646464 so indices will be typically smaller than 777 bits. In consequence, the final size of the model can be further compressed and the memory bandwidth is further reduced. Figure 2 shows an example of a small FC layer computing the standard dot product (Figure 2a) and our CREW mechanism (Figure 2b), saving 33% of multiplications and 20% of storage. Then, we present CREW, a novel accelerator that implements the above computation reuse and efficient weight storage scheme for FC layers. CREW is implemented on top of a TPU-like architecture, but it includes an enhanced weight stationary dataflow. The extra hardware required for our technique is modest since most of the components are already available in the baseline TPU-like architecture. CREW only requires small local buffers to store blocks of indices and some shared buffers to store partial results. The extra memory represents a small increase in the on-chip storage of the accelerator. Our experimental results show that the overheads are minimal compared to the savings in memory fetches and multiplications. Although our scheme has some similarity with UCNN , a recently proposed mechanism for computation reuse in CNNs, our work is different in several manners. First, we observe the low number of unique weights per input neuron of different FC layers instead of per output neuron. Second, we exploit this observation to reduce the size of the indexation. UCNN focuses on convolutional layers and shows modest speedups for FC layers compared to CREW. Our scheme not only avoids most of the multiplications, it also provides a significant reduction in storage and memory accesses due to the smaller indexes compared to the original weights. To summarize, this paper focuses on energy-efficient FC layer inference. The main contributions are: We analyze the unique weights per input in FC layers for several state-of-the-art MLPs and RNNs, including a Transformer. We observe that, on average, each input is multiplied by 444444 unique weights. We propose a novel computation reuse mechanism to exploit weight repetition on FC layers. This technique reduces the number of multiplications and memory accesses by 98% and 40% respectively on average. Furthermore, it replaces weights by indices in the buffer of partial results, resulting in 25% reduction of the model size. We present CREW, a hardware accelerator that implements our computation reuse scheme. CREW improves performance by 2.61​x2.61𝑥2.61x and reduces energy consumption by 2.42​x2.42𝑥2.42x on average over a TPU-like accelerator. Compared to UCNN , CREW achieves 2.10​x2.10𝑥2.10x speedup and 2.08​x2.08𝑥2.08x energy savings on average. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background information on modern DNNs. Section III reviews prior computation reuse mechanisms and motives our own proposal by presenting the analysis of unique weights per input. Section IV describes in detail our reuse scheme. Section V describes the hardware implementation of our computation reuse and model compression scheme. Section VI presents the evaluation methodology and Section VII discusses the experimental results. Section VIII reviews some related work and, finally, Section IX sums up the main conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) represent the state-of-the-art solution to a broad range of applications such as machine translation [ref]1 and speech recognition .
