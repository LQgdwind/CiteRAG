      "content": "Paper Title: SimCLF: A Simple Contrastive Learning Framework for Function-level Binary Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral articles have pointed out that project head can improve the performance of the model before it [ref]7[ref]5[ref]17. The influences of including a projection head g‚Äã(h)ùëî‚Ñég(h) are studied in this section. g‚Äã(h)ùëî‚Ñég(h) maps representations to the space where the contrastive loss is applied after the training process. However, after the finetuning phase, the projection head g‚Äã(h)ùëî‚Ñég(h) is discarded and not used further. Figure 7 shows the difference between the model with and without the projection head. The embedding zùëßz is used as the representation for downstream tasks. Numerous scholarly articles [ref]7 [ref]5 [ref]17 have employed the contrastive learning model as a prominent approach. While the function of the projection head, denoted as g‚Äã(h)ùëî‚Ñég(h), has been widely acknowledged and demonstrated in various studies, such as SimCLR [ref]5, the precise reasons for its effectiveness remain subjects of ongoing debate. However, it is noteworthy that in SimCLF, incorporating the projection head did not yield desirable outcomes. Figure 8 shows that the model‚Äôs AUC score increases slightly (on average 3%) when the model is trained with projection head g‚Äã(h)ùëî‚Ñég(h) compared to the model without fine-tuning. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the AUC score of the model with the projection head remains considerably lower than that of the model without the projection head. A conjecture put forward by SimCLR [ref]5 suggests that the significance of utilizing the representation prior to the nonlinear projection lies in mitigating the loss of information induced by the contrastive model. Additionally, another plausible explanation is that [ref]5 incorporates a vast amount of data, wherein some information may be compromised when employing the contrastive model with the projection head. However, in our experiments the amount of data is relatively small (tens of thousands). In the process of fine-tuning, the BERT-based encoder is used. Compared to ResNet-50 [ref]5, BERT has a better encoding capability. The information lost due to contrastive learning is relatively small and could therefore be ignored.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Several articles have pointed out that project head can improve the performance of the model before it [ref]7[ref]5[ref]17.
