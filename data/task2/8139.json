      "content": "Paper Title: New Lower Bound and Algorithms for Online Geometric Hitting Set Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe hitting set problem is one of the most fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization.\nLet Σ=(𝒫,𝒮)Σ𝒫𝒮\\Sigma=({\\mathcal{P}},\\cal S) be a range space, where 𝒫𝒫\\cal P is a set of elements and 𝒮𝒮\\cal S is a collection of subsets of 𝒫𝒫{\\mathcal{P}} known as ranges. A subset ℋ⊆𝒫ℋ𝒫\\cal H\\subseteq\\cal P is called a hitting set of the range space Σ=(𝒫,𝒮)Σ𝒫𝒮\\Sigma=({\\mathcal{P}},\\cal S) if the set ℋℋ\\cal H intersects every range s𝑠s in 𝒮𝒮\\cal S.\nThe objective of the hitting set problem is to find a hitting set with the minimum cardinality.\nThis problem is one of Karp’s 21 classic NP-hard problems , and the best approximation factor achievable in polynomial time is Θ​(log⁡|𝒫|)Θ𝒫\\Theta(\\log|{\\mathcal{P}}|) assuming P≠NPPNP\\text{P}\\neq\\text{NP}  . Due to several applications in VLSI design, database management, resource allocation, facility location and wireless networks, researchers have considered the hitting set problem in geometric setup (also known as geometric hitting set problem), where the set 𝒫𝒫\\cal P is a collection of points from ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, and the set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S is a finite family of geometric objects chosen from some infinite class (hypercubes, balls, etc.) [ref]1   .\nBy a slight misuse of the notation, we will use 𝒮𝒮\\cal S to signify both the set of ranges as well as the set of objects that define these ranges.\nThe hitting set problem remains NP-hard, even for simple objects like unit disks and unit squares . A PTAS is known when the geometric objects are half-spaces in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, and when objects are r𝑟r-admissible regions in a plane (this includes pseudo-disks) . Alon et al.  initiated the study of the online hitting set problem in a setup where the whole range space Σ=(𝒫,𝒮)Σ𝒫𝒮\\Sigma=({\\mathcal{P}},{\\cal S}) is known in advance, but the order of arrival of the elements of 𝒮𝒮{\\cal S} is not known a priori. In this setup, they proposed a deterministic O​(log⁡|𝒫|​log⁡|𝒮|)𝑂𝒫𝒮O(\\log|{\\mathcal{P}}|\\log|\\cal S|) competitive algorithm and obtained a lower bound of Ω​(log⁡|𝒫|​log⁡|𝒮|log⁡log⁡|𝒫|+log⁡log⁡|𝒮|)Ω𝒫𝒮𝒫𝒮\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\log|{\\mathcal{P}}|\\log|\\cal S|}{\\log\\log|{\\mathcal{P}}|+\\log\\log|\\cal S|}\\right).\nIn the same setup, Even and Smorodinsky  studied the problem for various geometric range spaces and achieved an optimal competitive ratio of Θ​(log⁡|𝒫|)Θ𝒫\\Theta(\\log|{\\mathcal{P}}|) when objects are intervals, half-planes, and unit disks, and the set 𝒫𝒫{\\mathcal{P}} is a finite subset of points in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to obtain a similar result if we don’t know the set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S in advance, and we answer affirmatively when 𝒮𝒮\\cal S is similarly sized homothetic copies of any regular k𝑘k-gon. Motivated by various applications, De and Singh  considered the online hitting set problem, where 𝒫=ℤd𝒫superscriptℤ𝑑{\\cal P}={\\mathbb{Z}}^{d} and 𝒮𝒮\\cal S consists of unit balls or hypercubes in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. For unit hypercubes, they proved that every deterministic algorithm has a competitive ratio of at least d+1𝑑1d+1; whereas they propose a randomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio of O​(d2)𝑂superscript𝑑2O(d^{2}) for d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3. For unit balls in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, they proposed a deterministic algorithm having a competitive ratio of O​(d4)𝑂superscript𝑑4O(d^{4}). Khan et al.  studied the problem, where, for a given M∈ℝ+𝑀superscriptℝM\\in\\mathbb{R}^{+}, 𝒫𝒫{\\mathcal{P}} is a finite subset of [0,M)2∩ℤ2superscript0𝑀2superscriptℤ2[0,M)^{2}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{2} and the set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S consists of axis-aligned integer squares s⊆[0,M)2𝑠superscript0𝑀2s\\subseteq[0,M)^{2} in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}. Here, an integer square is a square whose all corners have integral coordinates. They obtained an O​(log⁡M)𝑂𝑀O(\\log M) competitive algorithm for this variant. This result is tight since the lower bound is Ω​(log⁡M)Ω𝑀\\Omega(\\log M) which even holds for intervals . Observe that, since the integer squares are from [0,M)2superscript0𝑀2[0,M)^{2}, the side length of the squares is in the range [1,M]1𝑀[1,M].\nIn the same setup, no result is known when the squares are not integer. In fact, the authors  posed this as an open problem. Motivated by this, in this paper, we have considered a more general range space where 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P} is a finite subset of ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}\nand the set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S consists of squares (not necessarily integer squares) of side length in the range [1,M]1𝑀[1,M]. When 𝒫=(0,M)d∩ℤd𝒫superscript0𝑀𝑑superscriptℤ𝑑{\\mathcal{P}}=(0,M)^{d}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{d} and 𝒮𝒮{\\cal S} is a family of α𝛼\\alpha-fat objects111Definition of fat object is given in Section 2. Note that this definition is slightly different than . If α^^𝛼\\hat{\\alpha} and α𝛼\\alpha are the fatness of an object according to the definition of  and ours, respectively, then α^≤1α^𝛼1𝛼\\hat{\\alpha}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\alpha}. in (0,M)dsuperscript0𝑀𝑑(0,M)^{d}, very recently, Alefkhani et al.  proposed a deterministic online algorithm with a competitive ratio of (4α+1)2​d​log⁡Msuperscript4𝛼12𝑑𝑀(\\frac{4}{\\alpha}+1)^{2d}\\log M. They proved that every deterministic algorithm has a competitive ratio of Ω​(log⁡M)Ω𝑀\\Omega(\\log M) for this problem. They  noted the vast gap between the lower and the upper bounds, and proposed to bridge this gap as an open problem. In this paper, we propose an exponential factor improvement in the upper bound and give an improved randomized lower bound.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the set 𝒫𝒫\\cal P is a collection of points from ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, and the set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S is a finite family of geometric objects chosen from some infinite class (hypercubes, balls, etc.) [ref]1   .\nBy a slight misuse of the notation, we will use 𝒮𝒮\\cal S to signify both the set of ranges as well as the set of objects that define these ranges.\nThe hitting set problem remains NP-hard,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
