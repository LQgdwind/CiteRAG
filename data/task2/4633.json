To compute the desirability of each alternative a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A, UTADIS  considers an  Additive Value Function (AVF) : where ujsubscript𝑢𝑗u_{j}, j=1,…,m𝑗1…𝑚j=1,\\ldots,m, are Marginal Value Functions being piece-wise linear monotonic and defined by a pre-defined number γjsubscript𝛾𝑗\\gamma_{j} of equally distributed characteristic points βj1,βj2,…,βγjsubscriptsuperscript𝛽1𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝛽2𝑗…superscript𝛽subscript𝛾𝑗\\beta^{1}_{j},\\beta^{2}_{j},\\ldots,\\beta^{\\gamma_{j}}, such that: A comprehensive value is normalized in the   [ref]1 range by assuming that uj​(βj1)=0subscript𝑢𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝛽1𝑗0u_{j}(\\beta^{1}_{j})=0, for j=1,…,m𝑗1…𝑚j=1,\\ldots,m, and ∑j=1,…,muj​(βjγj)=1subscript𝑗1…𝑚subscript𝑢𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝛽subscript𝛾𝑗𝑗1\\sum_{j=1,\\ldots,m}u_{j}(\\beta^{\\gamma_{j}}_{j})=1. To enable control over the difference between marginal values assigned to the subsequent characteristic points, we consider ρj​(s−1,s),j=1,…,m,s=2,…,γjformulae-sequencesubscript𝜌𝑗𝑠1𝑠𝑗1…𝑚𝑠2…subscript𝛾𝑗\\rho_{j}(s-1,s),j=1,\\ldots,m,s=2,\\ldots,\\gamma_{j}, and ρ𝜌\\rho variables defined as follows: In the basic setting, ρ𝜌\\rho is fixed to zero, which implies fulfilment of the weak monotonicity constraints. The marginal value for performance xjk∈[βjs,βjs+1]subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑘𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝛽𝑠𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝛽𝑠1𝑗x^{k}_{j}\\in[\\beta^{s}_{j},\\beta^{s+1}_{j}] can be computed using a linear interpolation: UTADIS incorporates a threshold-based sorting procedure, where each class Clsubscript𝐶𝑙C_{l} is delimited by the lower tl−1subscript𝑡𝑙1t_{l-1} and upper tlsubscript𝑡𝑙t_{l} thresholds defined on a scale of a comprehensive value U𝑈U. For simplicity, we do not consider the lower threshold of the least preferred class C1subscript𝐶1C_{1} and the upper threshold of the most preferred class Cpsubscript𝐶𝑝C_{p}, which could be arbitrarily fixed to t0=0subscript𝑡00t_{0}=0 and tp>1subscript𝑡𝑝1t_{p}>1. Hence, to derive the assignment for alternative a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A, U​(a)𝑈𝑎U(a) is compared with a vector of p−1𝑝1p-1 thresholds t=[t1,…,tl−1,tl,…,tp−1]𝑡subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑙1subscript𝑡𝑙…subscript𝑡𝑝1t=[t_{1},\\ldots,t_{l-1},t_{l},\\ldots,t_{p-1}] such that t1≥εsubscript𝑡1𝜀t_{1}\\geq\\varepsilon, tl−tl−1≥εsubscript𝑡𝑙subscript𝑡𝑙1𝜀t_{l}-t_{l-1}\\geq\\varepsilon, for l=2,…,p−1𝑙2…𝑝1l=2,\\ldots,p-1, and 1−tp−1≥ε1subscript𝑡𝑝1𝜀1-t_{p-1}\\geq\\varepsilon, where ε𝜀\\varepsilon is an arbitrarily small positive value. In UTADIS, the parameters of an assumed sorting model are inferred from the DM’s indirect preference information. It consists of the desired class assignments for reference alternatives in ARsuperscript𝐴𝑅A^{R}: The assignment examples are reproduced via preference disaggregation that ensures a comprehensive value of each reference alternative a∗∈ARsuperscript𝑎superscript𝐴𝑅a^{*}\\in A^{R} is within the range [tl−1,tl)subscript𝑡𝑙1subscript𝑡𝑙[t_{l-1},t_{l}) delimited by the lower and upper thresholds corresponding to its desired class Clsubscript𝐶𝑙C_{l}, i.e.: Variable δ𝛿\\delta allows for controlling the distances of alternatives’ comprehensive values from the class limits. In the basic setting, it is set to zero. Overall, a set 𝒰Rsuperscript𝒰𝑅\\mathcal{U}^{R} of compatible AVFs and class thresholds is defined by the following set EARsuperscript𝐸superscript𝐴𝑅E^{A^{R}} of linear constraints: where ρ𝜌\\rho and δ𝛿\\delta are equal to zero, and ε𝜀\\varepsilon is a small positive constant. Please note that constraints ensuring monotonicity of the thresholds (tl−tl−1≥εsubscript𝑡𝑙subscript𝑡𝑙1𝜀t_{l}-t_{l-1}\\geq\\varepsilon) are redundant when the DM assigns at least one alternative to each class. Since the DM’s preference information is incomplete, when EARsuperscript𝐸superscript𝐴𝑅E^{A^{R}} is feasible, 𝒰Rsuperscript𝒰𝑅\\mathcal{U}^{R} consists of infinitely many sorting models. To choose one of them, one needs to optimize an objective function. In Section 3, we discuss sixteen procedures that differ mainly with respect to considering different objectives and/or incorporating additional variables and constraints. In what follows, we discuss the approaches for robustness analysis, whose results will be exploited by some of these procedures. ROR verifies the possibility or necessity of certain relationships based on a set of all compatible sorting models. This requires checking the consistency of the basic constraint set EARsuperscript𝐸superscript𝐴𝑅E^{A^{R}} with additional constraints representing a verified hypothesis. In what follows, we focus on a weak assignment-based preference relation ≿→:A×A→{0,1}\\succsim^{\\rightarrow}:A\\times A\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}, defined as follows: Its necessary counterparts holds if ≿→superscriptsucceeds-or-equivalent-to→\\succsim^{\\rightarrow} is confirmed for all compatible sorting models, i.e.: Note that if ¬(a≻→,Nb)superscriptsucceeds→𝑁𝑎𝑏\\neg(a\\succ^{\\rightarrow,N}b), there exists at least one compatible sorting model in 𝒰Rsuperscript𝒰𝑅\\mathcal{U}^{R} that assigns b𝑏b to a more preferred class than a𝑎a. Relations ∼→superscriptsimilar-to→\\sim^{\\rightarrow} and ≻→superscriptsucceeds→\\succ^{\\rightarrow} along with their robust extensions ∼→,Nsuperscriptsimilar-to→𝑁\\sim^{\\rightarrow,N} and ≻→,Nsuperscriptsucceeds→𝑁\\succ^{\\rightarrow,N} can be defined analogously by checking if one alternative is assigned to the same or more preferred class as another. The truth of these relations is verified using linear programming  . In SOR, 𝒰Rsuperscript𝒰𝑅\\mathcal{U}^{R} is exploited with the Monte Carlo simulations to derive a set S⊆𝒰R𝑆superscript𝒰𝑅S\\subseteq\\mathcal{U}^{R} of uniformly distributed compatible sorting models. In practice, S⊂𝒰R𝑆superscript𝒰𝑅S\\subset\\mathcal{U}^{R} and |S|≪|𝒰R|much-less-than𝑆superscript𝒰𝑅|S|\\ll|\\mathcal{U}^{R}|. The results obtained for these models are summarized in the form of four stochastic acceptabilities: Class Acceptability Indices (C​A​I𝐶𝐴𝐼CAIs) and Assignment-based Pair-wise Winning (A​P​W​I𝐴𝑃𝑊𝐼APWI), Outranking (A​P​O​I𝐴𝑃𝑂𝐼APOI) and Equality (A​P​E​I𝐴𝑃𝐸𝐼APEI) Indices. C​A​I𝐶𝐴𝐼CAIs quantify the share of compatible sorting models assigning a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A to class Clsubscript𝐶𝑙C_{l} and its approximation C​A​I′𝐶𝐴superscript𝐼′CAI^{\\prime} is defined as follows, i.e.: Furthermore, A​P​W​I:A×A→ℝ∈ [ref]1:𝐴𝑃𝑊𝐼→𝐴𝐴ℝ01APWI:A\\times A\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\in [ref]1 is defined as the share of all models in 𝒰Rsuperscript𝒰𝑅\\mathcal{U}^{R}, which classify one alternative into a more preferred class than another alternative. Its approximation A​P​W​I′𝐴𝑃𝑊superscript𝐼′APWI^{\\prime} is computed in the following way: The remaining pairwise indices, i.e., A​P​O​I𝐴𝑃𝑂𝐼APOIs and A​P​E​I𝐴𝑃𝐸𝐼APEIs, are defined analogously by referring to the shares of models confirming that one alternative is assigned to a class, respectively, at least as good or the same as another.
