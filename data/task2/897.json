      "content": "Paper Title: Bad and good news for Strassen‚Äôs laser method: Border rank of perm‚ÇÉ and strict submultiplicativity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper advances both upper and lower bound techniques in the study of the complexity of tensors\nand applies these advances to tensors that may be used to upper bound the exponent œâùúî\\omega of matrix multiplication. The exponent œâùúî\\omega of matrix multiplication is defined as It is a fundamental constant governing the complexity of the basic operations in linear algebra.\nIt is generally conjectured that œâ=2ùúî2\\omega=2. It has been known since 1988 that\nœâ‚â§2.38ùúî2.38\\omega\\leq 2.38  which was slightly improved upon 2011-2014\n  .\nAll new upper bounds on œâùúî\\omega since 1987 have been obtained\nusing Strassen‚Äôs laser method, which bounds œâùúî\\omega via auxiliary tensors,\nsee any of  [ref]6 [ref]25 for a discussion.\nThe bounds of 2.382.382.38 and below were obtained using the big Coppersmith-Winograd tensor\nas the auxiliary tensor.\nIn  it was shown the big Coppersmith-Winograd tensor could not\nbe used to prove œâ<2.3ùúî2.3\\omega<2.3 in the usual laser method. In this paper we examine 141414 tensors that potentially could be used to prove œâ<2.3ùúî2.3\\omega<2.3 with the laser method.\nOur approach is via algebraic geometry and representation theory, building on the recent advances\nin  .\nWe solve the longstanding problem (e.g., [6, Problem 9.8],\n[11, Rem. 15.44])\nof determining the border rank of the Kronecker square of the\nonly Coppersmith-Winograd tensor that could potentially prove œâ=2ùúî2\\omega=2\n(the q=2ùëû2q=2 small Coppersmith-Winograd tensor). The answer is a negative\nresult for the advance of upper bounds, as it is 161616, the maximum possible value.\nOn the positive side, we show that a tensor that could potentially be\nused to prove œâ<2.11ùúî2.11\\omega<2.11 has border rank of its Kronecker\nsquare significantly smaller than the square of its border rank. While this result alone does\nnot give a new upper bound on the exponent, it opens a promising new direction for upper bounds.\nWe also develop new lower and upper bound techniques,\nand present directions for future research. The tensors we study are the small Coppersmith-Winograd tensor  Tc‚Äãw,qsubscriptùëáùëêùë§ùëûT_{cw,q} for 2‚â§q‚â§102ùëû102\\leq q\\leq 10 (nine such) and\nits skew cousin  Ts‚Äãk‚Äãe‚Äãw‚Äãc‚Äãw,qsubscriptùëáùë†ùëòùëíùë§ùëêùë§ùëûT_{skewcw,q} for even q‚â§10ùëû10q\\leq 10 (five such).\n(These tensors are defined for larger qùëûq but they are only useful for the laser method\nwhen q‚â§10ùëû10q\\leq 10.)\nThe tensors Tc‚Äãw,2subscriptùëáùëêùë§2T_{cw,2} and Ts‚Äãk‚Äãe‚Äãw‚Äãc‚Äãw,2subscriptùëáùë†ùëòùëíùë§ùëêùë§2T_{skewcw,2} potentially could be used to prove œâ=2ùúî2\\omega=2.\nExplicitly,\nthe small Coppersmith-Winograd tensors  are and, for q=2‚Äãpùëû2ùëùq=2p even, its skew cousins  are The small Coppersmith-Winograd tensors are symmetric tensors and their\nskew cousins are skew-symmetric tensors.
