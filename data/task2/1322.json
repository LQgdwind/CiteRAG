      "content": "Paper Title: Runtime Complexity Analysis of Logically Constrained Rewriting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRewriting with constraints over background theories is a highly\nversatile model of computation and tool for analysis.\nWhile user-defined data types are modelled by free function symbols, arbitrary\ndecidable theories can be incorporated, such as integer or bit-vector\narithmetic, lists, or array theory. Constraints over these theories can be effectively handled by SMT solvers.\nDifferent rewrite formalisms capture this idea   [ref]19.\nHere we use the recent notion of logically constrained term rewrite\nsystems (LCTRSs for short), due to Kop et al.    . LCTRSs can abstract programs in a variety of paradigms, comprising\nimperative, functional, and logic languages. They also subsume\ninteger transition systems (ITSs), which constitute a frequently used\nprogram abstraction [ref]19  [ref]8 but do—in contrast to\nLCTRSs—not support (non-tail) recursion.\nOn the other hand, LCTRSs can also model simplification routines for\nexpressions, which are crucial procedures in compilers or SMT solvers.\nFor all of these application areas, LCTRSs offer a uniform toolset\nto analyse termination (or non-termination)  , reachability ,\nuniqueness , or program equivalence . However, techniques for resource analysis of LCTRSs are so far lacking.\nThis is\ndespite the fact that in their application domains (program analysis,\nsimplification systems), execution time is crucial. As a remedy, this paper\ninvestigates methods to analyse (worst-case) innermost runtime\ncomplexity of logically constrained rewrite systems.\nTo this end, we unify and generalise the complexity framework for standard rewriting by\nAvanzini and Moser  with the approach by Brockschmidt et al. to\nalternate time and size bound analysis for ITSs [ref]8, and moreover\npropose processors for modularisation and sublinear bounds.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: such as integer or bit-vector\narithmetic, lists, or array theory. Constraints over these theories can be effectively handled by SMT solvers.\nDifferent rewrite formalisms capture this idea   [ref]19.\nHere we use the recent notion of logically constrained term rewrite\nsystems (LCTRSs for short), due to Kop et al.    . LCTRSs can abstract programs in a variety of paradigms,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
