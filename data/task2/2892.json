      "content": "Paper Title: Class Incremental Online Streaming Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nParameter-isolation-based approaches train different subsets of model parameters on sequential tasks. PNN [ref]37, DEN 4 expand the network to accommodate the new task. PathNet , PackNet , Piggyback [ref]28, and HAT  train different subsets of network parameters on each task. Regularization-based approaches use an extra regularization term in the loss function to enable continual learning. LWF  uses knowledge distillation  loss to prevent catastrophic forgetting. EWC , IMM , and MAS  regularize by penalizing changes to the important weights of the network. Rehearsal-based approaches replay a subset of past training data during sequential learning. iCaRL , SER 7, and TinyER  use memory replay when training on a new task. DER  uses knowledge distillation and memory replay while learning a new task. DGR 0, MeRGAN 2, and CloGAN  retain the past task(s) distribution with a generative model and replay the synthetic samples during incremental learning. Our approach also leverages memory replay from a tiny episodic memory; however, we store the feature-maps instead of raw inputs. Variational Continual Learning (VCL)  leverages Bayesian inference to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the approach, when naïvely adapted, performs poorly in the streaming learning setting. Additionally, it also needs task-id during inference. Furthermore, the explicit finetuning with the buffer samples (coreset) before inference violates the single-pass learning constraint. Moreover, it still does not outperform our approach even with the finetuning. More details are given in the appendix. REMIND 5 is a recently proposed rehearsal-based lifelong learning approach, which combats catastrophic forgetting in online streaming setting. While it follows a setting close to the one proposed, the model stores a large number of past examples compared to the other baselines; for example, iCaRL  stores 10K past examples for the ImageNet experiment, whereas REMIND stores 1M past examples. Further, it actually uses a lossy compression to store past samples, which is merely an engineering technique, not an algorithmic improvement, and can be used by any continual learning approach. For more details, please refer to the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Parameter-isolation-based approaches train different subsets of model parameters on sequential tasks.
