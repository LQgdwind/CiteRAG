The FJC is a hybrid consistency and weaker than the causal. This model despite the malicious nodes, and ensures that the healthy node has the latest update. Our proposed consistency is a data-centric model that also supports the client-centric model. Additionally, this model reduces the staleness rates, monetary costs, and the severity of violations. Harmony is offered as an adaptable consistency in Cassandra and provides consistency levels based on the application requirements . This consistency can elastically tolerate the stale read value or significantly reduce the staleness rate by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas involved in the read operations. Our method significantly reduces the staleness rate at the client-side. At the server-side, all servers have the same view of users’ requests and decrease the severity of violations. Bismar, a new consistency performed in Cassandra that argues the monetary costs must also be taken into account when evaluating or selecting consistency levels in Cassandra’s storage system. Accordingly, it has defined a new metric called consistency-cost. Therefore, this adaptive model has been introduced as an economic consistency model . Our proposed consistency also pursues Bismar goals, with the exception that our consistency is a data-centric and supports both server and client sides, but Bismar is an adaptable consistency. Eventual is a client-centric model that provides a relatively weak level of consistency and does not guarantee a reduction in the severity of violations. However, a cloud storage system with eventual consistency ensures that if the system does not have a continuous update, the system converges to the steady-state and all replicas are adapted . In contrast, our approach reduces the staleness rate and the severity of violations at the client-side. A combination of causal, monotonic read, and read your write consistencies which are designed for the cloud storage systems . The system uses monotonic read and read your write to investigate the severity of violations in the implementation of read operations and local auditing. Similarly, it uses the causal in the global auditing. We have provided X-STCC at both server and client sides. Moreover, our proposed applies a global auditing schema in order to the reduction of staleness rate and the severity of violations. Furthermore, Our proposed supports monotonic read, read your write, monotonic write and write follow read. Weak causal consistency strives to maintain the causal relations among operations. This model avoids the reduction of the convergence degree among the replicas that have been introduced in the causal convergence . Moreover, this model is another variant of the causal consistency that provides both the weak causal and convergence. The cloud storage system has been implemented in the causal consistency based on the partial and full replication protocols with respect to which the performance of the system is analyzed .\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Depot is a cloud storage system with the Fork-Join-Causal (FJC) consistency to secure the system from malicious clients and servers [ref]16.
