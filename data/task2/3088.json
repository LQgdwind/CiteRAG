      "content": "Paper Title: A Massively Parallel Implementation of Multilevel Monte Carlo for Finite Element Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we evaluate the performance of the scheduling algorithm which was implemented in\nFEMPAR [ref]7 , an open source, hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallel, object-oriented (OO) FORTRAN200X scientific software framework for the massively parallel FE simulation of multiscale/multiphysics problems governed by PDEs. We developed a new layer of software that permits the execution of several instances of a model as required by sampling UQ methods. In this way it is possible to exploit advanced discretization methods provided by the FEMPAR  library, e.g., AgFEM methods. These embedded techniques have been recently exploited in [ref]3 to perform UQ in random geometries using the MLMC implementation described herein.  On top of these advanced discretization methods, FEMPAR  provides advanced built-in multilevel domain decomposition solvers   and an interface with PETSc , which, in turn, provides access to many other linear and nonlinear solvers. The code is open source, under the GPLv3 license, and available at the FEMPAR  gitlab repository\n(https://github.com/fempar/fempar). Most numerical experiments presented herein have been performed in Marenostrum IV (MN-IV), a supercomputer hosted at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). MN-IV is equipped with 3456 compute nodes connected together with the Intel OPA HPC network. Each node is equipped with 2x Intel Intel Xeon Platinum multi-core CPUs, with 24 cores each (i.e., 48 cores per node), and 96 GBytes of RAM. FEMPAR  was compiled with the Intel Fortran compiler (v18.0.1) with the system-recommended optimization flags, and linked against the Intel MPI Library for message-passing (2018.0.128), the BLAS/LAPACK and PARDISO available on the Intel MKL library for optimized dense linear algebra kernels, and sparse direct solvers, respectively , and the PETSc library (3.12.4). Some additional tests were perfomed in Gadi, a supercomputer hosted at the Australian National Computational Infrastructure Agency (NCI). Gadi is a equiped with 3024 nodes, each containing 2x 24-core Intel Xeon Scalable Cascade Lake cores and 192 GB of RAM. All nodes are interconnected via Mellanox Technologies‚Äô latest generation HDR InfiniBand technology.\nFEMPAR  was compiled with the GNU Fortran compiler (v8.5.0) with the system-recommended optimization flags, and linked against the OpenMPI Library for message-passing (4.2.2), and the BLAS/LAPACK and PARDISO available on the Intel MKL library (v2020.0.166) for optimized dense linear algebra kernels, and sparse direct solvers, respectively , and the PETSc library (3.12.4). We consider two examples aimed at testing the scalability and efficiency of the scheduling software.\nFirst, we consider a model independent evaluation of performance, testing the scheduling algorithm using a computational model that simply idles  for a randomly selected time interval, while executing in parallel in Section¬†5.1. As a second example, we consider a 3D Poisson problem in Section¬†5.2, with a random diffusion term that is described by a  Karhunen-Lo√®ve Expansion (KLE) and fixed Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary of a randomized popcorn geometry similar to that described in [ref]3. This Poisson model is discretized using  Algebraic Multigrid (AMG), and executed in parallel with differing core counts on each level. For each example we perform the standard scaling experiments, namely, strong scaling where the number of MLMC samples (or AMLMC tolerance) is kept constant, while the number of processors is increased, weak scaling where the number of MLMC samples is increased (or AMLMC tolerance is decreased), and the number of processors is increased, so that the relative number of MLMC samples to processors is fixed. We consider here sample sizes (or initial sample sizes in the case of AMLMC), N‚ÑìsubscriptùëÅ‚ÑìN_{\\ell}, which are integers that experience an exponential growth, (for l=0,‚Ä¶,Lùëô0‚Ä¶ùêøl=0,...,L).\n As defined in Section¬†2.2, sùë†s is the ratio between the size of the mesh at two different levels of the hierarcy, s=2ùë†2s=2 in all the experiments presented herein. The constant ŒìŒì\\Gamma defines the relation between the number of samples at different levels required to achieve optimal complexity by equilibrating statistical and spatial approximation errors. The optimal value depends on the properties of the discretization and solution algorithms as well as on the regularity of the problem. In the case of the solution of the Poisson problems in smooth domains using linear FEs and solving the resulting linear system with the conjugate gradient method, Œì=4Œì4\\Gamma=4 is optimal, as validated in¬†[ref]3. It is worth noting that this is not the case of the popcorn example of Section 5.2. The main motivation for the development of AMLMC methods is precisely to correct the number of samples N‚ÑìsubscriptùëÅ‚ÑìN_{\\ell} during the excution of the algorithm to obtain an optimal complexity regardless of the value of ŒìŒì\\Gamma. To test the scalability of the scheduling algorithm, we scale the overall computational cost of the experiments by a sample multiplier, denoted by Cùê∂C, taking the number of samples at each level according to where Nl‚ãÜsuperscriptsubscriptùëÅùëô‚ãÜN_{l}^{\\star} is a relatively small sample size obtained (approximately) from ¬†(10), whose values are given in Table¬†1. In the results below we present the speedup S‚Äã(p)ùëÜùëùS(p) defined by where tw‚Äã(p)subscriptùë°ùë§ùëùt_{w}(p) is the wall clock time to compute the MLMC estimate as a function of pùëùp.\nThe speedup is useful here for weak scaling, as this normalization allows us to compare results for different model evaluation times, which would be difficult to do if wall times were presented. We also consider the effect of idling and coordination relative to the time spent in active computation. We divide the scheduling algorithm execution on each task into three parts, managing, m‚Äã(p)ùëöùëùm(p), idling, i‚Äã(p)ùëñùëùi(p), and active computation, a‚Äã(p)ùëéùëùa(p), which we measure in core-seconds. The master task and any other coordinators are always contributing to the managing total, while executing tasks are contributing to either idling or active computation, depending on where they are in the scheduling algorithm execution. When an executing partition is in the setup or run phase, its cores contributes to the active total; otherwise, it contributes to the idling total. We define the efficiency as in 8, to be a value in (0,1)01(0,1) that measures the overhead of the scheduling algorithm as a ratio of total core time used in the computation. We note that our results compare most closely to the similarly performed experiments in  and 2. Our implementation performs well generally, and especially well at addressing the difficult problem of scalability when the model has a low execution time.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: In this section we evaluate the performance of the scheduling algorithm which was implemented in\nFEMPAR [ref]7 , an open source, hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallel, object-oriented (OO) FORTRAN200X scientific software framework for the massively parallel FE simulation of multiscale/multiphysics problems\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
