      "content": "Paper Title: Worldsheet: Wrapping the World in a 3D Sheet for View Synthesis from a Single Image\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNovel view synthesis from multiple images. Traditional novel view synthesis methods use multiple input views at test time  [ref]22 1, and are often based on different representations. Among recent works, Waechter et al.  build scene meshes with diffuse appearance. StereoMag  proposes multiplane images (MPIs) from a stereo image pair as a layered scene representation. NPBG  captures the scene as a point cloud with neural descriptors. NeRF  proposes a neural radiance field representation for scene appearance, and is followed by many extensions (see  for a summary). NSVF  adopts sparse voxel octrees as scene representations. FVS  and SVS  blend multiple source images based on a geometric scaffold. Yoon et al.  combine depth from both single and multiple views to generate novel views of dynamic scenes. Access to multiple input views greatly simplifies the task, allowing the scene geometry to be recovered via multi-view stereo . Novel view synthesis from a single image.\nIn early works, Debevec et al.  recover 3D scene models and Horry et al. 4 fit a regular mesh to generate novel views. Liebowitz et al.  and Criminsi et al.  generate meshes via projective geometry constraints but these methods came at the expense of manual editing.\nHoiem et al. 3 generate automatic 3D pop-up by fitting vertical and ground planes onto the 2D image, unlike our mesh representation.\nMore recently in  8 0, layered depth images are used for single image view synthesis based on a pre-trained depth estimator. In 8, online videos are used to train a scale-invariant MPI representation for view synthesis. SynSin  synthesizes novel views from a single image with a feature point cloud.\nIn contrast, we learn to construct scene meshes instead of point clouds and directly map image texture instead of feature vectors to generate novel views from large viewpoint changes. Differentiable mesh rendering. Recent work on differentiable mesh renders 6   allow learning 3D structures through synthesis. NMR 6 and SoftRas  reconstruct the 3D object shape as a mesh by rendering it, comparing it with the input image, and back-propagating losses to refine the mesh geometry. CMR 5, CSM 9 and U-CMR 0 build category-specific object meshes from images by deforming from a mean or template category shape through silhouette (and keypoints in 5) supervision.\nOur method is aligned with the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm above. However, unlike most previous works that apply differentiable mesh rendering to objects, we learn the 3D geometry of scenes through the rendering losses on the novel view. Moreover, instead of predicting a texture flow as in 5 0, we propose to analytically sample the mesh texture from the input view with a differentiable texture sampler. Unlike , our differentiable texture sampler considers multiple mesh faces in the z-buffer (soft rasterization instead of only the closest one), and assumes perspective (instead of orthographic) camera projection.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Novel view synthesis from multiple images.
