      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-node Bert-pretraining: Cost-efficient Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs deep learning models become more powerful and complex, the training of those models also demands more computation resources. Large models like ResNet¬†[ref]25 and DeepSpeech2¬† can take weeks to train on a single GPU device¬†[ref]27. The need for shortening the training time of large deep learning models has brought up distributed training algorithms. Among the distributed training algorithms, data parallelism¬†[ref]28 and model parallelism¬† are the two most popular types. Data parallelism¬†[ref]28 is a natural way to scale out the training process by slicing and distributing the training data into multiple devices. Each worker will retain a full replica of the model on different data. Workers will synchronize over the updates of the model by exchanging gradients. In contrast, model parallelism¬† divides the model into different pieces and distributes those pieces into each devices to form a training pipeline. Workers will train on the same date but for different parts of the model, which allows devices to fit bigger model. Workers will synchronize over the activation maps. However, as the training graphs of deep learning models are typically directed-acyclic, model parallelism¬†, which partitions the execution graph, essentially introduces strong sequential dependencies: at most one device will be fully utilized in computing at any given time of training. To gain more device utilization, pipeline devices to overlap computation was proposed¬†. Such overlapping requires activation maps that are supposed to be synchronized to be stacked and stored. Assuming mini-batch data enters the pipeline one at a time, and the pipeline has length nùëõn, this will impose an extra linear scale of memory storage for devices in the pipeline, which is not scalable as the number of devices increases. Furthermore, the hard limit on device memory that model parallelism¬† brings leaves very little room for researchers to optimize the training throughput. Compared with model parallelism¬†, data parallelism¬†[ref]28 also introduces hard limit: each device must be able to fit in one complete replica of the model. One might argue that this is a bottleneck as models are getting bigger, it‚Äôs the feature maps that consumes most memory rather than the model itself. Although model size usually is not a bottleneck, data parallelism suffers from trade-offs between synchronization cost and model parameter staleness in parameter updates¬†[ref]28. Network topologies have also been explored in the implementation of data parallelism in order to reduce the synchronization cost. For example, a ring based system topology¬† has been proposed to maximize the inter-device communication bandwidth. By having all devices jointly form a ring topology, each device only passes the computed weight gradient to its neighbor in the ring. Such approach guarantees that communication channel between any two devices will be filled up with maximum one model‚Äôs gradient, avoiding traffic congestions. Further benchmarks have shown this approach guarantees linear scalability of bandwidth with respect to the number of devices¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: As deep learning models become more powerful and complex, the training of those models also demands more computation resources.
