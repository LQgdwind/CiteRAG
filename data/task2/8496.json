      "content": "Paper Title: Distribution-Free Normal Modal Logics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first, other than IML (Intuitionistic Modal Logic), sub-classical modal logic system studied was Dunn‚Äôs Positive Modal Logic (PML) , weakening the lattice-base axioms of the logic to those of a mere distributive lattice. Both negation and implication are absent from the language of PML. Dunn‚Äôs article has attracted some interest. Gehrke, Nagahashi and Venema  studied the Sahlqvist theory of a system DML (Distributive Modal Logic), which is the fusion of its two monomodal fragments and is weaker than Dunn‚Äôs PML. Celani and Jansana  proposed a new semantics for PML, to model the consequence relation of the logic. Finally, and more relevant to our purposes, Bezhanishvili, Dmitrieva, de Groot and Morachini  focused on a distribution-free version of PML. A single relation RùëÖR in frames generates both ‚ñ°,‚óá‚ñ°‚óá\\Box,\\Diamond, the interpretation for modal formulae is standard, except that in pursuing a way to define frames that validate interaction axioms they find it necessary to abandon distribution of diamonds over joins. The authors do not work with canonical extensions, they model their logic(s) of interest in (topological) semilattices and they develop a related correspondence theory. A duality for distribution-free modal lattices is presented in , building on the Hofmann, Mislove and Stralka 0 duality for meet semilattices, and the authors use it to build a new semantic framework for the logic of their focus. The logics we consider may, or may not be distributive and, axiomatically, they are the sub-classical analogues of the classical basic systems of normal modal logic. Their equivalent algebraic semantics is given by the variety of implicative modal bounded lattices ùêã=(L,‚â§,‚àß,‚à®,0,1,‚Üí,‚ñ°,‚óá)ùêãùêø01‚Üí‚ñ°‚óá\\mathbf{L}=(L,\\leq,\\wedge,\\vee,0,1,\\rightarrow,\\Box,\\Diamond). The implication fragment of the logics may be as weak as the same fragment of the non-associative full Lambek calculus and as strong as the Intuitionistic (or Boolean) propositional calculus. We adopt a uniform relational semantics approach, based on a generalization of the J√≥nsson-Tarski framework  for the relational representation of normal lattice operators given in [ref]24. The relational semantics of distribution-free systems is typically given in two-sorted frames 4    , with a distinguished relation generating a Galois connection on the powersets of the sorts and modeling sentences as sets that are stable under the closure operator generated by the Galois connection. It has been observed that a two-sorted framework makes it hard to transfer and use results and techniques established for the classical setting. Indeed, the possibility of direct transfer and use of results is missing and much has to be established afresh. However, recent developments seem to gradually fill-in the gap with the classical (distributive, or Boolean) setting. Other than the generalization of the concept of canonical (perfect) extensions to bounded lattices  and the topological dualities of [ref]22 [ref]24 [ref]23 , a Sahlqvist theory for distribution-free logics in the RS-framework has been developed by Conradie and Palmigiano , a Goldblatt-Thomason theorem for non-distributive logics in a two-sorted semantic framework has been published by Goldblatt , a van Benthem characterization result for logics without distribution has been detailed in  by the author and several distribution-free systems have been modeled in the two-sorted approach, amongst which we may mention     . This article fills in a gap in the literature by presenting a systematic study of the relational semantics of the basic normal modal logic systems that may lack distribution of conjunction over disjunction and conversely. Relying on the extension of canonical extensions to the case of bounded lattices , it specifies what a canonical frame for the distribution-free systems is, it identifies frame classes corresponding to the basic normal modal logic systems and it proves canonicity and completeness in the relational semantics. Section¬†2 defines normal lattice expansions and, in particular, the variety of implicative modal lattices. It specifies the basic proof system for any normal lattice expansion, built on top of a proof system for Positive Lattice Logic (PLL) and including only axioms and rules from which the distribution and normality properties of the logical operators are obtained. The section is concluded with a duality between the lattice of axiomatic extensions of the basic logic and the lattice of subvarieties of the variety determined by the equivalent algebraic semantics of the basic logic system. Section¬†3 introduces sorted residuated frames with sorted relations and it defines their complete lattices of stable sets. Sorted image operators are defined as in the classical J√≥nsson-Tarski framework  (which precedes by a decade and logically underlies Kripke semantics for modal logic, or Routley-Meyer semantics for relevance logic). Stable-set sorted operators are defined from the image operators and it is proven that, under a mild assumption of smoothness of the frame relations, they are completely additive. Normal lattice operators of distribution types depending on the sort of the generating relation are subsequently derived and the full complex algebra of a frame is defined. Relational semantics is presented in terms of both a relation of satisfaction ‚ä©forces\\Vdash and a relation of co-satisfaction (refutation) ‚ä©‚àÇsuperscriptforces\\Vdash^{\\!\\!\\partial}. The sorted relational framework is a smooth generalization of classical relational semantics (see Remark¬†3.4 and Remark¬†3.9). The section is concluded with instantiating definitions to the case of implication and the modal operators and deriving soundness of the logic obtained as the fusion of its fragments with the single operators ‚Üí,‚ñ°‚Üí‚ñ°\\rightarrow,\\Box and ‚óá‚óá\\Diamond and this completes the presentation of the basic background needed. Section¬†4 considers the minimal distribution-free normal modal logic system, including just the K-axiom ‚ñ°‚Äã(p‚Üíq)‚ä¢‚ñ°‚Äãp‚Üí‚ñ°‚Äãqproves‚ñ°‚Üíùëùùëû‚Üí‚ñ°ùëù‚ñ°ùëû\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)\\vdash\\Box p\\rightarrow\\Box q, on top of the standard distribution and normality axioms for each of ‚ñ°‚ñ°\\Box and ‚óá‚óá\\Diamond, but without the interdefinability of box and diamond axiom. To define frames that validate the K-axiom, it is first pointed out that the lattice ùí¢‚Äã(Z1)ùí¢subscriptùëç1{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{1}) of stable sets and the MacNeille completion of a sub-poset Q‚äÜùí¢‚Äã(Z1)ùëÑùí¢subscriptùëç1Q\\subseteq{\\mathcal{G}}(Z_{1}) of principal (closed and open) elements are identical. We refer to the sub-poset QùëÑQ as the intermediate structure of the frame. The significant issue arising is that in frames that can be axiomatically extended to validate the K-axiom the upper MacNeille extension \\largesquare‚Äã‚ñ°usuperscript\\largesquare‚ñ°ùë¢\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}^{u} of the definition of the box operator \\largesquare‚Äã‚ñ°\\largesquare‚ñ°\\largesquare\\Box\\; in the intermediate structure must lie below its lower MacNeille extension \\largesquare‚Äã‚ñ°‚Ñìsuperscript\\largesquare‚ñ°‚Ñì\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}^{\\ell}. A restricted (second-order) join-distributivity of \\largesquare‚Äã‚ñ°\\largesquare‚ñ°\\largesquare\\Box\\; over joins, \\largesquare‚Äã‚ñ°‚Äã‚ãÅx‚ààAŒì‚Äãx‚äÜ‚ãÅx‚ààA\\largesquare‚Äã‚ñ°‚ÄãŒì‚Äãx\\largesquare‚ñ°subscriptùë•ùê¥Œìùë•subscriptùë•ùê¥\\largesquare‚ñ°Œìùë•\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}\\bigvee_{x\\in A}\\Gamma x\\subseteq\\bigvee_{x\\in A}\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.0pt}{$\\largesquare\\Box\\;$}}\\Gamma x is postulated and the class of refined frames defined. The section is concluded with a soundness proof for the class of refined frames whose intermediate structure validates the K-axiom, a requirement that can be easily phrased as a first-order frame axiom. Section¬†5 specifies frame classes corresponding to the D, T, B, S4 and S5 axioms and proves soundness results. Section¬†6 constructs the canonical frame, as an instance of a general representation result for normal lattice expansions. It is argued that the full complex algebra of the canonical frame is a canonical extension of the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of the logic, that the frame is refined and that the frame axioms corresponding to logic axioms hold. This establishes canonicity and completeness in the relational semantics. In Section¬†7 we argue that the semantic framework and approach of the previous sections is scalable and it can be adapted to handle the cases where the underlying lattice logic is distributive, or intuitionistic. For the Heyting algebra case, we show that validity of the K-axiom holds without a need to assume a second-order axiomatization of the frame.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: calculus.
