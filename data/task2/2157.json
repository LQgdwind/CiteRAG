      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Intrusion Prevention Policies through Optimal Stopping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe problem of automatically finding security policies has been studied using concepts and methods from different fields, most notably reinforcement learning, game theory, dynamic programming, control theory, attack graphs, statistical tests, and evolutionary computation. For a literature review of deep reinforcement learning in network security see , and for an overview of game-theoretic approaches see . For examples of research using dynamic programming, control theory, attack graphs, statistical tests, and evolutionary methods, see , , [ref]9, , and . Most research on reinforcement learning applied to network security is recent. Prior work that most resembles the approach taken in this paper includes our previous research  and the work in , , , , 1, and 2. All of these papers focus on network intrusions using reinforcement learning. This paper differs from prior work in the following ways: (1) we formulate intrusion prevention as an optimal stopping problem ( uses a similar approach); (2) we use an emulated infrastructure to estimate the parameters of our simulation model, rather than relying on abstract assumptions like     1 2; (3) we derive a structural property of the optimal policy; (4) we analyze the learned policies and relate them to the optimal policy, an analysis which prior work lacks    1 2; and (5) we apply state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, i.e. PPO 0, rather than traditional ones as used in     1 2. Optimal stopping has previously been applied to model problems in in different domains, including finance , queuing systems [ref]18, and attack detection . We believe we are first in using optimal stopping to model intrusion prevention.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: see , and for an overview of game-theoretic approaches see .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
