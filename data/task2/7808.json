      "content": "Paper Title: Lens functions for exploring UMAP Projections with Domain Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDimensionality reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used to visualise complex,\nhigh-dimensional data in two or three dimensions .\nWhile these visualisations provide a good overview, they may not contain all the\npatterns an analyst expects to find. Patterns may not be visible due to errors\nand distortions [ref]2 or can be hidden by a few influential\ndata attributes . Prior information and domain\nknowledge have been incorporated in DR algorithms as constraints to make\nembeddings better reflect analysts’ expectations .\nGenerally, these techniques aim to emphasise or suppress known structures in the\nembeddings. In this paper, we use such constraints for domain-knowledge-guided exploration\ninstead. Our primary inspiration comes from topological data analysis algorithms\nMapper  and STAD . Both algorithms\nsupport lens functions that highlight how particular features behave in\ndifferent parts of the data. Their key benefit is that they create configurable\nperspectives, each potentially uncovering different insights. For example, lens\nfunctions can be used to emphasise a feature of interest or to incorporate\nadditional signals. The idea underpinning lens functions can be traced back to classical Morse\ntheory, which studies shape with a function that identifies points of interest\n(e.g., ). The Mapper algorithm is based closely on these\nideas, as it detects clusters in (overlapping) lens level sets and connects them\nacross level set boundaries to construct a network that approximates a Reeb\nGraph . The resulting structure summarises the relation\nbetween the data’s shape and the chosen lens function. Lens functions can also be applied to modulate manifolds that describe\npoint-to-point connectivity. For example, STAD removes edges between points in\ndifferent lens level sets from a graph connecting all points closer than a\nparticular distance threshold . The resulting network does\nnot have the same formal properties as a Reeb graph but can be used to visualise\nthe same relations. In general, lens functions have three related effects: 1)\nthey separate similar observations with different lens values; thereby 2)\nrevealing distinct sub-populations with similar lens values; and 3) uncovering\nhow these sub-populations evolve over the lens function. Visually, lens functions are particularly effective because they express\npatterns by changing network connectivity and layout (i.e., position of the data\npoints on the screen). They modulate data point positions and change which data\npoints are pre-attentively perceived as a single group by the proximity Gestalt\nlaw . Strictly speaking, many of the same patterns can\nalso be visualised by colouring data points. However, as the visual variable of\ncolour is less accurately perceived than\nposition  they are not as easy to recognise\nthat way. This is also corroborated by the discovery of novel patterns in older\ndatasets using Mapper (e.g., 0 1). The present paper proposes lens functions for UMAP, a state-of-the-art\ndimensionality reduction algorithm 2. We present three lens\ntypes for UMAP models (see Fig. 1), bringing lens functionality\nto UMAP in an accessible manner. Two case studies demonstrate the added value\nlenses have for exploration workflows with UMAP: exploring data from multiple\nperspectives, leading to different insights. In addition, we show the\ncomputation scalability of these lens types by reporting compute times and\npresenting a synthetic benchmark. In summary, we make the following contributions: Three lens types for UMAP models that adapt embeddings for answering\nquestions using domain knowledge. Two use cases demonstrating exploration workflows using the lens types,\nand explaining in which scenarios each lens type is appropriate. A ready-to-use, open-source Python\npackage111https://github.com/vda-lab/lensed_umap implementing\nthe proposed functionality and the demonstrated use cases.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: or three dimensions .\nWhile these visualisations provide a good overview, they may not contain all the\npatterns an analyst expects to find.
