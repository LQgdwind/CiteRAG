      "content": "Paper Title: Audio Retrieval with Natural Language Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we first formulate the problem of audio retrieval with natural language queries. Next, we describe two cross-modal embedding methods that we adapt for the task of audio retrieval. Finally, we describe the four datasets used in our experimental study, and the two benchmarks that we propose to evaluate performance on the audio retrieval task. Problem formulation. Given a natural language query (i.e. a written description of an audio event to be retrieved) and a pool of audio samples, the objective of text-to-audio (abbreviated to t2a) retrieval is to rank the audio samples according to their similarity to the query. We also consider the converse a2t task, viz. retrieving text with audio queries. Methods.\nTo tackle the problem of audio retrieval, we propose to learn cross-modal embeddings. Specifically, given a collection of N𝑁N audio samples with corresponding text descriptions, {(ai,ti):i∈{1,…,N}}conditional-setsubscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖𝑖1…𝑁\\{(a_{i},t_{i}):i\\in\\{1,\\dots,N\\}\\} we aim to learn embedding functions, ψasubscript𝜓𝑎\\psi_{a} and ψtsubscript𝜓𝑡\\psi_{t}, that project each audio sample aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and text sample tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} into a shared space, such that ψa​(ai)subscript𝜓𝑎subscript𝑎𝑖\\psi_{a}(a_{i}) and ψt​(ti)subscript𝜓𝑡subscript𝑡𝑖\\psi_{t}(t_{i}) are close when the text describes the audio, and far apart otherwise. Writing si​jsubscript𝑠𝑖𝑗s_{ij} for the cosine similarity of the audio embedding ψa​(ai)subscript𝜓𝑎subscript𝑎𝑖\\psi_{a}(a_{i}) and the text embedding ψt​(tj)subscript𝜓𝑡subscript𝑡𝑗\\psi_{t}(t_{j}), we learn the embedding functions by minimising a contrastive ranking loss [ref]41: where B𝐵B denotes the batch size, m𝑚m the margin (set as a hyperparameter), and [⋅]+=m​a​x​(⋅,0)subscriptdelimited-[]⋅𝑚𝑎𝑥⋅0[\\cdot]_{+}=max(\\cdot,0) the hinge function. We consider two frameworks for learning such embedding functions ψasubscript𝜓𝑎\\psi_{a} and ψtsubscript𝜓𝑡\\psi_{t}: Mixture-of-Embedded Experts (MoEE)  and Collaborative-Experts (CE) . MoEE, originally designed for video-text retrieval, constructs its video encoder from a collection of “experts” (features extracted from networks pre-trained for object recognition, action classification, sound classification, etc.) which are computed for each video, aggregated along their temporal dimension with NetVLAD , projected to a lower dimension via a self-gated linear map and then L2-normalised. The text encoder first embeds each word token with word2vec [ref]43 and aggregates the results with NetVLAD . The result is projected by a sequence of self-gated linear maps (one for each expert) into a shared embedding space with the outputs of the video encoder. Finally, a scalar-weighted sum of the embedded experts in each joint space is used to compute the overall cosine similarity between the video and text (see  for more details). CE adopts the same text encoder as MoEE and similarly makes use of multiple video experts. However, rather than projecting them directly into independent spaces against the embedded text, CE first applies a “collaborative gating” mechanism, which filters each expert with an element-wise attention mask that is generated with a small MLP that ingests all pairwise combinations of experts (see  for further details). To adapt these frameworks for audio retrieval, we use the same text encoder structures ψtsubscript𝜓𝑡\\psi_{t}, and build audio encoders ψasubscript𝜓𝑎\\psi_{a} by mimicking the structure of their video encoders, replacing the “video experts” with “audio experts” (described in Sec. 4). Datasets.\nAs the primary focus of our work, we study two audio-centric datasets—these are datasets which comprise audio streams (sometimes with accompanying visual streams) paired with natural language descriptions that focus explicitly on the content of the audio track. To explore differences between audio retrieval and video retrieval, we also consider two visual-centric datasets, that comprise audio and video streams paired with natural language which focus primarily (though not always exclusively) on the content of the video stream. Details of the four datasets we employ are given next. 1. AudioCaps  (audio-centric) is a dataset of sounds with event descriptions that was introduced for the task of audio captioning, with sounds sourced from the AudioSet dataset .\nAnnotators were provided the audio tracks together with category hints (and with additional video hints if needed).\nWe use a subset of the data, excluding a small number of samples for which either: (i) the YouTube-hosted source video is no longer available, (ii) the source video overlaps with the training partition of the VGGSound dataset .\nFiltering to exclude samples affected by either issue leads to a dataset with 49,291 training, 428 validation and 816 test samples.111We make the sample list publicly available at the project page . 2. Clotho  (audio-centric) is a dataset of described sounds that was also introduced for the task of audio captioning, with sounds sourced from the Freesound platform .\nDuring labelling, annotators only had access to the audio stream (i.e. no visual stream or meta tags) to avoid their reliance on contextual information for removing ambiguity that could not be resolved from the audio stream alone.\nThe descriptions are filtered to exclude transcribed speech.\nThe publicly available version of the dataset includes a dev set of 2893 audio samples and an evaluation set of 1045 audio samples.\nEvery audio sample is accompanied by 5 written descriptions.\nWe used a random split of the dev set into a training and validation set with 2,314 and 579 samples, respectively. 3. ActivityNet-Captions [ref]46 (visual-centric) consists of videos sourced\nfrom YouTube and annotated with dense event descriptions.\nIt allocates 10,009 videos for training and 4,917 videos for testing (we use the public val_1 split provided by [ref]46).\nFor this dataset, descriptions also tend to focus on the visual stream. 4. QuerYD  (visual-centric) is a dataset of described videos sourced from YouTube and the YouDescribe  platform.\nIt is accompanied by audio descriptions that are provided with the explicit aim of conveying the video content to visually impaired users. Therefore, the provided descriptions focus heavily on the visual modality.\nWe use the version of the dataset comprising trimmed videos with 9,114 training, 1,952 validation, and 1,954 test samples. Benchmark.\nTo facilitate the study of the text-based audio retrieval task, we propose to re-purpose the two audio-centric datasets described above, AudioCaps and Clotho, to provide benchmarks for text-based audio retrieval. This approach is inspired by precedents in the vision and language communities, where datasets, such as , that were originally introduced for the task of video captioning, have become popular benchmarks for text-based video retrieval    .\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: embedding ψa​(ai)subscript𝜓𝑎subscript𝑎𝑖\\psi_{a}(a_{i}) and the text embedding ψt​(tj)subscript𝜓𝑡subscript𝑡𝑗\\psi_{t}(t_{j}), we learn the embedding functions by minimising a contrastive ranking loss [ref]41: where B𝐵B denotes the batch size, m𝑚m the margin (set as a hyperparameter), and [⋅]+=m​a​x​(⋅,0)subscriptdelimited-[]⋅𝑚𝑎𝑥⋅0[\\cdot]_{+}=max(\\cdot,0) the hinge function.
