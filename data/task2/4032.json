      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Improvement Heuristics for Graph Combinatorial Optimization Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRanking items based on preferences or opinions is, in general, a straightforward task if the number of alternatives to rank is relatively small. Nevertheless, as the number of alternatives/items increases, it becomes harder to get full rankings that are consistent with the pairwise item-preferences. Think of ranking 50 players in a tournament using their paired comparisons from the best performing player to the worst. Obtaining the ranking that agrees with most of the pairwise comparisons is not trivial. This task is known as the Preference Ranking Problem (PRP) . Formally, given a preference matrix B=[bi​j]N×N𝐵subscriptdelimited-[]subscript𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑁𝑁B=[b_{ij}]_{N\\times N} where entries of the matrix bi​jsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b_{ij} represent the preference of item i𝑖i against item j𝑗j, the aim is to find the simultaneous permutation ω𝜔\\omega of rows and columns of B𝐵B so that the sum of entries in the upper-triangle of the matrix is maximized (see Eq. 1). Note that row i𝑖i in B𝐵B describes the preference vector of item i𝑖i over the rest of N−1𝑁1N-1 items, while column i𝑖i denotes the preference of the rest of the items over item i𝑖i. Thus, in order to maximize the upper triangle of the matrix, preferred items must precede in the ranking (see Fig.1a). In addition to the matrix representation (Fig. 1a), the problem can be formulated as a complete bidirected graph where nodes represent the set of items to be ranked and the weighted edges denote the preference between items. A pair of nodes i𝑖i and j𝑗j has two connecting edges (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) and (j,i)𝑗𝑖(j,i), with weights bi​jsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b_{ij} and bj​isubscript𝑏𝑗𝑖b_{ji} that form the previously mentioned preference matrix B𝐵B. A solution (permutation) to the PRP can be also represented as an acyclic tournament on the graph, where the node (item) ranked first has only outgoing edges, the second in the ranking has 1 incoming edge and the rest are outgoing, and so on until the last ranked node, which only has incoming edges (see Fig.1b and c). Ranking from pairwise comparisons is a ubiquitous problem in modern Machine Learning research. It has attracted the attention of the community due to its applicability in various research areas, including, without being limited to: machine translation , economics , corruption perception  or any other task requiring a ranking of items, such as sport tournaments, web search, resource allocation and cybersecurity [ref]32  [ref]34.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: limited to: machine translation , economics , corruption perception  or any other task requiring a ranking of items, such as sport tournaments, web search, resource allocation and cybersecurity [ref]32  [ref]34.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
