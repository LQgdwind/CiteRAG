      "content": "Paper Title: SSMG: Spatial-Semantic Map Guided Diffusion Model for Free-form Layout-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite notable advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models [ref]21 , text descriptions often struggle to adequately convey detailed controls, even when composed of lengthy and complex texts (as shown ‚ÄúText Guided‚Äù in Figure 1).\nIn contrast, methods of Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have risen to prominence, enabling the rendering of realistic and complex scene images from user-specified layouts. Owing to its fine-grained control, L2I generation possesses enormous potential for a wide range of display applications. These range from enhancing the user experience in interactive design to revolutionizing content creation in film and animation   . Recent methods adapt large-scale pre-trained diffusion models  for the L2I generation, demonstrating superior performance compared to GAN-based approaches   .\nThese methods  3 7 4 can be broadly classified into two types, token-guided and image-guided.\nToken-guided methods, as illustrated in Figure 1, tokenize the layout of spatial and semantic information to embeddings, which are then integrated into T2I models via an attention mechanism.\nSemantic information ‚Äúclasses‚Äù is typically managed by a text encoder, e.g., CLIP , while spatial position information is handled by various tokenization methods, e.g., Fourier embedding in GLIGEN  or learnable matrixes in ReCO 3.\nHowever, the tokenization of spatial information, akin to textualization, fails to effectively harness the inherent 2D spatial structure of the layout. Consequently, as demonstrated in Figure 1, it struggles to achieve fine-grained spatial control at the pixel level, leading to issues such as imprecise object boundaries and loss of objects. In contrast, ControlNet 4, a representative image-guided work, incorporates visual conditions, e.g., the layout of boxes, into frozen T2I diffusion models to enable additional condition signals. ControlNet duplicates the weights of the diffusion model into a ‚Äútrainable copy‚Äù and a ‚Äúlocked copy‚Äù, with the trainable copy being trained to learn these visual conditions.\nThis approach provides more accurate spatial controllability. Nevertheless, the semantic control in ControlNet is solely derived from global image captions, resulting in a lack of control over the detailed semantics of individual instances. As shown in Figure 1, the objects within the box suffer from severe semantic ambiguity, resulting in erroneous or blurred objects. Considering the aforementioned limitations, a pressing question arises: can a novel guiding strategy be developed that overcomes the shortcomings of both token-guided and image-guided strategies, thereby offering precise control over both the semantics and the spatial layout of the generated images? In response to this contemplation, we argue that a map-guided strategy could serve as an effective solution.\nOn the one hand, the 2D feature map naturally inherits the spatial structure of layouts, which preserves the advantage of visual conditions as exemplified in ControlNet.\nOn the other hand, feature maps offer a richer semantic dimension than the RGB space of image guidance, e.g., H√óW√óCùêªùëäùê∂H\\times W\\times C, where Cùê∂C‚â´much-greater-than\\gg333. This enriched semantic dimension allows for a more detailed content representation at each spatial pixel. As a result, it enables the effective control of positions and semantics of individual instances, achieving enhanced spatial accuracy and semantic richness. In this paper, we present a novel Spatial-Semantic Map Guided (SSMG) diffusion model that adopts the feature map generated from layout as guidance. Specifically, we first initialize the spatial-semantic map based on the given layout info. By fully embracing the spatial structure inherent in the layout, we populate the corresponding position in the map with semantics learned in the textual encoder. Our initialization not only ensures the complete preservation of spatial information but also infuses the feature map with rich semantic content. Then, considering that the initial map processes each instance independently, we further propose Relation-Sensitive Attention (RSA) to establish the relationships among instances in the scene, as well as the relationship of each instance with the overall scene. RSA allows the spatial and semantic information of each instance to cross-reference all other instance or scene information, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of the scene context. Finally, with the enhanced spatial-semantic map, we integrate it into the conditional generation process through the proposed Location-Sensitive Attention (LSA). This strategy empowers the model to warp the noise image features at each position according to the spatial-semantic map, heightening the model‚Äôs sensitivity to the embedded spatial information.\nIn such a way, our SSMG effectively enhances the model‚Äôs controllability over both semantics and the spatiality of generated images. Moreover, our approach serves as a significant extension to traditional T2I methods. SSMG not only permits free-form textual descriptions for each instance but also supports a multitude of layout positional representations, transcending the limitations of bounding boxes. These advantages provide ample\nadaptability and flexibility for L2I generation, rendering it convenient for wider applications. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SSMG achieves highly promising results, setting a new state-of-the-art across a range of metrics encompassing fidelity, diversity, and controllability. Notably, SSMG verifies the superiority of the map-guided strategy in layout controllability, significantly improving previous state-of-the-arts YOLO scores from 30.530.530.5 to 37.637.637.6 on the COCO dataset. We also provide sufficient representative cases to highlight the distinctive features of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Despite notable advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models [ref]21 , text descriptions often struggle to adequately convey detailed controls, even when composed of lengthy and complex texts (as shown ‚ÄúText Guided‚Äù in Figure 1).\nIn contrast, methods of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
