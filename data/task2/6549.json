      "content": "Paper Title: Performance Scaling via Optimal Transport: Enabling Data Selection from Partially Revealed Sources\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe choice of training data is one of the most crucial components when it comes to extracting the best performance out of a model. Since data is typically acquired from various sources, such as different organizations or vendors, machine learning practitioners often encounter a central question: how to select and combine samples from these data sources? Although data selection has been extensively studied in the literature related to active learning , coreset selection [ref]2, and data valuation [ref]3   [ref]6  , most techniques are designed for a fully-observable setting where all data sources are fully revealed to the model developer. The core ideas behind these techniques are to compare the relative importance of different data points or enumerate possible combinations of data points, all of which require complete knowledge of the entire collection of data points. While these methods have shown promising results, their practical applications in real-world scenarios are limited due to a significant gap: the acquisition decision-making processes require knowledge of the entire data sets, while data owners may only reveal limited samples before an acquisition decision is made (e.g.,  0 provide the examples in real-world data markets). To bridge the gap, this paper explores strategic data selection in partially observable settings, where only limited samples of data sources (referred to as pilot datasets) are accessible. The goal is to determine an optimal allocation of the selection budget to each source, only based on the pilot datasets, such that the model trained on the mixture of collected data achieves the best performance at some given objectives. Technical challenges. In the fully-observable setting, the evaluation and eventually ranking the candidate data selection decisions, including the number of samples to be selected and the ratio of samples from each source (\"mixing ratios\"), can be determined directly on the available datasets 1 2. However, the partially observable setting presents considerable challenges for evaluating a selection decision as one can no longer directly evaluate model performance on the entire data. With limited samples from each data source, the best possible evaluation is the resulting model performance for any combination of the pilot datasets. Then, to make an informed selection decision, it is necessary to understand the model’s performance when trained on potentially larger datasets (target scales) at various mixing ratios. In other words, there is a need for prediction and projection of model performance onto larger data scales at different mixing ratios. A recent study 3 proposes a performance scaling law that takes into account the data size and mixing ratio to predict model performance. Providing a preliminary exploration of this problem, though, this approach faces two major limitations: (1) The numerical instability of its high-order form for scaling functions causes significant difficulty in fitting its parameters, rendering the fitted function susceptible to overfitting and often fails to extrapolate model performance on unseen data mixtures. (2) It hypothesizes on the separability of model performance scaling with data composition and with data size, which is generally untrue as evidenced by latest research 4 and leads to unsatisfactory performance prediction results in empirical observations. Besides, this method requires parameters that grow quadratically with the number of data sources, demanding many (mixing ratio, resulting performance) pairs to fit the function, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Thus, there remains a considerable lack of effective and practical approaches to this problem. Contributions. The paper investigates two fundamental building blocks for strategic data selection in the partially observable setting: (Q1) How to provide an accurate projection of model performance trained on any combination of data sources based on limited samples? And (Q2) How to determine the optimal selection strategy? Towards that end, the paper makes the following contributions. ∙∙\\bullet Parameter-Efficient Performance Prediction based on Optimal Transport (Addressing Q1). In contrast to existing model performance scaling methods that feature a one-shot fitting of a non-informative parametric model (\"surrogate\"), our approach is a novel two-stage performance inference process, where the first stage addresses the dependence of the model performance on the mixing ratio by fitting a parameter-efficient model between model performance and Optimal Transport 6 distance between the mixtures of training data and the validation data (Section 4.2). Then, for stage two,\nwe propose a parameter-free mapping that directly projects model performance onto larger data scales, achieving remarkable accuracy as it fully preserves this the dependency of model performance scaling with data sizes and data distributions (Section 4.3). ∙∙\\bullet Determining optimal data selection strategies (Addressing Q2).\nWe consider the typical data selection goal: maximizing the resulting model performance with fixed data acquisition budgets (data quantity). With model performance predicted by the proposed tools, these problems translate into convex losses that are optimized effectively via gradient-based methods (Section 4.4). We also provide in Appendix.B how it similarly applies to alternative objectives such as minimizing data acquisition costs for the resulting model performance to reach a given level. ∙∙\\bullet Experiments. We experiment on a variety of applications (vision, natural language processing (NLP) etc., with simple to complex models) with a rich diversity of tasks and scenarios. The proposed approach is highly effective in performance prediction, demonstrating superior prediction precision to many baselines while being much more efficient to be constructed (Section 5).\nWe test the performance of data selection by optimizing the performance predictor and show that it improves over existing methods by 3%percent33\\% on ImageNet-100.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: a central question: how to select and combine samples from these data sources?
