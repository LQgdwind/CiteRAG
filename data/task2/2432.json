      "content": "Paper Title: CREW: Computation Reuse and Efficient Weight Storage for Hardware-accelerated MLPs and RNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have extended ScaleSim¬†, a simulator for DNN accelerators, to accurately model three different systems: a TPU-like architecture, UCNN¬† and our CREW scheme presented in Section¬†V. ScaleSim models a systolic array architecture and supports any kind of neural network, including CNNs, MLPs and RNNs. Table¬†III shows the parameters for the experiments. The baseline configuration is a TPU-like architecture clocked at 500 MHz with an output stationary dataflow¬†. It includes a systolic array of 16√ó16161616\\times 16 (256 PEs) and 24 MB of global on-chip SRAM. Inputs and weights are quantized to 8-bit integers without any accuracy loss for our set of DNNs, whereas activation functions are performed in 32-bit floating point. On top of this architecture, we have implemented UCNN as described in¬† and our CREW scheme as presented in Section¬†V. The sizes of the additional local buffers required by UCNN and CREW are provided in Table¬†III. CREW requires three local SRAM buffers on each PE: the Partial Product Indirections buffer, the Partial Product Buffer shared between multiple PEs of the same row and the Partial Sum Buffer. All the local buffers are sized taking into account the block size parameter of our dataflow. We employ a block size of 16√ó16161616\\times 16 for all the DNNs, as we found that it provides a good trade-off between on-chip storage requirements and performance. As a result, all the local buffers require less than 1KB of capacity per PE. These overheads are taken into account for the area, timing and energy evaluation of the accelerator. Regarding main memory, we model an LPDDR4 of 8 GB with a bandwidth of 16 GB/s (dual channel). Regarding area and energy consumption, the combinational logic hardware is implemented in Verilog, including all the additional components required by CREW, and synthesized to obtain the delay and power using the Synopsys Design Compiler, the modules of the DesignWare library and the technology library of 28/32nm from Synopsys¬†. For the technology library, we use the standard low power configuration with 0.78V. On the other hand, we characterize the memory components of the accelerator by obtaining the delay, energy per access and area using CACTI-P¬†. We use the configurations optimized for low power and a supply voltage of 0.78V. Finally, the energy consumption of main memory is estimated by using the MICRON power model for LPDDR4¬†[ref]36. The results obtained with the aforementioned tools are combined with the activity factors and memory traces provided by the extended ScaleSim¬† simulator to obtain the dynamic and static power of the accelerators. Our objective is to prove that our scheme provides important savings for multiple applications and different DNN architectures. To this end, we evaluate our technique on five state-of-the-art DNNs from different application domains, including speech recognition and machine translation as shown in Table¬†IV. We include DeepSpeech2 (D‚ÄãS‚Äã2ùê∑ùëÜ2DS2)¬†, an RNN that consists of GRU cells for end-to-end speech recognition implemented in PyTorch¬†, and Kaldi¬†[ref]13, an MLP for acoustic scoring from the popular framework of the same name. DS2 and Kaldi are trained and evaluated with the Librispeech¬† dataset. In addition, we employ two machine translation networks: G‚ÄãN‚ÄãM‚ÄãTùê∫ùëÅùëÄùëáGNMT¬†[ref]1 and Transformer¬†. GNMT is an LSTM network for neural machine translation based on the Google Translator and trained using the WMT16¬† dataset with texts of newspapers from German to English (DE-EN). As described in Section¬†II-A, the Transformer is a deep MLP with an encoder-decoder architecture that is mainly composed of attention layers. We evaluate the Transformer implementation from the OpenSeq2Seq¬†0 framework of NVIDIA, using the WMT16 dataset for translating from English to German (EN-DE). Finally, PTBLM¬† is an LSTM network for language modeling using the Penn Treebank dataset. Accuracy is reported as Word Error Rate (WER) for speech recognition (lower is better), bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) for machine translation (higher is better), and perplexity for language modeling (lower is better). For all the DNNs, we employ the entire evaluation sets from their respective datasets, including several hours of audio and a large number of texts, to assess the efficiency of our computation reuse scheme in terms of performance and energy consumption. Our workloads represent important machine learning applications, and the selected DNNs cover three of the most common approaches for sequence processing: MLPs, LSTMs and GRUs.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: CACTI-P¬†.
