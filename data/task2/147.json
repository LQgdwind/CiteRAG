      "content": "Paper Title: Sketchformer: Transformer-based Representation for Sketched Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSketch representation and interpretation remains an open challenge, particularly for complex and casually constructed drawings. Yet, the ability to classify, search, and manipulate sketched content remains attractive as gesture and touch interfaces reach ubiquity. Advances in recurrent network architectures within language processing have recently inspired sequence modeling approaches to sketch (e.g. SketchRNN [ref]12) that encode sketch as a variable length sequence of strokes, rather than in a rasterized or ‘pixel’ form. In particular, long-short term memory (LSTM) networks have shown significant promise in learning search embeddings   due to their ability to model higher-level structure and temporal order versus convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on rasterized sketches   [ref]6 . Yet, the limited temporal extent of LSTM restricts the structural complexity of sketches that may be accommodated in sequence embeddings. In language modeling domain, this shortcoming has been addressed through the emergence of Transformer networks   [ref]28 in which slot masking enhances the ability to learn longer term temporal structure in the stroke sequence. This paper proposes Sketchformer, the first Transformer based network for learning a deep representation for free-hand sketches. We build on the language modeling Transformer architecture of Vaaswani et al. [ref]28 to develop several variants of Sketchformer that process sketch sequences in continuous and tokenized forms. We evaluate the efficacy of each learned sketch embedding for common sketch interpretation tasks. We make three core technical contributions:\n1) Sketch Classification. We show that Sketchformer driven by a dictionary learning tokenization scheme outperforms state of the art sequence embeddings for sketched object recognition over QuickDraw! ; the largest and most diverse public corpus of sketched objects.\n2) Generative Sketch Model. We show that for more complex, detailed sketches comprising lengthy stroke sequences, Sketchformer improves generative modeling of sketch -- demonstrated by higher fidelity reconstruction of sketches from the learned embedding. We also show that for sketches of all complexities, interpolation in the Sketchformer embedding is stable, generating more plausible intermediate sketches for both inter- and intra-class blends.\n3) Sketch based Image Retrieval (SBIR) We show that Sketchformer can be unified with raster embedding to produce a search embedding for SBIR (after  for LSTM) to deliver improved prevision over a large photo corpus (Stock10M). These enhancements to sketched object understanding, generative modeling and matching demonstrated for a diverse and complex sketch dataset suggest Transformer as a promising direction for stroke sequence modeling.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: as gesture and touch interfaces reach ubiquity.
