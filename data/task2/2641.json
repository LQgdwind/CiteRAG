      "content": "Paper Title: Identification of Driver Phone Usage Violations via State-of-the-Art Object Detection with Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditionally, any kind of object identification with the use of video surveillance would be done manually and could involve the laborious task of humans either monitoring the live stream of the camera or reviewing historic footage. This difficult and tiresome task meant that a more intelligent approach would eventually be required . Object detection is a computer vision task concerned with detecting and classifying objects within an image. The use of this technology has paved the way for a more automated solution into video surveillance applications. Examples of such tasks include Licence Plate Recognition (LPR) , people tracking, vehicle counting, or unattended baggage in airports. We can describe two-major historic milestones in the development of object detection: “traditional object detection period” (pre 2014)    and “learning-based detection period” . It was not until 2015 where object detection could be utilised in real-time video with the development of Faster Regional-Based Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) [ref]5, an improvement from its predecessor R-CNN [ref]21 in both accuracy and speed. Modern-day object detectors can be categorised into two types: one-stage (YOLO [ref]8 , SSD , and CenterNet ) and two-stage (R-CNN series including Fast R-CNN , Faster R-CNN [ref]5, R-FCN ,\nand Libra R-CNN ). Two-stage detectors generally split the overall object detection task as follows: the first stage is to generate proposals, and then the second stage focuses on the verification and recognition of these proposals . The two-stage detectors are typically slower due to their heavy-head design but detect with a higher level of accuracy , whilst one-stage approaches tend to be faster but can be more limited in terms of their predictive performance .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and “learning-based detection period” .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
