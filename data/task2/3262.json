      "content": "Paper Title: DIAL: Deep Interactive and Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nActive Learning aims at optimizing the training process of a learning algorithm through an iterative collaboration with a human oracle [ref]10. It makes the algorithm choose from a pool of unlabeled data which ones would be the most relevant to improve itself. Then, the oracle provides the asked labels and the algorithm can learn from it. As it defines how to select the data samples to annotate, the acquisition function is the key differentiating component of these methods. These acquisition functions usually rely on an uncertainty, a representativeness or a diversity score computed directly with the model to select the most relevant samples. Uncertainty methods can rely on simple criteria like entropy  or disagreement between ensemble models  to estimate the model’s prediction confidence. As uncertainty-based methods do not aim to be representative of the dataset, they can select very similar examples. To address this issue, representativeness-based methods aim to select the samples in order to form a subset as representative as possible of the entire dataset. Addressing this as a core-set approach,  solves it like the K-center problem using the L2 distance between the activations of the final fully-connected layer of the CNN. Finally, often relying on clustering  , diversity-based active learning aims to select samples that are as diverse (i.e. different) as possible to reduce the redundancy among the selected samples. In the past decade, active learning has been deeply explored in remote sensing to train algorithms for animal detection  , image classification  , image segmentation [ref]39 and recently for change detection [ref]22. We borrow from active learning techniques to smoothly help the agent to guide our interactive neural network. We focus on uncertainty measures which fit our use-case better than representativeness ones since we aim to easily spot wrong predictions and not to increase our training set.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Active Learning aims at optimizing the training process of a learning algorithm through an iterative collaboration with a human oracle [ref]10.
