      "content": "Paper Title: HetPipe: Enabling Large DNN Training on (Whimpy) Heterogeneous GPU Clusters through Integration of Pipelined Model Parallelism and Data Parallelism\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPipelining has been leveraged to improve the performance of\nmachine learning systems     [ref]29.\nA pipelining scheme is employed to handle expensive backpropagation .\nPipe-SGD pipelines the processing of a minibatch to hide communication\ntime in AllReduce based systems [ref]29.\nA weight prediction technique is proposed to address the staleness issue\nin pipelined model parallelism .\nDetailed comparisons of HetPipe with PipeDream \nand GPipe  are provided in Section 2.3.\nNote that the feature of overlapping computation and communication, presented in PipeDream ,\nwill also improve the performance of our system.\nPipeDream employs the one-forward-one-backward scheduling algorithm for pipeline execution where the minimum number of minibatches that is large\nenough to saturate the pipeline are admitted.\nSophisticated schedulers that consider various factors\nsuch as heterogeneous configurations, the number of partitions,\nand the number of concurrent minibatches within a virtual worker,\ncan potentially improve the performance of HetPipe.\nTechniques to optimize learning rates have been studied , which can also be applied to HetPipe to help converge faster. Decentralized training systems that consider heterogeneous environments have also been studied [ref]31 [ref]30.\nHowever, these techniques do not consider integration of DP with PMP, which allows support for large models that do not fit into single GPU memory.\nIn AD-PSGD, once a mini-batch is\nprocessed, a worker updates the parameters by averaging\nthem with only one neighbor which is randomly selected [ref]30.\nThis is done asynchronously, allowing faster workers to continue.\nIn theory, the convergence rate of AD-PSGD is the same as SGD.\nIn principle, the contribution of AD-PSGD is orthogonal with the contributions of HetPipe in that we can extend our HetPipe further by adapting the idea of asynchronous decentralized update in AD-PSGD when there is a bottleneck in the parameter server. When it comes to the experimental evaluations, the performance of AD-PSGD is evaluated for DNN models whose sizes are 1MB, 60MB, and 100MB, which are smaller than the models we consider in HetPipe.\nFor a decentralized training system, Hop [ref]31 considers the bounded staleness\nand backup workers, and uses CIFAR-10\nfor performance evaluation on a CNN model.\n There have been earlier efforts to employ DP and/or\nMP for model training. Project Adam uses both DP and MP\nto train machine learning models on CPUs .\nPal et al. combine DP and MP in a similar way as our\nsystem, but do not consider pipelining nor heterogeneous GPUs .\nSTRADS leverages MP to address the issues of uneven convergence of parameters\nand parameter dependencies .\nFlexFlow considers utilizing parallelism in various dimensions such as\nsample, operator, attribute and parameters to maximize parallelization\nperformance .\nBounded staleness has been explored where Jiang et al. present heterogeneity-aware parameter synchronization algorithms that are based on the SSP model , while Cui et al. analyze the effects of bounded staleness .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Pipelining has been leveraged to improve the performance of\nmachine learning systems     [ref]29.\nA pipelining scheme is employed to handle expensive backpropagation .\nPipe-SGD pipelines the processing of a minibatch to hide communication\ntime in AllReduce based systems [ref]29.\nA weight\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
