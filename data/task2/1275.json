      "content": "Paper Title: On 𝐶⁰-persistent homology and trees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the work of Le Gall and Curien  , we define a tree constructed from a compact, connected and locally path connected space X𝑋X and a continuous function f:X→ℝ:𝑓→𝑋ℝf:X\\to\\mathbb{R} using a pseudo-distance on X𝑋X defined in terms of f𝑓f (section 2.1). We use this constructed tree to extend the work of Curry  previously valid under a Morse assumption to every continuous function. More precisely, we prove that it is possible to retrieve the barcode of the function from the constructed tree via an explicit algorithm (theorem 2.16). We show that the map assigning a function f: [ref]1→ℝ:𝑓→01ℝf: [ref]1\\to\\mathbb{R} to its constructed tree Tfsubscript𝑇𝑓T_{f} is a surjection onto the space of trees of finite upper-box dimension and provide an explicit construction of an inverse image (section 2.3). Following previous work by Picard  and Schweinhart , we introduce the so-called persistence index of degree k𝑘k, ℒk​(f)subscriptℒ𝑘𝑓{\\mathcal{L}}_{k}(f) of a function f:X→ℝ:𝑓→𝑋ℝf:X\\to\\mathbb{R} (definition 3.3). For a regular enough metric spaces X𝑋X, if f𝑓f is Hölder continuous (or Hölder continuous up to precomposition by a homeomorphism), we show an upper bound for ℒ0​(f)subscriptℒ0𝑓{\\mathcal{L}}_{0}(f) in terms of dim¯⁡(X)¯dim𝑋\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(X) (lemma 3.13) and show that ℒ0​(f)=dim¯⁡(Tf)subscriptℒ0𝑓¯dimsubscript𝑇𝑓{\\mathcal{L}}_{0}(f)=\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(T_{f}), where Tfsubscript𝑇𝑓T_{f} denotes the tree constructed from f𝑓f (theorem 3.9). We modify Schweinhart’s definition for the k𝑘kth degree homological dimension of X𝑋X (definition 3.31) as and show that under for X𝑋X regular enough, we retrieve a well-known result by Kozma et al. that dimPH0(X)=dim¯⁡(X)subscriptsuperscriptdimension0PH𝑋¯dim𝑋\\dim^{0}_{\\operatorname{PH}}(X)=\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(X)  and moreover that the supremum in this definition is attained generically (theorem 3.19). Moreover, dimPHk(X)superscriptsubscriptdimensionPH𝑘𝑋\\dim_{\\operatorname{PH}}^{k}(X) can be bounded above by dim¯⁡(X)¯dim𝑋\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(X), up to a factor which may depend on k𝑘k and the regularity of X𝑋X (theorem 3.23). We show that the supremum in the definition of dimPHksubscriptsuperscriptdimension𝑘PH\\dim^{k}_{\\operatorname{PH}} could have been taken over any regularity class Cα​(X,ℝ)superscript𝐶𝛼𝑋ℝC^{\\alpha}(X,\\mathbb{R}), up to a factor of α𝛼\\alpha (theorems 3.19 and 3.23) and show a genericity result for the set of functions in Cα​(X,ℝ)superscript𝐶𝛼𝑋ℝC^{\\alpha}(X,\\mathbb{R}) satisfying dim¯⁡(X)=ℒ0​(f)¯dim𝑋subscriptℒ0𝑓\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(X)={\\mathcal{L}}_{0}(f). Moreover, under more stringent conditions on X𝑋X, we show the same genericity result holds in fact for dim¯⁡(X)≤ℒk​(f)¯dim𝑋subscriptℒ𝑘𝑓\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(X)\\leq{\\mathcal{L}}_{k}(f) for integer 0≤k<dim¯⁡(X)0𝑘¯dim𝑋0\\leq k<\\operatorname{\\overline{dim}}(X) and show the equality case with some supplementary conditions on X𝑋X and in particular for compact Riemannian manifolds (theorem 3.29). In so doing, we answer a question by Schweinhart  regarding bounds on homological dimensions and regularity conditions on X𝑋X for this bound to be sharp (section 3.3). Using the results relating to the bounds on the homological dimensions, we give a Wasserstein stability result valid for all degrees of Čech homology on regular enough metric spaces (which in particular include all compact smooth manifolds of convexity radius bounded below) (theorem 4.13), for which explicit bounds on the constant CXsubscript𝐶𝑋C_{X} are given and sharp bounds on the regime of validity of the theorem (corollary 4.16). We show an annex result of stability for the trees constructed from the functions f𝑓f in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the trees (theorem 4.21). Finally, we discuss some easy consequences of these results applied to the stochastic setting (section 5) and prove Chazal et al.-like results  for the dpsubscript𝑑𝑝d_{p}-stability of average diagrams of stochastic processes with an a priori hypothesis of regularity (theorem 5.8).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: More precisely, we prove that it is possible to retrieve the barcode of the function from the constructed tree via an explicit algorithm (theorem 2.16).
