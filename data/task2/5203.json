      "content": "Paper Title: Distribution Fitting for Combating Mode Collapse in Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative adversarial networks (GANs) 3 have attracted much attention since the first introduction. Owing to its excellent performance, this adversarial training scheme became one of the most significant achievements in the machine learning field of the past decades. The framework simultaneously trains two sub-networks: a generator that generates samples from a noise vector and a discriminator designed to distinguish real and fake samples. In the optimal case, the generated samples cannot be discriminated from the real ones. However, GAN training is dynamic and sensitive to nearly every aspect of its setup, from optimization parameters to model architecture [ref]4. Thus, GANs encounter challenges in the training process. Mode collapse is one of the main obstacles, which represents that GANs may fail to model the full distribution and some minor modes might not be captured. Even a simple Gaussian mixture model can work better than GANs on capturing the underlying distribution and provides an explicit representation of the statistical structure [ref]36. To address the issue, researchers presented various methods, including applying multi-generators  , improving the training strategy    , using penalty modules      and adding constraints  5 9   6  1 9 0. There are also methods for unbalanced or very small samples under different categories  4 . However, mode collapse remains a troublesome issue in complicated applications of GANs. Researchers are still working hard on it 7  2  8. Therefore, the study of methods for combating mode collapse remains of great importance. In GANs 3, the output of the discriminator represents the probability that the input sample came from the real data. The authors demonstrated that the generator’s global minimum under the optimal discriminator is reached if and only if the generated distribution is the same as the real one. However, we notice that the minimum value is also reachable while the generated and real distributions are not the same due to the nonuniform sampling in the training process. In this case, the sampled distribution cannot adequately denote the complete real distribution, and the GAN objective can occasionally reach the minimum in practical training. As a result, the risks of mode collapse will increase and GAN training will be sensitive, requiring us to adjust each parameter carefully. Therefore, we consider that the nonuniform sampling issue is one of the reasons which leads to mode collapse. However, the existing techniques mostly aim at other aspects of the mode collapse issues, which cannot handle the mentioned problem well. Meanwhile, some disadvantages are also obstacles to applications of the existing methods, such as heavy computation, requirements of manual design, and lack of interpretability. Thus, related research on this problem is still valuable and indispensable. In this work, we propose a global distribution fitting method to combat the mode collapse problem. We design a penalty to constrain the generated data’s distribution and incorporate it into the training objective. We prove that on the basis of not changing the global minimum of the GAN objective, the method will make it harder to reach the minimum value while the generated and real distributions are not the same. Furthermore, to cope with situations where the overall real data is unreachable, we propose a local distribution fitting method, utilizing sampled distribution to match the real one. The proposed methods will not bring heavy computation or require complicated manual design, making it easy to implement them in other frameworks. The experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and competitive performance. To summarize, there are three main contributions in this work: We analyze the causes of mode collapse from a new perspective. Because of the nonuniform sampling in practical training, the GAN objective could reach the minimum value when the generated and real distributions are not the same. Therefore, the training will be sensitive and risks of mode collapse will increase. We propose global and local distribution fitting methods to suppress mode collapse. On the basis of not changing the global minimum of the GAN objective, the method will make the objective harder to reach the minimum when the generated distribution is not the same as the real one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with both theoretical derivation and experiments. The theorems and proofs are also of great reference value for other methods based on distribution or feature matching.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: generated samples cannot be discriminated from the real ones.
