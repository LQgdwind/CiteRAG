      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Agent Chance-Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path with Application to Risk-Aware Intelligent Intersection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting vehicle coordination methods, which are designed primarily for human drivers, tend to fall short in leveraging the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles (AVs). With the progress of self-driving technologies, the bottleneck of roadway efficiency will no longer be attributed to drivers but rather to the automation scheme underpinning the coordination of AVs’ actions. A crucial challenge for these schemes lies in detecting and reasoning about uncertainties in the operating environment. In urban scenarios, uncertainty arises predominantly111Other sources of uncertainty could stem from vehicle perception and trajectory tracking error due to road and weather conditions. from human-driven vehicles (HVs) as their intention could exhibit a stochastic and oftentimes risky behavior. Unlike streets/highways with well-delimited lanes, intersections typically lack clear marking, thereby creating “conflict zones” with elevated potential for crashes. In fact, as reported in , 40% of all crashes and 20% of fatalities happen to occur at intersections. These uncertainties can be mitigated by a risk-aware Intelligent Intersection system in which AVs’ actions are judiciously planned and coordinated in a centralized or decentralized fashion. While coordination can be achieved either way, the former approach is less prone to communication overheads and packet loss, does not suffer from synchronization issues and offers enhanced system-wide controllability, hence the focus of the present work on the centralized scheme. In line with this rationale, Dresner et al.  developed a protocol for multi-vehicle coordination via a centralized controller relying on Vehicle-to-Intersection (V2I) communication network . The protocol employs a reservation mechanism wherein AVs declare their destinations to the controller and wait until permission is granted. The controller provides each vehicle with trajectory details, modeled as a path on an abstracted grid map, as well as destination speed. The work is extended in  with a refined trajectory representation considering vehicle kinematics. To avoid collisions, a grid-based collision map is constructed with inflated grid cells as a buffer. However, tuning cell size heuristically yields more conservative behavior when the cell is large and deteriorated performance when small, with no clear relationship to the actual probability of collision. Furthermore, the coordination mechanisms in   rest on the First-come-first-serve (FCFS) principle, which lacks guarantees on the global optimality of the attained objective value (e.g., maximum throughput). Different from existing centralized planners for optimizing intersection management (e.g.,   [ref]5 ), we develop a chance-constrained model which alongside optimal control ensures that collision probability remains within prescribed limits despite the imposed uncertainty. In planning under uncertainty, the Multi-agent Markov Decision Process (MMDP), which extends the classical MDP  to multiple agents, is a well-established mathematical formalism . A special class of MDPs with non-negative utilities is known as the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP)  (a.k.a. Stochastic Longest Path). Notoriously, MMDPs suffer from an exponential joint action space and a state space that is typically exponential in the number of agents. Notable research efforts have been directed towards exploiting agents’ interactions to facilitate the problem’s tractability (see, e.g., 0 1). Of particular interest, we consider MMDPs with local interactions 2 3, where agents have to coordinate their actions only at certain interaction zones. We explore such an interaction scheme within an SSP framework with additional constraints that capture the probability of failure (e.g., collision) under several risk criteria. In particular, as exemplified in Fig. 1(a), the studied intersection is modelled as a collection of finite “interaction” points where vehicles (i.e., agents) are likely to collide. However, contrary to prior methods which encode failure as a negative penalty 3 2, we bound the probability of collision by a preset threshold. This allows for a more versatile representation of safety requirements and has been adopted recently in the literature for the single AV scenario 4 5. We remark that the solution techniques for MMDPs provided in 2 3 are not amenable to these newly introduced constraints. To further the design of safe and efficient traffic management programs, the present study proposes a risk-aware Intelligent Intersection system for AVs and HVs that, in spite of possible uncertainties, maximizes intersection’s throughput without infringing the desired risk tolerance level. More concretely, the contributions and roadmap of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n In Sec. III, we lay out the architecture of the proposed Intelligent Intersection framework where AVs are proctored by a centralized controller whereas HVs follow traffic light signals. As illustrated in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d), the system is augmented with a probabilistic intent detector as well as robust motion model generator for HVs, allowing to cater for real-world nuances (e.g., imperfect trajectory estimation, ambiguity in drivers’ decisions). In Sec. IV, we formulate a novel Multi-agent Chance-Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path (MCC-SSP) model with local interactions and devise an exact solution method based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Through rigorous analytical scrutiny, the probabilistic constraints in MCC-SSP are proved reducible to equivalent linear ones in ILP (Theorem 1). More importantly, the ILP formulation features polynomial number of variables and constraints when the number of agents per interaction is small, thereby improving upon the state-of-the-art designed for the single agent case 6 7. Drawing on MCC-SSP formalism, Sec. V develops a conditional planner that enables AVs to react to potential contingencies (e.g., an unexpected maneuver from an HV). The planner supplies AVs with safe (w.r.t. permissible risk limit) contingency plans – a maneuver for every possible scenario. A hybrid risk calculation method is employed, permitting the computations to be carried out offline in most cases. Subsequently, Sec. VI models the reference trajectories via multi-variate Gaussian processes known as Probabilistic Flow Tubes (PFT) 8 (see Fig. 1(c)) and presents a computationally efficient means of estimating their collision probabilities. Lastly, Sec. VII validates the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed risk-aware intelligent intersection system through a series of simulations. Specifically, taking the classical grid problem as a case study we first demonstrate the scalability of the introduced ILP formulation against the number of agents and horizons as well as its invariance to the number of states. Next, we investigate the proposed planner’s computational feasibility and contrast its performance with that of common approaches: FCFS and standard signalized scheme. As simulations indicate, the featured planner outperforms the two benchmarks by up to a factor of 2 in maximizing the intersection’s throughput and supports rapid planning for multiple horizons (>1​H​zabsent1𝐻𝑧>1Hz).\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: lacks guarantees on the global optimality of the attained objective value (e.g., maximum throughput).
