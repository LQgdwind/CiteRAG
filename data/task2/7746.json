However, by multiplying the right-hand sides of all equations,\nwe get −11-1. Note that this argument used implicitly the assumption that the\nvariables commute pairwise even if they do not appear in the same equation,\nwhich is true over {−1,+1}11\\{-1,+1\\}.\nThus, this argument does not hold if one assumes that\nonly variables occurring\nin the same equation commute pairwise. In fact, Mermin famously established that\nthe system (1) has a solution consisting of linear operators on a\nHilbert space of dimension four   and the\nconstruction is now know as the Mermin-Peres magic\nsquare . This construction proves the\nBell-Kochen-Specker theorem on the impossibility to explain quantum\nmechanics via hidden variables  . Any Boolean CSP instance, just like the one above, can be associated with a certain non-local game with two\nplayers, say Alice and Bob, who are unable to communicate while the game is in\nprogress. Alice is given a constraint at\nrandom and must return a satisfying assignment to the variables in the\nconstraint. Bob is given a variable from the constraint and must return an\nassignment to the variable. The two players win if they assign the same value to\nthe chosen variable. With shared randomness, Alice and Bob can play the game\nperfectly if and only the instance is satisfiable [ref]18.\nThe Mermin-Peres\nconstruction  \nwas the first example of an instance where the players can play perfectly by\nsharing an entangled quantum state although the instance is not satisfiable. We\nnote that   were looking at quantum contextuality scenarios rather than\nnon-local games and it was Aravind who reformulated the construction in the above-described\ngame setting [ref]1, cf. also . The game was introduced for any Boolean\nCSP by Cleve and Mittal [ref]18\nand further studied by Cleve, Liu, and Slofstra . Every Boolean relation can be identified with its characteristic function, which\nhas a unique representation as a multilinear polynomial via the Fourier\ntransform. The multilinear polynomial representation of Boolean relations (and\nthus also Boolean CSPs) makes it possible to consider relaxations of\nsatisfiability in which the variables take values in a suitable space,\nrather than in {−1,+1}11\\{-1,+1\\}. Such relaxations of satisfiability have been\nconsidered in the foundations of physics long ago, playing an important role in\nour understanding of the differences between classical and quantum theories.\nIn detail, given a Boolean CSP instance, a classical assignment assigns to every\nvariable a value from {−1,+1}11\\{-1,+1\\}. An operator assignment assigns to every\nvariable a linear operator A𝐴A on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space (which\nmeans, up to a choice of basis, a matrix with complex entries) so that A2=Isuperscript𝐴2𝐼A^{2}=I\nand each A𝐴A is self-adjoint, i.e., A=A∗𝐴superscript𝐴A=A^{*} and thus in particular A𝐴A is\nnormal, meaning that A​A∗=A∗​A𝐴superscript𝐴superscript𝐴𝐴AA^{*}=A^{*}A.333A∗superscript𝐴A^{*} denotes the conjugate\ntranspose; all concepts are fully defined and details provided in\nSection 2. Furthermore, it is required that operators\nassigned to variables from the scope of some constraint pairwise commute. Ji showed that for Boolean\nCSPs corresponding to 2-SAT there is no difference between (classical)\nsatisfiability and satisfiability via operators .\nLater, Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini established a complete classification for all Boolean CSPs parameterized by the set of\nallowed constraint relations. In particular, they showed that only CSPs whose\nrelations come from 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, or Dual\nHorn-SAT have “no satisfiability gap” in the sense that (classic)\nsatisfiability is equivalent to operator satisfiability; for all other Boolean CSPs, there is a satisfiability gap in the\nsense that there are instances that are not (classically) satisfiable but are\nsatisfiable via operators just as in the Mermin-Peres magic square.\nThe “no-gap” part of the result is established by the substitution\nmethod [ref]18. The “gap” part of the result is\nestablished by showing that reductions between CSPs based on primitive positive\nformulas, which preserve complexity and were used to establish Schaefer’s\nclassification of Boolean CSPs, preserve satisfiability gaps.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: to the variable. The two players win if they assign the same value to\nthe chosen variable. With shared randomness, Alice and Bob can play the game\nperfectly if and only the instance is satisfiable [ref]18.\nThe Mermin-Peres\nconstruction  \nwas the first example of an instance where the players can play perfectly by\nsharing an entangled quantum state although the instance is not satisfiable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
