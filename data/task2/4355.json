      "content": "Paper Title: Egocentric Scene Understanding via Multimodal Spatial Rectifier\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur egocentric scene understanding lies in the intersection between single view geometry and equivariant spatial rectifier. We briefly review the related work.\n Single View Depth and Surface Normal Single view scene understanding approaches have shown great progress by leveraging a large amount of data such as ScanNet  that supervises to learn the mapping from an image to a 3D scene geometry such as depths  [ref]9   0       9 1    2   or surface normals   [ref]9 4   3 5 0 .\nExisting methods that show remarkable performance on scene understanding tasks have focused on either: (1) designing deep neural network architectures   ; or (2) exploiting useful 2D visual cues for learning 3D geometry, including textures 3, vanishing points 5, planar surfaces 4 , and depth-surface normal consistency .\nNevertheless, they are only enabled by large-scale indoor RGBD datasets, such as ScanNet , NYUv2 , Sun3D 8, and Sun RGBD 1.\nHowever, due to the nature of data collection methods, a model trained on such datasets show a notable performance degradation when applying it to egocentric images because of two reasons: (1) The model has not exposed to the tilted images that have substantially different visual patterns from that of upright images. (2) The model has limited capability of learning dynamic foreground objects that are abundant in egocentric scenes, e.g., hands, pots, pans, vacuums, brooms, pets, and humans.\nTo address these challenges in egocentric images, we make use of a multimodal spatial rectifier, which allows using large existing datasets in conjunction with egocentric datasets. Rotation Equivariance Equivariance is a geometric property of a visual representation: the visual representation in an image must be transformed, according to the transformation of the scene.\nEnforcing equivariance in learning a scene geometry allows geometrically coherent learned models.\nTo achieve this, camera poses 2 and gravity directions  can be employed.\nFor instance, equivariance is used to learn the geometry of scenes by augmenting transformations, i.e., spatial rectifier  that rectifies a tilted image to an upright (gravity-aligned) image 9  0.\nDespite the substantial improvement on the tilted images, the spatial rectifier with a unimodal gravity-aligned direction shows poor performance on egocentric images.\nIt is mainly caused by excessive warping of egocentric images due to a large variation of camera angle, e.g., nearly 90 degree pitch angle when engaging eye-hand coordination.\nOur multimodal spatial rectifier prevents such excessive perspective warp by predicting multiple reference directions, which significantly improves the egocentric scene understanding task. Egocentric Scene Datasets Egocentric scene datasets have been used for a wide range of tasks such as action recognition 2 1 0, action anticipation  7, and many others 7 5 6.\nNotably, Damen et al.  proposed EPIC-KITCHENS, a large-scale egocentric benchmark with densely annotated actions and object interactions in the kitchen environment.\nA few egocentric RGBD datasets that exist were designed for activity recognition 8  8 3.\nWith a few exception, such datasets do not include the 3D gravity direction that is critical for learning an equivariant representation.\nOur EDINA dataset provides synchronized RGBD and gravity directions captured from an egocentric viewpoint with diverse daily activities.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: understanding approaches have shown great progress by leveraging a large amount of data such as ScanNet  that supervises to learn the mapping from an image to a 3D scene geometry such as depths  [ref]9   0       9 1    2   or surface normals   [ref]9 4   3 5 0 .\nExisting methods that show remarkable performance on scene understanding tasks have focused on either: (1) designing deep neural\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
