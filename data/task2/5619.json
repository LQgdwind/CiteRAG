      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Task Self-Supervised Time-Series Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs various self-supervised learning approaches have been proposed in diverse domains, multi-task self-supervised learning has been studied to learn general representations. In computer vision, multi-task self-supervised learning methods were proposed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer [ref]33. [ref]34 combined context prediction , colorization [ref]20, exemplar , and motion segmentation  using CNN architecture. This method explored lasso-regularized combination and harmonizing network inputs for effective multi-task self-supervision.  trained Vision Transformer to learn visual features by investigating the merits of image reconstruction, rotation prediction, and contrastive learning. A multi-task objective function was derived using an uncertainty weighting approach to mitigate difficulty in optimizing the fixed weights of each task. In natural language processing,  proposed a multi-task self-supervised learning method for disfluency detection. This method combined tagging to detect the added noisy word and sentence classification to distinguish the original sentences from the ones with grammatical errors. In speech recognition,  enabled robust speech recognition by jointly learning regression workers to predict speech features and binary workers to capture higher-level information from the speech signal. Finally, in time-series analysis,  proposed a multi-task self-supervised learning for human activity detection. It learned time-series representations by integrating multiple binary classifications to recognize various transformations. However, it cannot be generally applied to other time-series data because of its specific application.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: has been studied to learn general representations.
