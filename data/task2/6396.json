Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

The key idea is to represent textual descriptions of companies as dense vectors (a.k.a.,¬†embeddings) in a high-dimensional space, such that the similarity between two companies can be measured by the proximity between their corresponding vectors.\nThe text embeddings are usually obtained using pretrained LMs, such as BERT , T5 , LLaMA  and GPT-3/4 [ref]10 [ref]11.\nThe pretrained LMs can be used directly, or finetuned on company descriptions in a supervised  , semi-supervised [ref]8, or Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) paradigm  to further improve the performance of proximity search.\nSupervised and semi-supervised methods typically yield superior performance (than SSL) on domain-specific tasks, when high-quality annotations are available[ref]8.\nThis limits its applicability in scenarios where the annotation is scarce, noisy, or costly to obtain. ùëµùëµ\\bm{N}-shot prompting. The recent rapid development of LLMs such as GPT-3/4 [ref]10 [ref]11, LLaMA  and LaMDA  has led to significant improvements in general-purpose conversational AI like ChatGPT .\nBy prompting them with N‚â•0ùëÅ0N\\!\\geq\\!0 examples, the instruction tuned models can answer questions about identifying similar companies, for example\n‚ÄúCan you name 10 companies that are similar to EQT?‚Äù\nAs a result, NùëÅN-shot prompting has emerged as a potential tool for investment professionals (e.g.,¬† ) looking to\nconduct similar company search and analysis.\nHowever, this approach is currently limited by several factors:\n(1) to ensure the model‚Äôs responses are up-to-date, relevant, and precise, a large amount of domain-specific information must be incorporated, an active area of research with various methods such as contextual priming and fine-tuning being explored;\n(2) the decision-making process may not be explainable, making it difficult to understand and trust the answer;\n(3) the performance is closely tied to meticulous design of prompts.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: between two companies can be measured by the proximity between their corresponding vectors.\nThe text embeddings are usually obtained using pretrained LMs, such as BERT , T5 , LLaMA  and GPT-3/4 [ref]10 [ref]11.\nThe pretrained LMs can be used directly, or finetuned on company descriptions in a supervised  , semi-supervised [ref]8, or Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) paradigm  to further\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
