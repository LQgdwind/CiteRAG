Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Note that standard VI procedure requires access to a fully-specified MDP, over which we can generate VI trajectories to use as training data. When an MDP is not available, following the remarks of , we generate synthetic discrete MDPs that align with the target MDP as much as possible444If no prior knowledge about the environment is known, one might resort to generic graph distributions, such as Erd≈ës-R√©nyi [ref]12 or Barab√°si-Albert [ref]2.‚Äîfinding that useful transfer still occurs, echoing the findings of . To summarise in brief, the executor function training proceeds as follows: First, generate a dataset of MDPs which, as much as possible, mimics in some way the characteristics of the true MDP we‚Äôd like to deploy on (e.g. determinism, number of actions, etc.). If no such knowledge is available upfront, resort to a generic graph distribution like Erd≈ës-R√©nyi or Barab√°si-Albert. Then, execute the Value Iteration algorithm on these MDPs, keeping track of intermediate values Vt‚Äã(s)subscriptùëâùë°ùë†V_{t}(s) at each iteration tùë°t, until convergence.
