      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Augmentation for Class-Imbalanced Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we carry out systematic experiments and analysis to validate the proposed ToBA framework in the following aspects:\n(i) Effectiveness in both promoting imbalanced node classification and mitigating the prediction bias between different classes.\n(ii) Versatility in cooperating with and further boosting various IGL techniques and GNN backbones.\n(iii) Robustness to extreme class imbalance.\n(iv) Efficiency in real-world applications.\nWe briefly introduce the experimental setup first, and then present the empirical results and analyses.\nPlease refer to the Appendix for more reproducibility details (¬ß¬†A), as well as extended empirical results and discussions (¬ß¬†B). *ToBAP/ToBAT: ToBA with prediction-/topology-based candidate class selection. We report the average score of 5 independent runs to eliminate randomness Due to space limitations, we omit the error bar and only report the best performance for most settings, full results can be found in the supplementary material. Datasets.\nWe validate ToBA on five benchmark datasets for semi-supervised node classification: three from the widely-used Plantoid citation graphs¬†[ref]37 (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed), and two from the Coauthor networks¬† (CS, Physics) with more nodes & edges and high-dimensional features to test ToBA on large graphs, detailed data statistics can be found in Appendix¬†A.1.\nFor citation networks, we follow the public splits in¬† where each class has 20 training nodes.\nFor coauthor networks, we use a similar split by randomly sampling 20 training nodes from each class.\nFollowing prevailing IGL studies¬†[ref]34  [ref]54, for a dataset with mùëöm classes, we select half of them (‚åäm/2‚åãùëö2\\lfloor m/2\\rfloor) as minority classes.\nThe imbalance ratio IR=#‚Äãmajority training nodes#‚Äãminority training nodes‚àà[1,‚àû)IR#majority training nodes#minority training nodes1\\text{IR}=\\frac{\\#\\text{majority training nodes}}{\\#\\text{minority training nodes}}\\in[1,\\infty), i.e., more imbalance ‚áî‚áî\\Leftrightarrow higher IR. Settings.\nTo fully validate ToBA‚Äôs performance and compatibility with existing IGL techniques and GNN backbones, we test six baseline methods with five popular GNN backbone architectures in our experiments, and apply ToBA with them under all possible combinations.\nWe consider two IGL reweighting baselines, the standard cost-sensitive Reweighting¬† and a topology-imbalance-aware node reweighting approach ReNode¬†.\nAs for resampling IGL baselines, we include two general methods Oversample¬† and SMOTE¬†, and two recent graph-specific augmentation techniques GSMOTE¬†[ref]54 and GENS¬†[ref]34.\nWe use the official public implementations of these IGL baselines for a fair comparison.\nNote that although there are other techniques available for IGL¬†  , previous studies¬†[ref]34  have shown they are generally outperformed by the baselines we use.\nOur baseline choices allow us to test the potential of ToBA to achieve further improvements on top of SOTA.\nWe further use five GNN backbones (GCN¬†, GAT¬†, GraphSAGE¬†, PPNP¬†, GPRGNN¬†) and three class-balanced metrics (Balanced Accuracy, Macro-F1, and Performance Disparity) for a comprehensive evaluation of ToBA.\nThe performance disparity is defined as the standard deviation of accuracy scores across all classes, thus a lower disparity indicates a smaller predictive bias.\nFor clarity, we use ‚Üë‚Üë\\uparrow/‚Üì‚Üì\\downarrow to denote larger/smaller is better for each metric. On the effectiveness and versatility of ToBA (Table¬†4).\nWe report the empirical results of applying ToBA with 6 IGL baselines and 5 GNN backbones on 3 imbalanced graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed¬†[ref]37) with IR=10 in Table¬†4.\nIn all 3 (datasets) x 5 (backbones) x 7 (baselines) x 2 (ToBA variants) x 3 (metrics) = 630 setting combinations, it achieves significant and consistent performance improvements on the basis of other IGL techniques, which also yields new state-of-the-art performance.\nIn addition to the superior performance in boosting classification, ToBA also greatly reduces the model predictive bias.\nSpecifically, we notice that:\n(1) ToBAT demonstrates better classification performance, while ToBAP performs better in terms of reducing performance disparity.\n(2) ToBA itself can already achieve superior IGL performance that is comparable to the best IGL baseline.\n(3) On the basis of the SOTA IGL baseline, ToBA can handle the topological challenges in IGL and further boost its performance by a large margin (e.g., ToBAT boost the best-balanced accuracy score by 6.08%/26.20%/8.15% on Cora/CiteSeer/PubMed dataset).\n(4) In addition to better performance, by mitigating the AMP and DMP, ToBA can also greatly reduce the predictive bias in IGL with up to 32.75%/57.62%/71.88% reduction in performance disparity on Cora/CiteSeer/PubMed.\nMore detailed results can be found in Appendix¬†B.3. Due to space limitations, we only report the best Balanced Accuracy score in each setting, full results can be found in the supplementary material. On the robustness of ToBA (Table¬†2).\nWe now test ToBA under varying types and levels of imbalance, results reported in Table¬†2.\nIn this experiment, we extend Table¬†4 and consider a more challenging scenario with IR = 20.\nIn addition, we consider the natural (long-tail) class imbalance¬†[ref]34 that is commonly observed in real-world graphs with IR of 50 and 100.\nDatasets from¬† (CS, Physics) are also included to test ToBA‚Äôs performance on large-scale tasks.\nResults show that:\n(1) ToBA is robust to extreme class imbalance, it consistently boosts the best IGL performance by a significant margin under varying types and levels of imbalance.\n(2) ToBA is capable of achieving performance comparable to that of the best IGL baseline.\n(3) The performance drop from increasing IR is significantly lowered by ToBA.\n(4) ToBA‚Äôs advantage is more prominent under higher class imbalance, e.g., on Cora with step IR, the performance gain of applying ToBA on Base is 13.4%/35.2% with IR = 10/20, similar patterns can be observed in other settings. On mitigating AMP and DMP (Fig.¬†6).\nWe further design experiments to verify whether ToBA can effectively handle the topological challenges identified in this paper, i.e., ambivalent and distant message-passing.\nSpecifically, we investigate whether ToBA can improve the prediction accuracy of minority class nodes that are highly influenced by ambivalent/distant message-passing, i.e., high local heterophilic ratios/long distance to supervision signals.\nResults are shown in Fig.¬†6 (5 independent runs with GCN classifier, IR=10).\nAs can be observed, ToBA effectively alleviates the negative impact of AMP and DMP and helps node classifiers to achieve better performance in minority classes. Complexity analysis (Table¬†3).\nToBA introduces mùëöm (the number of class) virtual nodes with ùí™‚Äã(n)ùí™ùëõ\\mathcal{O}(n) edges.\nBecause of the usage of relative risk in Eq.¬†(3) and the long-tail distribution of node uncertainty, only a small portion of nodes have positive risks with relatively few (empirically around 1-3%) virtual edges introduced.\nFor computation, most of the steps can be executed in parallel in matrix form on a modern GPU with ùí™‚Äã(1)ùí™1\\mathcal{O}(1)/ùí™‚Äã(m‚Äãn+|‚Ñ∞|)ùí™ùëöùëõ‚Ñ∞\\mathcal{O}(mn+|\\mathcal{E}|) time/space complexity.\nThe time complexity mostly depends on the topological similarity computation in Eq.(5) which requires the usage of torch.scatter_add * Results obtained on an NVIDIA¬Æ¬Æ{}^{\\text{\\textregistered}} Tesla V100 32GB GPU. function with ùí™‚Äã(n)ùí™ùëõ\\mathcal{O}(n) time cost.\nThis step is only needed for ToBAT, thus ToBAP is usually faster in practice.\nTable¬†3 reports the ratio of virtual nodes/edges to the original graph introduced and the running time of ToBA in each iteration on different datasets.\nWe discuss how to further speed up ToBA in practice in Appendix¬†B.1.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: results can be found in the supplementary material. Datasets.\nWe validate ToBA on five benchmark datasets for semi-supervised node classification: three from the widely-used Plantoid citation graphs¬†[ref]37 (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed), and two from the Coauthor networks¬† (CS, Physics) with more nodes & edges and high-dimensional features to test ToBA on large graphs, detailed data statistics can be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
