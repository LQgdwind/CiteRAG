      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Style Prompt Learning Using Diffusion Models for Blind Face Restoration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplementation.\nThe proposed framework was developed using Python and PyTorch.\nWe fine-tuned the style encoder from e4e  on our training dataset, with 150,000 iterations using a batch size of 16.\nFor the code diffuser, we trained 200,000 iterations with a batch size of 8 and a denoising step of 4 (T=4)(T=4) for both training and testing.\nThe variance schedule βt\\beta_{t} increased linearly from β1=0.1\\beta_{1}=0.1 to βT=0.99\\beta_{T}=0.99.\nThe restoration auto-encoder was trained with 500,000 iterations using a batch size of 4.\nBoth the code diffuser and restoration auto-encoder used the Adam optimizer (momentum coefficients 0.5 and 0.999, learning rate 0.0002).\nUnless otherwise stated, all experiments were conducted on the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Datasets. \nWe trained our algorithm on the FFHQ dataset , which comprises 70,000 high-resolution facial images, resized to 512×512512\\times 512 resolution.\nFrom the FFHQ dataset, we generated degraded images using the degradation model described in established literature  2. The degradation process is 𝐈d​e={[(𝐈g​t⊗𝐤σ)↓r+𝐧δ]J​P​E​Gq}↑r\\mathbf{I}_{de}=\\left\\{\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{I}_{gt}\\otimes\\mathbf{k}_{\\sigma}\\right)\\downarrow_{r}+\\mathbf{n}_{\\delta}\\right]_{JPEG_{q}}\\right\\}\\uparrow_{r}. Here, 𝐈d​e\\mathbf{I}_{de} and 𝐈g​t\\mathbf{I}_{gt} denote a degraded image and its corresponding high-quality counterpart, respectively. 𝐤σ\\mathbf{k}_{\\sigma} means the Gaussian blur kernel with σ\\sigma. 𝐧δ\\mathbf{n}_{\\delta} denotes the Gaussian noise with δ\\delta. [⋅]J​P​E​Gq[\\cdot]_{JPEG_{q}} is a JPEG compression with the quality factor qq. During training, the parameters σ\\sigma, rr, δ\\delta, and qq were randomly sampled from the given ranges (σ∈[0.2,10]\\sigma\\in[0.2,10], r∈ r\\in , δ∈[ref]0 \\delta\\in[ref]0 , and q∈ 00q\\in 00 ). For testing, our method was evaluated on both a synthetic dataset (CelebA-Test ) and three real-world datasets (LFW-Test [ref]43, CelebChild-Test 2, and WebPhoto-Test 2). The CelebA-Test  comprises 3,000 samples generated from CelebA-HQ images  using the above degradation process.\nLFW-Test has 1,711 images, which are extracted from the first image of each identity in LFW’s [ref]43 validation set.\nCelebChild-Test and WebPhoto-Test 2 contain 180 and 407 degraded facial images, respectively.\nNote that real-world datasets have no ground-truth images. Metrics.\nWe employed multiple evaluation metrics including the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), paired and unpaired inception discriminative scores (P-IDS/U-IDS) , the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE), the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).\nFID and NIQE have been recognized as benchmark non-reference metrics for assessing the quality of restored images.\nWe set the term FID for unpaired evaluation and FID† for paired evaluation.\nWe also ranked each method’s performance across all metrics using the mean rank, offering a comprehensive evaluation of overall performance.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: is a JPEG compression with the quality factor qq.
