      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse Attention Acceleration with Synergistic In-Memory Pruning and On-Chip Recomputation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnalog computing inaccuracies.\nAnalog computing in ReRAM is commonly known to be susceptible to inherent circuit noises and inaccuracies, such as thermal noise, temperature fluctuations, process variations, and coupling noise between adjacent cells   [ref]23.\nThese inaccuracies limit the feasible precision of computations in ReRAM crossbar arrays. To evaluate the impact of limited compute precision for in-memory thresholding on the final model accuracy, we use the following approach444As we explain in Section VII, we do not perform additional fine-tuning to quantize key values to lower bit-precision.: where ScoreRbsuperscriptsubscriptScoreRb\\mathrm{Score_{R}^{b}} denotes the in-memory score values (e.g. results of qi×𝒦Tsubscript𝑞𝑖superscript𝒦𝑇q_{i}\\times{\\mathcal{K}^{T}}) when the output has limited accuracy with a b𝑏b-bit precision.\n“Argwhere” finds the indices of score elements that are lower than the target threshold.\nNote that the threshold values (𝒯​h𝒯ℎ\\mathcal{T}h) are learned during the full-precision finetuning process such as LeOPArd  [ref]75.\nThe scores of the identified pruning indices are then forcefully set to a large negative value (−c𝑐-c) to remove irrelevant elements.\nAlso, recall that we perform low-precision in-memory computing for the sole purpose of identifying the irrelevant key vectors.\nWith on-chip accelerators, the score computation for unpruned vectors is still performed in full-precision. Figure 5 compares the final model accuracy after quantizing the ScoreScore\\mathrm{Score} with different bit-precision (b𝑏b) across three different models: BERT-Base  with GLUE [ref]143, BERT-Base with SQUAD , and ViT  with  dataset.\nThe results show that the quantization error with 4-bit precision virtually has no impact on the final model accuracy555A recent study from HP Lab  has shown that ReRAM in-memory computing for 64-tap dot-product delivers 5-bit equivalent output accuracy after including all the error sources..\nThus, the runtime pruning mechanism is robust against approximation, even when the computation has a certain level of errors.\nThis is intuitive because the incorrectly pruned vectors already exhibit a small score value, likely in the vicinity of 𝒯​h𝒯ℎ\\mathcal{T}h.\nHence, the impact on model accuracy is negligible.\nFinally, even more sensitive workload to the noise can be in theory compensated by adding a modest negative margin on top of 𝒯​h𝒯ℎ\\mathcal{T}h in Equation 3 at the cost of reducing the pruning ratio (directly proportional to hardware performance). ADC converter overhead.\nThe overhead of ADC converters increases proportionately to the precision of conversion.\nTwo design choices can support comparisons between vector-matrix multiplication outputs and the threshold values.\nThe first option uses a 5-bit ADC to convert the outputs and employs digital comparators for thresholding.\nThe other option utilizes analog comparators for thresholding prior to ADC.\nThe output of each analog comparison represents a binary value, which indicates whether to prune the corresponding key vector.\nSince the resulting pruning vector only requires one bit per key, we can use a low-overhead 1-bit ADC (implemented as a comparator).\nThe low overhead of 1-bit ADC (>20×\\times  lower area and >30×\\times  lower power consumption compared to a 5-bit ADC) favors the second option for in-memory thresholding. Reading unpruned vectors overhead.\nFinally, performing in-memory thresholding followed by fetching each unpruned 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} vector from ReRAM arrays (for digital re-compute) is arduous and can impose significant read latency.\nThis occurs because we store each vector of 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} vertically at each ReRAM column (Figure 4), and kisubscript𝑘𝑖k_{i} is mapped to the it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} ReRAM column.\nOn the other hand, accessing from ReRAM through a standard read operations fetches the data stored horizontally in a row.\nTherefore, fetching from ReRAM requires sequentially asserting all the (horizontal) wordlines, bringing in each row of the 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} matrix (even the ones associated with pruned k𝑘k vectors), and selectively fetching the unpruned vectors to on-chip buffers.\nWe address this challenge by a recent taped-out transposable ReRAM proposal , which we expound below.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: is commonly known to be susceptible to inherent circuit noises and inaccuracies, such as thermal noise, temperature fluctuations, process variations, and coupling noise between adjacent cells   [ref]23.\nThese inaccuracies limit the feasible precision of computations in ReRAM crossbar arrays.
