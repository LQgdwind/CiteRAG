      "content": "Paper Title: Constructing Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets using Contrastive Divergence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern deep learning models have shown impressive performance on a variety of applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing    8 1 .\nLarge training datasets and heavy computational infrastructure have played a pivotal role in achieving such performance. Moreover, the availability of large training datasets is critical to improving the performance of these models. This reliance on large datasets not only increases the computational complexity required to train these models but also adds to the total training time required to achieve acceptable accuracy. Typically, training time for larger datasets requires hundreds of GPU hours leading to enormous amounts of carbon emission which has adverse environmental impacts . There have been several attempts by researchers to reduce the reliance on large datasets. A naive approach to overcome this issue could be to randomly sample a subset from the original dataset and use it for training. However, such subsets need not necessarily reflect the diversity and information captured by original datasets.\nAnother common approach has been that of Core-Subset or ‘Coreset’ selection      5, which attempts to sample a small (informative) subset of the original data that can produce results comparable to the original dataset. However, finding an optimal solution to such a problem is NP-hard and often results in subpar performance. Further, it is shown that coreset methods scale poorly with the dimension of dataset leading to suboptimal subsets in higher dimensions 6. To address these issues, 6 proposed ‘Bayesian Psuedo-Coreset’ (BPC), a new technique for generating synthetic images that can scale to high-dimensional datasets. The general idea of BPC is to use gradient based optimization to reduce the divergence between the parameter posterior of the original dataset and the parameter posterior associated with the synthetic dataset. A parallel and closely related approach with same motivation is that of dataset condensation [ref]53  [ref]52 7   . The goal of these methods is same as that of bayesian pseudo-coreset. However, these methods take a non-bayesian approach to generate the synthetic dataset by optimizing heuristic objectives based on features [ref]52 , gradients [ref]53, training trajectory , and performance matching 7  between synthetic data samples and the original data points. Recently,  tried to bridge the gap between bayesian pseudo-coreset (BPC) methods and dataset condensation methods by analyzing various divergence metrics. In particular, they showed that under certain assumptions, dataset condensation methods can be seen as special cases of BPC methods with different divergence metrics.\nHowever, on high dimensional datasets such as images, dataset condensation methods often outperform the performance of BPC methods. We argue that this drop in performance is attributed to the stringent form of parameter posterior of original dataset used by previous methods.\nIn this work, we relax this condition and propose a more flexible framework to work with such posteriors. In particular, we don’t assume any form for parameter posterior associated with original dataset and use an energy-based distribution to model the posterior associated with synthetic data. Then, we derive contrastive divergence like loss function required to minimize the forward KL-Divergence between these posteriors. Our method allows flexibility to use various energy function without worrying about parameter posterior of original dataset. We experimentally observe that our method not only outperforms bayesian pseudo-coreset methods, but also gives performance comparable with that of dataset condensation methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that bridges the performance gap between BPC and dataset condensation methods.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows : We propose a flexible framework for construction of bayesian pseudo-coreset where we don’t assume any form for parameter posterior associated with original dataset and use a energy-based distribution to model the posterior associated with synthetic data. Our method allows one to use various energy functions to model the parameter posterior associated with synthetic data without having to worry about posterior associated with real data. We derive a contrastive-divergence like loss function to minimize the forward KL divergence between the posteriors; further, we also show a simple and efficient way to estimate this loss and learn the pseudo-coreset. We rigorously test our method against state-of-the-art BPC methods as well as dataset condensation methods. We observe that our method not only outperforms BPC methods but also gives performance comparable to that of dataset condensation, hence, bridging the performance gap between the two paradigms.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: posterior of the original dataset and the parameter posterior associated with the synthetic dataset.
