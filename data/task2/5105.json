More works can be found in the paper list. Event-based Tracking.\nEvent-based tracking has attracted more and more attention in recent years. To be specific, based on the DVS camera, ATSLTD [ref]16 proposes an event-frame combined algorithm to construct the event to frames and warp the spatio-temporal information of asynchronous retinal events.\nChen et al. [ref]17 further feed the sequence of TSLTD frames to a retinal motion regression network to perform an end-to-end 5-degree-of-freedom (5-DoF) object motion regression.\nRamesh et al.  use the discriminative representation for the object with online learning for long-term event-based tracking.\nChamorro et al.  present an ultra-fast tracking algorithm able to estimate 6-DoF motion and a robust mechanism for the matching of events with projected line segments with very fast outlier rejection.\nIgnacio et al.  propose an asynchronous patch-feature tracker that relies solely on events and processes each event individually as soon as it gets generated.\nTo solve the HDR situation, Jiang et al.  combined the offline-trained detector with an online-trained tracker in a specific Kalman fusion scheme.\nSiamEvent [ref]22 correlates the embedded events at two timestamps to compute the target edge similarity and use the Siamese network via edge-aware similarity learning.\nZhu et al.  proposes an event-based tracker based on key-event embedding and motion-aware target likelihood prediction.\nSTNet  employs the Transformer network and spiking neural network (SNN) to extract temporal and global spatial information.\nHowever, with the above development, event-based tracking still has low tracking ability because of the limited event-modality representation and lack of color information. Color-Event based Tracking. \nTracking by combining color frames and event streams is an interesting and reliable way to achieve high-performance target object localization. For instance, Daniel et al.   firstly leverage the complementarity of event and visible cameras to realize low latency feature tracking. DashNet  jointly processes the synchronous activation from artificial neural networks and SNN spikes signal resources based on the complementary filter and attention module. ESVM  is a color-event tracker proposed by Huang et al., which targets tracking objects by adaptive search region mining and online SVM (Support Vector Machine) updating. Liu et al.  propose a three-step tracking algorithm by fusing color frames and event streams simultaneously. Zhang et al.   propose self- and cross-domain attention with an adaptive weighting scheme to fuse visual and event images. Wang et al.  build the CMT which is a cross-modality transformer module that performs well for color-event tracking.\nZhang et al. propose the AFNet  which is a dual-branch network with modality-alignment modules to export the information fusion of color and event frames to realize high-frame rate tracking.\nAlthough good performance can be achieved in some scenarios, these trackers involve multiple components and branches, such as fusion strategies, multi-step structures, augmentation modules, and dual-branch (Siamese) frameworks to locate the target object. Therefore, these algorithms suffer from heavily limited tracking efficiency with superfluous module design. In this paper, we propose a simple and unified color-event tracking framework that can realize more efficient and accurate tracking.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: tracking.
