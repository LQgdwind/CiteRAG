      "content": "Paper Title: Movement Analytics: Current Status, Application to Manufacturing, and Future Prospects from an AI Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable 4.1 lists industrial applications in maritime industries  , transportation      , autonomous vehicles 63 28, health  [ref]178 , behavior analysis  , manufacturing 16   and indoor positioning 16 . The papers    give a good review of how movement and data analytics are used to assist real-time decision making in the areas of maritime industries, indoor positioning, behavior analysis, and transportation, respectively. Al Nuaimi and Kamel  presents a survey of systems and methods used for tracking\npeople and objects in indoor environments such as factories, hospitals, nursing homes, and\ntrain terminals. The authors have compared different indoor positioning systems such as “Fixed indoor positioning systems” (that have a fixed number\nof Base Stations (BS) installed at fixed locations within the\nbuilding); and “Indoor pedestrian positioning”(people carrying localization sensors). The comparison was done with respect to the challenges of providing the best indoor position systems. The key factor in deciding tracking system efficiency depends on how accurately it can track the people movement and which methods are available to quantify the movement. With this perspective, the authors have extended the survey on different methods used for estimating the position of people. The two main methods outlined in the survey are: “Bayesian filtering” to estimate the steps of the pedestrian at a certain time when knowing the previous steps of the same pedestrian at number of times before it and “Kalman filter-based algorithms”: a mathematical model which is used to accurately estimate the position with the existence of noise. Their findings suggest that the fixed indoor position system provides a good accuracy, however there is good scope to enhance the performance of the “indoor pedestrian positioning” system. Later Schabus and Scholz 16, also focused on tracking objects and people in\nindoor environments. However, rather than deciding on which system is better as in , the authors focused on the objective of finding the best paths from one point to another\nand identifying the bottlenecks. For this purpose they analyzed the movement behavior in an\nindoor environment using Geographical Information Services (GISs). The movements behavior\nis visualized as a network with paths created from one point to another using routing\nalgorithms to get shortest paths. These paths are compared with historical paths (actually\nvisited path by an asset) to gain insight about detailed movement behavior and deviations\nfrom the optimal path. The bottlenecks are identified by summing up the number of times an\nedge is visited by an asset. While the focus of Schabus and Scholz 16 was to identify the deviation from\nshortest paths and bottleneck paths with using movement behavior analysis,\nSong et al. 28 worked with the objective of finding safe paths in an indoor\nenvironment. They proposed mobile robot path planning to produce the optimal safe path. A\nreal-time obstacle avoidance decision model based on ML algorithms is\ndesigned to improve the accuracy and speed of real-time obstacle avoidance prediction for\nmobile robots in local path planning. The Rapid-exploration Random Tree algorithm (RRT)\nalgorithm is extended by greedy algorithm approach to smooth the global path and shorten\nits total length by removing the redundant nodes. The method is called Smooth Rapidly\nexploring Random Tree (S-RRT) method. The authors have also looked at optimizing the path\nplanning time together with finding the shortest path. For optimizing the path planning\ntime and generate a more stable collision-free optimization path, an improved hybrid\ngenetic algorithm-ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed. It is based on the idea of hybrid\nalgorithm that combines the advantages of genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization, and\ncan generate better paths in global path planning and local path planning. All three papers mentioned so far used movement analytics to find best and/or safe paths in indoor\nenvironment. However, there are studies demonstrating the benefits of using the movement analytics with respect to other aspects such as capturing real time disruptions in manufacturing space. For example, Dobler et al.  studied how big data from interwoven, autonomous and intelligent supply chains can be integrated and used in optimizing the manufacturing systems against various real-time disruptions such as machine failure, resource become unavailable etc. They propose and compare two different approaches for the optimization of manufacturing lines. The first approach is based on static optimization of production demand. In the second approach, real-time situational awareness—implemented as digital avatar—is used to assign local intelligence to jobs and raw materials. The real-time situational awareness will inform about events such as disruptions and machine failures which will be fed into the optimization framework to make better decisions. The results are generated using event-discrete simulation and are compared to common (heuristic) job scheduling algorithms. The application of movement analysis is studied in literature from\nvarious point of view in manufacturing as well as other industries.\nAnother industry making use of movement analytics is the transport industry where there are many applications such as identifying consumer behavior that in turn determines the\ndemand of a specific route; collision free paths; route congestion; demand of different\npaths at different times; and estimating alternate routes    . To identify consumer\nbehavior in using specific routes, correct labeling of events plays an important role.\nAsakura and Hato  worked on this problem and propose a labeling algorithm for\ntracking travelers’ behavior. They used mobile communication systems such as GPS (global\npositioning systems), cellular phone and RFID for the\nsame purpose. Two of the important events to label that helps in identifying the demand of a\nspecific path/position of route and hence help in identifying the possible congestion are:\nmove or stay. The authors have proposed a simple labeling algorithm based on the approach\nof varying thresholds or discarding some points from the analysis, for example points that\nhave very short duration at a place are discarded while labeling stay. The threshold variation approach helped them in predicting the areas of congestion or demand at a time with more confidence. Andrienko et al.  worked on the similar problem; however rather than just\nlabeling the data efficiently, they suggest a complete framework for movement analysis\ncombining interactive visual displays with database operations and computational\nmethods. Their\nmovement analysis framework has three main components: 1). Data cleaning and filtering by\nincluding additional fields such as speed or time interval between two movements that can\nhelp with logically filtering the data; 2). Extraction of significant places where an object\nstops frequently or for more duration using a SQL query or user defined criteria;\n3). Extraction and examination of trips where a trip may be application-and\ngoal-dependent using a SQL based query or thresholds. To avoid the false\nflagging/categorizing of a place as significant place, for example, removing occasional\nplaces from regular ones, the clustering algorithm (OPTICS) is used where parameters of a\ncluster are user configurable. While Asakura and Hato  and Andrienko et al.  worked on data\nhandling and labeling part, Mo et al.  studied the use of movement data\nto predict the demand of flow through the rail network. They propose a simulation-based\noptimization (SBO) framework to simultaneously calibrate origin-destination (OD) flow,\npassenger path choices and train capacity for urban rail systems using automated fare\ncollection and automated vehicle location data to analyze performance and\nconduct performance retrospectives of urban rail systems. The SBO model has the objective\nof minimizing the square error between model-derived OD exit flows and the corresponding\nobservations and the difference between model-derived and observed journey time\ndistribution (JTD) where observation data is obtained from autoamted fare collection data. The model calculates\nthe OD exit flow, and JTD using a black-box function that corresponds to the transit\nnetwork loading (TNL) model (a forecasting model), which assigns passengers over a\ntransit network given the (dynamic) OD entry demand and path choices. TNL can output the\nmodel-derived OD exit flows and JTD for a given set of path choices and train\ncapacity. TNL has no analytical form therefore SBO is used. The proposed optimization\nmethod is tested on different scenarios representing different degrees of path choice\nrandomness and crowding sensitivity. Data from the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway system is used as a case study for generating synthetic observations used as “ground\ntruth\". The results show that the response surface methods (particularly constrained\noptimization using response surfaces) have consistently good performance under all\nscenarios. Later on Arp et al.  worked on the problem of determining best\nalternative routes in case of congestion or diversions using movement data. They use\nparametric optimization and network based real-time forecasting for traffic flow en route on a\nnetwork. Prato  present a good review of the state of the art in the analysis of route choice behavior within a discrete choice modeling framework. This review focuses on drivers’ route choice behavior in transportation networks, but the same modeling framework is applicable to the multi-modal context. The review examines both major challenges in route choice modeling, namely the generation of a choice set of alternative routes, and the estimation of discrete choice models. This is difficult as the semantics identifying the different routes can be a challenge based on the length and topology of area and noise present in the data. The choice set generation methods are classified as deterministic shortest path-based methods, stochastic shortest path-based techniques, constrained enumeration algorithms that rely on the behavioral assumption that travelers choose routes according to behavioral rules other than the minimum cost path, and probabilistic approaches that attach a generation probability to each route. The maritime industry is another industry also benefited from the use of movement analytics\n  . Yang et al.  focus on the comprehensive\nreview of the literature regarding Automatic Information Systems (AIS) applications in\nmaritime industries. They categorized the AIS applications into seven application fields\nof data analysis for maritime industries: AIS data mining, navigation safety, ship\nbehavior analysis, environmental evaluation, trade analysis, ship and port performance,\nand Arctic shipping. The methodologies in the literature are categorized into four\ncategories: data processing and mining, index measurement, causality analysis, and\noperational research. One of the most recent and relevant works in the maritime industry\nusing movement analytics is by Du et al. . They worked on the problem of\nidentifying the obstacles and optimize against those obstacles to determine the\ncollision-free path for coastal ships with minimum turning points. They present an\noptimized path planning method based on improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)\nand Douglas Peucker (DP) algorithms. The DDPG method works for continuous space and partly\ndepends on the grid environment and grid partition strategy. The aim of the study is to\navoid known obstacles and shore-based information obstacles (such as ship-wreck area,\nrestricted navigation area, and military exercise area) by making better predictions and\nfinding an obstacle-free path with minimum turning points. To make better predictions,\nauthors have used Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) as the first layer of DDPG to enable the uses of historical state information to approximate the current environmental state information. The DDPG is further improved by using a two stage reward function, mainline reward function and auxiliary reward function, to overcome the low learning efficiency and convergence speed of the traditional DDPG method. The mainline reward function is used to guide the ship to reach the target point and complete the path planning task. Meanwhile, the auxiliary function gives reasonable punishment in the process of path planning, so as to avoid obstacles. The problem that too many turning points may exist in the above-planned path, which may increase the navigation risk, an improved DP algorithm is proposed to further optimize the planned path to make the final path more safe and economical. The proposed DP algorithm helps in removing the excess turning points. The other important industry which benefited from movement analytics is health. Nguyen et al. [ref]178, Andrienko et al.  study the use of Bayesian neural networks in developing a hands-free wheelchair control system. The experimental results show that with the optimized architecture, classification Bayesian neural networks can detect head commands of wheelchair users accurately irrespective to their level of injury\n\nReference markers found: [178]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]178: Table 4.1 lists industrial applications in maritime industries  , transportation      , autonomous vehicles 63 28, health  [ref]178 , behavior analysis  , manufacturing 16   and indoor positioning 16 .
