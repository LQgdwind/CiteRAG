      "content": "Paper Title: Multiwinner Temporal Voting with Aversion to Change\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur analysis extends the line of work initiated by Bredereck et al. , but our model and contributions differ\nfrom theirs in several key aspects: Bredereck et al. \nstudy a model where (i) committees are not selected from the set of winning committees output by a voting rule, but need to satisfy a lower bound on their score (via a single non-transferable vote committee scoring rule), (ii) the subsequent committees need not be of the same size, and (iii) voters preferences in all stages are known at the start.\nIn contrast, we consider a large class of popular voting rules and require each selected committee to win under a given rule for a fixed committee size; moreover, our model is more realistic in that it does not assume that the second-stage preferences are known initially. Other papers in this vein include the work of\nBredereck et al. , that considered maximizing the changes made to a committee (the “revolutionary” setting) to find diverse committees, and the paper by\nDeltl et al. , which looks into treating agents fairly. Our work is also related to the study of robustness in temporal voting [ref]7.\nBredereck et al. [ref]7 conducted an axiomatic study of several voting rules, focusing on the worst-case change that may have to be made to a winning committee after a single change was made to some agent’s preference.\nConversely, for a given election and a voting rule, they ask for the minimum number of changes to the agents’ preferences so that the election outcome changes (in any way) under the given rule. This framework was subsequently adapted and studied in approval-based elections , for greedy approval-based rules , and for nearly-structured preferences . Our work is different in that we go beyond this worst-case measure and conduct a more fine-grained analysis, where we ask by how much a winning committee needs to change in a given altered election and study the related computational problems. Moreover, Bredereck et al. [ref]7 and Faliszewski et al.  assume a fixed tie-breaking order of candidates, whereas we study rules under parallel-universe tie-breaking.\nFurther, while most of the prior work focuses on a few\neasy-to-compute rules,\nin our work, we focus on the important class of Thiele rules\nand their greedy variants.\n There are also models of temporal voting where a single winner is chosen at each timestep.\nThese works generally consider temporal extensions of popular multiwinner voting rules and study various axiomatic properties  , welfare measures [ref]19 , or extensions of the justified representation axioms and its variants [ref]9   .\nOther works look into the special case of fair scheduling, where preferences and the outcome are permutations of candidates . We note that similar problems have also been studied (albeit under different names) in the context of stable matching , coloring , clustering  , and reoptimization  .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: “revolutionary” setting) to find diverse committees, and the paper by\nDeltl et al. , which looks into treating agents fairly.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
