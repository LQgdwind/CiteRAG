      "content": "Paper Title: GraphFramEx: Towards Systematic Evaluation of Explainability Methods for Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent studies have proposed to systematically evaluate the performance of explainability methods for GNNs.  evaluates explainability methods on three new benchmarks for which groundtruth is available to alleviate five pitfalls observed in the widely used type 1 synthetic datasets. But methods are only evaluated with the accuracy metric. Our framework evaluates explainers regardless of the existence of groundtruth. The first attempt to construct an evaluation framework without groundtruth explanations is the paper of Yuan et al. [ref]48. They evaluate diverse explainability methods on two fidelity scores at different sparsity levels. But simple baselines such as distance and PageRank and gradient-based methods are omitted, while we show their superiority in some settings. 9 adopts the same methodology as [ref]48, but normalizes one of the fidelity scores to facilitate the comparison of explainability methods. Authors of  are the first ones to carry out a theoretical study and derive upper bounds on three evaluation metrics: unfaithfulness, instability and fairness mismatch. While they run extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets and compare six explainability methods, they only take a model focus and do not account for necessary explanations. In addition, like , we consider stability and fairness to be optional criteria and not general quality measures. None of these papers studies the relation between accuracy and explainability. Moreover, they do not consider other mask transformation than sparsity.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: Our framework evaluates explainers regardless of the existence of groundtruth.
