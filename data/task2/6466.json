A mixture density network [ref]27 is a popular approach that fits a (typically Gaussian) mixture model to the data, but it requires setting a parameter for how many modes to fit, which may not be known a priori. When actions can be represented as pixels in an image (e.g., pick points), a Fully Convolutional Network  can be applied to learning pixelwise multimodality  [ref]29. Shafiullah et¬†al. [ref]30 propose Behavior Transformers, a technique that applies the multi-token prediction of Transformer neural networks  to imitation learning. Other Transformer-based policies report similar benefits for multimodal data  ; however, these approaches require action discretization to cast behavior prediction as next-token prediction. In a very recent paper, Chi et¬†al.  introduce diffusion policies, an application of diffusion models  to imitation learning from multimodal data. Florence et¬†al.  propose implicit behavior cloning, a technique that trains a conditional energy-based model  and is found to outperform (explicit) BC and mixture density networks in their experiments. As opposed to explicit models that take the form œÄ:ùíÆ‚Üíùíú:ùúã‚ÜíùíÆùíú\\pi:\\mathcal{S}\\to\\mathcal{A}, implicit models take the form of a scalar-valued function E:ùíÆ√óùíú‚Üí‚Ñù:ùê∏‚ÜíùíÆùíú‚ÑùE:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\to\\mathbb{R}; the action is an input rather than an output of the model. To sample an action from the policy, instead of evaluating the explicit model a^=œÄ‚Äã(s)^ùëéùúãùë†\\hat{a}=\\pi(s), the implicit model must perform optimization over Eùê∏E conditioned on state sùë†s: In this work, we combine IBC with IFL to mitigate the effects of both distribution shift and multimodality. To our knowledge, we are the first to extend implicit policies to interactive IL.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Learning from multimodal demonstrations is an active challenge in machine learning and robotics.
