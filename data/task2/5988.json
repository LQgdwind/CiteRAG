      "content": "Paper Title: The Metaverse: Survey, Trends, Novel Pipeline Ecosystem & Future Directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe second type of interactions we study as part of the Metaverse pipeline is the User-Business Interactions. In this section, we describe the set of services offered by businesses to users represented as digital avatars in the Metaverse. For instance, a user can request to ride a car, purchase land or a house, buy clothes, ask for a real-time language translator, or attend universities and get trained. In this current literature, there are no precedented attempts to categorize the User to Business interactions based on the types of applications. Therefore, we conducted a literature review to categorize the groups of applications tailored for offering services to avatars in the Metaverse based on the purpose of the applications and underlying technology used. The resulting categories include (1) Acquisition, (2) Employment, (3) Education, and (4) Entertainment. In the sequel, we present the set of services provided in the Metaverse for each of these categories. Afterward, we describe a common set of enabling technologies that are shared across the different applications offered by businesses. Acquisition: Purchase a property, such as land, building, house, apartment, car, clothes, etc., and convert it to a digital asset. Employment: Attend the virtual twin of the companies and perform the tasks required. From one perspective, the avatar is part of the business providing services to other avatars in the Metaverse. From another perspective, the avatar works for a company or opens a business that is handled by a service provider. In this case, the job of the service provider is to offer the infrastructure needed to manage a proper work environment such as handling tasks and organizing meetings, delivering supplies, and facilitating coordination and communications among employees and customers. Education and training: Another form of user-business interaction will be offered for education and training purposes. Avatars will be able to attend virtual classes and training sessions. Furthermore, they can work cooperatively to resolve assignments and discuss projects. Entertainment: attend a sporting event, concert, casino, cinema, and theater virtually from the comfort and safety of their own homes. Business applications simplify and relieve virtual users beyond worries about the underlying complexity, trust, privacy, and security. Services offered by businesses to avatars are created, maintained, and optimized through a set of enabling technologies that are customized in favor of the Metaverse environment. AI. AI is at the core of most of the services provided by businesses in the Metaverse. Through the data generated from various user interactions in the Metaverse, the volume of generated data is enormous and can be employed to reinforce knowledge and enhance intelligence by personalizing experiences and services to improve user satisfaction. Such data is the target of many business owners to increase their market value by investing in the Metaverse and developing applications pointing to the richness of AI solutions. Digital Twin (DT) is one of the driving forces behind building applications in various Metaverse environments . In this context, DT is used as a service offered by businesses. For instance, the authors in [ref]244 and  provide an example of how to build a DT of a university inside the Metaverse. More precisely, the authors described existing efforts in the business sector to create virtual universities for improving learning quality and overcoming spatial and temporal limitations to perceive knowledge. Bright opportunities exist to improve students’ immersiveness in learning through learning by doing, either through virtual simulations or a deeper view of their heritage and culture by visiting historical places and sites and traveling through time. Furthermore, the authors in  present a DT for building manufacturers and automated supply chains, which offer services for customers digitally and deliver the products to their homes.\nIn terms of using AI for growing business and serving users, the possibilities are endless and include building virtual robots inside the Metaverse to serve virtual users, either by offering chatbots, real-time translation, tour guides, event management, and tasks automation on-demand . \n Blockchain. Multiple businesses in the Metaverse attempt to use Blockchain as part of their services for transparent management and increased value by gaining the trust of users . As part of the AI ecosystem, it is important to use trustworthy data, which can be guaranteed through the use of Blockchain . An important aspect to offer a business to users is to allow them to pay for it. Through Blockchain, users can use the digital wallet of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc) to pay for services and transfer funds safely and securely . The Blockchain in the Metaverse is also used for holding the ownership of digital assets such as lands, houses, or other digital objects. The work in  studies the importance of using Blockchain in the Metaverse for businesses while focusing on the importance of cyberattacks detection and improvement of intra and inter-organizational communications among manufacturers through the Blockchain . \nMoreover, businesses are more likely to target a variety of interconnected Metaverse environments, or parallel Metaverse, to offer their services. For the user’s convenience, the same subscriptions, digital wallets, ownerships, and benefits should be shared across multiple environments. To this end, it is important to utilize the cross-chain concept to facilitate teleportation and maintain high standards of security and transparency. For instance, the authors in 6, propose the use of cross-chain-empowered federated learning solutions to improve the security and privacy in the industrial Metaverse. \n Networking.\nThe increasing volume of data generated through the IoT devices and users’ interactions with Business services raises the need for producing faster network connectivity for real-time application response . For instance, real-time digital asset rendering and physical world synchronization for supporting DT require higher network resources 1. Furthermore, data aggregation for processing and conducting intelligent inferences requires networking support. Furthermore, it is vital to maintain seamless transitions or teleportation of the same service across multiple Metaverse Environments when the user moves . With the development of 5G, these network requirements are slightly relieved, due to the high internet speed and scalability offered compared to previous generations . Since a high data rate for rendering is required, where computation is more likely not performed on the headsets or locally, the use of fog and edge computing is becoming handy. Supporting the immersiveness, immediacy, consistency, and reliable API requests between the users and applications is possible through the 5G . \n Computing. Computing requirement is tremendous in the Metaverse due to the need for data processing, AI solutions, XR, and content creation in general. Suitable computing infrastructure that must be adopted by businesses include cloud computing, fog and edge computing, and computing first network (CFN) . While cloud computing offers massive computing power allowing fast processing of large volume of data and handling a vast number of API and service calls, networking delays is the main issue behind relying solely on cloud computing to support the Metaverse . Consequently, edge and fog computing can complement the cloud computing power by offering additional computing resources near the user, eliminating the issue of high delays for virtual rendering and real-time response . However, fog and edge computing have limited computing power to support the Metaverse, especially when the number of users increases while counting more on interoperability across different environments. Finally, a business can resort to CFN, which improves computing and networking availability by leveraging more servers from within the edge computing layer but at different locations, thus empowering distributed edge computing . \n Privacy and Security.\nBusinesses must deal with malicious users attempting to steal users’ data and attack services and applications in the Metaverse . Privacy and security risks are connected to each of the enabling technologies supporting the Metaverse. Through attacks on authentication mechanisms, malicious users might attempt to impersonate an avatar and steal the access credentials through simple techniques such as email phishing or by imitating voice, behavior, and appearance . As a result of the huge volume of data from users’ interactions which are mainly transferred for analysis and AI model updates, such data can be accessed by the attacker through the network for stealing valuable information or tampering. Business. Business in the virtual world has a different feel following all the advancements of technologies, more importantly, AR, MR, and AI . Marketing and branding using AI with the help of generated data from interactions and the existence of intelligent virtual assistants. To this end, more opportunities exist for businesses to scale and grow by offering more flexibility for the users to check the products in AR mode. While the user is in a virtual shopping store, the computing machines in the background hold the history of data related to all interactions and time spent looking for certain categories, allowing the development of more robust marketing. All these factors lead businesses to invest millions of dollars in developing Metaverse applications to widen their market and benefit from the hype of virtual technology and intelligence . \n Ethical & Social. Ethical and social aspects are of immense importance in the Metaverse where businesses can develop and serve applications without precautions of the impacts on human lives . A major issue is related to data collection, where concerns are raised about the amount of data collected, the sensitivity of such data, and the privacy implications 72. Furthermore, aligned with the objectives of Metaverse to offer immersiveness and near-real-life experience, some applications offered by businesses can have a negative impact on users’ lives (e.g gaming industry). Furthermore, lack of awareness and cyberbullying are major concerns that can increase with the circumstances and freedom of behavior provided in the virtual world .\nFrom another perspective, when utilized for the correct purposes, the Metaverse is a great opportunity for expanding businesses and providing opportunities for users to develop economies and earn living by making money as they work . The Metaverse offers a golden opportunity for businesses to grow and increase their profit and market value by embracing the new advancement in virtual technologies and intelligence. Despite the growing trend towards building more applications for serving users in the Metaverse, it is challenging to account for the concerns related to trusting AI, securing user data and transactions, mitigating security issues and vulnerability, and respecting ethical guidelines and social implications on human lives.\n\nReference markers found: [244]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]244: Twin (DT) is one of the driving forces behind building applications in various Metaverse environments .
