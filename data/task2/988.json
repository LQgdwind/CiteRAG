NAS-Bench-101  is a tabular benchmark that consists of a cell-structured search space containing 423423423k unique architectures evaluated for 4,12,36412364,12,36 and 108108108 epochs on the CIFAR-10 image classification task. The cell structure is limited to a number of nodes |V|‚â§7ùëâ7|V|\\leq 7 (including the input and output node) and edges |E|‚â§9ùê∏9|E|\\leq 9. The nodes represent an operation from the operation set ùí™={1√ó1conv., 3√ó3conv., 3√ó3maxpooling}\\mathcal{O}=\\{1\\times 1~{}\\mathrm{conv.},\\ 3\\times 3~{}\\mathrm{conv.},\\ 3\\times 3~{}\\mathrm{max~{}pooling}\\}. In our experiments, we use 90%percent9090\\% of the 423423423k (architecture,accuracy)architectureaccuracy(\\mathrm{architecture},\\ \\mathrm{accuracy}) pairs as training examples and 10%percent1010\\% as validation ones. The ENAS [ref]13 search space consists of architectures represented by a DAG with |V|=8ùëâ8|V|=8 nodes (including the input and output node) and 6 operation choices on each of the non-input and non-output nodes. As [ref]20, we sample 19,0201902019,020 architectures from this space. NAS-Bench-201 [ref]23 is a tabular benchmark, employing a cell-structured search space, with 15,6251562515,625 unique, sampled architectures trained and evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-16-120  for image classification. NAS-Bench-201 differs from NAS-Bench-101 in the cell representation: the nodes represent the sum of feature maps and the edges represent an operation from ùí™={1√ó1conv., 3√ó3conv.,3√ó3avgpooling,skip,zero}\\mathcal{O}=\\{1\\times 1~{}\\mathrm{conv.},\\ 3\\times 3~{}\\mathrm{conv.},3\\times 3~{}\\mathrm{avg~{}pooling},\\mathrm{skip},\\mathrm{zero}\\}. The DAG representing a NAS-Bench-201 architecture has |V|=4ùëâ4|V|=4 nodes and |E|=6ùê∏6|E|=6 edges. While the NAS-Bench-101 benchmark provides the true performance of all fully trained architectures, ENAS does not provide any such value. Therefore, we use the weights of the optimized one-shot model as a proxy for the validation/test performance of the sampled architectures during optimization. We split the (architecture,accuracy)architectureaccuracy(\\mathrm{architecture},\\mathrm{accuracy}) pairs into 90%percent9090\\% training and 10%percent1010\\% test examples. On NAS-Bench-201, we evaluate abilities of the proposed autoencoder and show the transferability of our BO and extrapolation results. After testing its autoencoder abilities, we evaluate SVGe on performance prediction, Bayesian optimization and search space extrapolation.\nIn all our experiments, we set ùê°‚àà‚Ñù250ùê°superscript‚Ñù250\\mathbf{h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{250} for the concatenated node dimension and ùê°G‚àà‚Ñù56subscriptùê°ùê∫superscript‚Ñù56\\mathbf{h}_{G}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{56} for the latent space dimension. All the algorithms and routines are implemented using PyTorch¬† and PyTorch Geometric¬†We provide our implementation at\nhttps://github.com/jovitalukasik/SVGe.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: 90%percent9090\\% of the 423423423k (architecture,accuracy)architectureaccuracy(\\mathrm{architecture},\\ \\mathrm{accuracy}) pairs as training examples and 10%percent1010\\% as validation ones.
