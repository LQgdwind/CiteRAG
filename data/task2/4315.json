      "content": "Paper Title: Bridging the Gap between Object and Image-level Representations for Open-Vocabulary Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nZero-shot Object Detection (ZSD): This setting involves detecting novel class objects at inference, for which no visual examples are available during training. Zhu et al. [ref]9 use semantic information with visual features to get proposals for both seen and unseen classes. Bensal et al.  show that learning a good separation between background and foreground is critical in ZSD and propose to use multiple latent classes for modeling background during training. Rahman et al.  propose a polarity loss to solve the ambiguity between background and unseen classes. DELO  focuses on generating good proposals for unseen classes by synthesizing visual features for unseen objects using a generative model. Gupta et al.  benefits from the contemporary cues in semantic and visual space ensuring better class separation for ZSD. Other works use additional learning signals, including unlabeled images from target domain  and raw textual descriptions from the internet .\nAlthough significant progress has been made on this topic   , the inherent complexity of the task makes it challenging for the ZSD models to generalize well to unseen object classes. Weakly-supervised Object Detection (WSOD):\nIn this setting, only image-level labels are used to approach object detection  7 8  , or are used alongside the detection dataset to enlarge the detector vocabulary   . Bilen et al.  proposed a weakly-supervised deep detection network (WSDNN) that uses off-the-shelf region proposals   and computes objectness and recognition scores for each proposal using separate subnetworks. Cap2Det  operates in a similar setting and uses raw text captions to generate pseudo-labels to guide image-level supervision. Li et al.  uses segmentation-detection collaborative network (SDCN) for accurate detection under weakly-supervised setting using only image labels. PCL  proposes to cluster the spatially adjacent proposals and then assign image labels to each cluster. CASD  argues that the detectors trained only with image-level labels are prone to detect boxes around salient objects and propose feature attention along with self-distillation to address the issue. YOLO9000  and DLWL  augments the detection training by assigning image-level labels to the max-score proposal. Detic  shows that using max-size proposal is an optimal choice for assigning image-level labels as it does not rely on the predictions of the network being optimized and provides better signals for the novel classes.\nWe also operate in a similar WSOD setting and use high-quality object proposals from pretrained multi-modal ViT  to enlarge detector vocabulary and generalize towards novel object categories. Open-vocabulary Object Detection (OVD):\nIn OVD, the objective is to detect target class objects not present in the training/base class vocabulary.\nA typical solution of the problem is to replace the classifier weights with text embeddings of the target vocabulary (e.g., GloVe , BERT , CLIP ).\nOVR-RCNN  uses BERT embeddings as classifier weights and proposes to use open-vocabulary captions to learn the vision-to-language mapping. It surpasses the ZSD approaches by a large margin. ViLD  uses pretrained CLIP  to distill knowledge into a two-stage object detector 5 and replaces the classifier weights with CLIP text embeddings obtained by ensembling multiple text prompts (e.g., a {category}, a photo of a {category}). Gao et al. 6 generate pseudo bounding-box labels using pretrained VL models for training open-vocabulary detector. All these methods use carefully designed manual prompts for generating text embeddings. DetPro 7 and PromptDet 8 replace these manual prompts with learnable tokens and achieve competitive results on novel/rare categories. However, in our work, we use fixed manual prompts and instead focus on improving the object-centric representations for open-vocabulary object detection.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Zero-shot Object Detection (ZSD): This setting involves detecting novel class objects at inference, for which no visual examples are available during training.
