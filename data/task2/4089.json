      "content": "Paper Title: Texture Extraction Methods Based Ensembling Framework for Improved Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGlobal Average Pooling (GAP) has been used for feature aggregation- TCNN [ref]1 and wavelet CNN [ref]11 are the most well known applications of GAP. This method is lossy regarding spatial information but is suitable for extracting the texture features [ref]11. The bi-linear pooling (BLP) introduced by Lin et al.  makes second-order interactions between the two outputs - it is an outer product of each pair of feature points. BLP encodes more information than GAP. GAP also acts as a structural regularizer which enables us to explicitly enforce feature maps to classify the textures more efficiently . DeepTEN  is a technique that uses residual dictionary learning to encode features on an end-to-end learning framework. It is different from SIFT  and filter banks  as hand-engineered features are used, but in DeepTEN method the dictionaries, features, classifiers, and encoding representation are all trained together to produce an orderless encoding. DeepTEN is very efficient for material and texture recognition tasks, and can also be used as a pooling layer on top of convolution layers to increase the flexibility of the model . To integrate histograms with CNN, a histogram layer was introduced by Joshua , which captures the local spatial features using a histogram. The histogram layer uses a Radial basis function (RBF)  for the binning operation to find the bin centers and widths. It also makes use of the GAP to capture the spatial, texture, and orderless convolution features. The histogram layer enables the model to use fewer layers than conventional CNN, as the texture information is directly captured by feature maps . Fractal analysis pooling (FAP) is used in FENet to group points of a texture based on the local fractal dimension of the image. It eliminates the dependency on spatial order while encoding the characteristics of features [ref]28. Fractal dimension is a quantitative measure of the roughness of a given image . GAP is used to capture the spatial features of a texture but sometimes it fails to distinguish between complex distributive patterns from a texture. FENet uses both GAP and FAP as the method and distributive features are captured from distinct aspects [ref]28. Similarly, in this work, we propose a model architecture which exhibits an improvement in results by combining several techniques after the convolution layers. In the proposed model we consider the TE methods which extract properties from a single feature map unlike the class-net  where numerous feature maps are used to find the texture features.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Global Average Pooling (GAP) has been used for feature aggregation- TCNN [ref]1 and wavelet CNN [ref]11 are the most well known applications of GAP.
