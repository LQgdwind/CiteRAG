      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Motion Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter having introduced QuMoSeg, we next review the most related methods. Synchronization refers to recovering elements of a group (associated to vertices in a graph) starting from a (redundant) set of pairwise ratios (associated to edges in the graph).\nPopular synchronization problems involve rotations and rigid motions         , which are at the core of tasks such as camera motion estimation in SfM [ref]46, point cloud registration  and SLAM .\nOther synchronization problems concern homographies (which are related to image mosaicking ) and affine transformations (which were used to solve for global color correction ).\nAlthough synchronization has a well-established theory for the case where unknowns/measures belong to a group, specific routines can be possibly developed when the variables do not belong to a group and have a poorer structure.\nA notable example are partial permutations, which appear in the context of multi-view matching     .\nAnother example are binary matrices, which are related to part segmentation in point clouds  and motion segmentation in images [ref]4 (the basis of our method). Motion Segmentation aims at detecting moving objects in a scene given multiple images by grouping all the key-points moving in the same way .\nExisting techniques fall into three main categories, depending on the assumptions made on the inputs.\nSome methods assume extracted key-points and work with unknown correspondences  .\nOther algorithms assume some local information about correspondences in addition to the key-points, namely matches between image pairs [ref]5 [ref]4.\nThe third category assumes known global information about the correspondences, namely multi-frame trajectories      .\nOur method belongs to the second category [ref]5 [ref]4.\nAccordingly, our technique splits motion segmentation into multiple two-frame sub-problems and then finds a global consistency among the partial results.\nOur method is related to Arrigoni and Pajdla [ref]4, as we adapt their model and the data structures.\nTheir approach relies on a similar formulation as (17) but solves the problem over real variables instead of binary ones, ending up with an approximate solution based on a spectral decomposition.\nIn this paper, instead, we derive a QUBO formulation from scratch and solve it without relaxation on an AQC. Quantum Computer Vision. Several quantum techniques are available for computer vision tasks, such as recognition and classification  , object tracking , transformation estimation , point set and shape alignment  , graph matching  and permutation synchronization .\nMost of these methods are designed for an AQC.\nIn , a binary matrix factorization is applied to feature extraction from facial images, while in  redundant detections are removed in multi-object detection with the help of an AQC.\nAnother method classifies multi-spectral images with quantum SVM .\nA quantum approach for correspondence problems on point sets  recovers rotations between pairs of point sets, which are approximated as sums of basis matrix elements.\nThe qKC method described in  employs both classical and quantum kernel-based losses for point set matching.\nIn contrast to , qKC is designed for a circuit-based quantum computer.\nQGM is the first approach for matching small graphs using AQC .\nQ-Match  can non-rigidly match 3D shapes with up to 500500500 points and it overcomes the hardware limitations of the modern AQC (e.g., the qubit connectivity pattern) by an iterative optimization scheme. The quantum method most closely related to ours is QSync , as it also uses the framework of synchronization but solves a different problem.\nThere are substantial differences between\nour task and permutation synchronization :\nQSync operates on permutation matrices (i.e., both rows and columns sum to 1), whereas the binary matrices in our case are less constrained (only rows sum up to 1).\nAlthough this might seem a minor difference, the term trace‚Å°(Xj‚ÄãXiùñ≥‚ÄãXi‚ÄãXjùñ≥)tracesubscriptùëãùëósuperscriptsubscriptùëãùëñùñ≥subscriptùëãùëñsuperscriptsubscriptùëãùëóùñ≥\\operatorname{trace}(X_{j}X_{i}^{\\mathsf{T}}X_{i}X_{j}^{\\mathsf{T}}) in QSync is constant and can be ignored in (8); the absence of ‚Äúcolumns sum to 1‚Äù constraint means that we either i) require additional assumptions (QuMoSeg-v2) or ii) resort to different computations resulting in a new (dense) matrix (QuMoSeg-v1).\nIn QSync, the number of variables scales quadratically with the number of points, whereas our method is more efficient per construction (e.g., it uses matrices with 2‚Äãk2ùëò2k entries if there are two motions, see Remark 2). Hence, we can handle larger problems: five images of two motions with ten points each, i.e., 100100100 points (see Sec.¬†5) vs five points in four images .\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: ratios (associated to edges in the graph).\nPopular synchronization problems involve rotations and rigid motions         , which are at the core of tasks such as camera motion estimation in SfM [ref]46, point cloud registration  and SLAM .\nOther synchronization problems concern homographies (which are related to image mosaicking ) and affine transformations (which were used to solve for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
