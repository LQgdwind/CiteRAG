      "content": "Paper Title: Active Learning in Gaussian Process State Space Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nState-space models (SSMs) are a compact representation of dynamical systems as a set of input, output and state variables where the transition could be deterministic or stochastic. SSMs are widely used in practice, where applications range from aerospace-related work (e.g. ), medicine (e.g. [ref]1) to economics and finance (e.g. [ref]56). The two important aspects of SSMs are learning and control and they have been a fruitful research field in classical engineering (e.g. 0 ). Learning in SSM is about finding optimal hyperparameters so that the dynamical system is accurately captured whereas control refers to optimising a specific objective function based on inputs and states of a given SSM. The latter is often referred as optimal control. During the last decade, both aspects of SSMs also attracted the attention from the machine learning community (e.g.  ). To capture the uncertainty of system dynamics, Bayesian models are often employed in the context of SSM. For example, a Gaussian Process (GP) prior  is mostly used to describe the transition between states, which leads to family of Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) with an impressive amount of progress has been made (e.g.         , and more). Learning and inference of GPSSM are an active research topic in machine learning community and this paper focuses on learning of GPSSM. While different approaches of GPSSM mainly address the modelling issues, the question about data-efficient learning of GPSSM remains largely unanswered. Such questions go naturally to the field of Active Learning (AL), which is the process of strategically selecting and generating new data for supervised learning. The purpose of AL is to learn the proposed model with the least amount of data possible. Though the majority of recent papers in this field focused on classification problems (e.g.  ) and rather few were for regression (e.g.  ), Schreiter et al. applied AL in GP regression and Zimmer et al. extended the scope to learning time-series models. Both papers employed the entropy criterion for exploration, while using a greedy selection based on the maximum predictive variance of the GP. In context of state-space models for predictive control, Buisson et al. proposed an AL approach for learning the transition dynamics via optimising the trajectory. For AL in GPSSM, Capone et al. was the first to introduce the concept here. However, in both cases, Buisson et al. and Capone et al. simplified the settings by assuming the states are observable and measurable. By doing so, the resulting state-space models can be actively learned in the same way as standard GP regression models in a supervised manner. In contrast to previous work, we present an AL strategy on GPSSM without relying on the assumption that the states are observed. That is, we actively steer the system through the latent state-space by determining its inputs such that the underlying dynamics can be optimally learned by a GPSSM. For the information criterion, we employ an approximated measure of the mutual information. We propose and discuss two different approaches for the approximation of mutual information in the context of unmeasurable, latent state-space. This paper is on learning a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system actively from noisy data via probabilistic SSM. Its main contributions include: We derive tractable approximate mutual information estimates for GPSSM with latent states based on the state-of-the-art learning scheme and the technique of approximate Gaussian integral. We propose an AL strategy for GPSSM with latent states based on inputs. We conduct experiments for different examples to demonstrate the usefulness of our strategy in physical systems, which is a typical application for SSM. The reminder of this paper is organised as follow: We give a brief overview of backgrounds in section 2 and introduce GPSSM in section 3. Section 4 shows our active learning strategies and section 5 evaluates our concepts on several test scenarios. A conclusion is given in section 6. Detailed proof of propositions, experimental details and few further remarks are left in supplementary materials.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: output and state variables where the transition could be deterministic or stochastic.
