      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised network distillation: an effective approach to exploration in sparse reward environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first provide the wider conceptual context to our work, and then focus more on methods that are closely related to our models.\nAccording to the prevailing view, the approaches to IM can be divided into two main categories with adaptive motivations.\nKnowledge-based approach is focused on the acquisition of the world knowledge of and it draws on the theory of drives, theory of cognitive dissonance and optimal incongruity theory. Competence-based approach focuses on the acquisition of skills by motivating the agent to achieve a higher level of performance in the environment, which means to acquire desired actions to achieve self-generated goals. Its psychological basis includes the theory of effectance and the theory of flow. The knowledge-based category focusing on exploration can be divided into prediction-based, novelty-based and information-based approaches [ref]4.\nPrediction-based approaches use the prediction error as an intrinsic reward signal. The source of error can be a forward model (e.g.¬† [ref]12 ), a generative model [ref]55 (e.g.¬†based on a variational auto-encoder ) or disagreement in a learned world model . Exploration with Mutual Information (EMI)  extracts predictive signals that can be used to guide exploration based on forward prediction in the representation space. Model-based Active eXploration (MAX)  uses an ensemble of forward models to plan to observe novel events. Information approaches use quantities from information theory , such as information gain, mutual information, entropy and try to maximize the information obtained by the agent from the environment. Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME)  approximates the environment dynamics and uses the information gain of the learned dynamics model as an intrinsic reward. Random Encoders for Efficient Exploration (RE3)  is an exploration method that utilizes state entropy as an intrinsic reward.\nFor more details, we recommend surveys  [ref]4 . In a narrower context, our work falls into the area of novelty-based approaches that monitor the state novelty.\nThe first models exploited the count-based approach . This approach is impractical for large or continuous state spaces and it was extended by introducing pseudo-count and neural density models   . A similar method to pseudo-count was used by a random network distillation (RND) model  with a lower complexity. The never-give-up framework  learns intrinsic rewards composed of episodic and life-long state novelty (which is detected by an RND model). BYOL-Explore  is one of the recent methods using self-supervised learning in the context of exploration and intrinsic rewards. Self-supervised learning is a paradigm of machine learning when the agent does not have any externally labeled data. The goal is to use the information in the data itself and prepare the model to perform another task. Self-supervised learning also started to be used in the field of state representation learning , it has proven to be a suitable method for creating the feature space  and has also found its use in reinforcement learning  . Contrastive learning  is a method of self-supervised learning minimizing a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs from the same category, and large for pairs from different categories.\nSeveral different objective functions have been proposed, e.g. Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) 0, InfoNCE , or multi-class NùëÅN-pair loss . Another approach to self-supervised learning is based on regularization (non-contrastive methods). In this case, the model sees only positive examples (data points from the same category) and generates a feature space based on various regularization losses like invariance and covariance loss in the case of Barlow Twins model , triple variance-invariance-covariance losses in VICReg model , or other priors like proportionality, variability, slowness principle, or repeatability 4.\nBootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL)  relies on two neural networks, referred to as online and target networks that interact and learn from each other.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: includes the theory of effectance and the theory of flow.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
