      "content": "Paper Title: Projection-Free Stochastic Bi-level Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the two-level hierarchical optimization problem Here, the outer problem involves minimizing the objective function Q​(𝐱)𝑄𝐱Q({\\mathbf{x}}) with respect to 𝐱𝐱{\\mathbf{x}} over the convex compact constraint set 𝒳⊂ℝm𝒳superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{m}. The objective function is of the form Q​(𝐱):=F​(𝐱,𝐲⋆​(𝐱))assign𝑄𝐱𝐹𝐱superscript𝐲⋆𝐱Q({\\mathbf{x}}):=F({\\mathbf{x}},{\\mathbf{y}}^{\\star}({\\mathbf{x}})), where 𝐲⋆​(𝐱)superscript𝐲⋆𝐱{\\mathbf{y}}^{\\star}({\\mathbf{x}}) is a solution of the inner optimization problem, which for a given 𝐱𝐱{\\mathbf{x}}, entails minimizing the strongly convex function G​(𝐲,𝐱)𝐺𝐲𝐱G({\\mathbf{y}},{\\mathbf{x}}) with respect to optimization variable 𝐲𝐲{\\mathbf{y}}. Observe that for bilevel problems of type 𝒫1subscript𝒫1\\mathcal{P}_{1}, the inner and outer problems are inter-dependent and cannot be solved in isolation. Yet, these problems arise in a number of areas, such as meta-learning [ref]1, continual learning , reinforcement learning [ref]3, and hyper-parameter optimization  . Of particular interest are the large-scale or stochastic settings, where the functions F𝐹F and G𝐺G are expectations of random functions with unknown distributions, and are accessible only through their samples. First-order stochastic approximation algorithms have been recently proposed    . The main idea behind these algorithms is to run one gradient descent step in order to solve the inner optimization problem, and subsequently, utilize the updated variable 𝐲𝐲{\\mathbf{y}} to run another gradient descent step on the outer minimization problem. In some works, such as 0 1, the constraint set 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} in the outer optimization problem is taken to be 𝒳=ℝm𝒳superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^{m}, resulting in a simpler unconstrained outer optimization problem. However, in applications such as meta-learning [ref]1, personalized federated learning 2, and corsets , the constraint set 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is a strict subset of 𝒳⊂ℝm𝒳superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{m}. The standard approach to dealing with such constraint sets is to project the updates of the outer optimization problem onto 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} at every iteration. Though popular and widely used, the projected gradient approaches may not necessarily be practical, for instance, in cases where the projection sub-problem is too expensive to be solved at every iteration. The difficulties surrounding projection-based methods have motivated the development of projection-free algorithms 3, that make use of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) updates 4. These FW-based algorithms only require solving a linear program over 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, which could be significantly cheaper than solving a non-linear projection problem, as in the case of ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-norm or nuclear norm ball constraints. Projection-free algorithms for single-level stochastic optimization algorithms are well-known and state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity of 𝒪​(ϵ−2)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})   5. These algorithms rely on a recursive gradient tracking approach that allows the samples to be processed sequentially and achieves variance reduction without the use of checkpoints or large batches. Motivated from these developments, we ask the following question: “Is it possible to develop efficient projection-free algorithms for bi-level stochastic optimization problems?” This work puts forth the Stochastic Bi-level Frank-Wolfe (SBFW) algorithm, which is the first projection-free algorithm for bi-level problems. Further, we also focus on the special class of problems called stochastic compositional problems where the inner optimization problem in (1) is solvable in closed-form 1 0. Although the results developed for bi-level problems are applicable to compositional problems, we provide improved convergence rates for the stochastic compositional problems using a modified analysis (cf. Sec. III-B). It is important to note that, while bilevel optimization problems are more challenging to solve, they offer additional flexibility in formulation, and tend to outperform their single-level counterparts. Of particular interests are sparse bilevel problems, such as sparse MAML (6 7), which involve ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} or nuclear norm constraints. Other important applications where projection-free bilevel optimization algorithms apply include image reconstruction 8 and neural network architecture search 6.\nBefore proceeding, we\nprovide an practical example and discuss various challenges\nassociated with solving it efficiently.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of type 𝒫1subscript𝒫1\\mathcal{P}_{1}, the inner and outer problems are inter-dependent and cannot be solved in isolation.
