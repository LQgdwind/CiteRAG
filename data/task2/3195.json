To justify STEAM’s validity on the application of MSDA, we implement STEAM under the problem definition described in Section 3.6. We firstly consider evaluation on PACS dataset again with the same problem definition and setting of . Next, we follow [ref]54 and use miniDomainNet for evaluation, which is a sampled subset of DomainNet and reformatted into a smaller image size (96×96969696\\times 96). In general, miniDomainNet consists of 444 domains (Clipart, Painting, Real and Sketch) across 126126126 classes, which mostly resembles data diversity of the original DomainNet. For PACS, we use ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet as the CNN backbone, by following training protocols in . Batch size is 323232. For miniDomainNet, we use ResNet-18 as the CNN backbone, the same used as in [ref]54. Similarly, we use SGD with momentum as the optimizer, and the learning rate decays according to cosine annealing rule. The model is trained with an initial learning rate of 0.0050.0050.005 for 606060 epochs. For each mini-batch, we sample from each domain 646464 images. Results. Given the standard test protocol in [ref]33 on PACS, we use one domain as target and the remaining as sources. Classification accuracy on the target domain test set is reported. We compare our STEAM with two state-of-the-art multi-source domain adaptation approaches: M3SDA [ref]33 and CMSS . In addition, we also present the following methods as our baselines: DANN [ref]14, MDAN , WBN , MCD . The results are shown in Table 3. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art average accuracy of 93.0%percent93.093.0\\%. On the most challenging sketch domain, we obtain 85.1%percent85.185.1\\%, clearly outperforming other baselines. On the miniDomainNet, we compare with the same methods presented in DAEL [ref]54, including MCD , DCTN , DANN [ref]14, M3SDA [ref]33, MME . The results are shown in Table 4. Our method achieves 66.3%percent66.366.3\\% average accuracy, again, justifying significant advantages out of our interesting invariance hypothesis.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: MSDA, we implement STEAM under the problem definition described in Section 3.6.
