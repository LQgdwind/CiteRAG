      "content": "Paper Title: Faster Fréchet Distance Approximation through Truncated Smoothing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparing curves is an important task in for example trajectory analysis , handwriting recognition  and matching time series in data bases .\nTo compare curves, one needs a suitable distance measure.\nThe Hausdorff distance is a commonly used distance measure when comparing sets of points.\nHowever, although each curve corresponds to a set of points, a point set by itself does not capture the order in which points appear along the curve.\nThis may lead to curves having low Hausdorff distance, even when they are clearly very different.\nSee for example the curves on the right.\nThe Fréchet distance is a distance measure that does take the ordering of points along the curves into account, and hence compares curves more accurately. The first algorithm for computing the Fréchet distance between polygonal curves was given by Godau 1, who presented an O​(n3​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛3𝑛O(n^{3}\\log n) time algorithm for two curves with n𝑛n vertices in total.\nAlt and Godau  later improved the result to an O​(n2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛O(n^{2}\\log n) time algorithm.\nThe discrete version of the problem was first studied by Eiter and Mannila , who gave an O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) time algorithm. These results have since been improved in the word RAM model of computation.\nFor example, Agarwal et al.  gave an O​(n2​log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛𝑛O(n^{2}\\log\\log n/\\log n) time algorithm for the discrete problem, and Buchin et al. [ref]9 later improved the complexity bound for the continuous problem to O​(n2​(log⁡log⁡n)2)𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}(\\log\\log n)^{2}).\nUnfortunately there is strong evidence that these results cannot be improved significantly, since Bringmann [ref]5 showed that a strongly-subquadratic (i.e., n2−Ω​(1)superscript𝑛2Ω1n^{2-\\Omega(1)}) time algorithm would refute the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Due to the conditional lower bound, we will focus on efficient approximation algorithms.\nWhen the curves are from certain families of “realistic” curves, strongly-subquadratic time (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithms are known to exist.\nFor example, if the curves are either κ𝜅\\kappa-bounded or backbone curves, the algorithm by Aronov et al.  gives a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation to the discrete Fréchet distance in O​(n4/3​log⁡n/ε2)𝑂superscript𝑛43𝑛superscript𝜀2O(n^{4/3}\\log n/\\varepsilon^{2}) time.\nLater on, Driemel et al. 7 presented (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate algorithms for the continuous Fréchet distance that take near-linear time, given that the curves are from one of four realistic curve classes.\nThese four classes includes κ𝜅\\kappa-bounded curves, but also c𝑐c-packed, φ𝜑\\varphi-low density and κ𝜅\\kappa-straight curves.\nTheir result on c𝑐c-packed curves was improved by Bringmann and Künnemann , whose algorithm matches conditional lower bounds. When approximating the Fréchet distance between arbitrary curves, SETH again gives conditional lower bounds.\nThe lower bound by Bringmann [ref]5 holds not only for exact algorithms, but for 1.0011.0011.001-approximate algorithms as well.\nThis lower bound was later improved by Buchin et al. 0, who showed that under SETH, no strongly-subquadratic (3−ε)3𝜀(3-\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm exists, even for curves in one dimension.\nFor the current strongly-subquadratic algorithms, the best known approximation factor is polynomial (nεsuperscript𝑛𝜀n^{\\varepsilon}) for both the discrete and the continuous Fréchet distance.\nWhether a strongly-subquadratic constant factor approximation algorithm exists remains open. For the discrete Fréchet distance, Bringmann and Mulzer  gave a linear time greedy algorithm with an approximation factor of 2Θ​(n)superscript2Θ𝑛2^{\\Theta(n)}.\nThey also presented the first strongly-subquadratic time algorithm with polynomial approximation factor.\nFor any α∈[1,n/log⁡n]𝛼1𝑛𝑛\\alpha\\in[1,n/\\log n], their algorithm gives an α𝛼\\alpha-approximation in O​(n2/α)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝛼O(n^{2}/\\alpha) time.\nThis result was later improved by Chan and Rahmati 3, who gave an O​(n2/α2)𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript𝛼2O(n^{2}/\\alpha^{2}) time algorithm, for any α∈[1,n/log⁡n]𝛼1𝑛𝑛\\alpha\\in[1,\\sqrt{n/\\log n}]. For continuous Fréchet distance, the first polynomial approximation algorithm running in strongly-subquadratic time is due to Colombe and Fox 5.\nThey gave an α𝛼\\alpha-approximate algorithm running in O​(n​log⁡n+(n3/α2)​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛3superscript𝛼2𝑛O(n\\log n+(n^{3}/\\alpha^{2})\\log n) time.\nRecently, van der Horst et al. 5 presented the first algorithm that supports arbitrarily small polynomial approximation factors in strongly-subquadratic time O​(n​log3⁡n+(n2/α)​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛superscript𝑛2𝛼superscript3𝑛O(n\\log^{3}n+(n^{2}/\\alpha)\\log^{3}n). The basis of our results is a curve simplification algorithm.\nWe use the resulting simplified versions of two curves to efficiently approximate the Fréchet distance between the input curves.\nDoing so, we improve the running time of the algorithm by van der Horst et al. 5 significantly for curves in one dimension, and by a logarithmic factor in higher dimensions.\nOur running time in one dimension is O​(n​log3⁡n+(n2/α3)​log2⁡n​log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛superscript𝑛2superscript𝛼3superscript2𝑛𝑛O(n\\log^{3}n+(n^{2}/\\alpha^{3})\\log^{2}n\\log\\log n), in contrast to our O​(n​log⁡n+(n2/α)​log2⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛superscript𝑛2𝛼superscript2𝑛O(n\\log n+(n^{2}/\\alpha)\\log^{2}n) time algorithm for higher dimensions.\nWe summarize our algorithms in Section 2, but first we define the Fréchet distance and some useful notation.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: in the word RAM model of computation.\nFor example, Agarwal et al.  gave an O​(n2​log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛𝑛O(n^{2}\\log\\log n/\\log n) time algorithm for the discrete problem, and Buchin et al. [ref]9 later improved the complexity bound for the continuous problem to O​(n2​(log⁡log⁡n)2)𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}(\\log\\log n)^{2}).\nUnfortunately there is strong evidence that these\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
