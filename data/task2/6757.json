      "content": "Paper Title: Source-free Domain Adaptive Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaselines. Four general domain adaptive pose estimation methods CC-SSL , MDAM , RegDA [ref]12 and UniFrame  with SOTA performances are chosen as baselines for comparison. We list these baselines that need to access source data to demonstrate that our proposed source-free method’s performance remains competitive when compared to general domain adaptive pose estimation methods. We build source-free baselines by either adapting domain-adaptive HPE methods or source-free DA methods for classification methods. We first introduce two domain adaptive HPE methods. RegDA-SF is based on [ref]12, which originally contains three steps and the first step uses source data. We replace the first step with an exponential moving averaging strategy to obtain the new method. Uniframe-SF is on the foundation of . What we do is remove the style transfer modules between source and target so that it becomes a source-free method. The rest are adapted from source-free DA methods for classification methods. SHOT [ref]21 is a classic source-free domain adaptation method for image classification, and we adapt its mutual information maximization module for HPE by treating the normalized heatmaps as output probabilities in classification. MMT is based on , which is a source-free adaptation method that applies two models mutually learning from each other. Here we replace its soft classification loss with the soft consistency loss. SHOT++ [ref]22 is the advanced version of [ref]21, which uses a special unsupervised representation learning technique predicting image rotations. We also add this module to our adopted baseline. Metrics. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach, we adopt the Percentage of Correct Keypoint (PCK) metric, as used in previous work. We set the ratio of correct predictions to be 5%percent55\\%, and report PCK@0.05 in Tables 1-4. In addition to overall keypoint accuracy, we divide joints into several part segments and measure their performance using specific metrics. For the 21-keypoint hand skeleton, we use the Metacarpophalangeal (MCP), Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP), Distal Interphalangeal (DIP), and Fingertip (Fin) metrics. For the 18-keypoint human skeleton, we select the Shoulder (Sld), Elbow (Elb), Wrist, Hip, Knee, and Ankle metrics. These segment-specific metrics enable a more detailed evaluation of the models’ performances. Quantitative Results. We present the results of our proposed method on four different tasks: hand tasks RHD→→\\rightarrowH3D and RHD→→\\rightarrowFreiHand, and human tasks SURREAL→→\\rightarrowHuman3.6M and SURREAL→→\\rightarrowLSP. Tables 1 and 2 show the results for the hand tasks, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the second best baseline SHOT++ with a significant lead of 3.3%percent3.33.3\\% and 3.0%percent3.03.0\\%, respectively. Moreover, our method outperforms the SHOT++ model by 4.1%percent4.14.1\\% and 3.9%percent3.93.9\\% on the PIP metric, respectively. For the human tasks, Tables 3 and 4 display the results. Our model achieves a considerable margin of 3.4%percent3.43.4\\% and 3.3%percent3.33.3\\% over the second best baseline SHOT++ for SURREAL→→\\rightarrowHuman3.6M and SURREAL→→\\rightarrowLSP, respectively. Specifically, our method outperforms SHOT++ by 7.0%percent7.07.0\\% on the Wrist for the adaptation on Human3.6M and 5.3%percent5.35.3\\% on the Ankle for the adaptation on LSP. Furthermore, our approach remains competitive when compared with general domain adaptive HPE methods that need to access source data, as it surpasses UniFrame by 2.6%percent2.62.6\\% on RHD→→\\rightarrowH3D, 0.3%percent0.30.3\\% on RHD→→\\rightarrowFreiHand, and 1.2%percent1.21.2\\% on SURREAL→→\\rightarrowLSP. Qualitative Results.  Figs. 6 shows qualitative results of H3D on the left side and LSP on the right side. We use Source only, UniFrame-SF , SHOT++ [ref]22, Ours, and Ground Truth for qualitative comparison. It is evident that our method outperforms other baselines significantly.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Baselines.
