      "content": "Paper Title: Heterogeneous Generative Knowledge Distillation with Masked Image Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative learning has an extraordinary power to learn from unlabeled large-scale data. Inspired by the success in NLP (e.g. BERT 0, GPT ), masked image modeling methods (MIM) show a solid ability to learn visual representations from the prediction of masked patches. In addition to better learning ability, the burgeoning MIM models pursue deeper and broader structures. However, deploying large networks (such as ResNet101 ) on computationally limited devices is complex. Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained high-capacity teacher network to a lightweight student model, which is beneficial for deploying efficient networks on resource-constrained devices. Pioneering research by Hilton  et al. shows that low-capacity networks (the student model) can often be significantly improved, benefiting from the auxiliary knowledge gained by a set of large models. However, traditional distillation methods have difficulty utilizing large MIM models due to two shortcomings. First, smaller CNN-based student networks can quickly learn the knowledge (such as logits and features) extracted by multiscale visual processing methods (such as SIFT , Swin ) and pyramid networks  with labeled unmasked images. However, they have difficulty in learning the knowledge from single-scale masked modeling possessed by heterogeneous MIM teacher models (such as CAE [ref]5, MAE 2) and in processing masked images (discussed in Section 3.2.1). For example, as shown in Fig. 1, student models cannot mimic the data distribution of MIM teacher models. One may zero out all masked pixels and directly feeds the masked image to the student. However, compared with the consistent output distribution of teacher models (shown in blue), the result of CNNs leads to a severe data distribution shift (shown in green). Transferring knowledge from the MIM teacher to the CNN student with such an extensive distribution discrepancy can disturb the student’s learning pattern. Therefore, directly training a small CNN-based network to distill knowledge using MIM seems not applicable. Secondly, self-supervised distillation does not require annotated data compared with traditional supervised KD methods. As a result, it does not learn a probability distribution in some classes or categories . Therefore, self-supervised learning from the training data itself becomes particularly important. In addition to a single instance, the relationship between multiple images may demonstrate more about the inner relations of the dataset, which represents the probability distribution. However, traditional distillation strategies mainly transfer features  6  or logits    for instance, which is not plausible to learn the inner-relationship of the data itself. We inject generative learning into knowledge distillation and propose Heterogeneous Generative Knowledge Distillation (H-GKD) as a new learning paradigm to learn data’s visual representation and distribution from heterogeneous models. With the analysis above, we find that traditional Convnets with overlapping sliding windows are hard to learn the knowledge from masked images and single-scale outputs. Inspired by sparse convolution , we design a student model for learning generative visual representations better. Besides being equipped with sparse convolution, the student model also uses a UNet-style  to keep the advantages of multiscale structures. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of a learning probability distribution, our idea is first to calculate the distances (similarities) between the input image and other data points, then convert them to distribution. A memory queue is maintained to transfer the distribution from the teacher to the student to achieve this. Specifically, we train a teacher model using generative methods, extracting pre-trained representations and similarity distribution. Subsequently, we train a sparse convolution-based student model using generative methods and align the knowledge from the heterogeneous teacher to the student. This simple structure brings noticeable results: Unlike traditional KD methods, generative distillation does not require any labeled data or additional image operations. The student model can efficiently learn the inner relations of the dataset itself through similarity distribution. The teacher model can be pre-trained using advanced generative methods, such as MAE 2, CAE [ref]5, BEiT , as a result, the student model can learn the visual representation from a heterogeneous teacher via sparse convolution and hierarchical structure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of downstream tasks are performed on Imagenet 1K  and COCO 2 datasets, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. For example, on the Imagenet 1K dataset, H-GKD improved the accuracy of ResNet50 (sparse) from 76.98% to 80.17% (a gain of more than 3%). Compared with state-of-the-art distillation methods, H-GKD achieves a significant improvement in classification, which is greater than 1%. To summarize, our work provides the following. We are the first to inject Masked Image Modeling (MIM) methods into Knowledge Distillation. We describe an H-GKD method to transfer knowledge between heterogeneous models in a self-supervised manner. We achieve a new learning paradigm to learn the visual representation and distribution of data from heterogeneous teacher models, which can be pre-trained using advanced generative methods. With the proposed method, we refresh the state-of-art results achieved by the SOTA KD methods on several downstream tasks. Compared with various distillation strategies, we conduct extensive experiments under multiple settings on benchmark datasets to verify our effectiveness.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: pyramid networks  with labeled unmasked images.
