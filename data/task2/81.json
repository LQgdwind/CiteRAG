      "content": "Paper Title: Component Analysis for Visual Question Answering Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we first introduce the baseline approach, with default image and text encoders, alongside a pre-defined fusion strategy. That base approach is inspired by the pioneer of Antol¬†et¬†al. on VQA¬†[ref]4. To understand the importance of each component, we update the base architecture according to each component we are investigating. In our baseline model we replace the VGG network from¬†[ref]20 by a Faster RCNN pre-trained in the Visual Genome dataset¬†. The default text encoding is given by the last hidden-state of a Bidirectional LSTM network, instead of the concatenation of the last hidden-state and memory cell used in the original work. Fig.¬†1 illustrates the proposed baseline architecture, which is subdivided into three major segments: independent feature extraction from (1) images and (2) questions, as well as (3) the fusion mechanism responsible to learn cross-modal features. The default text encoder (denoted by the pink rectangle in Fig.¬†1) employed in this work comprises a randomly initialized word-embedding module that takes a tokenized question and returns a continuum vector for each token. Those vectors are used to feed an LSTM network. The last hidden-state is used as the question encoding, which is projected with a linear layer into a dùëëd-dimensional space so it can be fused along to the visual features. As the default option for the LSTM network, we use a single layer with 204820482048 hidden units. Given that this text encoding approach is fully trainable, we hereby name it Learnable Word Embedding¬†(LWE). For the question encoding, we explore pre-trained and randomly initialized word-embeddings in various settings, including Word2Vec (W2V) [ref]13 and GloVe . We also explore the use of hidden-states of Skip-Thoughts Vector  and BERT  as replacements for word-embeddings and sentence encoding approaches. Regarding the visual feature extraction (depicted as the green rectangle in Fig.¬†1), we decided to use the pre-computed features proposed in [ref]20. Such an architecture employs a ResNet-152 with a Faster-RCNN  fine-tuned on the Visual Genome dataset. We opted for this approach due to the fact that using pre-computed features is far more computationally efficient, allowing us to train several models with distinct configurations. Moreover, several recent approaches    employ that same strategy as well, making it easier to provide fair comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches.\nIn this study we\nperform experiments with two additional networks widely used for the task at hand, namely VGG-16  and ReSNet-101 . Given the multimodal nature of the problem we are dealing with, it is quite challenging to train proper image and question encoders so as to capture relevant semantic information from both of them. Nevertheless, another essential aspect of the architecture is the component that merges them altogether, allowing for the model to generate answers based on both information sources¬†. The process of multimodal fusion consists itself in a research area with many approaches being recently proposed¬†   .\nThe fusion module receives the extracted image and query features, and provides multimodal features that theoretically present information that allows the system to answer to the visual question. There are many fusion strategies that can either assume quite simple forms, such as vector multiplication or concatenation, or be really complex, involving multilayered neural networks, tensor decomposition, and bi-linear pooling, just to name a few. Following¬†[ref]4, we adopt the element-wise vector multiplication (also referred as Hadamard product) as the default fusion strategy. This approach requires the feature representations to be fused to have the same dimensionality. Therefore, we project them using a fully-connected layer to reduce their dimension from 204820482048 to 102410241024. After being fused together, the multimodal features are finally passed through a fully-connected layer that provides scores (logits) further converted into probabilities via a softmax function (SùëÜS). We want to maximize the probability P(Y=y|X=x,Q=q)P(Y=y|X=x,Q=q) of the correct answer yùë¶y given the image XùëãX and the provided question QùëÑQ. Our models are trained to choose within a set comprised by the 300030003000 most frequent answers extracted from both training and validation sets of the VQA v2.0¬†dataset¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: section we first introduce the baseline approach, with default image and text encoders, alongside a pre-defined fusion strategy.
