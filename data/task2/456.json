      "content": "Paper Title: Asymmetric Leaky Private Information Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the era of big data and data analytics, users who access a plethora of online services face serious privacy risks. Their online behavior and data access patterns can be analyzed to reveal sensitive personal information and breach their privacy . One possible solution to such data leakages is to retrieve information privately by executing a private information retrieval (PIR) protocol. In a PIR protocol, the identity of the message retrieved by the user remains secret from the database(s). This is typically achieved at the expense of an increased communication cost to ensure that the desired message remains hidden among others.\nIn the pioneering work by Chor et al. , the authors considered one-bit long messages. The overhead was calculated as the sum of the queries sent by the user (upload cost) and the answers provided by the database (download cost). Under arbitrarily large messages, the download cost becomes the dominant factor of the PIR overhead. This allows the PIR rate to be defined as the ratio of the message size to the number of downloaded bits. The maximum of these rates is referred to as the PIR capacity and its reciprocal as the download cost. Since the introduction of the PIR problem in , an extensive body of works have investigated efficient PIR schemes that yield either computational     or information-theoretic privacy guarantees [ref]6   [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2.\nThe former achieves privacy assuming computational limitations at the DBs, where cryptographic assumptions are invoked to preserve privacy such that NP-hard computations are required to reveal the requested message identity.\nIn information-theoretic PIR, the DBs are assumed to be computationally unbounded, thus achieving a higher level of assurance. Perfect privacy is guaranteed if the queries do not reveal any information about the desired message (privacy) and the answers are sufficient to recover it (decodability). An intuitive PIR solution is to download all K𝐾K messages from a database. In fact, this is the only way to guarantee perfect privacy in the single database case. However, privacy comes at an impractical communication overhead. Review of Recent Progress on Information-Theoretic PIR:\nA practical way to increase the PIR capacity is to consider a distributed storage system (DSS) of N𝑁N databases. Shah. et al. [ref]6 proposed a PIR scheme that achieves a rate of 1−1N11𝑁1-\\frac{1}{N} when K𝐾K messages are replicated across N𝑁N non-colluding databases. Later, Sun and Jafar  characterized the PIR capacity for any N𝑁N and K𝐾K as (1+1/N+1/N2+⋯+1/NK−1)−1superscript11𝑁1superscript𝑁2⋯1superscript𝑁𝐾11(1+1/N+1/N^{2}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+1/N^{K-1})^{-1}. The original scheme introduced in  achieves capacity when the message size L𝐿L is allowed to grow as a function of N𝑁N and K𝐾K. Subsequently, they characterized the PIR capacity for a fixed message size . Since the appearance of the fundamental result of Sun and Jafar , numerous important and practically relevant variations of PIR have been considered. Multi-round PIR allows multiple rounds of communication between the user and databases. While interaction does not increase capacity, it can reduce the storage overhead at each database 0. Sun and Jafar 1 considered the robust PIR problem where M−N𝑀𝑁M-N out of a total of M>N𝑀𝑁M>N databases fail to respond to user queries. Additionally, they characterized the capacity when T<N𝑇𝑁T<N databases collude and share the received queries. Tajeddine et al. 2 considered MDS-PIR for coded databases where each message is separately coded using an (N,M𝑁𝑀N,M) MDS code. Banawan and Ulukus 3 derived the coded PIR capacity for arbitrary N,M𝑁𝑀N,M, and K𝐾K. Wang and Skogland 4 showed that the PIR capacity remains 1−MN1𝑀𝑁1-\\frac{M}{N} even if each message is coded. In 5 and 6, the scenario of N𝑁N MDS-coded databases with T𝑇T colluding ones was presented. However, the capacity of this case is still an open problem (for other variants of MDS-PIR, see 7 8 9 0). In 1 and 2, the case of multi-message PIR, where the user can use one query to request more than one messages, was investigated. Banawan and Ulukus 3 characterized the PIR capacity with Byzantine databases where any subset of databases can be adversarial and respond untruthfully. In 4, Tajeddine et al. studied the same model but in the presence of colluding databases. Banawan and Ulukus 5 studied PIR through a wiretap channel, where an eavesdropper tries to decode the content sent through the channel. Other variants of PIR in the presence of eavesdroppers are studied in 6,7. The problem of PIR was also studied when the user has a cache or side-information, which can be useful in increasing PIR capacity 8 9 0 1 2.\nPIR from storage-constrained databases was studied in 3 3 4, where capacity was characterized under the assumption of uncoded storage across databases. Recently, Tian et al. 4 proposed a new capacity-achieving scheme with an optimal message size of N−1𝑁1N-1 and a minimum upload cost.\nOther lines of work considered different privacy requirements from the original PIR model in . The problem of symmetric PIR (SPIR) was studied in [ref]9, where the user must be able to retrieve the message of interest privately (user privacy), while at the same time the databases must avoid any information leakage about the remaining K−1𝐾1K-1 messages (DB privacy).\nThe SPIR optimal download cost was characterized as NN−1𝑁𝑁1\\frac{N}{N-1} with common randomness at least α=1N−1𝛼1𝑁1\\alpha=\\frac{1}{N-1} bits per desired message bits.\nLatent-variable PIR was considered recently in 5, where privacy is required for a latent variable describing a predefined user attribute.\nAdditional interesting variants of PIR can be found in 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2. The novel coding schemes and fundamental ideas developed in the above works have also helped in advancing other problems beyond PIR. For instance, an interesting connection between blind interference alignment (BIA) and PIR was studied in 6 showing that a good BIA scheme translates to a good PIR protocol.\nSecure and private distributed matrix multiplication has been considered in 7 8 9 0 1 addressing the problem of computing a product of two matrices with some constraints on the identity of the product matrices and/or the information content in the matrices. Jia and Jafar 7 showed the connection of the secure and private distributed matrix multiplication to one variation of the MDS-PIR problem. Recently, the problem of private set intersection (PSI) was studied in 2 from a PIR perspective and capacity results were obtained. Relaxing Privacy Metrics for PIR: The above works have all focused on perfect privacy, either for the user (as in PIR), or for both the user and the DBs (as in SPIR). The perfect privacy requirement usually comes at the expense of high download cost and does not allow tuning the PIR efficiency and privacy according to the application requirements. In scenarios of frequent message retrieval, trading user or DB privacy for communication efficiency could be desirable. Ideally, one would select a desired leakage level and then design a leakage-constrained PIR scheme that guarantees such privacy while maximizing the PIR capacity. A few previous works have introduced privacy definitions that relax the notion of perfect privacy. Asonov et al. replaced privacy with the concept of repudiation 3. The repudiation property is achieved if some uncertainty remains about the desired message. However, this metric does not provide any information-theoretic privacy guarantees, as repudiation is satisfied even if the retrieved message can be identified with almost certainty.\nRecently, Toledo et al. 4 adopted a game-based differential privacy definition to increase the PIR capacity at the expense of bounded privacy loss. However, their privacy definition only captures the privacy of the submitted queries. The authors propose several schemes that hide the query identity and study their cost. Although the query privacy can be thought of as functional equivalent to information-theoretic PIR in some cases, it does not satisfy the perfect privacy definition. In our prior work, we introduced the Leaky PIR (L-PIR) where a bounded amount of leakage is allowed about the message identity 5. We adopted a concept similar to differential privacy to bound the leakage as a function of a non-negative constant ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. The leakage in privacy is achieved by constructing multiple biased “retrieval paths” across databases where each path realizes one query per database. Lin et al. 6 7 relaxed user privacy by allowing bounded\nmutual information between the queries and the corresponding requested message index. Unlike 6 7, which deal with the average leakage (measured by mutual information), the L-PIR model in 5 satisfies the privacy leakage constraints strictly for all possible query/message index combinations, and thus provides stronger privacy guarantees. In another recent work, Guo et al. 8 considered the problem of SPIR with perfect user privacy and relaxed DB privacy. DB privacy was relaxed by allowing a bounded mutual information (no more than δ𝛿\\delta) between the undesired messages, the queries, and the answers received by the user. Similar to the original work on SPIR in [ref]9, SPIR with relaxed DB privacy in 8 requires sharing common randomness among DBs and comes at the expense of a loss in the PIR capacity. Summary of contributions–\nWe investigate a three-way tradeoff between user privacy, DB privacy, and the communication efficiency of PIR.\nWe study the problem of Asymmetric Leaky PIR (AL-PIR) where some information about the identity of the desired message is allowed to leak to the DBs, and some information about the undesired messages is allowed to leak to the user. The goal is to trade privacy in both directions for achieving gains in PIR capacity, thus making PIR more communication-efficient.\nFor user privacy, we adopt the metric introduced in our prior work 5, where the privacy bound is determined as a function of a non-negative constant ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. For bounding DB privacy, we adopt a mutual information-based leakage metric to be bounded by a non-negative constant δ𝛿\\delta.\nWe next summarize the main contributions: We propose an AL-PIR scheme that satisfies the leakage budgets in both directions for arbitrary values of (ϵ,δ)italic-ϵ𝛿(\\epsilon,\\delta), an arbitrary number of K𝐾K messages, and an arbitrary number of N𝑁N databases. The achievable download cost of this scheme is given by D​(ϵ,δ)=1+1N−1−δ​eϵNK−1−1𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿11𝑁1𝛿superscript𝑒italic-ϵsuperscript𝑁𝐾11D(\\epsilon,\\delta)=1+\\frac{1}{N-1}-\\frac{\\delta e^{\\epsilon}}{N^{K-1}-1}. This cost also represents an upper bound on the optimal download cost (lower bound on the capacity) of the AL-PIR. We use an alternate perfect privacy PIR scheme that follows a path-based approach, where a user’s query is equivalent to selecting one of several possible paths across databases. A path is defined as a set of queries, one per database, that achieves decodability, however different paths incur different download costs. We leverage this cost imbalance to introduce leakage through the idea of biasing the path selection probabilities. A path giving a lower download cost can be used more frequently compared to higher download cost paths. This biasing introduces user privacy leakage. The path selection probabilities are chosen to minimize the download cost while satisfying the privacy budget, measured by ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. To achieve DB privacy, our scheme requires sharing common randomness among databases. We combine the path-based approach with the ideas of the scheme presented in 8 to arrive at our general AL-PIR scheme. In particular, achieving a DB privacy leakage of no more than δ​L𝛿𝐿\\delta L bits, requires common randomness given by (1N−1−eϵ+NK−1−1NK−1−1​δ)​L1𝑁1superscript𝑒italic-ϵsuperscript𝑁𝐾11superscript𝑁𝐾11𝛿𝐿\\big{(}\\frac{1}{N-1}-\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+N^{K-1}-1}{N^{K-1}-1}\\ \\delta\\big{)}L bits, which represents an upper bound on the optimal common randomness size. We present a converse proof to obtain a lower bound on the optimum download cost (upper bound on capacity). This bound is characterized by D∗​(ϵ,δ)≥1+1N​eϵ−1−δ(N​eϵ)K−1−1superscript𝐷italic-ϵ𝛿11𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ1𝛿superscript𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ𝐾11D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\geq 1+\\frac{1}{Ne^{\\epsilon}-1}-\\frac{\\delta}{(Ne^{\\epsilon})^{K-1}-1}.\nThe upper and lower bounds are shown to match each other at extreme values of epsilon (ϵ=0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon=0; ϵ→∞→italic-ϵ\\epsilon\\to\\infty) and for any δ𝛿\\delta.\nMoreover, we show through gap analysis that our upper and lower bounds are within a maximum multiplicative gap of N−e−ϵN−1𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ𝑁1\\frac{N-e^{-\\epsilon}}{N-1} for any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 and δ≥0𝛿0\\delta\\geq 0. We derive a lower bound on the optimal required common randomness at the databases. This bound characterizes that achieving a DB privacy leakage of no more than δ​L𝛿𝐿\\delta L bits, requires shared randomness of size no less than (1N​eϵ−1−(N​eϵ)K−1(N​eϵ)K−1−1​δ)​L1𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ1superscript𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ𝐾1superscript𝑁superscript𝑒italic-ϵ𝐾11𝛿𝐿(\\frac{1}{Ne^{\\epsilon}-1}\\ -\\frac{(Ne^{\\epsilon})^{K-1}}{(Ne^{\\epsilon})^{K-1}-1}\\delta)L bits. We investigate the tradeoffs AL-PIR variations in both sides of leakage as special cases\nof our general (ϵ,δ)italic-ϵ𝛿(\\epsilon,\\delta) AL-PIR scheme. In particular, we show a three-way tradeoff between download cost, user privacy, and DB privacy, such that enhancing one of them would be at the expense of the other two. We also show matching results for the following special cases for our derived bounds on the AL-PIR model: a) perfect user privacy (original PIR) , b) perfect user and DB privacy (SPIR) [ref]9, c) Leaky user privacy (L-PIR) 5, and d) perfect user privacy and leaky DB privacy 8.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Since the introduction of the PIR problem in , an extensive body of works have investigated efficient PIR schemes that yield either computational     or information-theoretic privacy guarantees [ref]6   [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2.\nThe former achieves privacy assuming computational limitations at the DBs, where cryptographic assumptions are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
