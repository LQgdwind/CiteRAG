      "content": "Paper Title: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Reverse Model-based Imagination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe train a probabilistic neural network to represent the approximated reverse dynamics and reward model, which takes the next state and current action as input and outputs a diagonal multivariate Gaussian distribution predicting state difference and reward: where 𝝁ϕsubscript𝝁italic-ϕ\\bm{\\mu}_{\\phi} and 𝚺ϕsubscript𝚺italic-ϕ\\bm{\\Sigma}_{\\phi} denote the mean and variance of reverse model p^ϕsubscript^𝑝italic-ϕ\\widehat{p}_{\\phi}, respectively. To boost the model accuracy, following Janner et al. (2019) , we train an ensemble of seven such models and pick the best five models according to the validated performance on a hold-out set of 1000 transitions in the offline dataset. During the model-based imagination, we randomly select a model from the best five model candidates to rollout trajectories per step. The neural network architecture of each model has four feedforward layers with 200 hidden units. Each intermediate layer has a swish activation, and the inputs and outputs of our models are normalized across the given dataset. The rollout policy G^θ​(a|s′)subscript^𝐺𝜃conditional𝑎superscript𝑠′\\widehat{G}_{\\theta}(a|s^{\\prime}) implemented by a conditional VAE has two components: an encoder E^ω​(s′,a)subscript^𝐸𝜔superscript𝑠′𝑎\\widehat{E}_{\\omega}(s^{\\prime},a) and a decoder D^ξ​(s′,z)subscript^𝐷𝜉superscript𝑠′𝑧\\widehat{D}_{\\xi}(s^{\\prime},z). Both the encoder and the decoder contain two intermediate layers with 750 hidden units and relu activations. Besides the common implementation of conditional VAE  [ref]8, our rollout policy G^θ​(a|s′)subscript^𝐺𝜃conditional𝑎superscript𝑠′\\widehat{G}_{\\theta}(a|s^{\\prime}) takes the next state as input and can sample reverse action usinsubscript𝑠ins_{\\text{in}}g stochastic inference from an underlying latent space. To generate diverse imaginary trajectories in complex tasks, we adopt such conditional VAE as a rollout policy introduced in Section 3. Moreover, we observe that ROMI’s reverse model is quite accurate in the maze2d and hopper domains, in which ROMI can also use a uniform policy to launch diverse trajectories instead. We introduce the hyperparameters of ROMI in Table 7. As suggested by the evaluated reverse model error in Table 5, we perform short-horizon model rollouts in the 24 tasks of D4RL benchmark, in which ROMI rollouts five steps in domains with higher model accuracy and performs one step imagination in walker2d and halfcheetah. For antmaze with sparse rewards, we prioritize the start point of model imagination, in which the prioritized weights are similarly introduced in BAIL 7. We combine ROMI with prior offline RL learning algorithms (i.e., BCQ [ref]8 or CQL ) to conduct extensive evaluations on D4RL benchmark suite. As discussed in Section 3, ROMI combines the given dataset 𝒟envsubscript𝒟env{\\mathcal{D}}_{\\rm{env}} and model-based buffer 𝒟modelsubscript𝒟model{\\mathcal{D}}_{\\text{model}} to obtain the total dataset 𝒟totalsubscript𝒟total{\\mathcal{D}}_{\\text{total}} for model-free learning methods. During policy training, we collect the training minibatches from two sources, 𝒟envsubscript𝒟env{\\mathcal{D}}_{\\rm{env}} and 𝒟modelsubscript𝒟model{\\mathcal{D}}_{\\text{model}}, and define the ratio of data collected from the model-based buffer 𝒟modelsubscript𝒟model{\\mathcal{D}}_{\\text{model}} as η∈ 𝜂01\\eta\\in . Therefore, the ratio of data collected from 𝒟envsubscript𝒟env{\\mathcal{D}}_{\\rm{env}} is naturally derived by 1−η1𝜂1-\\eta. We list the hyperparameters η𝜂\\eta in Table 7, where we search over η∈{0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9}𝜂0.10.30.50.70.9\\eta\\in\\{0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9\\} and choose the best one for each domain. We found that data ratio η=0.1𝜂0.1\\eta=0.1 is generally effective for ROMI. The only exception is the maze2d domain, in which other ratios were found to work better. Moreover, ROMI’s training time on an NVIDIA RTX 2080TI GPU of each task is about eight hours to 20 hours with the BCQ or CQL learning algorithms. We compare ROMI with eleven state-of-the-art offline RL baselines: BC (behavior cloning), BCQ [ref]8, BEAR 0, BRAC-v, BRAC-p , BAIL 7, CQL , MOPO 3, MOReL 2, Repb-SDE 4, and COMBO 5. Our implementation of these baseline algorithms refers to their public source codes. In particularly, we utilize the implementation of BC introduced by the Repb-SDE repository and the implementation of MOReL and COMBO is referred to https://github.com/SwapnilPande/MOReL/ and https://github.com/takuseno/d3rlpy/, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Both the encoder and the decoder contain two intermediate layers with 750 hidden units and relu activations.
