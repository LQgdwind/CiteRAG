      "content": "Paper Title: EI-MTD: Moving Target Defense for Edge Intelligence against Adversarial Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA number of defenses have been proposed to harden networks against adversarial attacks, including preprocessing techniques , [ref]43, detection algorithms , , veriﬁcation and provable defenses , , and various theoretically motivated heuristics , . More sophisticated defenses that rely on network distillation  and specialized activation functions [ref]51 were also toppled by strong attacks , , , [ref]51. Despite the eventual defeat of other adversarial defenses, adversarial training with a PGD adversary remains empirically robust to this day [ref]16. In [ref]16, it shows that increasing the capacity of DNNs can increase the robustness when adversarial training is applied. Hence, we choose adversarial training for a teacher DNN on the cloud data center, but not train student DNNs directly due to their relatively small capacity. Instead, we further use knowledge distillation to transfer robust knowledge from a teacher DNN to student DNNs. Many recent defenses resort to randomization schemes for mitigating the effects of adversarial perturbations in the input or feature space. Xie et al.  utilize random resizing and padding to mitigate the adversarial effects at the inference stage. Guo et al.  apply image transformations with randomness such as a bit-depth reduction before feeding the image to a CNN. These methods are effective in black-box settings, but not well in white-box settings. Dhillon et al.  present a method to stochastically prune a subset of the activations in each layer and retain activations with larger magnitudes. Luo et al.  introduce a new CNN structure by randomly masking the feature maps output from the convolutional layers. Other randomization schemes are inspired by MTD, which randomly switches the models served for classification. Sailik et. al  proposed an MTDeep to defend DNNs by a repeated Bayesian game. Their experimental results show that MTDeep reduces misclassiﬁcation on perturbed images for MNIST and ImageNet datasets while maintaining high classiﬁcation accuracy on a legitimate test image. Roy et. al  propose an MTD against transferable adversarial attacks. Their experiment results show that even under very harsh constraints, e.g., no attack-cost, and availability of attacks which can bring down the accuracy to 0, it is possible to achieve reasonable accuracy for classification. Song et. al  designed an fMTD for embedded deep visual sensing systems by forking models to simulate MTD. However, all these defenses are not aimed at edge intelligence and did not take account of the limitation of resources as we explained in Section 1.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: A number of defenses have been proposed to harden networks against adversarial attacks, including preprocessing techniques , [ref]43, detection algorithms , , veriﬁcation and provable defenses , , and various theoretically motivated heuristics , .
