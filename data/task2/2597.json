      "content": "Paper Title: 3DStyleNet: Creating 3D Shapes with Geometric and Texture Style Variations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D style transfer is one of the main applications of 3DStyleNet. We compare our method to a strong baseline method which combines NeuralCage [ref]57 and linear image style transfer network [ref]27. Specifically, in the baseline method, we train NeuralCage on our training shapes, and use it to deform the source shape to match the target shape. We then feed the source and target texture images to the pre-trained linear image style transfer network to transfer the texture style as well. The results of the baseline and our method are shown in Fig. 5. Our method can better approximate both the geometric and texture style of the target object. Notice that the baseline largely preserves the source shape for the car category, while ours produces results closer to the target shape.\nLikewise, for animals, our method captures style of the target shape and texture, which is especially evident for the 5th column – while the baseline simply enlarges the dog’s head, our method jointly stylizes both geometry and texture to achieve the cartoon look of the target shape. We also observe some failure cases. For example, the elephant nose in the 6-7th columns is unnaturally warped.\nThis is because we do not define a nose part in our segmentation, and our method relies on semantic part segmentation of the source object.\nThe human cartoon style transfer results show that our method does a better job in semantic-ware style transfer than baseline. For example, in the last column, the baseline mistakenly transfers the color of hair to human faces while our method does not. User Study.\nWe conducted a user study through Amazon Mechanical Turk where users were asked to compare our results against using Neural Cage [ref]57 and Style Transfer [ref]27 combined. We generated 2000 videos of the source and target models, which we labeled original animals A and B, and the two stylized models, which we labeled hybrid animals C and D, where in half the videos our model was hybrid C and in the other half it was hybrid D to overcome what is known as left-side selection bias.\nWhen asked whether the stylized animal models are closer to the target shape or closer to the source shape, 41.9% of users reported that our model is closer to the target than it is to the source, compared to only 26.8% for the baseline model. 69.6% of users thought our generated colors and patterns are closer to animal B than those of the baseline, and 63.4% reported that our model has more similar shape and body proportions to the target than those of the baseline. However, only 51.2% reported that our model is more unique than the baseline and 53.1% reported that our overall shape is more of a blend of the two shapes compared to the baseline. The questions we asked in the AMT survey can be found in the Supplement. Mesh Texture Transfer.\nIf disabling the geometric style transfer,\nour 3DStyleNet can also be applied to the task of mesh texture transfer (see §2.3).\nUnlike purely geometric\napproaches that seek to find a distortion-minimizing mapping between\ngeometries, our approach is able to hallucinate new texture images.\nAs a result, our method avoids\ndistortions of the source texture caused by widely different target geometry (see\nclose ups in Fig. 6), and tends to preserve\nsalient features of the target (such as the face of the goat).\nCompared to the baseline, our method is orders of magnitude faster (9∼similar-to\\sim10 seconds on RTX 2080ti) and robust to non-manifold\nnon-watertight meshes with diverse topologies, which makes it practical\nfor processing meshes in the wild. In contrast, competitive methods in §2.3 place many requirements on the input\ngeometry – for example, only half of the goat is available for  in Fig.6\nbecause this method is designed for geometries that are homeomorphic to a disk. \n\n\n\nAugmentation Method\nChamfer ↓↓\\downarrow\nChamfer L1 ↓↓\\downarrow\nF-score ↑↑\\uparrow\n\nSeen Shapes\nSimilar Shapes\nUnseen shapes\nSeen Shapes\nSimilar Shapes\nUnseen shapes\nSeen Shapes\nSimilar Shapes\nUnseen shapes\n\nNo Data Augmentation\n0.025\n0.035\n0.065\n0.073\n0.102\n0.187\n0.323\n0.210\n0.085\n\nRandom Affine\n0.040\n0.043\n0.053\n0.114\n0.123\n0.152\n0.211\n0.195\n0.144\n\nNeural Cage [ref]57 Geometry\n0.017\n0.022\n0.044\n0.050\n0.064\n0.128\n0.415\n0.346\n0.143\n\nRandom COCO  Texure\n0.014\n0.021\n0.045\n0.040\n0.061\n0.131\n0.572\n0.361\n0.140\n\nStyle Transfer [ref]27 Texture\n0.015\n0.023\n0.047\n0.042\n0.068\n0.136\n0.518\n0.316\n0.122\n\nNeural Cage [ref]57 + Style Transfer [ref]27\n0.019\n0.022\n0.040\n0.053\n0.062\n0.116\n0.423\n0.370\n0.181\n\nOurs: Geometry Transfer only\n0.018\n0.021\n0.040\n0.051\n0.062\n0.116\n0.423\n0.358\n0.188\n\nOurs: Texture Transfer only\n0.012\n0.024\n0.051\n0.034\n0.070\n0.148\n0.623\n0.314\n0.118\n\nOurs(w/o finetune): Texture + Geometry Transfer\n0.019\n0.022\n0.039\n0.054\n0.063\n0.111\n0.414\n0.360\n0.183\n\nOurs: Texture + Geometry Transfer\n0.016\n0.019\n0.037\n0.047\n0.055\n0.107\n0.449\n0.394\n0.218\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nInput\n\n\n\nNo Aug.\n\n\n\nRandom Aff.\n\n\n\nN.
