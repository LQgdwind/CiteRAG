Bespoke Approximation of Multiplication-Accumulation and Activation Targeting Printed Multilayer Perceptrons\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrinted electronics (PE) offer a promising solution for introducing computing and intelligence into various domains, including low-end healthcare products like smart bandages, disposables, packaged foods and beverages, smart packaging, in-situ monitoring applications and the vast market of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)   .\nThese domains impose stringent demands for ultra-low cost (even sub-cent) and conformality, requirements that cannot be met by lithography-based silicon technologies.\nOn the other hand, PE technology features negligible non-recurrent engineering (NRE) costs, low equipment costs, and ultra-low fabrication cost .\nConsidering also the inherently supported features of conformality, flexibility, stretchability, non-toxicity, and porosity; PE technology is increasingly recognized as a key enabler for the Internet of Things as part of the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, whose core technology advances are functionality and low-cost . By PE we refer to a set of fabrication techniques that are based on printing processes that can realize ultra-low cost, large scale and flexible hardware .\nPE does not challenge silicon-based electronics in integration density, area, or speed, mainly due to their large feature sizes arising from low-cost and low-resolution printing.\nTypically, operating frequency of printed circuits ranges from a few Hz to only a few kHz  while their feature size tends to be several microns [ref]6.\nOn the other hand, due to its form-factor, conformity, low cost, and on-demand, even at low-volume fabrication, PE can target application domains untouchable by silicon VLSI .\nHowever, their large feature sizes and inherent high transistor gate capacitances result in increased power and area compared to nanometer technologies.\nDespite the appealing features of PE, such limitations make the realization of complex circuits, as machine learning (ML) classifiers that form the core task in most printed applications , very challenging. As an attempt to mitigate the aforementioned limitations, the authors in [ref]8 exploit the potential for high customization, originating by the low-fabrication and NRE costs of printed circuits and designed bespoke ML classifiers.\nThe term bespoke refers to fully-customized circuit implementations, tailored to specific ML model and dataset.\nThe bespoke designs of [ref]8 achieved remarkable area and power savings that proved however insufficient towards the realization of complex ML circuits, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs).\nThus, [ref]8 focused only on simple ML models (e.g., Decision Trees).\nTargeting more complex printed ML circuits, the authors in [ref]9 0  1 employed Approximate Computing.\nApproximate computing for ML circuit design is gaining significant attention since by trading some loss in accuracy, it can achieve high gains in area and power 2 3.\nThough, their proposed approximations are limited in scope and do not exploit the full spectrum of Approximate Computing, resulting in conservative gains.\nSimilarly, 4 used Stochastic Computing that resulted however in large accuracy degradation. In this work, we propose an automated design framework that through means of bespoke design and approximation enables printed-battery powered MLP classifiers.\nUnlike the state of the art, we implement a holistic approximation that targets the core components of a MLP circuit: multiplication, accumulation, and activation function.\nSpecifically, we use power-of-2 weight quantization to eliminate multiplications and quantized Relu to reduce the size of the outputs of the hidden layer.\nMoreover, we propose an accumulation approximation that through a genetic optimization reduces the number of summand bits in each accumulator.\nFinally, we also approximate the activation function of the output layer by selectively comparing subsets of its inputs, decreasing, thus, the size of the comparators.\nCompared to the state-of-the-art exact baseline, our evaluation shows that, across six MLPs of varying complexity, our framework delivers more than 2.62.62.6x area and 888x power reduction for less than 555% accuracy loss. Our novel contributions within this work are as follows: This is the first comprehensive approximation framework\n111Our framework is available at https://github.com/floAfentaki/Approximation-Techniques-Targeting-Printed-MLPs\nfor printed MLPs circuits that apply a holistic approximation across all the MLP components: multiplication, accumulation, and activation function. We propose an activation-aware accumulation approximation, customized for bespoke MLP circuits, that is applied through a multi-objective genetic optimization.\nOur proposed area model and accuracy evaluation of approximate printed MLP circuits enable fast and high-level exploration of the corresponding approximation space. Our framework enables printed-battery powered operation of complex printed MLP circuits for up to 555% accuracy loss. Specifically, our framework surpasses the current state of the art by increasing the number of parameters that can be integrated into a printed MLP circuit by 202020x.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: arising from low-cost and low-resolution printing.\nTypically, operating frequency of printed circuits ranges from a few Hz to only a few kHz  while their feature size tends to be several microns [ref]6.\nOn the other hand, due to its form-factor, conformity, low cost, and on-demand, even at low-volume fabrication, PE can target application domains untouchable by silicon VLSI .\nHowever, their\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
