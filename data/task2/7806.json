      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Resource Partitioning on Modern GPUs: A Reinforcement Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince multi-/many-core architectures and CPU-GPU heterogeneous architectures became common in servers and HPC clusters, a variety of co-scheduling and resource partitioning techniques have been proposed.\nHowever, as far as we know, this is the first work to apply a reinforcement learning approach to co-optimize the hierarchical resource partitioning and co-scheduling job selections for modern GPUs.  Literature of Co-scheduling and Resource Partitioning: \nSince multi-core processors appeared on the market, several researchers have proposed co-scheduling mechanisms while focusing on multi-programmed but single-threaded workloads.\nY. Jiang et al. studied the theoretical aspects of co-scheduling and provided an optimal solution .\nThen, K. Tai et al. extended this theoretical work to take the execution time lengths into account .\nS. Zhuravlev et al. focused on the shared resource contention in a processor and proposed an interference-aware co-scheduling method .\nJ. Feliu et al. proposed a scheduling policy that explicitly considers the contentions on the underlying shared cache hierarchy .\nM. Banikazemi et al. designed and implemented a user-level meta co-scheduler and demonstrated the effectiveness . Other researchers extended the ideas and proposed several co-scheduling techniques for multi-threaded programs.\nM. Bhadauria et al. explored the feasibility of space-shared scheduling using a greedy-based co-run job selection and resource allocation policy . Then, H. Sasaki et al. proposed a scalability-based resource allocation approach for a given multi-programmed and multi-threaded workload . J. Breitbart et al. created a resource monitoring tool useful for co-scheduling HPC applications  and provided a memory-intensity-aware co-scheduling policy .\nSince the industry started supporting several QoS control features, some researchers combined the above concepts with cache partitioning  , bandwidth partitioning   or the combination of them  .\nQ. Zhu et al. rather targeted CPU-GPU heterogeneous processors and proposed a co-scheduling approach suitable for them . Applying Co-scheduling and Resource Partitioning to GPUs: \nS. Pai et al. first pointed out the waste of resources within a GPU when running a CUDA kernel and explored the feasibility of GPU multi-processing using their elastic kernel implementation .\nI. Tanasic et al. proposed a microarchitectural mechanism to enable multi-processing on GPUs, which does not require any kernel modifications .\nFollowing these seminal studies, the MPS feature has been already supported in commercial Nvidia GPUs . Several studies focused on software mechanisms to improve the efficiency of multi-processing on GPUs.\nT. Allen et al. proposed a framework called Slate that optimizes the combination of co-located processes and dynamically adjusts the scales of them .\nsmCompactor is a similar framework to Slate, which aims at maximizing the resource utilization [ref]28.\nC. Reano et al. proposed a safe co-scheduling mechanism that takes memory footprints into account when processes are co-scheduled in a time sharing manner .\nOther studies rather focused on hardware mechanisms to improve the efficiency of the concurrency controlling features   .\nSince the industry has started supporting the physical resource partitioning called MIG , few studies targeted the MIG-based partitioning and proposed several optimization mechanisms [ref]33  .\nThe closest work to ours is , which covers co-scheduling decision making and resource partitioning, however it does not manage the hierarchical partitioning and works only when co-locating two programs. System Optimizations with Reinforcement Learning:\nSince reinforcement learning is a powerful tool to optimize software or hardware knobs, it has been widely used also for a variety of system optimizations.\nAlthough these techniques are promising or already widely used, they target fundamentally different problems from ours.\nE. Ipek et al. proposed a reinforcement learning-based memory controller design that optimizes the scheduling policy on the fly .\nFollowing this seminal work, there have been a variety of software/hardware optimizations using reinforcement learning.\nYoo et al. applied reinforcement learning to determine several parameters in a QLC SSD such as the SLC cache size and the hot/cold separation threshold [ref]35.\nD. Zhang et al. invented RLScheduler that automatically configures the priority function used for batch scheduling in HPC systems based on reinforcement learning .\nR. Chen et al. utilized reinforcement learning to co-optimize the cache and bandwidth allocations for multi-programmed server workloads .\nY. Wang et al. proposed a power management technique for multi-core processors based on reinforcement learning .\nP. Zhang et al. applied an reinforcement learning approach to an ensemble controller that dynamically selects the best prefetch policy from multiple different prefetchers .\nG. Singh et al. targeted hybrid storage systems and proposed an adaptive and extensible data placement using their online reinforcement learning approach .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: that optimizes the combination of co-located processes and dynamically adjusts the scales of them .\nsmCompactor is a similar framework to Slate, which aims at maximizing the resource utilization [ref]28.\nC. Reano et al. proposed a safe co-scheduling mechanism that takes memory footprints into account when processes are co-scheduled in a time sharing manner .\nOther studies rather focused on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
