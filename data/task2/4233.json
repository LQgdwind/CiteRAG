      "content": "Paper Title: Distilling a Pretrained Language Model to a Multilingual ASR Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompared to other machine learning domains, obtaining speech data is expensive, ending up in unavoidable performance degradation of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model.\nFurther, collecting non-English speech data is exceptionally difficult as there are not so many speakers available  [ref]2 .\nIn contrast, text models have been successfully developed and widely utilized by improving the performance based on the vast web-crawled corpus   .\nEspecially, the rise of end-to-end (E2E) transformer-based models showed numerous successes    0, such as cross-lingual language models  1.\nMotivated by this, transformer architecture is becoming increasingly common for E2E ASR models [ref]2 2 3 4 5 6 7, where its generalization performance is still limited compared to that of text models.\nFurthermore, many approaches have been introduced for multilingual ASR, such as adapter modules [ref]2 8 9, multi-head architecture   , logit adjustment [ref]2, language-dependent batching 8 , multi-task training  , language embeddings  , and cross-lingual training 2.\nHowever, ASR performance has been limited for minor languages, e.g., languages with less than 100 hours of speech.\nHence, it naturally raises the following intuition: Can we utilize the well-trained cross-lingual language models to increase the performance of multilingual ASR models on low-resource languages? One of the main approaches to using one model to help the other is knowledge distillation (KD)    [ref]27   0.\nKD transfers the information embedded inside the latent representations of the teacher model to the student model, which improves the predictive performance of the student model without any architectural modifications .\nHence, it can enjoy the better of two worlds, easily adding the KD loss in a plug-and-play manner to the existing model training, yet enjoying the better performance with the aid of the teacher model.\nFor the classification models, it is common to distill by minimizing the distance between two output logits of the teacher and student networks   .\nAlso, many transformer-specific KD methods have been introduced to distill the information more effectively [ref]27   0.\n[ref]27 minimizes the distance between the attention maps or feature outputs of two transformer models with different sizes.\n distills the attention maps of a transformer-based audio model to smaller architectures such as convolutional or recurrent neural networks. Although the above methods concentrate on distilling between the same modalities, some methods bridge the differences between speech and text.\n distills between text and speech models by minimizing the distance between the classification probabilities, whereas 0 minimizes the distances between the first hidden representations or the output logits.\nBoth works sidestep the discrepancy problem between speech and text modalities by disregarding the sequence-level features.\n[ref]2 handles the multilingual ASR by directly copying the weights of the cross-lingual language model to the ASR model‚Äôs transformer decoder.\n2 uses kùëòk-means clustering to segment the audio into phonemic units, where text input is also phonemicized for adversarial training to distinguish the features between two different modalities.\n1 aligns the text and speech embeddings via a learnable linear transform layer in an unsupervised manner.\nFinally, a simple nùëõn-gram language model is commonly applied to the final predictions to improve the ASR performance 2 6 2.\nWe did not utilize the method in our work, but we emphasize that it can be used in parallel with the KD methods.\nKD methods try to yield better predictions in the first place, where using the nùëõn-gram language model concentrates on refining the output predictions further. However, aligning the sequence-level temporal features between text and speech data remains challenging.\nThe shrink mechanism 3 is commonly used to align temporal information between speech and text.\nIt clusters the neighboring outputs into speech segments while discarding the non-speech segments.\n4 propose a model that contains speech and text models as its components, where it concentrates on solving the speech-to-text translation task.\n5 introduces an encoder-decoder architecture with the losses that accommodates each module to solve the ASR task.\n6 inputs speech and text to the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively, improving the performance of speech translation task. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Distilling a Language model to a Speech model (Distill-L2S), to leverage the rich knowledge from a well-trained general text model to increase the multilingual ASR performance, especially for low-resource languages.\nOur method distills the knowledge by minimizing the differences between text and speech features.\nWe use various methods to mitigate the inherent discrepancy between the two modalities, such as the shrink method 3, nearest-neighbor interpolation 7, and a learnable linear transformation layer [ref]27 1.\nUnlike previous methods, our method avoids additional modification of the pre-existing ASR architectures, only requiring the speech features to be sequence-based.\nWe distill the knowledge of the transformer-based cross-lingual text model, InfoXLM 1, while fine-tuning the transformer-based large-scale ASR model, XLSR-wav2vec 2.0 2.\nWe experiment on 20 low-resource languages of the CommonVoice dataset  to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: performance degradation of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model.\nFurther, collecting non-English speech data is exceptionally difficult as there are not so many speakers available  [ref]2 .\nIn contrast, text models have been successfully developed and widely utilized by improving the performance based on the vast web-crawled corpus   .\nEspecially, the rise of end-to-end (E2E)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
