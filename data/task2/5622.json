      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Intrinsic Embedding for Non-rigid Point Cloud Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEstimating correspondences between non-rigidly aligned point clouds serves as a critical building block in many computer vision and graphics applications, including animation  [ref]36, robotics [ref]16 , autonomous driving [ref]55 , to name a few.\nIn contrast to the well known rigid case, more sophisticated deformation models are in demand to characterize the non-rigid motions, for instance, articulation movements of human shapes. To address this challenge, extrinsic methods in principle approximate a complex global non-rigid deformation with a set of local rigid and/or affine transformations, e.g., point-wise affine transformation   , deformation graph   , and patch-based deformation  .\nBeing intuitive and straightforward, the extrinsic deformation models are in general redundant and lack global structures.\nOn the other hand, intrinsic methods   0    first transform extrinsic coordinates into an alternative representation, in which shape alignment is performed.\nFor instance, the seminal functional maps framework  utilizes eigenbasis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator as spectral embeddings and turns non-rigid 3D shapes matching into rigid alignment of high-dimensional spectral embeddings, under the isometric deformation assumption.\nHowever, spectral embeddings are generally obtained by an inefficient, non-differentiable off-line eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian operator defined on shapes, either represented as polygonal meshes  or point clouds .\nMoreover, spectral embeddings are sensitive to various practical artifacts such as noise, partiality, disconnectedness, to name a few. To this end, we follow the isometric assumption and first propose a learning-based framework, Neural Intrinsic Embedding (NIE), to embed point clouds into a high-dimensional space.\nIn particular, we expect our embedding to satisfy the following desiderata: (1) It is aware of the intrinsic geometry of the underlying surface; (2) It is computationally efficient; (3) It is robust to typical artifacts manifested in point clouds.\nOur key insight is that geodesics on a deformable surface, which are inherently related to Riemannian metric, contain rich information of the intrinsic geometry.\nTherefore NIE is trained such that the Euclidean distance between embeddings approximates the geodesic distance between the corresponding points on the underlying surface.\nIn particular, considering the local tracing manner of geodesic computation, we choose DGCNN  as our backbone, which efficiently gathers local features at different abstraction levels.\nWe also carefully formulate a set of losses and design network modification to overcome practical learning issues including rank deficiency, and sensitivity to point sampling density. As a consequence, NIE manages to learn an intrinsic-aware embedding from merely unstructured point clouds. Fig. 1 demonstrates that, we obtain the segmentation result the closest to the ground-truth based on geodesic distances. Furthermore, based on NIE, we propose a Neural Intrinsic Mapping (NIM) network, a weakly supervised learning framework for non-rigid point cloud matching.\nThough closely related to the Deep Functional Maps (DFM) frameworks, our method replaces the spectral embedding with the trained NIE, and further learns to extract the optimal features based on a self-supervised loss borrowed from .\nIn the end, we establish a pipeline for weakly supervised non-rigid point cloud matching, which only requires all the point clouds to be rigidly aligned and, for training point clouds, access to the geodesic distance matrices of them. Our overall pipeline is simple and geometrically informative. We conduct a set of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline. In particular, we highlight that (1) our method performs on par with or even better than the competing baselines which generally require more supervision and/or more structural geometric input on near-isometric point cloud matching; (2) our method achieves sensible generalization performance, thanks to our tailored design to reduce bias of point sampling density; (3) our method is robust regarding several artifacts, including noise and various partiality.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Estimating correspondences between non-rigidly aligned point clouds serves as a critical building block in many computer vision and graphics applications, including animation  [ref]36, robotics [ref]16 , autonomous driving [ref]55 , to name a few.\nIn contrast to the well known rigid case, more sophisticated deformation models are in demand to characterize the non-rigid\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
