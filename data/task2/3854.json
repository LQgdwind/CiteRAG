      "content": "Paper Title: Chromatic 𝑘-Nearest Neighbor Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present the data structure of Chan et al. [ref]12 for finding the mode color among points in query disks.\nThis data structure can then be used in conjunction with that of Section 3.2 to get a data structure for chromatic k𝑘k-nearest neighbors queries. We first transform the problem, by performing a lifting map and\nsubsequently dualizing the points. For the lifting map, we map\neach point p∈P𝑝𝑃p\\in P to the point\np^=(px,py,px2+py2)^𝑝subscript𝑝𝑥subscript𝑝𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑥2superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑦2\\hat{p}=(p_{x},p_{y},p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}), essentially lifting the points\nof P𝑃P to the three-dimensional unit paraboloid. Call the set of\nlifted points P^^𝑃\\hat{P}. In the following lemma, we will show\nthat a disk D=D​(q,r)𝐷𝐷𝑞𝑟D=D(q,r) corresponds to the halfspace\nh−​(q,r):z≤2​qx​x+2​qy​y−qx2−qy2+r2:superscriptℎ𝑞𝑟𝑧2subscript𝑞𝑥𝑥2subscript𝑞𝑦𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑥2superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑦2superscript𝑟2h^{-}(q,r):z\\leq 2q_{x}x+2q_{y}y-q_{x}^{2}-q_{y}^{2}+r^{2}.\nSee Figure 6 for an illustration\nof this fact. Let D=D​(q,r)𝐷𝐷𝑞𝑟D=D(q,r) be a disk in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}.\nA point p∈ℝ2𝑝superscriptℝ2p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} lies in D𝐷D if and only if\np^∈ℝ3^𝑝superscriptℝ3\\hat{p}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3} lies in H​(q,r)𝐻𝑞𝑟H(q,r). Let p∈D𝑝𝐷p\\in D be a point. Then we have that\n(px−qx)2+(py−qy)2≤r2superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑥subscript𝑞𝑥2superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑦subscript𝑞𝑦2superscript𝑟2(p_{x}-q_{x})^{2}+(p_{y}-q_{y})^{2}\\leq r^{2}. This implies that\npx2+py2≤2​qx​px+2​qy​py−qx2−qy2+r2superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑥2superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑦22subscript𝑞𝑥subscript𝑝𝑥2subscript𝑞𝑦subscript𝑝𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑥2superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑦2superscript𝑟2p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}\\leq 2q_{x}p_{x}+2q_{y}p_{y}-q_{x}^{2}-q_{y}^{2}+r^{2},\nfrom which it can be seen that p^∈H​(q,r)^𝑝𝐻𝑞𝑟\\hat{p}\\in H(q,r).\nFollowing the reasoning backwards completes the proof. Let h∗superscriptℎh^{*} be the point dual to the plane hℎh bounding h−​(q,r)superscriptℎ𝑞𝑟h^{-}(q,r).\nBy taking the dual of P^^𝑃\\hat{P}, a set of planes H𝐻H is obtained,\nsuch that the points inside D𝐷D correspond to the planes below\nh∗superscriptℎh^{*}.\nWe will build a data structure on the set of planes H𝐻H, that can find the mode color among these planes. The data structure is based on the following observation by Krizanc et al. : Let A𝐴A and B𝐵B be multisets.\nIf c𝑐c is a mode of A∪B𝐴𝐵A\\cup B, and c∉A𝑐𝐴c\\notin A, then c𝑐c is a mode of B𝐵B. We apply this observation to 1r1𝑟\\frac{1}{r}-cuttings.\nA 1r1𝑟\\frac{1}{r}-cutting ΞΞ\\Xi of 𝒜​(H)𝒜𝐻\\mathcal{A}(H) is a set of simplices with\ndisjoint interiors, that together cover ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, such that the interior of\na simplex in ΞΞ\\Xi is intersected by at most n/r𝑛𝑟n/r planes in H𝐻H.\nNow let q∈ℝ3𝑞superscriptℝ3q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\nbe a query point. Given a 1r1𝑟\\frac{1}{r}-cutting ΞΞ\\Xi of 𝒜​(H)𝒜𝐻\\mathcal{A}(H), let\nΔ∈ΞΔΞ\\Delta\\in\\Xi be a simplex containing q𝑞q, for which there is a\npoint in ΔΔ\\Delta strictly above q𝑞q. The mode color among the planes\nbelow q𝑞q is then either the color of a plane in the conflict list\nHΔsubscript𝐻ΔH_{\\Delta} of ΔΔ\\Delta (multiset A𝐴A), or it is the mode color among\nthe planes below ΔΔ\\Delta (multiset B𝐵B). Note that Chan\net al. [ref]12 use slightly\ndifferent sets. Our choice makes extending the result to the\nL∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} metric (as we do in Section 4.2) slightly easier. For the data structure, we now create a 1r1𝑟\\frac{1}{r}-cutting ΞΞ\\Xi on H𝐻H, and for every\nsimplex Δ∈ΞΔΞ\\Delta\\in\\Xi, we compute and store the mode color among the planes below ΔΔ\\Delta.\nAside from this cutting, we construct a point-location data structure for quickly finding the\nsimplex containing a query point. We also need the conflict lists of the simplices.\nHowever, as they have a total size of O​(n​r2)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟2O(nr^{2}), we will use a seperate data structure\nthat computes the conflict list during a query. Lemma 4.6 states our results on cuttings and\ncomputing their conflict lists. The following lemma is used to speed up the\ncomputation of the conflict lists for our problem, where the planes of H𝐻H\noriginate from two-dimensional points. Let a∈R3𝑎superscript𝑅3a\\in R^{3} be a point. We can construct, in constant time, a disk\nDasubscript𝐷𝑎D_{a} in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}, such that the points of P𝑃P inside Dasubscript𝐷𝑎D_{a} correspond to\nthose planes of H𝐻H below a𝑎a. Let m=(−ax/2,−ay/2)𝑚subscript𝑎𝑥2subscript𝑎𝑦2m=(-a_{x}/2,-a_{y}/2) and r=az−ax2+ay24𝑟subscript𝑎𝑧superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑥2superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑦24r=\\sqrt{a_{z}-\\frac{a_{x}^{2}+a_{y}^{2}}{4}}.\nThe disk Da=D​(m,r)subscript𝐷𝑎𝐷𝑚𝑟D_{a}=D(m,r) with center m𝑚m and radius r𝑟r is then lifted to the\nhalfspace The plane bounding this halfspace is dual to the point (ax,ay,az)=asubscript𝑎𝑥subscript𝑎𝑦subscript𝑎𝑧𝑎(a_{x},a_{y},a_{z})=a.\nThus, the points of P𝑃P inside Dasubscript𝐷𝑎D_{a} correspond to the planes of H𝐻H\nbelow a𝑎a. Let r∈[1,n]𝑟1𝑛r\\in[1,n] a parameter. We can store\na 1r1𝑟\\frac{1}{r}-cutting of 𝒜​(H)𝒜𝐻\\mathcal{A}(H) of O​(r3)𝑂superscript𝑟3O(r^{3}) size in a data structure of O​(n+r3)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟3O(n+r^{3}) size,\nso that the simplex Δ∈ΞΔΞ\\Delta\\in\\Xi containing a query point can be found in\nO​(log⁡r)𝑂𝑟O(\\log r) time, and so that reporting the conflict list of ΔΔ\\Delta takes\nO​(n1/2​polylog⁡n+n/r)𝑂superscript𝑛12polylog𝑛𝑛𝑟O(n^{1/2}\\operatorname{polylog}n+n/r) time. Building the data\nstructure takes expected O​(n1+δ+n​r2)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝛿𝑛superscript𝑟2O(n^{1+\\delta}+nr^{2}) time. Using the result of Chazelle , we can construct,\nin O​(n​r2)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟2O(nr^{2}) time, a 1r1𝑟\\frac{1}{r}-cutting ΞΞ\\Xi of O​(r3)𝑂superscript𝑟3O(r^{3}) size, along with a\npoint-location data structure, also of O​(r3)𝑂superscript𝑟3O(r^{3}) size, that answers queries in\nO​(log⁡r)𝑂𝑟O(\\log r) time. We now present a data structure for reporting the planes intersecting a simplex ΔΔ\\Delta, following the ideas of Chan et al. [ref]12.\nAny plane intersecting the interior of ΔΔ\\Delta intersects the interior of an edge of ΔΔ\\Delta (without containing the edge).\nBeause ΔΔ\\Delta has only O​(1)𝑂1O(1) edges, we will report the planes\nintersecting an edge e𝑒e of ΔΔ\\Delta for all edges of ΔΔ\\Delta\nindividually. As we will then show, the number of planes reported\nthis way will still be O​(n/r)𝑂𝑛𝑟O(n/r), even though we might report a\nplane multiple times. Let a​b¯¯𝑎𝑏\\overline{ab} be a line segment in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, of which we want to\nreport the planes intersecting it. Note that a plane intersects\nthe interior of a​b¯¯𝑎𝑏\\overline{ab}\nif and only if it is either strictly above a𝑎a and strictly below b𝑏b, or\nstrictly below a𝑎a and strictly above b𝑏b. The first set of planes (and\nsimilarly, the second set,) can be reported using two-dimensional\nsemialgebraic range reporting, using Lemma 4.4.\nLet Dasubscript𝐷𝑎D_{a} and Dbsubscript𝐷𝑏D_{b} be the two disks in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}, such that the points inside\nthe disks correspond to the planes below a𝑎a and b𝑏b, respectively.\nUsing the result of Agarwal et al. ,\nwe can construct a linear-size data structure in O​(n1+δ)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝛿O(n^{1+\\delta})\nexpected time, which reports the k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime} points strictly outside Dasubscript𝐷𝑎D_{a} and strictly\ninside Dbsubscript𝐷𝑏D_{b}, and thus the k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime} planes intersecting the interior of a​b¯¯𝑎𝑏\\overline{ab},\nin O​(n1/2​polylog⁡n+k′)𝑂superscript𝑛12polylog𝑛superscript𝑘′O(n^{1/2}\\operatorname{polylog}n+k^{\\prime}) time. Performing two of the above reporting queries per edge of ΔΔ\\Delta,\nwe obtain a query time of O​(n1/2​polylog⁡n+k′)𝑂superscript𝑛12polylog𝑛superscript𝑘′O(n^{1/2}\\operatorname{polylog}n+k^{\\prime}), where k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime}\nis the number of planes (including duplicates) reported in total.\nNote that we only report planes that intersect the interior of an edge\nof ΔΔ\\Delta, and thus we only report planes in the conflict list of\nΔΔ\\Delta. Furthermore, because we perform only a constant number of\nreporting queries, k′superscript𝑘′k^{\\prime} will be at most a constant factor greater than\nthe size of HΔsubscript𝐻ΔH_{\\Delta}. This gives a total query time of O​(n1/2​polylog⁡n+n/r)𝑂superscript𝑛12polylog𝑛𝑛𝑟O(n^{1/2}\\operatorname{polylog}n+n/r), proving the lemma. Finally, we build a number of data structures for level queries.\nOne is build on each set of planes in H𝐻H that share the same color.\nFor these data structures, we use Lemma 4.4 to handle\nthe queries with two-dimensional semialgebraic range counting.\nWe use the linear-space solution of Agarwal et al. ,\nwhich can be constructed in O​(n1+δ)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝛿O(n^{1+\\delta}) expected time and answers\nqueries in O​(n1/2​polylog⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛12polylog𝑛O(n^{1/2}\\operatorname{polylog}n) time. We now show how to compute the colors stored in the simplices. This can be done in\nO​(n​r3)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟3O(nr^{3}) time, after we created pointers from each plane to a counter counting\nthe frequency of the plane’s color. The color of a simplex can then be computed\nby scanning through all planes, upping a plane’s color’s frequency if the plane\nlies below the simplex, and keeping track of the color with the highest\nfrequency. This takes O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time per simplex, totalling O​(n​r3)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟3O(nr^{3}) time.\nThis brings the total size of the data structure to O​(n+r3)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟3O(n+r^{3}), and the total expected preprocessing time to O​(n1+δ+n​r3)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝛿𝑛superscript𝑟3O(n^{1+\\delta}+nr^{3}). Querying the structure with a point q𝑞q is done by first finding a simplex Δ∈ΞΔΞ\\Delta\\in\\Xi containing q𝑞q, for which there is a point in ΔΔ\\Delta strictly above q𝑞q.\nThis can be done in O​(log⁡r)𝑂𝑟O(\\log r) time.\nThen, the conflict list of ΔΔ\\Delta is reported, taking O​(n1/2​polylog⁡n+n/r)𝑂superscript𝑛12polylog𝑛𝑛𝑟O(n^{1/2}\\operatorname{polylog}n+n/r) time.\nFinally, for each color c𝑐c of the O​(n/r)𝑂𝑛𝑟O(n/r) reported planes, as well as for the color stored in ΔΔ\\Delta, the number of planes below q𝑞q that have color c𝑐c is counted.\nRecall that this can be done using level queries.\nThe mode color among the planes below q𝑞q is the color with the highest count. Let Hcsubscript𝐻𝑐H_{c} be the set of planes with color c𝑐c, and let CΔsubscript𝐶ΔC_{\\Delta} be the set of colors for which we perform a level query.\nNote that |CΔ|=O​(n/r)subscript𝐶Δ𝑂𝑛𝑟|C_{\\Delta}|=O(n/r).\nHölders inequality now states that for any two sequences x1,…,xmsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑚x_{1},\\dots,x_{m} and y1,…,ymsubscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑚y_{1},\\dots,y_{m} and any two positive values a𝑎a and b𝑏b.\nApplied to the level queries, we find that the level queries take a total of time. In total, the query time of the data structure is thus\nO​((n/r1/2)​polylog⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟12polylog𝑛O((n/r^{1/2})\\operatorname{polylog}n). We thus get the following result\n(essentially Theorem 17 of Chan\net al. [ref]12 in the case of halfspaces\nin ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, though slightly improved for the case of two-dimensional circular ranges): Let P𝑃P be a set of n𝑛n colored points in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} and r∈[1,n]𝑟1𝑛r\\in[1,n]\na parameter. In O​(n1+δ+n​r3)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝛿𝑛superscript𝑟3O(n^{1+\\delta}+nr^{3}) expected time, we can build a\ndata structure of O​(n+r3)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟3O(n+r^{3}) size, that reports the mode color\namong the points in a query disk in O​((n/r1/2)​polylog⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟12polylog𝑛O((n/r^{1/2})\\operatorname{polylog}n)\ntime.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: In this section, we present the data structure of Chan et al. [ref]12 for finding the mode color among points in query disks.\nThis data structure can then be used in conjunction with that of Section 3.2 to get a data structure for chromatic k𝑘k-nearest\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
