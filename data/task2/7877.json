      "content": "Paper Title: Flexible Music-Conditioned Dance Generation with Style Description Prompts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe AIST++ dataset [ref]5 includes 1,408 high-quality dance movements synchronized with music from 10 genres. It comprises motion sequences of varying durations, ranging from 7 seconds to 50 seconds, with an average duration of 13 seconds. We follow the original train/test splits. Consistent with EDGE , instances in the training set are cut to 5 seconds at 30 FPS with a stride of 0.5 seconds, and instances in the testing set are cut to 5 seconds at 30 FPS with a stride of 2.5 seconds. The proposed model has 49.7 million (M) parameters, and was trained on one NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU for 2 days with a batch size of 128. The implementation is based on the PyTorch. The number of iterations is 1000. The learning rate is 0.0002 and the weight decay is 0.02. The music condition transformer encoder has a depth of 2 layers, with 8 attention heads and a dimension of 512. The decoder block has a depth of 8 layers, with 8 attention heads and a dimension of 512. For long-term generation, we use linear weighted summation to sum up corresponding parts of different slices (5s). Specifically, we perform a weighted summation of the latter half (2.5s) of the previous slice and the former half (2.5s) of the next slice.\nTo mitigate the impact of randomness of stochastic, all evaluation metrics obtained by averaging over 100 trials. Following [ref]19 , we adopt the following evaluation metrics: Beat Alignment Score: It is used to measure the alignment between the music and the generated movement. We calculate the average time distance between each music beat and its closest dance beat as the beat alignment score. The music beats are extracted using the Librosa library , and the kinematic beats are calculated based on the local minima of the velocity of motion joints. Physical Foot Contact Score: It is a quantitative acceleration-based metric used to score the physical plausibility of the generated kinematic motion. The metric derives from two simple and related observations: (1) In the horizontal plane, any centre of mass (COM) acceleration must be due to static contact between the feet and the ground. Thus, either at least one foot is stationary on the ground or there is no acceleration of COM. (2) On the vertical axis, any positive COM acceleration must be due to static foot contact. Frechet Inception Distance(FID): FID is the distance between the generated dance movement distribution and the real movement distribution. We calculate the FIDs between the generated dances and the AIST++ dataset for all motion sequences in the kinetic feature space [ref]46 (denoted as F​I​Dk𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑘FID_{k}) and geometric feature space [ref]5 (denoted as F​I​Dg𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑔FID_{g}). Diversity: This metric assesses the diversity of dance motions by computing the average Euclidean distance between different generated dance motions. Similarly, we compute the Diversity between all motion sequences of the generated dances in the kinetic feature space [ref]46 (denoted as D​i​vk𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑘Div_{k}) and the geometric feature space [ref]5 (denoted as D​i​vg𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑔Div_{g}). \n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nGuidance weight w𝑤w = 2\nGuidance weight w𝑤w = 1\n\nB​e​a​t​A​l​i​g​n↑↑𝐵𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛absentBeatAlign\\uparrow\nP​F​C↓↓𝑃𝐹𝐶absentPFC\\downarrow\nF​I​Dk↓↓𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑘absentFID_{k}\\downarrow\nF​I​Dg↓↓𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑔absentFID_{g}\\downarrow\nD​i​vk→→𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑘absentDiv_{k}\\rightarrow\nD​i​vg→→𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑔absentDiv_{g}\\rightarrow\nB​e​a​t​A​l​i​g​n↑↑𝐵𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛absentBeatAlign\\uparrow\nP​F​C↓↓𝑃𝐹𝐶absentPFC\\downarrow\nF​I​Dk↓↓𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑘absentFID_{k}\\downarrow\nF​I​Dg↓↓𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑔absentFID_{g}\\downarrow\nD​i​vk→→𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑘absentDiv_{k}\\rightarrow\nD​i​vg→→𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑔absentDiv_{g}\\rightarrow\n\nEDGE \n0.26\n1.56\n35.35\n18.92\n5.32\n4.90\n0.25\n1.19\n45.41\n19.42\n4.82\n5.24\n\nDGSDP (ours)\n0.31\n1.51\n34.32\n19.04\n6.29\n5.81\n0.28\n1.65\n37.21\n18.19\n7.25\n6.42\n\nGround Truth\n0.35\n1.33\n–\n–\n9.43\n7.33\n0.35\n1.33\n–\n–\n9.43\n7.33\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n7.5 seconds\n10 seconds\n\nB​e​a​t​A​l​i​g​n↑↑𝐵𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛absentBeatAlign\\uparrow\nP​F​C↓↓𝑃𝐹𝐶absentPFC\\downarrow\nF​I​Dk↓↓𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑘absentFID_{k}\\downarrow\nF​I​Dg↓↓𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑔absentFID_{g}\\downarrow\nD​i​vk→→𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑘absentDiv_{k}\\rightarrow\nD​i​vg→→𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑔absentDiv_{g}\\rightarrow\nB​e​a​t​A​l​i​g​n↑↑𝐵𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛absentBeatAlign\\uparrow\nP​F​C↓↓𝑃𝐹𝐶absentPFC\\downarrow\nF​I​Dk↓↓𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑘absentFID_{k}\\downarrow\nF​I​Dg↓↓𝐹𝐼subscript𝐷𝑔absentFID_{g}\\downarrow\nD​i​vk→→𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑘absentDiv_{k}\\rightarrow\nD​i​vg→→𝐷𝑖subscript𝑣𝑔absentDiv_{g}\\rightarrow\n\n\n\nEDGE \n0.26\n1.11\n59.43\n25.60\n2.97\n3.52\n0.25\n0.88\n68.63\n32.24\n2.55\n3.14\n\nDGSDP (ours)\n0.30\n1.38\n55.65\n20.74\n4.10\n5.74\n0.30\n2.13\n56.15\n29.98\n5.21\n6.45\n\nGround Truth\n0.38\n1.04\n–\n–\n9.34\n7.47\n0.49\n1.70\n–\n–\n9.34\n7.47\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: The AIST++ dataset [ref]5 includes 1,408 high-quality dance movements synchronized with music from 10 genres.
