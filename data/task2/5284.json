      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-end AI Framework for Interpretable Prediction of Molecular and Crystal Properties\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks have shown great success for modeling\nmolecular and crystal structures. For small molecules, a suite of\nmodels have been proposed, including\nDimeNet [ref]4,\nGemNet 6,\nSphereNet ,\nComENet 8,\nSchNet  and\nPhysNet .\nThese models take in atomic coordinates and atomic numbers\nas input,\nand represent atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. Typical\ntarget properties\nfor these models are QM properties of molecules such as\ninternal energy,\nheat capacity and zero point vibrational energy (ZPVE). For crystal\nstructures, periodic boundary conditions need to be considered,\ntherefore crystal graph representations are typically used. Example\ngraph neural networks that take in crystal structures\nas input include\nALIGNN 9,\nCGCNN ,\nand MEGNet . These models\nfirst extract crystal\ngraphs from the structures, then generate atom and edge embeddings\nfor the center atoms and their neighbors. The bond and edge information\nis then updated via message passing. The target properties for these models are typically QM properties of crystals, e.g., formation energy and band gap. The growing number of the graph neural networks available for this purpose pushes the need for\nan end-to-end AI framework. Previous efforts toward\nsuch a goal typically missed one or more important aspects. For example,\nMatDeepLearn  integrates\na suite of\ngraph neural networks, including CGCNN, MEGNet,\nMPNN , GCN \nand SchNet. Although it can be used for\nhyperparameter tuning, model\ntraining, and inference, it lacks the explainability feature, which limits the amount of\nchemical insights that could be extracted from the results. Another\nexample is Dive in Graphs (DIG) , which enables model\ntraining and explanation. However, it does not allow for\nhyperparameter tuning, therefore only models with preset\nhyperparameters can be used. A complete package\noffering all of the aforementioned functionalities is therefore needed. Our AI framework also offers the functionality to\nperform MD simulations for small molecules, enabled by\nTorchMD-NET, an SE3-equivariant\ntransformer interatomic potential model that establishes\na relationship\nbetween atomic configurations and potential energies and forces.\nThe MD trajectories of selected molecules taken from the MD17 dataset were used for training the TorchMD-NET models.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Graph neural networks have shown great success for modeling\nmolecular and crystal structures. For small molecules, a suite of\nmodels have been proposed, including\nDimeNet [ref]4,\nGemNet 6,\nSphereNet ,\nComENet 8,\nSchNet  and\nPhysNet .\nThese models take in atomic coordinates and atomic numbers\nas input,\nand represent atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. Typical\ntarget\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
