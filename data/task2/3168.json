      "content": "Paper Title: Auxiliary Learning for Self-Supervised Video Representation via Similarity-based Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) methods have taken great strides recently in acquiring high-level semantic visual representations from unlabelled data, eliminating the cost of annotating large-scale datasets [ref]8  1  . The most common approach in SSL is to use large-scale unlabelled data, such as Kinetics-400 , for pretraining network parameters, followed by finetuning on a downstream task with a limited amount of labelled data [ref]8 [ref]9 1  . Despite the reduction in manual labelling, the performance of SSL methods is leveraged on huge unlabelled datasets, which demands high computational and memory costs, especially for large-scale video datasets. For example, it takes around two weeks to train MoCo 1 on Kinetics-400 for 300 epochs with two Nvidia RTX 2080TI GPUs. In fact, such computational costs place many state of the art (SotA) SSL approaches only in the realms of huge corporations who have such powerful resources  [ref]9 , and this further becomes a subject of ethical fairness as well as carbon emission footprints . A few recent works have addressed the issue of efficient pretraining for image-based tasks   , but there is only Lin et al. ’s work for video-based tasks which improves the generalization performance of a contrastive learning-based method  under a meta-learning paradigm. However, their method is not suited to most of the SotA works that use transformation-based pretext tasks [ref]8    . Our motivation is to develop a task-agnostic pretraining process that alleviates the dependency on large-scale datasets for self-supervised video representation learning, while ensuring the model generalises well and still contains rich information. To achieve this, we propose an auxiliary pretraining stage, based on knowledge distillation (KD), which trains on a reduced version of the source dataset, provides implicit knowledge for the primary pretraining stage with the same reduced-size source dataset, and boosts generalization for downstream video representation learning tasks. Figure 1 illustrates the difference\nbetween our framework and existing SSL methods, such as [ref]8    .\nWe employ a slowly progressing teacher model to iteratively distill knowledge to the student, our self-supervised model, by evaluating the similarity information of an augmented view of a query video clip to a large queue of random clips as anchors and transferring that information to the student. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such Similarity-based Knowledge Distilation (SKD) has been used in video-based self-supervised learning, while recently, SKD was adopted in image-based applications, for example for contrastive learning   or model compression  . To refer to this aspect of our work, we use auxSKD.\nTo support the operation of the proposed approach on temporal features in the video domain,\nwe apply temporal augmentations, in addition to spatial augmentations, to generate different transformed versions of a query video.\nSuch temporal transformations are the same as the pretext transformations used in the primary pretraining stage. Their application at this stage allows our teacher to impart knowledge which matters most in the primary pretraining stage.\n Also in this paper, we propose a new pretext task for video representation learning, namely Video Segment Pace Prediction (VSPP). While recent video playback rate prediction methods randomly sample training clips at different paces or speeds  , we sample training clips where only a randomly selected segment of the video has a randomly selected speed and the other segments of the video retain their natural pace. VSPP then requires the learner model to predict the playback speed of this randomly selected segment and its temporal location in the input training video. We advocate that by solving this pretext task, our model can strengthen its awareness of the natural pace of the clip and deal with the imprecise video speed labeling problem . In our experiments, we show that our results, based on Kinetics-100 pretraining as an example of a reduced-size dataset, rather than the commonly used Kinectics-400, beat VCOP  (↑↑\\uparrow4.7% on UCF101 and ↑↑\\uparrow7.8% on HMDB51), VideoPace  (↑↑\\uparrow5.4% on UCF101 and ↑↑\\uparrow9.5% on HMDB51) and RSPNet  (↑↑\\uparrow2.7% on UCF101 and ↑↑\\uparrow2.3% on HMDB51) in like-for-like comparisons. Our key contributions can be summarised as follows: (i) we propose an auxiliary pretraining stage for self-supervised video learning to alleviate the dependency on large-scale source datasets, e.g. to allow using Kinetics-100 instead of Kinetics-400,\n(ii) we extend similarity-based knowledge distillation to the task of self-supervised video representation learning which has not been shown before,\n(iii) we show that our approach can benefit other pretext tasks for self-supervised pretraining that involve video transformations (e.g. VCOP , VideoPace  and RSPNet ),\n(iv) we propose a simple, yet effective and novel pretext task which is more commensurate with video motion events than existing video playback prediction tasks,\n(v) we achieve SotA results when pretraining with Kinetics-100, and evaluate the performance of different components of our proposed method through ablation experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: learning (SSL) methods have taken great strides recently in acquiring high-level semantic visual representations from unlabelled data, eliminating the cost of annotating large-scale datasets [ref]8  1  .
