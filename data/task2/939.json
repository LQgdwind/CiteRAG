      "content": "Paper Title: A Distributed Model-Free Ride-Sharing Approach for Joint Matching, Pricing, and Dispatching using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur demand-aware route planning problem is a variation of the basic route planning problem (which is NP-hard) for shareable mobility services [ref]40  by setting α𝛼\\alpha = 1 and β=0𝛽0\\beta=0. Further, the existing literature proved that there is no optimal method to maximize the total revenue for the basic route planning problem (which is reducible to our DARM problem) using neither deterministic nor randomized algorithms  . Thus, the same applies to our DARM problem. However, several studies show that Insertion is an effective approach to greedily deal with the shared mobility problem. We propose an insertion based framework, similar to the idea in [ref]28, to optimize our matching framework. However, in [ref]28, authors group together close-by requests without considering if their destinations are in opposite directions, while our approach mitigate this problem. Also, [ref]28 use denwick tree to speed up their operations while we utilize our OSRM module as will be explained below. Note that, in our framework, this optimization step is impacted by the pricing decisions that are made based on the Q-values learnt from our DQN. In this aspect, our approach can achieve better results in a relatively long time period using the near future predicted demand (that is part of the DQN input) to overcome the short-sightedness problem of the basic insertion algorithms. In DARM, we follow the idea of searching each route and locally optimally inserting new vertex (or vertices) into a route. In our problem, there are two vertices (i.e., origin oisubscript𝑜𝑖o_{i} and destination disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i}) to be inserted for each request risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i}. We define the insertion operation as: given a vehicle Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} with the current route SVjsubscript𝑆subscript𝑉𝑗S_{V_{j}}, and a new request risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i}, the insertion operation aims to find a new feasible route SVj′subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}} by inserting oisubscript𝑜𝑖o_{i} and disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i} into SVjsubscript𝑆subscript𝑉𝑗S_{V_{j}} with the minimum increased cost, that is the minimum extra travel distance, while maintaining the order of vertices in SVjsubscript𝑆subscript𝑉𝑗S_{V_{j}} unchanged in SVj′subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}}. Specifically, for a new request risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i}, the basic insertion algorithm checks every possible position to insert the origin and destination locations and return the new route such that the incremental cost is minimized. To present our cost function, we first define our distance metric, where given a graph G𝐺G we use our OSRM engine to pre-calculate all possible routes over our simulated city. Then, we derive the distances of the trajectories (i.e., paths) from location a𝑎a to location b𝑏b to define our graph weights. Thus, we obtain a weighted graph G𝐺G with realisitic distance measures serving as its weights. We extend the weight notation to paths as follows:\nw​(a1,a2,…,an)=∑i=1n−1w​(ai,ai+1)𝑤subscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2…subscript𝑎𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛1𝑤subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖1w(a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}w(a_{i},a_{i+1}). \nThus, we define the cost associated with each new potential route/path SVj′=[ri,ri+1,…,rk]subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝑟𝑖subscript𝑟𝑖1…subscript𝑟𝑘S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}}=[r_{i},r_{i+1},...,r_{k}] to be the cost​(Vj,SVj′)=w​(ri,ri+1,…​rk)costsubscript𝑉𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗𝑤subscript𝑟𝑖subscript𝑟𝑖1…subscript𝑟𝑘\\text{cost}(V_{j},S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}})=w(r_{i},r_{i+1},...r_{k}) resulting from this specific ordering of vertices (origin and destination locations of the k𝑘k requests assigned to vehicle Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j}). Besides, we derive the cost of the original route to calculate the increased costs for every new route SVj′​[ri]subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗delimited-[]subscript𝑟𝑖S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}}[r_{i}]. To illustrate, assume Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j} for vehicle Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} has only two requests rxsubscript𝑟𝑥r_{x} and rysubscript𝑟𝑦r_{y}, its location is l​o​c​(Vj)𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝑉𝑗loc(V_{j}) and its current route has rxsubscript𝑟𝑥r_{x} already inserted as: [l​o​c​(Vj),ox,dx]𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝑜𝑥subscript𝑑𝑥[loc(V_{j}),o_{x},d_{x}]. Then, Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} picks SVj′subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}} of inserting rysubscript𝑟𝑦r_{y} into its current route, such that:\ncost​(Vj,SVj′​[ry])=min​[w​(l​o​c​(Vj),ox,oy,dx,dy),w​(l​o​c​(Vj),oy,ox,dx,dy),w​(l​o​c​(Vj),oy,ox,dy,dx),w​(l​o​c​(Vj),ox,oy,dy,dx),w​(l​o​c​(Vj),ox,dx,oy,dy),w​(l​o​c​(Vj),oy,dy,ox,dx)]costsubscript𝑉𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗delimited-[]subscript𝑟𝑦min𝑤𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝑜𝑥subscript𝑜𝑦subscript𝑑𝑥subscript𝑑𝑦𝑤𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝑜𝑦subscript𝑜𝑥subscript𝑑𝑥subscript𝑑𝑦𝑤𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝑜𝑦subscript𝑜𝑥subscript𝑑𝑦subscript𝑑𝑥𝑤𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝑜𝑥subscript𝑜𝑦subscript𝑑𝑦subscript𝑑𝑥𝑤𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝑜𝑥subscript𝑑𝑥subscript𝑜𝑦subscript𝑑𝑦𝑤𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝑜𝑦subscript𝑑𝑦subscript𝑜𝑥subscript𝑑𝑥{\\small\\text{cost}(V_{j},S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}}[r_{y}])=\\text{min}[w(loc(V_{j}),o_{x},o_{y},d_{x},d_{y}),}\\\\\n{\\small w(loc(V_{j}),o_{y},o_{x},d_{x},d_{y}),w(loc(V_{j}),o_{y},o_{x},d_{y},d_{x}),}\\\\\n{\\small w(loc(V_{j}),o_{x},o_{y},d_{y},d_{x}),w(loc(V_{j}),o_{x},d_{x},o_{y},d_{y}),}\\\\\n{\\small w(loc(V_{j}),o_{y},d_{y},o_{x},d_{x})]}.\nNote that the last two optional routes complete one request before serving the other, hence they do not fit into the ride-sharing category. However, we still consider them as we optimize for the fleet’s overall profits and total travel distance. Also, note that these two routes will still serve both requests and thus would not affect the overall acceptance rate of our algorithm. They may just increase the customers’ waiting time a little, however, we show in our results that the customers’ waiting time is very reasonable. Note that if this was the first allocation made to this vehicle, then the first request will be just added to its currently empty route. Otherwise, it will be dealt with (like all requests in the list) by following the insertion operation above. Then, the cost of serving all k𝑘k requests in matching Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j} is in turn defined as: cost​(Vj,Aj)=∑ri∈Mjcost​(Vj,SVj′​[ri])costsubscript𝑉𝑗subscript𝐴𝑗subscriptsubscript𝑟𝑖subscript𝑀𝑗costsubscript𝑉𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗delimited-[]subscript𝑟𝑖\\text{cost}(V_{j},A_{j})=\\sum_{r_{i}\\in M_{j}}\\text{cost}(V_{j},S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}}[r_{i}]).\nFinally, this phase works in a distributed fashion where each vehicle minimizes its travel cost, following Algorithm 3. This distributed procedure goes on a customer-by-customer basis as follows: Each vehicle Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} receives its initial matchings list Ajsubscript𝐴𝑗A_{j}, and an initial price Pi​n​i​tsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡P_{init} (as explained in Section IV-A) associated with each request risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} in that list. This initial matchings list is sorted ascendingly based on proximity to vehicle Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j}. Then, each vehicle Vjsubscript𝑉𝑗V_{j} considers each ri∈Ajsubscript𝑟𝑖subscript𝐴𝑗r_{i}\\in A_{j}, in order of proximity, inserting into its current route. For each request risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i}, the vehicle arrives at the minimum cost​(Vj,SVj′​[ry])costsubscript𝑉𝑗subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗delimited-[]subscript𝑟𝑦\\text{cost}(V_{j},S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}}[r_{y}]) of insertion into its current route (as described above). Now, given the initial price associated with this request Pi​n​i​tsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡P_{init} and the the new route SVj′​[ry]subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗delimited-[]subscript𝑟𝑦S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}}[r_{y}] (which may involve detours to serve this request), the vehicle can re-calculate the pricing to account for any extra distance, by feeding the new distance into Eq. (2) in Section IV-A. Afterwards, drivers will then modify the pricing based on the Q-values of the driver’s dispatch-to locations. Using the DQN dispatch policy on a regular basis, drivers have gained insight about which destinations can yield him/her a higher profit. So, they weigh in on their utility function and propose a new pricing to the customer (explained in Section IV-B). Finally, the customer(s) can accept or reject based on his/her utility function as explained in Section IV-C. If a customer accepts, the vehicle updates its route SVjsubscript𝑆subscript𝑉𝑗S_{V_{j}} to be SVj′​[ry]subscriptsuperscript𝑆′subscript𝑉𝑗delimited-[]subscript𝑟𝑦S^{\\prime}_{V_{j}}[r_{y}], otherwise SVjsubscript𝑆subscript𝑉𝑗S_{V_{j}} remains unchanged. The vehicle then proceeds to the next customer and repeats the process. Rejected requests will be fed back into the system to be considered in the matching process initiated in the next timestep for other/same vehicles. The key idea in the proposed matching algorithm is that the pricing of the passenger depends on the distance in the route based on the previous matched passengers. Thus, if the new passenger is going in the opposite direction, the distance will be larger leading to higher price, and we expect that the passenger would likely not accept the high price as compared to another vehicle that is going towards that direction. Of course, if the customer is willing to pay the high price, he/she will be matched. Thus, the increased pricing prioritizes passengers to be matched if their routes have intersections as opposed to if they are going in opposing directions.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Our demand-aware route planning problem is a variation of the basic route planning problem (which is NP-hard) for shareable mobility services [ref]40  by setting α𝛼\\alpha = 1 and β=0𝛽0\\beta=0.
