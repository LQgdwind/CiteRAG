      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Shot Continual Learning via Flat-to-Wide Approaches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting studies on continual learning (CL) mostly focus on a solution of the catastrophic forgetting (CF) problem where old parameters of a deep neural network are overwritten when learning new tasks without relying on any information of old samples thus losing its generalization power of old tasks. Three approaches, namely regularization-based approach, structure-based approach, memory-based approach, have been well-established in the literature  where some of the above mentioned approaches have successfully tackled the class-incremental learning problem , i.e., a single head scenario without any task IDs, more challenging than the task-incremental learning problem. However, these approaches suffer from the over-fitting problem in the case of limited samples. Hence, they are unfit for many real world problems such as a slow-speed manufacturing process where the problem of data scarcity is present. This drawback also does not coincide with the natural learning where human being can learn from very few samples . Our interest here is to attack the problem of few-shot continual learning [ref]4 where each task carries very few samples in the N-way K-shot setting, i.e., each task comprises N classes where each task presents K samples per class. Such a case requires a model to handle not only a sequence of tasks without the CF problem but also to avoid the over-fitting problem due to scarce samples. The few-shot continual learning approach is pioneered by the work in [ref]4 where the concept of neural gas (NG) is adopted. Old nodes of the NG structure are stabilized to avoid the CF problem while expanding the NG structure to adapt to new concepts.  presents a few-shot continual learning algorithm using the concept of session trainable parameters, deemed unimportant for previous tasks to alleviate the CF problem. The training process is governed by a triplet loss function and classification is performed using the nearest prototype-based classification approach. The vector quantization concept in the deep embedding space is successfully implemented in  to deal with both regression and classification problems in few-shot continual learning environments. A continually evolved classifier (CEC) is proposed in  using a graph attention network (GAT) to adapt the classifier‚Äôs weights. [ref]8 introduces the concept of flat learning, finding flat regions in the base learning task to be maintained in the few-shot learning task. However, it relies on a memory storing exemplar sets of previous tasks. The use of memory might lead to most samples of few-shot learning tasks to be kept in the memory. It heavily focuses on stability of base tasks but ignores plasticity of new tasks. This paper presents a FLat-tO-WidE appRoach (FLOWER) for few-shot continual learning problems. FLOWER is configured as a prototypical network  driven by the prototypical loss. FLOWER puts forward the flat-to-wide learning idea [ref]8 0, to discover flat-wide minimum regions. It minimizes the losses of noise-perturbed parameters of the feature extractor over MùëÄM runs. The flat-wide parameters are maintained in the subsequent few-shot learning tasks by constraining feature extractor parameters to prevent the catastrophic forgetting problem. Our approach differs from [ref]8 heavily focusing on the flat minimum regions resulting in over-dependence on the base learning task. In addition, no memory is imposed by FLOWER, and the wide learning concept is integrated as an attempt to drive flat regions to be wide, thus scaling well for large-scale problems. The concept of ball generator is integrated in FLOWER to prevent the over-training problem due to scarce samples in few-shot learning tasks. A feature-space data augmentation approach is applied in a sequence of few-shot learning tasks. The data augmentation strategy follows the ball generator concept 1 where the sampling space is limited to the smallest enclosing ball of few-shot samples. A generator loss is incorporated such that generated samples are adjacent to the center of its own class and away to the centre of other classes. The projection-based memory aware synapses method is implemented to avoid classifier‚Äôs parameters being overwritten when embracing new few-shot tasks. That is, the memory aware synapses regularization approach is combined with the classifier‚Äôs projection concept of 0 and the clamping procedure inducing flat-wide local optimum regions scaling well for large-scale continual learning tasks. The main network and the ball generator are trained to minimize a joint loss function of the prototypical loss and the generator loss added with the regularizer. A constraint is implemented to feature extractor parameters where they are clamped if going beyond the flat-wide regions [ref]8. This approach also prevents the over-fitting problem because only few classifier parameters are adapted while leaving feature extractor parameters in a fixed range. Five major contributions are proposed: 1) this paper proposes flat-to-wide approach (FLOWER) for few-shot continual learning synergizing the flat learning concept and the wide learning concept. The flat-wide minima are enforced to address the CF problem. This enables improved plasticity when learning new tasks as well as maintains decent performances with small base tasks. Note that the good average performance of [ref]8 often comes at the cost of poor performances on new tasks and small base tasks; 2) the concept of ball generator is proposed to perform the feature space data augmentation as a solution of data scarcity. This approach is modified from 1 designed for texts and non-continual learning problems; 3) new loss functions unifying the flat learning loss, wide learning loss and ball-generator loss are derived for both base learning task and few-shot learning tasks leading to an end-to-end training process; 4) rigorous theoretical study is performed to confirm the convergence of FLOWER where its losses converge toward zero; 5) the efficacy of FLOWER has been validated and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms where FLOWER delivers improved performances and works well with the small base tasks.
