      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Neural Networks Fused with Textures for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFine-grained image classification (FGIC) is a challenging problem in computer vision since the past decades [ref]1. It discriminates smaller visual variations among various sub-categories of objects like human faces, flowers, foods, etc. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved high performance in FGIC. The CNNs represent object’s shape, texture, and other correlated information in the feature space. In addition with global image-level description, object-parts relation, and local patch information have shown their efficacy by mining finer details to solve FGIC. Many works have been devised leveraging attention mechanism\n, [ref]3; context encoding [ref]4, ; erasing data augmentation , , and others. Many works avoid bounding-box annotations to localize essential image-regions using weakly supervised part selection . Thus, defining region-based descriptors is a key aspect to enhance FGIC performance. In another direction, the local binary patterns (LBP)  have achieved significant success in describing textural features from human faces, and other image categories . LBP is a non-parametric texture descriptor, extracted from a grayscale image. It encodes the differences between a pixel and its neighborhood pixels localized in a rectangular grid e.g., 3×\\times3, etc. Here, both the textural and deep features are fused to formulate an efficient feature vector for image classification.\nThis work proposes a method namely, Deep (Neural) Networks fused with Textures (DNT) to explore its aptness for FGIC. The first path extracts deep feature map using a base CNN. Then, the high-level deep feature maps is pooled through a set of non-overlapping patches. Next, a global average pooling (GAP) layer is applied to summarize the features followed by patch-encoding using the long short-term memory (LSTM). The other path computes the histograms of LBPs as local texture-based feature descriptors. Finally, these two sets of features are mixed prior to a classification layer. We have experimented on eight small-scale image datasets (1k-15k), representing a wide variations in the object’s shape, color, background, texture, etc. The datasets includes human faces with age-variations , ; hand shapes/palmprint , skin lesions , natural objects like flowers, underwater sea-lives; and food-dishes of India  and Thailand . This paper is an improvement of our earlier published work . Currently, this extended work contains new results tested on two more datasets representing hand-shape and skin lesions, including the results of previous work. The contributions of this paper are as follows: The deep features and local binary patterns are fused for image recognition. The method achieves satisfactory accuracy on eight image datasets representing the human faces, hand, skin lesions, food dishes, and natural object categories. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes related works, and Section 3 describes the proposed method. The experimental results are discussed in Section 4, followed by the conclusion in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Fine-grained image classification (FGIC) is a challenging problem in computer vision since the past decades [ref]1.
