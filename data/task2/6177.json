      "content": "Paper Title: Towards credible visual model interpretation with path attribution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe pioneering path attribution method in the vision domain, i.e., Integrated Gradients (IG)  took inspiration from cooperative game-theory [ref]22. In fact, IG corresponds to a cost-sharing method called Aumann-Shapley . However, Lundstrom et al.  recently noted that the class of functions ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} - see § 3, cf. Def. (1) - implemented by deep learning models, e.g., visual classifiers, behave differently than the corresponding functions in the cooperative game-theory setups. Hence, the path attribution framework needs further investigation for visual model interpretation in regards to its claimed properties. Below we explicate the peculiar problems faced when this framework is applied to the deep visual models. For clarity, we defer the proposed solutions to these problems to § 5. P1: Counter-intuitive attribution scores: Srinivas and Fleuret  first highlighted a critical issue of ‘counter-intuitive’ attribution scores computed by IG . We provide an accessible example below to clearly explain the problem. The examples and discussion herein are directly applicable to the modern deep visual models as they are represented well as piece-wise linear functions . Define a piece-wise linear function for an input 𝐱=[x1,x2]∈ℝ2𝐱subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2superscriptℝ2\\boldsymbol{x}=[x_{1},x_{2}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}. Consider two points 𝐱a=[1.5,1.5]superscript𝐱𝑎1.51.5\\boldsymbol{x}^{a}=[1.5,1.5] and 𝐱b=[ref]4 [ref]4superscript𝐱𝑏44\\boldsymbol{x}^{b}=[ref]4 [ref]4 s.t. 𝐱a,𝐱b∈𝒰2superscript𝐱𝑎superscript𝐱𝑏subscript𝒰2\\boldsymbol{x}^{a},\\boldsymbol{x}^{b}\\in\\mathcal{U}_{2}. For these points, x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} clearly influences the output more strongly than x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} due to its larger weight, i.e., 4 vs 1. However, when we apply Eq. (1) for attribution computation using a linear path like IG , we get the attribution scores of 𝒜​(𝐱a,𝟎)={3.5,6.5}𝒜superscript𝐱𝑎03.56.5\\mathcal{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}^{a},\\boldsymbol{0})=\\{3.5,6.5\\} and 𝒜​(𝐱b,𝟎)={20,19}𝒜superscript𝐱𝑏02019\\mathcal{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}^{b},\\boldsymbol{0})=\\{20,19\\}, where 𝟎∈ℝ20superscriptℝ2\\boldsymbol{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} is a zero vector used by IG as the baseline. Clearly, these attribution scores are not only counter-intuitive, but also inconsistent. We verify that  rightly concludes that the counter-intuitive behavior of IG (and other methods) for deep visual models occurs due to the violation of a property called weak dependence - cf. Def. (5). Simply put, an attribution method that depends weakly on model input, relies more strongly on the correct model weights to provide a credible attribution. Consider a piece-wise linear model F(.)F(.) encoded by ‘p𝑝p’ pieces, defined over the same number of open connected sets 𝒰isubscript𝒰𝑖\\mathcal{U}_{i} for i∈[1,p]𝑖1𝑝i\\in[1,p] s.t. For F​(𝐱)𝐹𝐱F(\\boldsymbol{x}), an attribution method weakly depends on 𝐱𝐱\\boldsymbol{x} when this dependence is only via the neighborhood set 𝒰isubscript𝒰𝑖\\mathcal{U}_{i} of 𝐱𝐱\\boldsymbol{x}. The following important proposition is also made in . “For any piece-wise linear function, it is impossible to obtain a saliency map222Termed ‘attribution map’ in this work. that satisfies both completeness and weak dependence on inputs, in general” . P2: The baseline enigma:\nThe baseline in the path attribution framework plays a key role in estimating the desired scores.\nHowever, since path functions are not originally rooted in the vision literature [ref]22, a concrete definition of the baseline still eludes the path methods in the vision domain. Gradients of a model’s output w.r.t. input are considered a useful attribution measure in deep learning , , .\nHowever, it is also known that they can locally saturate for the important input features ,  because the prediction function of the model tends to flatten for those features. This compromises the credibility of the computed attributions, especially for the important features. The path attribution framework circumvents this problem with a non-local solution that integrates the gradients over a path from the baseline to the input - cf. Def. (3).\nHere, the key assumption is that the baseline encodes the ‘absence’ of the input feature. Only by satisfying this assumption, the solution of the path attribution framework is truly non-local. To emulate the feature absence, different path attribution methods for visual models employ different baselines. For instance, IG  proposes a black image as the baseline, whereas [ref]31 uses adversarial examples . A study in  clearly shows that inappropriate encoding of feature absence in the baseline image can lead to severe unintended effects on the computed attribution scores. P3: Ambiguous path features: Still largely unexplored in the literature is the intrinsic ambiguity of the features residing on the path specified by the path function - cf. Def. (2).\nTo preserve the properties of the framework, the path features must reside within the extremities of absence and presence of the input feature.\nHowever, partially owing to the problem P2, it remains unknown if the paths defined by the existing methods in the vision domain are actually composed of the features that follow this intuition - see Fig. 1. In above, P1 and P2 are known but still open problems, and P3 is largely unexplored. Kapishnikov et al.  came the closest to exploring P3, however they eventually altered the path instead of addressing the features on the path. Besides the above issues, it is also known that gradient integration for path attribution can suffer from noise due to shattered gradients . However, this is known to be addressed well by computing Expected attribution scores using multiple baselines , , [ref]31, .\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: The pioneering path attribution method in the vision domain, i.e., Integrated Gradients (IG)  took inspiration from cooperative game-theory [ref]22.
