      "content": "Paper Title: Simplex Clustering via 𝚜𝙱𝚎𝚝𝚊 with Applications to Online Adjustment of Black-Box Predictions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the last decade, deep neural networks have continuously gained wide interest for the semantic analysis of real-world data [ref]2, . However, under real-world conditions, potential feature or class distribution shifts of the target data may affect the predictive performances of pre-trained source models [ref]4. To address this issue, several recent adaptation approaches investigated fine-tuning all or a part of the model parameters using standard gradient-descent and back-propagation procedures [ref]5  . However, in a breadth of practical applications , e.g. real-time predictions, it might be cumbersome to perform multiple forward and backward passes, more so when dealing with large (and continuously growing) deep-network models . This may be the case even for adaptation methods that fine-tune only parts of the models, such as the parameters of the normalization layers [ref]5. More importantly, there are increasing concerns about both data privacy  and model-parameters inaccessibility .\nIn fact, the existing adaptation techniques assume knowledge of the source model and training procedures of the source training, which may not always hold in practice. Thus, off-the-shelf, model-agnostic solutions that mitigate the above concerns would be of interest in numerous real-world applications. In this work, we explore online unsupervised adjustment of softmax predictions from black-box source models, where we have access only to the model predictions. Specifically, we tackle the clustering of discrete distributions, with a particular focus on the output soft predictions from deep networks. Fig. 1 shows an application example. (a) argmax (b) k-means (c) k-sBetas (ours) (d) Ground truth Probability simplex clustering, i.e. clustering discrete distributions, is not a new problem. It has been the subject of several early studies in the context of text analysis   , among other application domains. For instance, in , simplex clustering is motivated for partitioning sets of text documents, and encoding them depending on their normalized word frequencies. In the context of deep learning, clustering methods have been typically used on deep feature maps, not on the outputs, as in self-training frameworks . Note that the latter requires access to the internal feature maps of the source models, thereby violating the black-box assumption. Simplex-clustering based adjustment of the probabilistic outputs of a model complies with the black-box assumption, but has remained largely under-explored, to the best of our knowledge. (a) (b) (c) (d) The simplex clustering literature is often based on optimizing distortion-based objectives.\nThe goal is to minimize, within each cluster, some distortion measure evaluating the discrepancy between a cluster representative and each sample within the cluster.\nBesides standard objectives like k-means, which correspond to an ∥.∥2\\|.\\|_{2} distortion, several simplex-clustering methods motivated and used distortion measures that are specific to simplex data. This includes, for instance, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence   and the Hilbert geometry distance .\nIn this work, we explore a general maximum a posteriori (MAP) perspective of clustering discrete distributions. Using Gibbs models, we emphasize that the density functions underlying current distortion-based objectives (Table I) may not approximate properly the empirical marginal distributions of real-world softmax predictions (Fig. 2). Contributions. Driven by the above observations, we introduce a novel probabilistic clustering objective integrating a generalization of the 𝙱𝚎𝚝𝚊𝙱𝚎𝚝𝚊\\mathtt{Beta} density, which we coin 𝚜𝙱𝚎𝚝𝚊𝚜𝙱𝚎𝚝𝚊\\mathtt{sBeta}. We derive several properties of 𝚜𝙱𝚎𝚝𝚊𝚜𝙱𝚎𝚝𝚊\\mathtt{sBeta}, which enable to impose different constraints on our model, enforcing\nuni-modality of the densities within each cluster while avoiding degenerate solutions. We proceed with a block-coordinate descent approach, which alternates\noptimization w.r.t assignment variables and inner Newton iterations for solving the non-linear optimality conditions w.r.t the sBeta parameters.\nFurthermore, using the density moments, we derive a closed-form alternative to Newton iterations for parameters estimation.\nOur versatile formulation approximates a variety of parametric densities for modeling simplex data, including highly peaked distributions at the vertices\nof the simplex, as observed empirically in the case of deep-network predictions. It also enables to control the cluster balance. We report comprehensive experiments, comparisons and ablation studies, which show highly competitive performances of our simplex clustering for unsupervised adjustment of black-box predictions, in a variety of scenarios. We made available the code to reproduce our comparative experiments, including the proposed k-sBetas model, the explored state-of-the-art approaches, as well as the introduced softmax prediction benchmarks 111https://github.com/fchiaroni/Clustering_Softmax_Predictions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Over the last decade, deep neural networks have continuously gained wide interest for the semantic analysis of real-world data [ref]2, .
