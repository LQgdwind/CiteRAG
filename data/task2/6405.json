Therefore  proposed to use independent features. Then the expectation can be easily approximated by averaging over K𝐾K background samples xksuperscript𝑥𝑘x^{k}: with missing features S¯¯𝑆\\bar{S}.\nA later contribution by the same authors [ref]13 focussed on avoiding the feature independence assumption by exploiting the structure of tree models. Part of the community also followed this direction: [ref]1  estimate the conditional data distribution p​(XS¯|XS)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑋¯𝑆subscript𝑋𝑆p\\left(X_{\\bar{S}}|X_{S}\\right) to better approximate (8) and 3 uses the data distribution assumed by probabilistic PCA to ‘exactly’ compute the SHAP value. Some recent papers have tried to advocate a different estimation of the model output when features are missing.  [ref]8  analyse the missing feature problem from a causal perspective. The conditioning on known features is argued to be interventional, instead of observational (as was implicitly assumed in conditional SHAP). Computing interventional conditional distributions requires a causal graph over the features.  distinguishes between the true real world features X~~𝑋\\tilde{X} and the model inputs X𝑋X. There can be causal relations between the former but not between the latter. [ref]8 does not make this distinction and the resulting SHAP values are arguably the true causal output effects. The authors therefore deemed their explanations causal Shapley values. To illustrate the difference with the approach of , a causal graph for a model with three input features is shown in Figure 1 for both approaches. Contrary to causal Shapley values [ref]8 the method of  does not require any knowledge of the causal relations between the (real world) features. The authors show that the particular causal structure (e.g Figure 1a) leads to a model output equivalent to the left hand side of (9): Without the weight of the coalition, the contribution for one permutation R𝑅R, of feature i𝑖i then becomes instead of for conditional SHAP, with SiRsubscriptsuperscript𝑆𝑅𝑖S^{R}_{i} the set SRsuperscript𝑆𝑅S^{R} including feature i𝑖i. In short, interventional SHAP breaks the dependencies between Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} and XS¯iRsubscript𝑋subscriptsuperscript¯𝑆𝑅𝑖X_{\\bar{S}^{R}_{i}}, while conditional SHAP allows for them to have an effect. It is important to note that interventional SHAP keeps the dependencies within XS¯iRsubscript𝑋subscriptsuperscript¯𝑆𝑅𝑖X_{\\bar{S}^{R}_{i}} . 2 uses the axiomatic approach to study the attribution problem. They test interventional and conditional SHAP against a list of desirable properties. Contrary to the properties imposed in Section 2.1, these are at the level of the model f𝑓f not at the level of the model approximations (f​(h𝒙​(X′))𝑓subscriptℎ𝒙superscript𝑋′f\\left(h_{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) when X′≠𝒙′superscript𝑋′superscript𝒙′X^{\\prime}\\neq\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}), e.g. missingness (5) becomes ‘dummy’. Dummy: The authors show that conditional SHAP fails this property (and others), while interventional SHAP does not.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: features.
