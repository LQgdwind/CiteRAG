      "content": "Paper Title: MU-MAE: Multimodal Masked Autoencoders-Based One-Shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable I presents a comprehensive comparison of the overall 5-way 1-shot performance against existing methods on the MMAct one-shot data split. MASTAF serves as the chosen one-shot learning module across all algorithms, and the reported average accuracy is based on 10,000 randomly selected episodes from the test set.\nFor the HAMLET method, we explore two fusion merge types: concatenation-based fusion and summation-based fusion. Both fusion methods are re-implemented for comparative analysis. Additionally, pretrained and trained-from-scratch ResNet 50  and ViT [ref]10 are included as embedding networks for both HAMLET and MuMu. In our method, Mu-MAE, we conduct the vanilla ViT [ref]10 and pretained ViT  on the Kinetics-400 as the video embeding network with varying mask ratios and decoder depths in the pretraining process, reporting the best performance achieved with an 85% mask ratio and 4 blocks of the decoder.\nAs shown in Table I, Mu-MAE without any external data outperforms trained-from-scratch state-of-the-art methods, namely HAMLET [ref]13 and MuMu [ref]12, demonstrating improvements of 40.15% and 35.01% in average accuracy, respectively. The lower performance of trained-from-scratch HAMLET [ref]13 and MuMu [ref]12 is attributed to their inability to leverage ViT [ref]10 model scale without any external data. In contrast, Mu-MAE, equipped with a multimodal masked autoencoder, effortlessly scales up with potent backbones (e.g., ViT [ref]10), attaining an accuracy of 80.17% on MMAct  without relying on external data. Additionally, in the one-shot multimodal learning task, Mu-MAE with externald data outperforms the pretrained HAMLET and MuMu with an imporvement of 5.48% and 3.6%, reprectively.\nThese improvement highlight Mu-MAE’s capacity to generate spatiotemporal features that demand attention across diverse modalities, simultaneously amplifying the distinctions from other classes in one-shot learning. While Mu-MAE with pretrained ViT  exhibits superior performance compared to Mu-MAE with vanilla ViT, the slight gap in performance between these two models highlights the efficacy of our multimodal masked autoencoders in achieving good performance using only the target dataset without relying on external data. Our approach reduces computation costs and resource requirements.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: types: concatenation-based fusion and summation-based fusion. Both fusion methods are re-implemented for comparative analysis. Additionally, pretrained and trained-from-scratch ResNet 50  and ViT [ref]10 are included as embedding networks for both HAMLET and MuMu. In our method, Mu-MAE, we conduct the vanilla ViT [ref]10 and pretained ViT  on the Kinetics-400 as the video embeding network\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
