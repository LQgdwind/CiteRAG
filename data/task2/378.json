Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Resource management.\nTEMPO  addresses resource management for SQL databases in MOO settings.\nWhen all Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) cannot be satisfied, it guarantees max-min fairness over SLO satisfactions; otherwise, it degrades to WS for recommending a single solution.\nRecent optimization for cluster and cloud computing [ref]24 [ref]37\nfocus on running time of SQL queries, but not dataflow problems or multiple objectives.\nMorpheus  addresses the tradeoff between cluster utilization and job’s performance predictability by codifying implicit user expectations as explicit SLOs and enforces SLOs using scheduling techniques. WiseDB [ref]27  proposes learning-based techniques for cloud resource management. A decision tree is trained on a set of performance and cost-related features collected from minimum cost schedules of sample workloads.\nSuch minimum cost schedules are not available in our case.\nDhalion  uses learning methods to detect backpressure and resolve it by tuning the degree of parallelism, but does not consider optimization for user objectives.\nLi  minimizes end-to-end tuple processing time using deep reinforcement learning, and requires defining scheduling actions and the associated reward, which is not available in our problem. More relevant is recent work on performance tuning and optimization.\nPerfOrator  and Ernest  are modeling tools that use hand-crafted models while OtterTune  , which we leverage, learns more flexible models from the data.\nFor optimizing a single objective, OtterTune builds a predictive model for each user query by mapping it to the most similar past query and based on the model,\nruns Gaussian Process exploration to minimize the objective.\n\nCDBTune  solves a similar problem, but uses Deep RL to learn predictive models and determine the best configuration. Learning-based query optimization.\nCardlearner  uses a ML approach to learn cardinality models from previous job executions and uses them to predict the cardinalities in future jobs.\nRecent work  has used neural networks to match the structure of any optimizer-selected query execution plan and predicts latency.\nNeo  is a DNN-based query optimizer\nthat bootstraps its optimization model from existing optimizers and then learns from incoming queries.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: cannot be satisfied, it guarantees max-min fairness over SLO satisfactions; otherwise, it degrades to WS for recommending a single solution.\nRecent optimization for cluster and cloud computing [ref]24 [ref]37\nfocus on running time of SQL queries, but not dataflow problems or multiple objectives.\nMorpheus  addresses the tradeoff between cluster utilization and job’s performance\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
