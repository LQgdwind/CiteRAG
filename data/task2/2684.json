      "content": "Paper Title: A trainable monogenic ConvNet layer robust in front of large contrast changes in image classification Under review\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPromising approaches were advanced in the bio-inspired papers [ref]1 (which introduces VisNet) and [ref]20. They introduce and study, via quite different approaches, interesting hypothesis about how the cortex achieves various invariant representations. However, testing is done on relatively small datasets and although lighting invariance is considered, contrast invariance is not. Now let us mention the works [ref]21 and . The mathematical tools used in these papers involve only complex numbers, but otherwise are somewhat akin to the ones used here. Their goals, however, are quite different and in particular they do not seek a robust response to large contrast or illumination changes. The first presents (complex) harmonic networks (H-nets) and shows, by means of complex circular harmonic functions, that they exhibit equivariance to patch-wise translations and to in-plane rotations. The aim of the second is to present a complex-valued learnable Gabor-modulated network that features orientation robustness. Recent developments dealing with contrast robustness have been reported. In , for instance, the authors present an entry layer (VOneNet) which uses Gabor functions and report the results of testing it for different data degradations and perturbations. The layer is deterministic (non-trainable) and consequently it requires fine tuning of several parameters (related to the input size, normalization, and random parameters) to set the Gabor function. For contrast degradation, the test accuracy drops form 75.6% to 28.5% on the Imagenet dataset. Another deterministic approach is presented in . The authors propose to combine the chromatic component of a perceptual color-space to improve image segmentation. Nevertheless, tests in this work deal only with outdoor images with normal degradations and their parameters have to be tuned according to the dataset. A previous version of the M6 layer, still deterministic, was presented in , but already with quite robust responses for illumination or contrast variations. In another recent workÂ , the authors propose a bio-inspired approach to leverage quaternion Gabor filters to improve the classification even with contrast degradations. An adaptive local contrast normalization was proposed in . Although their approach is more effective than conventional normalizations, the trainable parameters are based on the dataset illumination. As a result, for images with different degradations the detection performance will in general be reduced. To assess in more concrete terms the performance and robustness of our M6 layer, we primarily compare it to conventional convolutional layers C, which are the most popular and are the architectures of many ConvNet models. Because of that, we looked for papers satisfying the following conditions: i) robust to contrast or illumination changes, ii) code available in Tensorflow, iii) implementable in different architectures and datasets, iv) applicable for image classification. The selected papers for that purpose, already cited above, are\n   , and on closer inspection we find that only  satisfies the four criteria. As we mention before, the main strength of M6 with respect to  is that the latter is based on a deterministic unit, while M6 is trainable, a fact that is responsible for all its goods reported in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Promising approaches were advanced in the bio-inspired papers [ref]1 (which introduces VisNet) and [ref]20.
