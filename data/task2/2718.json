Specifically, for humans, the typical group size is estimated around an average of 150 members, a limit that goes under the name of Dunbar’s number. This limit is related to the cognitive capacity that humans are able to allocate to nurturing their social relationships. The 150 friends, in fact, do not include acquaintances, but only people with which a coherent quality relationship is entertained. In a modern society, this entails, at the very least, exchanging birthday or Christmas cards every year. Unsurprisingly, humans are not fair in how they distribute their cognitive attentions among the 150 important persons they have around them. To the contrary, it is possible to group our social relationships in circles of increasing intimacy, as illustrated in Figure 1. Typically, each of us has at least four circles of intimacy  : the innermost one (support clique) includes our close family, the sympathy group comprises all those people whose death tomorrow would leave us deeply affected, the affinity group includes colleagues, extended family, people you hang out with, and finally the active network is made up of all the people you meaningfully interact with at least once a year. The circles are conventionally concentric, with the inner layers contained in the outer ones. Many people also feature an additional inner layer (contained in the support clique) comprising on average 1.51.51.5 alters for which they have a very high emotional investment [ref]23. The social brain theory was developed for the offline world, in which relationships were nurtured via face-to-face interactions, letters, or landline phone calls. Many had postulated that this theory would not carry over to the online world, where OSN allow us to engage conveniently with a huge number of people scattered across the globe. However, Dunbar’s model stood the test of the cyberworld as well: Dunbar’s number hold for email communications , mobile phone calls , and Twitter . More importantly, the same layered structure of social relationships has emerged on both Facebook and Twitter [ref]23.\nThese findings are extremely important. In fact, since ego network structures are known to impact significantly on the way information spreads in OSN, and on the diversity of information that can be acquired by users [ref]17, embedding these models of human cognition into services for OSN may drastically improve the quality of service provided to the users.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: in the outer ones.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
