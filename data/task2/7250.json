      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task robot data for dual-arm fine manipulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe architecture of the policy predictor represents the evolution of the model proposed by  (Fig. 5 (a)). This neural network structure first processes foveated vision using EfficientNetV2, which is a parameter-efficient visual data processing model[ref]29, then encodes the robot arm states and the predicted gaze position using a Transformer encoder. Subsequently, the Transformer decoder uses these encoded embeddings to output global-action and local-action. Global-action refers to a series of states up to a maximum of 20 time steps ahead, whereas local-action is the difference between the next state and the current state. Angles are represented in six dimensions for a continuous representation, as in [ref]30, rather than as Euler angles. Language instructions are first encoded using Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations ([ref]31), and then used as conditioned inputs for the Transformer encoder and FiLM -conditioned EfficientNet. FiLM was used, as in , to condition language-instructions to vision. However, unlike the study in  that used global vision, in the present study, foveated vision is used; thus, FiLM-based conditioning cannot choose the appropriate arm to use. For instance, for a language input such as “grasp nut with right white gripper,” there may not be any information about the hand in the foveated image, which prevents transferring information about the hand for use in downstream neural networks. Therefore, to condition hand information, language information was added as an additional embedding in the Transformer encoder. Additionally, the encoder predicts each task’s goal position, which contributes to policy stabilization by producing manipulation policies based on goals , which is trained using the mixture density network (MDN) loss  that fits the goal to the probability distribution represented by the Gaussian mixture model. The main changes compared with the model in  can be summarized as follows: First, the model has been adapted to use language instructions so that, rather than having a specialized policy model for each task, a single policy model learns all tasks. Second, both global-action and local-action are inferred from the same neural network, and local-action also receives the robot’s state and gaze coordinates. This is possible because of the use of the Transformer, which allows for attention to be directed to necessary somatosensory information, as shown in 1. Finally, goal position prediction was previously performed using a unimodal model with an ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} loss, whereas DAA adopts a multimodal model using the MDN. This allows for the prediction of the probability distribution of goal positions, which enables the accurate prediction of target states, even in the presence of multiple objects. The gaze predictor uses the cross-attention of the Transformer 2 (Fig. 5 (b)). Previous gaze prediction models (e.g., 0) predicted the gaze coordinates as a probability distribution using the MDN.\nHowever, training gaze prediction with the MDN was challenging under conditions involving multiple object scenes, which is a frequent occurrence in the training dataset. Therefore, in this study, left global vision is divided into an 18×32183218\\times 32 grid, and the left gaze coordinate is transformed into a one-hot vector within this 18×32183218\\times 32 grid of the left global vision, thereby solving it as a classification problem. Left global vision 144×256144256144\\times 256 serves as the input to EfficientNetV2, and the processed 18×32183218\\times 32 visual features undergo cross-attention with language, as proposed in , to condition language on vision. The output of cross-attention was trained using cross-entropy loss to predict the left gaze coordinate. Predicting both gazes independently (e.g., ) often led to predictions of different objects in multi-object environments. Therefore, in this study, the right gaze is calculated inversely using trigonometry. This is based on the predicted left gaze coordinates and depth information computed from the stereo camera.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: the evolution of the model proposed by  (Fig. 5 (a)).
