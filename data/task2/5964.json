Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unified Out-Of-Distribution Detection: A Model-Specific Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe describe the datasets used in the main paper in detail. ImageNet-1k (IN) [ref]4 is a large-scale dataset for image recognition, containing 1,000 classes of real-world photos. It has\n1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images. We use the validation set as the in-distribution (ID) test data. ImageNet-V2 (IN-V2)  is collected similarly to ImageNet-1k with 3 test sets, each with 10,000 images. We use the test version that contains 10 images for each class with a selection frequency of at least 0.7. ImageNet-R (IN-R) [ref]12 contains 30,000 images from 200 of the 1,000 ImageNet-1k classes. The images are\nof different styles from the ImageNet-1k, including but not limited to art, cartoons, DeviantArt, graffiti, embroidery, graphics, origami, paintings, patterns, plastic objects, plush objects, sculptures, sketches, tattoos, toys, and video game renditions. ImageNet-S (IN-S)  consists of 50,000 sketch images; 50 images for each of the 1000 ImageNet-1k classes. ImageNet-A (IN-A) [ref]15 has 7,500 of natural adversarial images from 200 of the 1,000 ImageNet-1k classes. It is constructed based on the ResNet50 model’s predictions. Wrongly classified images with high confidence are collected. Street View House Numbers (SVHN)  contains 73,257 training and 26,032 test images of digits 0 to 9. The images are 32 x 32 in resolution. We use only the test images for evaluation. Describable Textures Dataset (Texture)  consists 5,640 textural images found in the wild with image resolution ranging from 300 x 300 to 640 x 640. It is split into training, validation and testing set with equal sizes. We use the training set for the evaluation. Places  features more than 10 million images with more than 400 scene categories. We use the curated version from  with 50 classes outside ImageNet-1k classes and randomly sampled 10,000 images. iNaturalist (iNat)  consists of 859,000 images of more than 5,000 fine-grained species of animals and plants. We follow the setting from  with 110 classes not found in ImageNet-1k classes and randomly sample 10,000 images. SUN  has 130,159 images of 397 scenes with image resolution higher than 200 x 200. We also follow the same setting in  in this dataset, by using only 50 classes outside ImageNet-1k classes randomly sampling 10,000 images. ImageNet-O (IN-O) [ref]15 contains 7,500 natural adversarial images with classes outside a subset of 200 classes in ImageNet-1k. It is collected similarly to ImageNet-A. Semantic Shift Benchmark (SSB)  is curated from ImageNet-21k 4 by calculating the semantic distance using ImageNet-1k tree-like classes hierarchy. It is divided into ’Easy’ (SSB-E) and ’Hard’ (SSB-H) splits based on whether the classes are far way (i.e. dog with candle) or close to ImageNet-1k classes (i.e. dog with wolf). Each split has 1,000 classes and 50,000 images.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: We describe the datasets used in the main paper in detail. ImageNet-1k (IN) [ref]4 is a large-scale dataset for image recognition, containing 1,000 classes of real-world photos. It has\n1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images. We use the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
