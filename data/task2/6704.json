One of the earliest approaches for paired graph representation learning using GNNs is the graph convolutional Siamese network .\nIn Graph Convolutional Siamese network, the input pairs must share identical graph topology, and the paired training is done by simply concatenating the individual graph representations.\nHowever, since it does not take the interaction between the graphs during the embedding process into account, each graph is embedded into a single static representation regardless of its pair.\nThis static representation can limit the expressiveness of the many-to-many relationships between pairwise graphs .\nFor instance, when predicting interactions between chemical compounds, each molecular graph can have multiple functional groups, which are important sub-graphs for the task.\nSince the contribution of each functional group to the interaction depends on its pair, representing molecules with a single static representation may be limited in terms of expressiveness.\nTo overcome this limitation, it is necessary to consider the interaction between the input pair of graphs. Subsequent works    proposed architectures considering the interaction between the input pair using the co-attention mechanism, which is an intuitive way to contemplate pairwise interactions.\nWhile co-attention has improved the predictive power of these methods, they are still limited to obtaining the interaction representation at the node-level.\nThis not only leads to increased complexity but also generates redundant output as every node pair of the two input graphs must be considered. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for considering interactions between graphs at the graph-level by applying co-attention to graph pooling.\nOur Co-attention Graph Pooling (CAGPool) dynamically represents each input graph based on its interaction with the opposite graph in the pair (as illustrated in Figure 1), while adding minimal computation complexity.\nOur model outperforms baselines even without using the additional information commonly used in baseline methods on real-world public benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks in paired graph representation learning: drug-drug interaction classification and graph similarity regression.\nThe implementation is publicly available111https://github.com/LeeJunHyun/CoAttentionGraphPooling.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Recent advancements in both aggregation  [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3   and pooling operations        have significantly improved the capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enabling for more robust learning of complex graph representations\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
