An integer point (i,j)∈ℤ2𝑖𝑗superscriptℤ2(i,j)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{2} is visible from the origin (0,0)00(0,0) if i𝑖i and j𝑗j are relatively prime, that is, gcd​(i,j)=1gcd𝑖𝑗1\\mathrm{gcd}(i,j)=1. The slope of a segment between (0,0)00(0,0) and (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) is j/i𝑗𝑖j/i. For every n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}, the Farey set of order n𝑛n, is the set of slopes of the lines spanned by the origin and lattice points (b,a)∈[0,n]2𝑏𝑎superscript0𝑛2(b,a)\\in[0,n]^{2} with a≤b𝑎𝑏a\\leq b.\nThe Farey sequence is the sequence of elements in Fnsubscript𝐹𝑛F_{n} in increasing order.\nNote that Fn⊂[ref]0 subscript𝐹𝑛01F_{n}\\subset[ref]0 . Farey sets and sequences have fascinating properties,\nand the distribution of Fnsubscript𝐹𝑛F_{n}, as n→∞→𝑛n\\rightarrow\\infty is not fully understood.\nIt is known that where φ​(i)𝜑𝑖\\varphi(i) is Euler’s totient function (i.e., φ​(i)𝜑𝑖\\varphi(i) is the number of nonnegative integers j𝑗j with 1≤j≤i1𝑗𝑖1\\leq j\\leq i and gcd​(i,j)=1gcd𝑖𝑗1\\mathrm{gcd}(i,j)=1). Furthermore, if p1q1subscript𝑝1subscript𝑞1\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}} and p2q2subscript𝑝2subscript𝑞2\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}} are consecutive terms of the Farey sequence in reduced form (i.e., gcd​(p1,q1)=1gcdsubscript𝑝1subscript𝑞11\\mathrm{gcd}(p_{1},q_{1})=1 and gcd​(p2,q2)=1gcdsubscript𝑝2subscript𝑞21\\mathrm{gcd}(p_{2},q_{2})=1), then |p1​q2−p2​q1|=1subscript𝑝1subscript𝑞2subscript𝑝2subscript𝑞11|p_{1}q_{2}-p_{2}q_{1}|=1 . The Farey sequence is uniformly distributed on [ref]0 01[ref]0  in the sense that for any fixed subinterval [α,β]⊂[ref]0 𝛼𝛽01[\\alpha,\\beta]\\subset[ref]0 , the asymptotic frequency of the Farey set in [α,β]𝛼𝛽[\\alpha,\\beta] is known converge as n𝑛n tends to infinity : The error term is bounded by O​(n−1+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝜀O(n^{-1+\\varepsilon}), for some \\eps>0\\eps0\\eps>0. However, determining the rate of convergence is known to be equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis [ref]26 [ref]38; see also  and references therein. The key result we use is a bound on the average distance to a Farey set Fnsubscript𝐹𝑛F_{n}.\nFor every x∈[ref]0 𝑥01x\\in[ref]0 , let denote the distance between x𝑥x and the Farey set Fnsubscript𝐹𝑛F_{n}.\nKargaev and Zhigljavsky  proved that\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: the origin and lattice points (b,a)∈[0,n]2𝑏𝑎superscript0𝑛2(b,a)\\in[0,n]^{2} with a≤b𝑎𝑏a\\leq b.\nThe Farey sequence is the sequence of elements in Fnsubscript𝐹𝑛F_{n} in increasing order.\nNote that Fn⊂[ref]0 subscript𝐹𝑛01F_{n}\\subset[ref]0 .
