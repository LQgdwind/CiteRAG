      "content": "Paper Title: Where We Have Arrived in Proving the Emergence of Sparse Symbolic Concepts in AI Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we aim to prove that sparse symbolic concepts usually emerge in a well-trained AI model.\nRecent studies   have empirically discovered the emergence of symbolic concepts in various DNNs trained for different tasks.\nIn mathematics, the emergence of symbolic concepts means that the inference logic of an AI model can be represented as the detection of a small number of concepts with a certifiably low approximation error. ∙∙\\bullet Definition. We need a clear definition of concepts encoded by an AI model. In this paper, each concept is defined as the Harsanyi interaction [ref]11 and is shown in Eq. (1). Specifically, let us consider a trained model v𝑣v and an input sample 𝒙=[x1,⋯,xn]⊤𝒙superscriptsubscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑛top\\bm{x}=[x_{1},\\cdots,x_{n}]^{\\top} with n𝑛n input variables indexed by N={1,⋯,n}𝑁1⋯𝑛N=\\{1,\\cdots,n\\}.\nFor example, the input variables are image regions for image classification or words in an input sentence for a natural language processing task.\nFurthermore, without loss of generality, let us assume that the output of the model on the sample 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} is a scalar, denoted by v​(𝒙)∈ℝ𝑣𝒙ℝv(\\bm{x})\\in\\mathbb{R}. For models with multi-dimensional output vectors, we may choose one dimension of the output vector as the final output v​(𝒙)𝑣𝒙v(\\bm{x}). In particular, for multi-category classification tasks, we set v​(𝒙)=log⁡p​(y=ytruth|𝒙)1−p​(y=ytruth|𝒙)𝑣𝒙𝑝𝑦conditionalsuperscript𝑦truth𝒙1𝑝𝑦conditionalsuperscript𝑦truth𝒙v(\\bm{x})=\\log\\frac{p(y=y^{\\text{truth}}|\\bm{x})}{1-p(y=y^{\\text{truth}}|\\bm{x})} by following [ref]5. Ren et al.  have used the Harsanyi dividend [ref]11 (alternatively, we call it the Harsanyi interaction in this paper) to quantify the interaction I​(S)𝐼𝑆I(S) between input variables in the set S⊆N𝑆𝑁S\\subseteq N: where u​(T)​=def​v​(𝒙T)−v​(𝒙∅)𝑢𝑇def𝑣subscript𝒙𝑇𝑣subscript𝒙u(T)\\overset{\\text{def}}{=}v(\\bm{x}_{T})-v(\\bm{x}_{\\emptyset}). Here, v​(𝒙T)𝑣subscript𝒙𝑇v(\\bm{x}_{T}) denotes the model output on the masked input sample 𝒙Tsubscript𝒙𝑇\\bm{x}_{T}, where variables in N∖T𝑁𝑇N\\setminus T are masked using their baseline values 𝒃=[b1,…,bn]⊤𝒃superscriptsubscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑛top\\bm{b}=[b_{1},\\dots,b_{n}]^{\\top}, and variables in S𝑆S are unchanged.\nIn this way, u​(N)=v​(𝒙)−v​(𝒙∅)𝑢𝑁𝑣𝒙𝑣subscript𝒙u(N)=v(\\bm{x})-v(\\bm{x}_{\\emptyset}) represents the overall benefit of all input variables w.r.t. the model output, and u​(∅)=I​(∅)=0𝑢𝐼0u(\\emptyset)=I(\\emptyset)=0. Each interaction I​(S)𝐼𝑆I(S) can be understood as an AND relationship between input variables in S𝑆S. For example, as Figure 1 shows, to recognize a dog face, an AI model might encode the collaboration between three image regions in S={x1,x2,x3}𝑆subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3S=\\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\} for inference. Therefore, we can consider that there is interaction between the three image regions. The interaction will be activated and make a certain numerical effect I​(S)𝐼𝑆I(S) on the model output, only when the image regions x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}, x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}, and x3subscript𝑥3x_{3} are all present. In contrast, the absence (masking) of any of the three image regions (e.g., the masking of x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} in Figure 1) will deactivate the interaction and remove the numerical effect, i.e., I​(S|𝒙masked)=0𝐼conditional𝑆superscript𝒙masked0I(S|\\bm{x}^{\\text{masked}})=0. ∙∙\\bullet Certificated compositional inference patterns.\nMathematically, we find the interaction defined above has three desirable properties: (1) universal matching of the model output on any arbitrarily masked input sample, (2) transferability, and (3) discrimination power. Such three properties ensure that these interactions can faithfully represent compositional inference patterns encoded by the AI model. Universal matching of the model output. It is proven that the model output on any arbitrarily masked sample can be well mimicked/matched by the effects of specific interactive concepts, as follows. Let the input sample 𝐱𝐱\\bm{x} be arbitrarily masked to obtain a masked sample 𝐱Ssubscript𝐱𝑆\\bm{x}_{S}. The output of the AI model on the masked sample 𝐱Ssubscript𝐱𝑆\\bm{x}_{S} can be disentangled into the sum of effects of all interactive concepts within the set S𝑆S: Transferability and discrimination power. Li et al.  have empirically discovered the transferability and discrimination power of interactive concepts in classification tasks. Specifically, they discovered that there was a significant overlap between the set of salient interactive concepts extracted from different samples in the same category, which indicated that interactive concepts were transferable across different samples. Furthermore, it was also discovered that the same concept extracted from different samples consistently pushed the classification result towards a certain category, which implied that interactive concepts were discriminative in a classification task. ∙∙\\bullet The sparsity of interactions / interactive concepts is the core of the emergence of symbolic concepts. In other words, the core task of proving the emergence of symbolic concepts is to prove that in a well-trained AI model, the interactions/concepts defined above are sparse.\nAlthough there are as many as 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} interactions corresponding to each set S𝑆S in 2N={S:S⊆N}superscript2𝑁conditional-set𝑆𝑆𝑁2^{N}=\\{S:S\\subseteq N\\}, recent studies   have empirically discovered that these interactions were usually sparse for a sufficiently trained AI model. I.e., only a few salient interactions have significant effects on the model output, and can be taken as salient interactive concepts. In comparison, most other interactions have near-zero effects (i.e., I​(S)≈0𝐼𝑆0I(S)\\approx 0), which are referred to as noisy patterns. In this way, the model output can be summarized by a small number of salient interactive concepts, i.e., v​(𝒙)≈∑S∈ΩsalientI​(S)+v​(𝒙∅)𝑣𝒙subscript𝑆subscriptΩsalient𝐼𝑆𝑣subscript𝒙v(\\bm{x})\\approx\\sum_{S\\in\\Omega_{\\text{salient}}}I(S)+v(\\bm{x}_{\\emptyset}). Although the sparsity of interactive concepts has already been demonstrated in previous studies  , we still conducted experiments in this paper, in order to better illustrate this phenomenon. We followed  to conduct experiments on various DNNs111Please see Appendix C for details on these DNNs and datasets., including multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), residual multi-layer perceptrons (ResMLPs) , LeNet , AlexNet , VGG , ResNet , PointNet , PointNet++ , and on different datasets, including tabular data (the tic-tac-toe dataset [ref]7, the phishing dataset [ref]7, and the wifi dataset [ref]7), point cloud data (the ShapeNet dataset ), and image data (the MNIST-3 dataset  and the CelebA-eyeglasses dataset ). For better visualization, we showed the normalized interaction strength |I~​(S)|​=def​|I​(S)|/maxS′⁡|I​(S′)|~𝐼𝑆def𝐼𝑆subscriptsuperscript𝑆′𝐼superscript𝑆′|\\tilde{I}(S)|\\overset{\\text{\\rm def}}{=}|I(S)|/\\max_{S^{\\prime}}|I(S^{\\prime})| in a descending order. Each curve in Figure 2 represents the average strength over different samples in the dataset, which is computed according to the method in . Figure 2 successfully verifies that interactive concepts encoded by various DNNs on different tasks were all sparse.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: with a certifiably low approximation error. ∙∙\\bullet Definition.
