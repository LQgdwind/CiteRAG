      "content": "Paper Title: Extending Source Code Pre-Trained Language Models to Summarise Decompiled Binaries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReverse engineering binary programs has many applications, in particular, software security [ref]1. Binary reverse engineering is a hard task, requiring highly skilled reverse engineers [ref]1 . Disassemblers and decompilers can help in this process. Disassemblers transform the binary into a low-level intermediate representation, and decompilers lift the representation to a high-level programming language-like representation. But the output of decompilers is still difficult to read and understand [ref]1 . Much of the work that goes into reverse engineering a binary is spent labelling functions with semantic descriptions [ref]1. Current approaches        mainly focus on recovering aspects lost in the compilation and decompilation process, such as names and types.\nExisting works fail to address the inherent difficulties in binary code comprehensibility, namely, the need for a high-level overview of the code. For source code, methods exist to automatically generate summaries from code  . Source code summarisation is used to automatically generate short natural language descriptions of code, which support program comprehension and aid maintenance  . While these methods have been successfully applied to programming languages such as Python, Java and PHP [ref]14 [ref]15 , using pre-trained language models [ref]14 [ref]15 , none of these methods has been applied to the relatively syntactically-poor output of decompilers (see Figures  1(a) and  1(b)). Being able to quickly determine the context and application of a function, can save valuable analysis time, and greatly benefit reverse engineers. Function and variable names alone, are inadequate representations of the source code , which is why having descriptive summaries of binaries is desirable. Following , source code can be described as having two information channels: the algorithmic channel and the natural language channel. The algorithmic channel specifies the execution of a program (semantics), while the natural language channel explains the purpose and context of the program to humans . The natural channel includes function and variable names, code comments and the specific human-readable structure of programs. Processors only consider the algorithmic channel to execute a program, while humans use both the algorithmic channel and the natural channel to understand a piece of code . Furthermore, code is very regular and predictable, even more so than natural languages .\nThe compilation process, which transforms readable code into executable binaries, removes much of the information contained in the natural channel. Especially stripped binaries — binaries of which the symbol table is removed — are challenging, since they have almost no identifiers at all as can be observed in Figure 1(c). The goal of this paper is\nto advance the field of binary reverse engineering by\nexploring the application of code summarisation to decompiled binaries\nby taking advantage of source code pre-trained language models. However, there exists no dataset of aligned binaries\nand source code summaries since this is a new and unexplored task. As pointed out by LeClair and McMillan, the lack of standardised datasets is a major barrier to ongoing research, which we will address for this task . In this paper, we create a dataset containing pairs of decompiled and stripped-decompiled functions and summaries of these functions. During the creation of this dataset, we conform to the current best practices for dataset construction  0. We apply this dataset to an existing pre-trained language model using transfer learning, by fine-tuning this pre-trained model on our dataset. For this task, we selected a pre-trained CodeT5 model, which was only trained on source code [ref]14. We perform experiments on this model to explore the impact of decompilation, and the importance of identifiers. Furthermore, we explore the impact of compiler optimisation levels, the dataset size and the level of duplication. Our findings are that the decompilation and alignment of stripped functions has a very high failure rate; and the resulting stripped model has low performance. But, we found that the model shows state-of-the-art performance with both decompiled code as well as demi-stripped stripped code, code of which the identifiers were removed after decompilation. Our experiments on data duplication and dataset size further show that these models can be trained with few data, and that while duplicates have a high impact on performance, their presence is not paramount to model performance. Our key result: language models pre-trained on source code can be fine-tuned on binaries, opening up a range of new possibilities for the automated analysis of binaries.
