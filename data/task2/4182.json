It is here that RL has shown the most promising results. Consider first the great success achieved by Silver et al.  in the creation of ‘AlphaGo’—an algorithm that, for the first time, defeated a professional human player in the ancient game of Go. Wang et al.  reflect on the technological implications of this advancement, seeing it as a watershed moment for a new era of computational intelligence in complex systems. It is worth noting, however, though this algorithm did rely on RL, there was still a significant degree of agent design from humans, based on empirical game data. Arguably, then, in the context of in ACE, the development of AlphaGo does not solve the fundamental problem of improving agent representation. The developers of AlphaGo shared this sentiment, insisting that we ought to create algorithms that can learn tabula rasa—that is, in the absence of any preconceived notions, ideas, goals. And indeed, just one year later, Silver et al. created AlphaZero —which mastered the same game of Go, but solely using RL, without any human guidance or domain knowledge. Not long after this, an even bigger step was taken in the creation of MuZero . Here, Schrittwieser et al. developed an agent that could master several games, including Go, without being told the underlying dynamics of the system in question. That is, the agent was not told how it should play the game, nor how the game even works—it had to learn such dynamics from experience. The motivation for this pursuit is that “in real-world problems, the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown” —notice that this is the precise problem faced by agent-based modelling in economic contexts. Despite not knowing the system rules a priori, the MuZero algorithm was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in playing the games, unlocking a new conceptual framework for how we can train computer agents. Silver et al.  discuss the philosophical dimensions of this training approach, in a treatise entitled “Reward is enough.” Whether the maximisation of reward is, in fact, solely enough for the realisation of intelligence, or something more nuanced is required (for example, as suggested by Juechems and Summerfield [ref]32), the point remains: advances in RL have revealed new possibilities for the creation of intelligent agents—ones which have not been hard-coded by humans.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Whether the maximisation of reward is, in fact, solely enough for the realisation of intelligence, or something more nuanced is required (for example, as suggested by Juechems and Summerfield [ref]32), the point remains: advances in RL have revealed new possibilities for the creation of intelligent agents—ones which have not been hard-coded by humans.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
