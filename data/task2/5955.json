      "content": "Paper Title: AGI for Agriculture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we briefly introduce how AI and AGI techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP), can be adopted to advance a wide variety of agriculture applications.\nTexts are probably the most accessible data sources in many domains including agriculture, considering the vast amount of documents (e.g., scientific papers, technical reports, surveys, news, and social media data). Although some pioneering efforts use NLP techniques for agriculture applications, customizing NLP models for specific agriculture applications has been largely underexplored. In the following, we discuss several types of NLP techniques, including both traditional NLP techniques and the most recent large language models (LLMs), which have been used (or could be potentially used) to assist agriculture applications. Information Extraction. As a fundamental task in NLP, information extraction focuses on extracting structured information from unstructured or semi-structured documents. It is also an essential step for many other NLP tasks such as knowledge graph construction [ref]141. Some recent efforts in the agriculture domain can be found in this survey paper . Most work in this area focuses on applying classical NLP techniques (e.g., rule-based methods and learning-based methods) for subtasks like named entity recognition (NER) and then creating ontology or knowledge graph that is specific to agriculture. Recently, transformer-based language models like BERT have also been used for entity and relation extraction . Semantic Matching. Considering the diversity in language representations, semantic matching is a key technique that enables the correct matching of semantically similar entities with varying lengths (e.g., words, phrases, sentences, documents). One recent application of semantic matching in the agriculture domain is to establish the mapping between food descriptions and nutrition database [ref]140. In particular, a food-related text corpora (e.g., food and agricultural literature) is collected for pretraining transformer-based language models. And semantic matching between food and nutrition is then performed in the embedding space, by formulating an answer selection problem. Moreover, semantic matching could play an essential role in fusing agricultural text data from different sources. Question Answering and Dialogue System. Question answering (QA) and dialogue systems are fundamental problems in NLP  . The models are expected to accurately understand the question and context, and then generate informative responses. A direct extension of the QA technique is dialogue systems such as chatbots. By far, some chatbots have been developed in the agriculture domain, such as answering questions from farmers  [ref]158 . For instance, a recurrent neural network (RNN) based chatbot is designed to deal with questions about soil testing, plant protection, and nutrient management [ref]158. These QA systems or chatbots, however, have very limited capability due to the small model size and insufficient training data. Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). Language modeling has become the mainstream technique in NLP due to its effectiveness and remarkable generalizability. In particular, transformer-based pretrained language models can serve as base models for lots of NLP applications. PLMs such as BERT are usually pretrained by tasks like masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). Since these PLMs are pretrained in general domains using data from Wikipedia and BookCorpus, a fine-tuning step is usually required for specific domains. By fine-tuning the base PLMs with high-quality text corpus from a specific domain, customized language models could be developed. Some representative examples include BioBERT , PubMedBERT , and LEGAL-BERT . In [ref]140, a large-scale corpus of agricultural literature with more than 300 million tokens is used to fine-tune the generic BERT into AgriBERT. Such domain-specific language models could be potentially used to assist many agricultural applications, such as agricultural marketing, agricultural social media analytics, etc. Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs usually refer to PLMs with more than billions of model parameters, such as the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models (GPT-1 , GPT-2 , GPT-3 , InstructGPT , ChatGPT, and GPT-4 ), LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) , and BLOOM . For instance, GPT-3 and BLOOM have 175 billion parameters, and LLaMA has 65 billion parameters. Similar to traditional PLMs like BERT, these recent LLMs also follow the Transformer architecture , but they differ from each other in training objectives, data sources, optimization details, etc. For example, BERT only adopts the encoder of Transformer as it focuses on learning language representations, while GPT models adopt the decoder of Transformer, as their major objective is to generate realistic text. Owing to their huge model sizes and effective incorporation of human feedback (e.g., prompts), the latest LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have not only achieved amazing performance in traditional NLP tasks like language understanding, language generation, and question answering, but also demonstrated remarkable capabilities in zero-shot learning and reasoning . For instance, ChatGPT has shown a very promising capability in inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning . GPT-4 is a large multimodal model that can deal with both language and visual inputs. In addition, LLMs are also effective tools for data augmentation , which is very helpful for certain real-world scenarios with limited data. These exciting observations showcase that the LLMs-based techniques may enable a promising roadmap towards AGI. For agricultural applications, the LLMs would be able to significantly advance the processing, understanding, and interpretation of agricultural literature and documents. Moreover, the zero-shot learning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs would also greatly facilitate various decision-making problems in the agriculture domain. In the following sections, we will discuss how the AGI techniques (such as LLMs and large multimodal models) could be leveraged to advance a broad range of research areas and applications in agriculture. Sections 3-7 focus on several research topics in agriculture, involving different types of data (e.g., images, knowledge graphs) and various applications (e.g., precision livestock and crops, agricultural robotics). In Section 3, we will introduce AGI for agriculture image understanding, such as managing metadata in breeding studies, generating images for data augmentation, multi-task scheduling and compositing, few-shot learning, and domain adaptation. Section 4 discusses several potential aspects where knowledge graph techniques and AGI are jointly exploited for agricultural applications. Section 5 describes several possible ways of using AGI for agriculture robotics. Section 6 presents a few case studies, including AGI for precision farming and phenomics, introduces, AGI for precision livestock, and AGI for agricultural infrastructure. The last section concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [141]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]141: extraction focuses on extracting structured information from unstructured or semi-structured documents.
