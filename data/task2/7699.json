      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Optimal Transport for Geometric Cycle Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTopological data analysis (TDA) is a quickly growing field in computational and applied topology. In recent years, TDA has established itself as an effective framework to analyse, cluster, and detect patterns in complex data¬†[ref]52. One of the key algorithms in TDA is persistent homology (PH), a computational tool that describes the structure of data based on topological features persisting across different scales¬†  . In a nutshell, the PH algorithm proceeds by building a nested sequence of discrete spaces describing the input data at increasingly coarse scales, known as a filtration of simplicial complexes. The topological features of this filtration are then quantified by computing the homology groups of each simplicial complex in the sequence. A structural theorem¬† guarantees that the birth, death, and evolution of homology classes in the filtration can be summarised as a multi-set, called a persistence diagram (PD). PDs have been shown to contain rich information about the initial data, and PH-based data analysis approaches appear in an ever-increasing number of applications across multiple fields in modern science¬†   . Optimal transport (OT) is a far-reaching mathematical theory that, in its most basic and classical formulation, formalises the problem of finding a matching of a given probability distribution to another as efficiently as possible, in terms of a cost function¬† . When the cost function is induced by the distance function on a metric space (X,d)ùëãùëë(X,d), optimal transport provides a natural lifting of the ground metric to a metric on the space of probability distributions supported on XùëãX, commonly known as the Wasserstein distance. An extension of the optimal transportation problem which has recently received considerable attention is the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem¬†   , in which the probability distributions to be matched are defined over different metric spaces, rather than supported on a common space. The objective is then to find matchings that minimise distortion of pairwise distances. While the GW distance was originally introduced to compare metric measure spaces and can be viewed as a relaxation of the well known Gromov-Hausdorff distance¬†, some of its most successful applications address the problem of matching more general structured objects such as (labelled) graphs¬† [ref]53 [ref]10 . Among its numerous advantages, the GW distance has brought substantial improvements to graph processing tasks over classical methods, and can be efficiently approximated by a range of numerical algorithms in practice¬†[ref]53   . On the theoretical front, the space of gauged measure spaces (i.e., a measure space (X,Œº)ùëãùúá(X,\\mu) together with a symmetric gauge function k:X√óX‚Üí‚Ñù:ùëò‚Üíùëãùëã‚Ñùk:X\\times X\\to\\mathbb{R}) endowed with the GW distance has the geometry of an Alexandrov space, and a Riemannian orbifold structure can be developed in this setting¬† [ref]10. More recently, inspired by the goal of encoding relations in complex systems as higher-order networks, a variant of the GW problem, referred to as co-optimal transport¬†, was applied to model hypergraphs both from a theoretical and applied point of view¬†. In this paper, we combine the TDA and OT approaches described above to develop a transport-based theory for topological data processing. Our approach is inspired by recent extensions built upon persistent homology computations: the hyperTDA framework¬† encodes each point in a persistence diagram, together with a geometric realisation of its homology class as a generating cycle, as a higher-order network called a PH-hypergraph. In a PH-hypergraph, vertices corresponds to data points used as input to the PH computation, and hyperedges are given by the generators of features in the persistence diagram. We define the topological optimal transport (TpOT) problem, by considering a trade-off between preservation of geometric relationships, preservation of topological features, and coupling the two via the PH-hypergraph structure (see Figure¬†1). The output is (1) a matching between points that is topologically driven and geometrically informed, coupled with (2) a matching between persistent homology classes that is geometrically driven and topologically informed. Finding meaningful ways of matching topological features across distinct systems is an important challenge in TDA. The past few years have seen considerable effort in addressing this question, with a number of different solutions proposed¬†  5 8  1, many of which bridge between topological data analysis and optimal transport¬†3 7 0. A key aspect of the TpOT method is leveraging existing transportation theory for persistence diagrams to drive a matching between topological features, while also taking into account geometric information and the spatial interconnectivity of homology generators. By endowing PH-hypergraphs with probability measures, we introduce the concept of measure topological networks, and we formalise a framework for studying the TpOT induced distance dTpOT,psubscriptùëëTpOTùëùd_{\\mathrm{TpOT},p}. Our main contributions are as follows: We develop a flexible measure-theoretic formalism for simultaneously encoding the geometry and topology of a finite point cloud, in the form of the aforementioned measure topological networks, as well as a family of distances dTpOT,psubscriptùëëTpOTùëùd_{\\mathrm{TpOT},p}, p‚â•1ùëù1p\\geq 1, between these objects; see Definitions¬†1 and 2, respectively. The distance dTpOT,psubscriptùëëTpOTùëùd_{\\mathrm{TpOT},p} is shown to be a pseudometric on the space of measure topological networks ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P}, and the zero distance equivalence relation is completely characterised; see Theorem 1. We show that the metric induced by dTpOT,psubscriptùëëTpOTùëùd_{\\mathrm{TpOT},p} is geodesic, characterise the exact form of the geodesics and use this characterisation to show that this metric space is non-negatively curved, in the sense of Alexandrov; see Theorems 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Our framework is centred on an optimisation problem for which we provide efficient numerical algorithms, which we demonstrate on a variety of examples; see Section 5. The paper is organised as follows. Section¬†2 describes the necessary mathematical background on persistent homology and optimal transport. In Section¬†3, after motivating and constructing the TpOT problem, we define measure topological networks and the family of (pseudo-)metrics dTpOT,psubscriptùëëTpOTùëùd_{\\mathrm{TpOT},p}. We then discuss theoretical properties (Subsection¬†3.2) of the distance dTpOT,psubscriptùëëTpOTùëùd_{\\mathrm{TpOT},p}, and provide a characterisation of geodesics in Section¬†4. Finally, we provide details of the computational implementation (Subsection¬†3.4), as well as examples (Section¬†5).\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: (TDA) is a quickly growing field in computational and applied topology.
