      "content": "Paper Title: AutoDFP: Automatic Data-Free Pruning via Channel Similarity Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe field of model compression has undergone extensive research to bridge the gap between the size of neural networks and the hardware limitations of edge devices, such as pruning [ref]1, [ref]2, , quantization , , , , and knowledge distillation , , .\nModel compression technology known as network pruning aims to reduce redundant parameters and computations in the original networks. Pruning algorithms can be categorized into fine-grained pruning and structured pruning depending on the level of granularity. Since fine-grained pruning  produces irregular sparse patterns and requires specialized hardware support , many studies have focused on structured pruning. Numerous structured pruning methods have been proposed , , , , . While these methods have achieved outstanding performance, they require original training data to restore accuracy through fine-tuning or knowledge distillation, being both data-dependent and computationally expensive.\nIn situations where data privacy and security are critical, such as real-world applications involving restricted datasets like medical data and user data, these data-driven methods become unsuitable to employ. Consequently, multiple methods are proposed to perform data-free pruning , [ref]19, , .\nData-free pruning techniques, such as the ones presented in Dream  and DFNP [ref]19, utilize synthetic samples. Although these methods achieve pruning without the need for data, the process of generating synthetic data is computationally intensive and expensive.\nAnother category of data-free pruning , ,  proposes compensation for the pruned portion to restore the accuracy of the network.\nSimilarly, compensation techniques are also utilized in data-free quantization approaches .\nHowever, these approaches demand significant human efforts to modify pruning strategies and hyperparameters. Additionally, they are limited in their ability to identify network redundancies and provide inflexible compensation for pruned channels, resulting in a significant drop in accuracy.\nTaking the Neuron Merging  as an example, on the ImageNet dataset, pruning 30% of the parameters in the ResNet-50 network, the resulting top-1 accuracy rate is a mere 24.63%, which is unacceptable. To address this problem, we aim to automate the process of pruning and compensation based on the redundancy characteristics of each layer.\nIllustrated in Fig. 2, T-SNE is employed to visualize the clustering results of a particular layer of channels across multiple networks utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) . Through channel clustering, we discovered that they share similarities, which can also be seen as a certain degree of redundancy in the networks.\nBased on this observation, we hypothesize that when channels are pruned, the loss of information can be partially compensated for by preserving information from similar channels.\nTherefore, we propose the Automatic Data-Free Pruning (AutoDFP) method, which autonomously evaluates network redundancy levels and devises corresponding pruning and reconstruction strategies. An overview of our AutoDFP approach is depicted in Fig. 1.\nBy incorporating reinforcement learning, we can automatically derive the optimal strategy within the reinforcement learning framework, as depicted in Fig. 3.\nThe main contributions are summarized as follows: We formulate data-free pruning and reconstruction as an optimization problem based on the assumption of channel similarity. We model the resolution process of this pruning-reconstruction optimization problem as a Markov decision process, enabling its solution through reinforcement learning algorithms. We employ a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)  agent to automate the process of pruning and reconstruction. The SAC agent receives the state of each layer in the network and provides strategies for both pruning and reconstruction. The broad applicability of our method is demonstrated across a range of deep neural networks, including VGG-16/19 , MobileNet-V1 /V2 , ResNet-56/34/50/101 , and various datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Additionally, we have also evaluated our method on detection networks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The field of model compression has undergone extensive research to bridge the gap between the size of neural networks and the hardware limitations of edge devices, such as pruning [ref]1, [ref]2, , quantization , , , , and knowledge distillation , , .\nModel compression technology known as network pruning aims to reduce redundant parameters and computations in the original\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
