      "content": "Paper Title: Open Set Action Recognition via Multi-Label Evidential Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOpen set human action recognition has been studied in recent years due to its great potential in real-world applications, such as security surveillance , autonomous driving [ref]32, and face recognition .\nIt differs from closed set problems that aim to classify human actions into a predefined set of known classes, since open set methods can identify samples with unseen classes with high accuracy 2. To this end, several recent methods   are proposed for open set human action recognition.\nAs shown in the bottom-left of Figure 1, they focus on single-actor, single-action based recognition, assuming that each video contains only one single action.\nCompared with traditional softmax scores 1   for closed set recognition, evidential neural networks (ENNs) [ref]34  can provide a principled way to jointly formulate the multi-class classification and uncertainty modeling to measure novelty of an instance more accurately. It assumes that class probability follows a prior Dirichlet distribution.\nHowever, in more realistic situation with multiple actions of actor(s) (see the upper part of Figure 1), the Dirichlet distribution does not hold because the predicted likelihood of each action follows a binomial distribution (i.e., identifying either known or novel action). In this paper, we introduce a general but understudied problem, namely novelty detection of actor(s) with multiple actions.\nGiven real-world use cases 2 , the goal is to accurately detect if actor(s) perform novel/unknown action(s) or not. Following 0, an actor is considered unknown if it does not contain any known action(s).\nInspired by the belief theory 2 6, we propose a new framework named MUlti-Label Evidential learning (MULE), which is composed of three modules: Actor-Context-Object Relation modeling (ACO-R), Beta Evidential Neural Network (Beta-ENN), and Multi-label Evidence Debiasing Constraint (M-EDC).\nFirst, we build ACO-R representation to exploit the actors’ interactions with the surrounding objects and the context.\nThen, we use Beta-ENN to estimate the evidence of known actions, and quantify the predictive uncertainty of actions so that unknown actions would incur high uncertainty, i.e., lack of confidence for known predictions.\nHere, the evidence indicates actions closest to the predicted one in the feature space and are used to support the decision-making [ref]34.\nInstead of relying on Dirichlet distribution , the evidence in Beta-ENN is regarded as parameters of a Beta distribution which is a conjugate prior of the Binomial likelihood. Additionally, in open set recognition, static bias  may bring a false correlation between the prediction and static cues, such as scenes, resulting in inferior generalization capability of a model.\nTherefore, the M-EDC is added to the objective function of our framework to reduce the static bias for video actions.\nWe propose a duality-based learning algorithm to optimize the network.\nSpecifically, we apply an averaging scheme to proximate primal optimal solutions.\nThe primal and dual parameters are updated interactively, where the primal parameters regard model accuracy and dual parameters adjust model debiasing.\nThe theoretical analysis shows the convergence of the primal solution sequence and gives bounds for both the loss function and the violation of the debiasing constraint in MULE.\nTo adapt to our proposed problem, we re-split two representative action recognition datasets (i.e., AVA 4 and Charades ) into subsets of known actions and novel actions.\nAccording to the proposed uncertainty and belief based novelty estimation mechanisms, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on novelty detection.\nThe main contributions of this work are summarized: A new framework MULE is proposed for open set action recognition in videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to detect actors with multiple unknown actions. Furthermore, our method can generalize to scenarios where a video contains either a single or multiple actors associated with one or more actions. To optimize the Beta-ENN, we develop a simple but effective algorithm using a primal-dual average scheme update, with theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the primal solution sequence and bounds for both the loss function and the violation of the debiasing constraint. To estimate the novelty score for each actor, we introduce four novelty estimation mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MULE outperforms existing methods on novel action detection.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Open set human action recognition has been studied in recent years due to its great potential in real-world applications, such as security surveillance , autonomous driving [ref]32, and face recognition .\nIt differs from closed set problems that aim to classify human actions into a predefined set of known classes, since open set methods can identify samples with unseen\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
