      "content": "Paper Title: Game-Theoretic Models of Moral and Other-Regarding Agents (extended abstract)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGame Theory is widely regarded as the main conceptual foundation of strategic behavior. The promise behind its explosive development (at the crossroads of Economics and Computer Science) is that of understanding the dynamics of human agents and societies and, equally importantly, of guiding the engineering of artificial agents, ultimately capable of realistic, human-like, courses of action. Yet, it is clear that the main models of Game Theory, primarily based on the self-interested, rational actor model, and exemplified by the concept of Nash equilibria, are not realistic representations of the richness of human interactions. Concepts such as bounded rationality , and the limitations they impose on the computational complexity of agents’ cognitive models  can certainly account for some of this difference. But this is hardly the only possible explanation: People behave differently from ideal economic agents not because they would be irrational , but since many human interactions are cooperative, rather than competitive , guided by social norms such as reciprocity, fairness and inequity-aversion [ref]14, often involving networked minds, rather than utility maximization performed in isolation , driven by moral considerations  or by other not purely self-regarding behaviors, e.g. altruism 7 and spite  . Moral considerations (should) interact substantially with game theory: indeed, the latter field has been used to propose a reconstruction of moral philosophy   ; conversely, some philosophers have gone as far as to claim that we need a moral equilibrium theory . Whether that’s true or not, it is a fact that homo economicus, the Nash optimizer of economics, is increasingly complemented by a rich emerging typology of human behavior , that also contains (in Gintis’s words) \"homo socialis, the other-regarding agent who cares about fairness, reciprocity, and the well-being of others, and homo moralis 111since our agents are not necessarily human, we will use alternate names such as ”moral agent” for this type of behavior. … the Aristotelian bearer of nonconsequentialist character virtues\".222Gintis proposes a taxonomy of behavior with three distinct types of preferences: self-regarding, other regarding and universalist; a further relevant distinction is between so-called private and public personas, that leads to further types of behavior such as homo Parochialis, homo Universalis and homo Vertus. See  for further details.\nThese claims are well-documented experimentally: for instance,\nFischbacher et al. 4 investigated the percent of people having self-regarding preferences in a public goods game, showing that it is in the range of 30-40%, while the remaining were either other-regarding or moral agents. Since artificial agents (will) interact with humans, such concerns are highly relevant to the design of multiagent systems and justify the study of alternative other-regarding notions, e.g. Rong and Halpern’s 3  \"cooperative equilibria\" or dependency theory  1.\nOther-regarding considerations could be encoded (e.g. ) as externalities into agents’ perceived utilities, that may lead them away from straightforward maximization of their material payoffs. However, keeping them explicit may be important for agent implementations. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the emerging literature on non-Nashian, morally inspired game theoretic concepts and, equally important, to bring its concerns and methods to the attention of the various communities represented in TARK.\nWe are inspired by what we believe is one of the most intriguing classes of equilibrium concepts that can be seen as morally grounded: Kantian (a.k.a. Hofstadter) equilibria . This notion emerged from three separate lines of research converging on an identical mathematical definition, but justifying it, however, from several very different perspectives: superrationality 9 , team reasoning [ref]5, and Kantian optimization, respectively . The common framework (most crisply developed for symmetric coordination games) only considers as relevant the action profiles where all agents choose the same action, choosing the action x𝑥x that, if played by everyone, maximizes agents’ (identical) utility functions. The justification of this restriction depends on the perspective: superrationality assumes that if rationality constrains an agent to choose a specific course of action x𝑥x, then the same reasoning compels all agents (at least in the case of symmetric games, when all agents are positionally indistinguishable from the original agent) to also choose x𝑥x.333To cite Hofstadter: ”If reasoning dictates an answer, then everyone should independently come to that answer. Seeing this fact is itself the critical step in the reasoning toward the correct answer […]”. Though superrationality does away with the assumption of counterfactual independence of Nash equilibria, it is otherwise compatible with a particular version of homo economicus that requires some very strong assumptions on agent rationality (see  for a discussion).\nIn contrast, Kantian optimization justifies the limitation to symmetric profiles in a very different manner: Roemer  suggested that agents often ignore the potential for action of the other players, acting instead according to the Kantian categorical imperative  \"act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law\", that is, choose a course of action that, if adopted by every agent, would bring all agents the highest payoff. 444As recognized by Roemer himself and discussed e.g. in , the connection of Kantian equilibria to actual Kantian ideas is quite loose. Another possible interpretation is that Kantian equilibria embody rule utilitarianism 6. Finally, see  for a discussion of the normative aspects of Kantian equilibria.  One way to formalize this idea, employed e.g. in , is to decouple the material payoffs agents receive from their (perceived) utility, which agents maximize in order to select the action. Specifically, assume the given agent i𝑖i plays strategy x𝑥x against action profile y𝑦y. We assume that the material payoff the agent receives is π_​i​(x,y)subscript𝜋_𝑖𝑥𝑦\\pi_{\\_}{i}(x,y). On the other hand the utility the agent uses to evaluate alternative x𝑥x may not be equal to π_​i​(x,y)subscript𝜋_𝑖𝑥𝑦\\pi_{\\_}{i}(x,y) and may in fact, have in fact nothing to do with y𝑦y at all! Instead, u_​i​(x,y)=π_​i​(x,x¯_−i),subscript𝑢_𝑖𝑥ysubscript𝜋_𝑖𝑥subscript¯𝑥_𝑖u_{\\_}{i}(x,\\textbf{y})=\\pi_{\\_}{i}(x,\\overline{x}_{\\_}{-i}),\nwhere x¯_−isubscript¯𝑥_𝑖\\overline{x}_{\\_}{-i} is the action profile where all agents other than i𝑖i play x𝑥x as well. That is, the agent evaluates the desirability of action x𝑥x in isolation from the actions of the other players, as if choosing x𝑥x could somehow \"magically\" determine the other players to adopt the same strategy. 555Frank 7 refers to this as voodoo causation. Elster 2 argues that Kantian optimization seems to be rooted in a form of magical thinking, ”causing agents to act on the belief (or act as if they believed) that they can have a causal influence on outcomes that are effectively outside their control”. We take a descriptive, rather than normative position: such reasoning is something people simply do; understanding its implications is strategically valuable. Alternatively, π​(x,x¯_−i)𝜋𝑥subscript¯𝑥_𝑖\\pi(x,\\overline{x}_{\\_}{-i}) measures the extent to which action x𝑥x is \"the morally best course of action\". Such a justification is cognitively plausible: experiments have shown  that people often employ such \"universalization\" arguments when judging the morality of a given behavior. The questions we attempt to start answering in this paper are: Can we extend the definition of Kantian equilibria to cover all natural cases of \"Kantian behavior\"? However, we are not simply looking in our generalization for yet another equilibrium notion of primarily mathematical interest, but for one satisfying specific tractability requirements that ensure\neasy implementation in computational agents. Specifically, a target concept should at least be: expressive, i.e. indicative of realistic behavior of human agents in sufficiently typical situations cognitively plausible: the equilibrium should not be justifiable in terms of expensive epistemic assumptions (the way common knowledge of rationality can be used to justify Nash equilibria ); logically tractable: proposed equilibria should be easy to specify formally, in a way that translates to efficient implementations. computationally tractable: equilibria should be easy to compute , since bounded rational agents are assumed to compute (and play) them. The main message of the paper is that such an extension is possible, but any general notion of Kantian equilibria may be of theoretical interest only: while we give an interesting extension for certain symmetric games (Sec. 5) inspired by the concept of program equilibria, it’s not clear how to further extend it. Together with intractability (Thm. 2) this suggests that a general, practically relevant, notion of Kantian equilibrium might not exist. What is the relation between Kantian equilibria and Bacharach’s (informally defined) team-reasoning equilibria [ref]5? The answer is that Kantian equilibria are a proper subset of team-reasoning equilibria. Given that the answer to Q1 is negative, are there more specialized equilibria related to Kantian optimization that satisfy (I)-(IV)? We will show that there exist, indeed, several more restrictive equilibrium notions, satisfying tractability and plausibility constraints, and relate them to Kantian equilibria. Real people are seldom purely selfish or purely Kantian. (How) can we formalize this? We give such a definition, and motivate it through the case of Prisoners’ Dilemma. The outline of the paper is as follows: In Section 3 we review some basic notions. In Section 4 we obtain some further results on (and highlight some limitations of) Kantian equilibria: first of all, we point out that finding a mixed Kantian equilibrium is computationally intractable even for two-player symmetric games (Theorem 2). Second, multiple Kantian equilibria may exist, and lack of coordination on the same equilibrium may be detrimental to players, even with all of them playing a common linear combination of Kantian actions. In Section 5 we discuss the problem of extending Kantian equilibria to non-symmetric games. giving a proposal based on the concept of program equilibria. As such, our proposal inherits the problems of this concept. Given these problems, in Section 6 we propose several other-regarding equilibria.666Generally, ethical egoism and its variant, rational egoism, are not accepted as a basis of moral behavior; counterexamples exist, ; however, it’s fair to say that such positions are controversial, and somewhat marginal. In contrast, moral and other-regarding behaviors are better aligned, with other-regarding behavior often a consequence of moral play. We show (Theorem 6) that these equilibria can be computed efficiently, that they are indeed Kantian equilbria (according to our generalized definition), and that they yield Kantian equilibria for symmetric coordination games. Finally, in Section 7 we relax the assumption that the agents are other-regarding: we assume that agents have a degree of greed, zero for Kantian agents, infinite for Nashian agents. We show (Theorem 8) how our definition applies to Prisoners’ Dilemma. For reasons of space, most proof details are deferred to a longer version of the paper, available on arXiv 1. So have we done, for reasons of abundance of technical details, with some of the results: e.g. the ones the proper definition and characterization of Kantian program equilibria (Theorems 9, 10 in 1), which also clarify the connection between Kantian and team reasoning.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: agents not because they would be irrational , but since many human interactions are cooperative, rather than competitive , guided by social norms such as reciprocity, fairness and inequity-aversion [ref]14, often involving networked minds, rather than utility maximization performed in isolation , driven by moral considerations  or by other not purely self-regarding behaviors, e.g. altruism 7\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
