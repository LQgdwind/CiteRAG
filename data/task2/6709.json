      "content": "Paper Title: Fully 1×1 Convolutional Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, deep learning methods have achieved dramatic improvements in SISR tasks  . Especially for CNN-based models, various well-designed CNN architectures explore to further improve the SISR performance   . Besides, attention mechanism like the channel attention  has been introduced to SISR task as well   . Most recently, vision transformers have attracted great attention   and many work have been proposed to explore transformer-based architectures that achieve SOTA performance 0 . In addition to encompassing architectures, Zhao et al. 1 2 embarked on an empirical examination of suitable objective functions. Wu et al.2 innovated the contrastive learning framework for low-level SR tasks, providing an additional boost to the performance of existing methodologies. These diversified approaches to improving SISR continues to fuel the progression of this complex field. In contrast to achieving advancing performance with a rapidly increased number of parameters and computational cost, many lightweight SISR models have been exploited by reducing parameters, especially for resource-limited devices  3 [ref]9    . Hui et al. proposed a deep information distillation network (IDN) 3 and extended it into the information multi-distillation network (IMDN) [ref]9. Zhang et al.  proposed a real-time inference SR network by the re-parameterization strategy. Li et al.4 proposed a super lightweight model with low computational complexity, named s-LWSR, by using a symmetric architecture, compression modules, and reduced activations. They commonly leverage the normal 3×3333\\times 3 convolutions and try to develop well-designed blocks to promote the performance. In the last year, several work investigated some modern CNN-based architectures  . Liu et al. explored a modern CNN-based architecture and introduced larger kernels that utilize 7×7777\\times 7 kernel size. Ding et al. further brought the kernel size up to 31. Larger kernels bring larger receptive fields that significantly improve the capabilities of CNN-based networks compared to normal 3×3333\\times 3 convolution. Most recently, Liu et al.  exploited the large kernel in the lightweight SR network, which utilizes the channel shuffle operation to further reduce the number of learnable features. Spatial-shift operation is widely adopted in various computer vision tasks. Several existing works, such as 5 6 , have explored the use of spatial-shift operation in high-level tasks. Wu et al. 5 were the first to introduce the shift operation in convolution and proposed a compacted CNN model. Subsequently, adaptive and sparse shift operations were proposed in 6 . Additionally, Lin et al.  introduced the shift operation for temporal feature aggregation in videos. In this paper, we focus on exploring an effective convolutional model for lightweight SISR tasks, specifically by converting 3×3333\\times 3 convolution-based models into fully 1×1111\\times 1 convolutional models. However, 1×1111\\times 1 convolution lacks local feature aggregation and is unable to learn effectively. To address this challenge, we propose an effective yet efficient SCNet, which employs a basic group shift strategy for local feature aggregation. In addition, we provide detailed benchmark comparisons and ablation studies, demonstrating the potential of SCNet for developing efficient SISR models. We believe that our work will contribute to the development of efficient SISR models for the research community.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: performance with a rapidly increased number of parameters and computational cost, many lightweight SISR models have been exploited by reducing parameters, especially for resource-limited devices  3 [ref]9    .
