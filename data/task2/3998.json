      "content": "Paper Title: A Fundamental Probabilistic Fuzzy Logic Framework Suitable for Causal Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst, we briefly explain our motivations to create a Probabilistic Fuzzy Logic¬†(PFL) framework. Deep Learning Algorithms with their incredible achievements such as very high precision results in some specific tasks are at the center of the weak Artificial Intelligence . Deep Learning Algorithms fail when it comes to reasoning as pointed out by Madan et al , Pearl , and Faghihi et al . In order to equip the machine with reasoning (e.g., Causal Reasoning), Faghihi et al   suggest that we need to improve Non-Classical Logics‚Äô drawbacks and then integrate them with Deep Learning Algorithms. In this paper, we focus on an integration of Fuzzy Logic and Probability Theory in order to create a PFL framework. Let‚Äôs see a simple problem that can be solved by our PFL. Assume that we intend to allow only datapoints with the attribute high to be selected by a system (such as a neural network). Here, high is vague and could be considered as a fuzzy attribute. We suggest a probabilistic fuzzy approach to deal with the aforementioned problem (see Section 6). Also, using our PFL theory, we can answer questions such as the following: ‚ÄùGiven a fuzzy attribute (i.e., low) of X={1,‚Ä¶,10}ùëã1‚Ä¶10X=\\{1,...,10\\}, what is the probability of a randomly selected element from XùëãX being equal to 333, and 333 is low?‚Äù We believe that properly answering the above question could help the field of Causal Reasoning. Roughly speaking, we associate a random variable ŒæX,l‚Äão‚Äãwsubscriptùúâùëãùëôùëúùë§\\xi_{X,low} to the above question, and the answer is ‚Ñô‚Äã(ŒæX,l‚Äão‚Äãw=3)‚Ñôsubscriptùúâùëãùëôùëúùë§3\\mathbb{P}(\\xi_{X,low}=3). We use this type of random variables to define a fuzzy average treatment effect formula in Section 9. Apart from problems concerning Deep Learning Algorithms, our theory could also be used in Qualitative Research and Quantitative Research (which is out of the scope of this paper) . For instance, assume that a market researcher has conducted a survey. The questionnaire includes different types of questions such as demographic questions, multiple choice questions, and Likert scale questions . A Likert scale question is used to measure beliefs and opinions in a scale such as integers from 0 to 20 . The market researcher could fuzzify the interval   [ref]20 by using different fuzzy attributes such as low, medium and high. Then to select for instance high responses, one could apply our PFL theory (see Section 6). Now, we explain the organization of this paper. First, we provide the related works and their drawbacks in Section 2. In this section, we divide most known previous PFLs into three categories: 1) Zadeh‚Äôs theory, 2) Meghdadi and Akbarzadeh‚Äôs theory, 3) Buckley‚Äôs theory. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, other PFLs have been created following one of the above categories. In Section 3, we provide some basic ideas of Probability Theory, especially the main philosophical interpretations of Probability Theory. We dedicate this section to the subjective nature of some probability distributions discussed in the next sections. Also, we justify why we use a measure theoretical approach to construct our PFL. Section¬†4 is devoted to some basic concepts in the fuzzy literature required for the rest of this paper. Indeed, we define a fuzzy set and explain what we mean by a fuzzy attribute.\nIn Section 5, some terminology of Causal Inference are discussed. Then, the fundamental problem of Causal Inference is given, especially the average treatment effect as an estimand for the treatment effect of an intervention is defined. Further, the ignorability condition is explained as an assumption to overcome the fundamental problem of Causal Inference. Section 6 is devoted to some motivations and the problem setting of this paper. Indeed, one problem is how to feed a system by numerical values that satisfy a fuzzy attribute. Another problem is the assignment mechanism in Causal Inference in the case that we intend to assign for instance low, medium or high treatments to the units.\nIn Section 7, we build up our PFL framework in discrete case. Indeed, we define a two-steps random experiment, called Experiment¬†(‚ãÜ‚ãÜ\\star). Then, for any element xùë•x and a fuzzy attribute Aùê¥A of the sample space, we associate a binary random variable Œæx,Asubscriptùúâùë•ùê¥\\xi_{x,A} to the second step of the experiment. Also, we associate a random variable ŒæX,Asubscriptùúâùëãùê¥\\xi_{X,A} to the whole process, where XùëãX is the identity random variable defined on the sample space. Further, we provide several formulas for expected values and conditional probability distributions derived from these newly defined random variables. In Section¬†8, we introduce several possible models derived from our PFL framework. Since ‚Ñô‚Äã(x‚Äã¬†is¬†‚ÄãA)‚Ñôùë•¬†is¬†ùê¥\\mathbb{P}(x\\text{ is }A) is subjective in our theory, it could be based on the degree of ‚Äùxùë•x satisfying Aùê¥A‚Äù. Hence, some of the introduced models are based on membership degrees, which come from Fuzzy Logic. Further, we explain how to obtain ‚Ñô‚Äã(y‚Äã¬†is¬†‚ÄãB|x‚Äã¬†is¬†‚ÄãA)‚Ñôconditionalùë¶¬†is¬†ùêµùë•¬†is¬†ùê¥\\mathbb{P}(y\\text{ is }B|x\\text{ is }A) in the so-called standard models. Section 9 is devoted to the application of our PFL framework in Causal Inference. In this section, we explain an assignment mechanism using ŒæT,Asubscriptùúâùëáùê¥\\xi_{T,A}, where TùëáT is a treatment and Aùê¥A is a fuzzy attribute. Further, we define a fuzzy version of the average treatment effect with respect to any pair belonging to for instance {l‚Äão‚Äãw,m‚Äãe‚Äãd‚Äãi‚Äãu‚Äãm,h‚Äãi‚Äãg‚Äãh}ùëôùëúùë§ùëöùëíùëëùëñùë¢ùëö‚Ñéùëñùëî‚Ñé\\{low,medium,high\\}. This fuzzy version is based on the idea stating that to measure the causal effect of a treatment it suffices to measure the difference between the patients‚Äô conditions when they receive high treatments versus low  treatments. We also have an alternative for the ignorability condition to solve the fundamental problem of Causal Inference supported by providing an experiment. In Section 10, we provide a measure theoretical basis for our theory, which is followed by creating our PFL framework in continuous case. Indeed, the probability density function of ŒæX,Asubscriptùúâùëãùê¥\\xi_{X,A} includes the Dirac delta function as a term, when XùëãX is a continuous random variable. In Section 11, we explore the relationship between Zadeh and our PFL frameworks by addressing some main definitions. Next, Section 12 is devoted to the conclusion of this paper. In this section, we briefly justify the purposes of this paper and compare our constructed PFL framework to the previous ones. Our future works and also some recommendations for other researchers are provided in this section as well. Finally, we provide some appendices as a map to define Probability Theory as an application of Measure Theory. To do so, we start with Appendix A, where we introduce Topology, which makes it possible to define Borel sets and measures. Then, in Appendix¬†B, we very briefly explain everything in Measure Theory required to define different basic concepts in Probability Theory. In Appendix¬†C, we explain measure theoretical definitions of different basic concepts in Probability Theory such as probability measures, random variables, expected values, joint distributions, conditional distributions, discrete random variables and continuous random variables. In Appendix¬†D, we define generalized distributions, which include both discrete and continuous distributions by using the Dirac delta function.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: questions, and Likert scale questions .

Then to select for instance high responses, one could apply our PFL theory (see Section 6).
