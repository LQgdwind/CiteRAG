Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

The methods involved in the comparison include the GNA-RNN , GLA , CMPM+CMPC, MCCL , A-GANet6, Dual-path [ref]40, MIA, PMA , TIMAM , ViTAA 1, NAFS , DSSL [ref]43, MGEL 9, SSAN 4, TBPS(ResNet-50) , SUM , NAFS with RVN and CLFT  The experimental results of the different methods are listed in Table I. The accuracies obtained by our method on Rank-1, Rank-5 and Rank-10 are 64.12%, 82.76% and 88.65%, respectively, which are better than the performance achieved by all the compared methods. In addition, we found that the latest methods, MGEL, SSAN, TBPS, NAFS and CLFT, all achieve a performance of more than 60% on Rank-1. This is owing to the use of the attention mechanism, which allows the network to be more adaptive in extracting the desired discriminative features. However, they do not consider the impact of the diversity of texts and person images on text-image matching, so the performance is somewhat limited. Compared with CLFT, which achieves the second-best performance, the performance of the proposed method can still surpass that achieved by CLFT without using a complex module similar to attention. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over the other methods. Results on the RSTPReid dataset: Because the RSTPReid dataset is only recently published, there are fewer comparable methods on this dataset. In this experiment, we use only the latest five methods, that are IMG-Net, AMEN, DSS[ref]43, SSAN4 and SUM, to compare the performance with the proposed method. As presented in Table II, the latest method SUM achieves the suboptimal performance, and the recognition accuracy on Rank-1, Rank-5 and Rank-10 reaches 41.38%, 67.48% and 76.48%, respectively. In contrast, the recognition performance of the proposed method is 45.55%, 70% and 80%, which exceeds the performance obtained by SUM. The above experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: on the CUHK-PEDES dataset and compare its performance with some state-of-the-art methods.
