      "content": "Paper Title: Morph-SSL: Self-Supervision with Longitudinal Morphing to Predict AMD Progression from OCT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-Supervised Learning: It offers a way to overcome the paucity of labelled datasets for supervised training. SSL learns feature representations from unlabelled data by training the network on a pretext task that does not need manual labels. The SSL-trained models can either be utilized for off-the-shelf feature extraction or to provide initial weights for fine-tuning on the desired downstream task with limited labelled training data. The recent SSL methods employ pretext tasks based on image reconstruction or Contrastive Learning (CL). The reconstruction based methods train networks to predict the original image from its distorted version and have been applied to X-ray, CT, MRI and ultrasound images ,[ref]4. The distortions involve transformations such as non-linear intensity mapping, local shuffling and in-painting in Model-Genesis and randomly swapping patches in the image [ref]4. CL has been applied to chest X-ray, dermatology [ref]5, histology , MRI  and ultrasound  images. CL trains networks using random batches comprising two data-augmented versions per image, called positive pairs. While positive pairs are pulled closer, the features of different images in the batch called negative pairs are pushed apart. However, the images in a negative pair can still be semantically similar (same pathology or disease stage), resulting in many False Negative pairs. Their impact can be reduced by training with large batch sizes (1024 for chest X-rays, 512 for dermatology images in [ref]5 and 128 for histology image patches in  ). Since large batch sizes do not scale well to 3D images due to limited GPU memory, existing methods learn features at a 2D, slice-level for 3D MRI volumes , or for individual frames in ultrasound videos  where neighboring slices/frames of the same 3D image are excluded from negative pairs. The recently proposed Non-Contrastive methods overcome the problem of False Negative pairs. They do not maximize the negative pair separation but only ensure that they do not collapse onto the same feature representation. VICReg  keeps the standard deviation of each feature dimension over a batch above a threshold. Barlow Twin  forces the cross-correlation between two batch of features extracted from the two images in each positive pair to be close to the identity matrix. BYOL prevents feature collapse using slightly different network weights to extract features for the two views in the positive pair, where the second network weight is computed as the moving average of the past weights. CL and Non-Contrastive SSL have been adapted for retinal OCT to learn features for 2D B-scans with training batch sizes of 128 in [ref]12 and 384 in . Another method learns features for central B-scans by predicting the time interval between two input scans from random visits of the same patient . In contrast, Morph-SSL with a novel image morphing based pre-text task can be trained with a batch size of 1 to reduce GPU memory usage, allowing us to learn feature representations for entire 3D OCT volumes instead of 2D B-scans. Time to Conversion Prediction:\nExisting methods either employ Color Fundus Photographs (CFP) or OCT imaging for TTC prediction. CFP is a 2D image of the retinal surface and lacks a cross-sectional view of the retina. A 9-grade AREDS disease severity scale  further stratifies the iAMD stage in CFPs, where each successive stage has been linked to an increased 5-year risk of conversion to advanced AMD (from 1%percent11\\% in grade 1 to about 50%percent5050\\% risk in grade 9). However, no such severity scale exists for the relatively new OCT imaging. Some CFP-based methods predict the AREDS severity scale , . Two-year conversion of nAMD was predicted with an ensemble of such predictions combined with features from drusen segmentation and demographic data . The CNN-LSTM based methods in ,  require images from multiple past visits, hence cannot be used for patients visiting for the first time. The input CFPs from visits at irregular intervals are handled by scaling the input image features with visit time intervals  or using a time-aware LSTM network. In , a Generative Adversarial Network was used to generate synthetic CFP images for future time-points. Combining CFP with genetic features can improve performance , but such information is not readily available in eye clinics. While CFP-based methods can predict long-term conversion, they are not sensitive to short-term conversion risks within 2 years, required for effective clinical intervention. Because CFPs lack a 3D view of the retina, they cannot capture subtle changes in retinal layers or extract accurate lesion volumes. Many OCT-based methods first extract a set of handcrafted quantitative biomarkers to capture the distribution, appearance and volume of lesions like drusen, HRF and retinal layers such as RPE and PR. These biomarkers combined with other demographic  or genetic data  is input to an LSTM , Cox proportional hazards model , or an L1-penalized Poisson model  to predict the TTC. The biomarkers are extracted with automated segmentation methods that are often inaccurate and require voxel-level labels to train. Moreover, handcrafted biomarkers may not adequately capture the subtle retinal changes related to disease progression. Another approach directly uses the OCT scans as input. To reduce the compute and GPU memory, most existing methods operate on individual B-scans with 2D CNNs. Some methods in , [ref]12 only use the central B-scan that passes through the macula, ignoring the remaining B-scans in the volume. While  employed this strategy for TTC prediction, [ref]12 used it on other tasks such as predicting age, sex and visual acuity from OCT. Alternatively, 2D CNNs can be applied independently to every B-scan in the volume. During inference, the predictions from each B-scan is pooled,\neither by taking the the average  or maximum  to obtain the volume-level prediction. During training, the same GT for the conversion time is used for every B-scan in the volume, even if only a few of them have the biomarkers indicative of progression risk, resulting in noisy training labels. In contrast to these methods, in this work we explore a full 3D approach by developing a compact 3D-CNN network to effectively capture the spatial information across the individual B-scans. Other than our work, the only other 3D-CNN method is found in , which employs two prediction networks to predict the conversion risk within six months, one using raw OCT volumes and the other using retinal layer and lesion segmentation maps.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: or Contrastive Learning (CL).
