      "content": "Paper Title: Visually Grounded VQA by Lattice-based Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVQA System Designs.\nThe modular system design that our system follows has been the foundation of numerous other VQA approaches. Various of these methods separate the reasoning process in a modular and explicit way by learning a program sequence that is subsequently executed on image features 4      . Our approach differs from these in particular in the choice of image representation: we operate on scene graphs and use symbolic features instead of (spatial) visual features.\nRecent approaches increasingly employ scene graphs as image representation due to their usefulness in compositional VQA problems 8     . Our system shares similarities with the neuro-symbolic methods 8,  and [ref]46 in particular, but is a fully modular system with inference path production and ranking capabilities (unlike 8, which is trained end-to-end and does not have an explicit mechanism to produce and rank inference paths) and operates on a probabilistic, symbolic scene graph representation as its knowledge base (unlike [ref]46, which uses a discrete structural scene representation, and , which uses region-based visual features). All of these systems (with exception of [ref]46, which queries a discrete, structured database for answers in an artificial, constricted scenario) have in common an answer production process that determines the output answer by means of a discriminative classifier, defined over a preset answer vocabulary. All mentioned systems are trained using an objective function that serves to directly improve answer performance. Finally, our system’s retrieval-based design resembles DFOL, a method described in , which proposes a formalism for (neuro-)symbolic reasoning in VQA. Our work distinguishes itself from DFOL in particular by 1) the introduced graph search concepts, 2) the more sophisticated Question Parser, and 3) our explicit conceptualization of VLR as a retrieval-based VQA system. Visual Grounding (VG) and Generalization in VQA.\nThe problem of Q/A-biased learning in VQA systems leading to (or resulting from) a disregard of the visual modality has been discussed in work such as  , leading to the introduction of datasets that aim to uncover such undesirable behavior by showing dramatic losses of accuracy performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios (for GQA:  0). Various approaches have since been proposed to strengthen a model’s (correctly grounded) reliance on the visual knowledge base (e.g.   0), thereby building on the motivation that improving VG in VQA will help improve a model’s performance in generalization/OOD scenarios. In this context, however,  showed that improvements to VG by mechanisms used in   could not be proven to have been the primary cause of accuracy improvements on OOD tests. More recently,  found that although their VG-related measurements on ID data were less predictive of OOD performance than ID accuracy, improving these VG-related metrics lead to accuracy improvements in both ID and (moreso) OOD tests. Accuracy boosts based on VG-related improvements were, however, tied to specific conditions, indicating that the accuracy-VG relationship is a complex one and still not fully understood. Various systems focus on improving VG performance in the context of the GQA dataset, which we use as reference points in our evaluations: The module-based approach PVR  improves VG by deriving explicit inference instructions (similar to our work’s Question Parser) and including additional supervision for strengthening correct grounding during training of their classifier. Similarly, MMN  also uses a Question Parser and employs a scored alignment between predicted object importance and annotated relevant objects in each inference step as additional learning signal. MAC-Caps  proposes to use visual capsule modules  for question-conditioned selection of detected image properties to improve VG performance. Lastly, we note that VG is also studied in non-VQA scenarios, e.g. in Referring Expressions research, where the goal is to locate textually described regions in the image, or generate them (see e.g. the popular RefCOCO datasets ). This localization task can be considered a sub-problem of VQA which differs in certain aspects: E.g., VQA requires inference to produce additional output after localization (=answers), questions often refer to non-existent regions (e.g. existence verification), and may not explicitly refer to any image region at all (weather, scene). Also, VG research in VQA is primarily concerned with a model’s inherent ability to rely on relevant regions during its inference and answering process.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: increasingly employ scene graphs as image representation due to their usefulness in compositional VQA problems 8     .
