      "content": "Paper Title: RP-SLAM: Real-time Photorealistic SLAM with Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3DGS has rapidly gained interest within the field of SLAM research due to its rapid rendering capabilities and explicit scene representation. MonoGS4 and SplaTAM represent foundational efforts in coupled GS-SLAM algorithms, pioneering an approach that jointly optimizes Gaussian primitives and camera poses through gradient backpropagation. The concept of sub-maps is introduced by Gaussian-SLAM[ref]36 as a means of mitigating the issue of catastrophic forgetting. LoopSplat builds upon the foundations of Gaussian-SLAM[ref]36 through the utilization of a Gaussian splatting-based loop closure strategy, thereby enhancing the accuracy of poses through the implementation of improved registration techniques. However, a significant obstacle with these methods is that the time-consuming process of estimating the camera pose for each frame using 3DGS places a considerable computational burden, which limits its ability to achieve real-time performance. In order to address this challenge, decoupled 3DGS-based SLAM approaches have been introduced. Splat-SLAM and IG-SLAM employ pre-trained dense bundle adjustment for the purpose of camera pose tracking, while simultaneously utilising proxy depth maps for optimizing map representation. RTG-SLAM integrates frame-to-model ICP for pose tracking and employ the opaque Gaussian primitives for depth rendering. GS-ICP-SLAM attains remarkable speeds by capitalising on the shared covariance between G-ICP and 3DGS. Photo-SLAM6 and CaRtGS0 deploy ORB-SLAM3 for tracking and incorporates a coarse-to-fine approach in map optimization, thereby enhancing system robustness and overall performance. For incremental mapping, these methods often rely on dense pixel sampling to initialize new Gaussian primitives, resulting in redundancy and high storage costs. To optimize scene representation, a common approach selects a fixed number of keyframes, merging them with the latest keyframe into a fixed keyframe window for map optimization. However, this strategy risks local minima and forgetting issues over iterations. In the monocular case, the lack of depth information complicates the accurate addition of new primitives. MonoGS4 initializes primitives using random depths without a geometric foundation, relying entirely on the mapping process for optimization, which hinders precise scene representation. Photo-SLAM6 and CaRtGS0 adopt the spatial gradient-based densification method from the original 3DGS to add primitives. However, the limited iterations fail to optimize these primitives, leading to artifacts caused by mismatches between the geometric and photometric properties of the Gaussian primitives.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: coupled GS-SLAM algorithms, pioneering an approach that jointly optimizes Gaussian primitives and camera poses through gradient backpropagation.
