      "content": "Paper Title: Being Properly Improper\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStudying data corruption in ML dates back to the 80s [53, Section 4]. Remarkably, the first twist models assumed very strong corruption, possibly coming from an adversary with unbounded computational resources, but the data at hand was binary. Thus, because the feature space was as ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù as the class space, the twist models lacked the unparalelled data complexity that we now face.\nObtaining such twist models at scale with real world data has been a major problem in ML over the past decade for a number of reasons, not all of which are borne out of bad intent.\nNevertheless, there have been several streams of recent research aimed at addressing specific twists. Label noise is a twist which has recently drawn much attention and garnered many corrective attempts¬†    1 .\nNotably,¬† theoretically study the presence of class conditional noise in binary classification.\nTheir approach consists of augmenting proper loss functions with re-weighting coefficients, which is strictly dependent on the class conditional noise percentages, and hence requires knowledge of the noise proportions.\nAs a byproduct of their analysis, they show that biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. Setting label noise aside, there exists a zoo of other twists and corrective attempts.\nFor instance, data augmentation techniques, with vicinal risk minimization standing as a pioneer¬†[ref]14, seek to induce general robustness¬†[ref]55.\nIn deep learning, adversarial robustness attempts to address the brittleness of neural networks to targeted adversarial noise¬†  .\nData poisoning twists in computer vision can be very sophisticated and require further investigation¬†.\nInvariant risk minimization aims at finding data representations yielding good classifiers but also invariant to ‚Äúenvironment changes‚Äù ¬†; relatedly, covariate shift seeks to address changes between train and test, stemming from non-stationarity or bias in the data¬†.\nA recent trend has also emerged with correcting losses due to model confidence issues¬†  . Viewed more broadly, the abovementioned papers study arguably much different problems, but they tend to have a theme that goes substantially deeper than the superficial observation that they assume twisted data in some way: the core loss function\nis usually a proper loss.\nTherefore, they tend to start from the premise of a loss that inevitably fits the (unwanted) twist, and correct it mostly with a regularizer informed with some prior knowledge of the twist, on a ‚Äútwist-by-twist‚Äù basis.\nThere has been some positive work in this ‚Äúloss + regularizer‚Äù direction¬† , but we note that this does not fully address the underlying issue of properness perilously shaping the learning algorithm towards the twisted posterior. Lastly, our generalization of properness with twist-properness is partly inspired by recent work by¬†,\nwhere they theoretically investigate the focal loss.\nNotably, they show that the focal loss is classification-calibrated, but not strictly proper.\nFrom their work, we also gather the implicit notion that hyperparameterized losses that generalize proper losses (e.g., focal loss or Œ±ùõº\\alpha-loss generalizing log\\log-loss), which may represent a next step for loss functions in ML, need to be carefully understood from the standpoint of what their hyperparameterization trades-off from properness.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Setting label noise aside, there exists a zoo of other twists and corrective attempts.\nFor instance, data augmentation techniques, with vicinal risk minimization standing as a pioneer¬†[ref]14, seek to induce general robustness¬†[ref]55.\nIn deep learning, adversarial robustness attempts to address the brittleness of neural networks to targeted adversarial noise¬†  .\nData poisoning\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
