      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolicy Regret. The incompatibility of the traditional regret with an adaptive adversary was first identified by Merhav et al. , who studied the full information feedback model. The notion of policy regret was formalized by the foundational work of Arora et al. . They provide an algorithm which efficiently minimizes constant action policy regret ℛ𝒳constpolsubscriptsuperscriptℛpolsubscript𝒳const\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{pol}}_{\\mathcal{X}_{\\text{const}}} against generic m𝑚m-memory bounded adversaries. It is unclear how to apply this algorithm to our setting, since our focus is on minimizing the CPR ℛTcpsubscriptsuperscriptℛcp𝑇\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{cp}}_{T}. Arora et al.  do also consider minimizing the policy regret ℛ𝒞Tpolsubscriptsuperscriptℛpolsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{pol}}_{\\mathcal{C}_{T}} when 𝒞T⊋𝒳constsubscript𝒳constsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{C}_{T}\\supsetneq\\mathcal{X}_{\\text{const}}. For instance, when 𝒞Tsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{C}_{T} is the set of all piecewise constant sequences with at most s𝑠s switches, they provide an algorithm whose policy regret satisfies ℛ𝒞Tpol≤𝒪~​(m​(K​s)1/3​T2/3)subscriptsuperscriptℛpolsubscript𝒞𝑇~𝒪𝑚superscript𝐾𝑠13superscript𝑇23\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{pol}}_{\\mathcal{C}_{T}}\\leq\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(m(Ks)^{1/3}T^{2/3}\\right). Our Counterexample 3 shows that this algorithm cannot minimize CPR in the tallying bandit setting, since the optimal policy in Counterexample 3 has Θ~​(T)~Θ𝑇\\widetilde{\\Theta}(T) switches. Cesa-Bianchi et al. , Dekel et al.  and Arora et al.  study the constant action policy regret, and do not discuss CPR. The results of Mohri and Yang [ref]37 can be extended to yield policy regret guarantees relative to rather large comparator classes, but do not provide CPR guarantees. \n Reinforcement Learning (RL). Minimizing CPR is equivalent to the performance metric used in RL, which is to maximize the total collected reward [ref]39. As we show (see Lemma 1), any tallying bandit problem can be cast as an RL problem. However, RL methods typically scale with the cardinality of the state space [ref]8  . Hence, applying off the shelf RL algorithms to solve tallying bandit problems would incur Ω~​(Km)~Ωsuperscript𝐾𝑚\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\left(K^{m}\\right) CPR. \n Restless & Rested Bandits. In restless bandits, the reward of an arm evolves according to a stochastic process, independently of the actions chosen by the player   . This is incompatible with tallying bandits. By contrast, tallying bandits is a special case of rested bandits, which is a general non-stationary MAB framework where an arm’s reward changes when it is pulled. Tekin and Liu  and Cortes et al.  both study rested bandits where an arm’s reward evolves according to a stochastic process, but both consider notions of regret that are significantly weaker than the CPR. A different variant of rested bandits is studied by Bouneffouf and Féraud , who assume that the dynamics of how the reward changes is known upto a constant factor, and hence their results are incomparable to ours. \n Recharging, Recovering, Blocking, Delay-Dependent & Last Switch Dependent Bandits. This line of work studies settings where an arm’s reward changes according to the number of timesteps that have passed since the arm was last pulled     . Such settings typically cannot be cleanly classified as either rested or restless bandits, but are related to both. The models in these works for how the reward evolves are different than our tallying structure, where the reward of an arm instead depends on the number of times that arm was played. \n Rotting Bandits. The rotting bandits setting     is a special case of our tallying bandit formulation, and merits close comparison to our work. This setting enforces m=T𝑚𝑇m=T, and an arm’s reward is assumed to be a decreasing function of the number of times that arm has been pulled. In our language, this means the {hx}x∈𝒳subscriptsubscriptℎ𝑥𝑥𝒳\\{h_{x}\\}_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} functions are increasing. This strong assumption enables these works to efficiently minimize CPR even though m=T𝑚𝑇m=T, although we note that algorithms for this setting cannot handle general m<T𝑚𝑇m<T. By contrast, in our setting we make no assumptions on the structure of the functions {hx}x∈𝒳subscriptsubscriptℎ𝑥𝑥𝒳\\{h_{x}\\}_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}, and assuming m<T𝑚𝑇m<T is necessary. Indeed, in our setting, when m𝑚m is Ω~​(T)~Ω𝑇\\widetilde{\\Omega}(T) then the result of Theorem 2 shows that any player suffers Ω~​(T)~Ω𝑇\\widetilde{\\Omega}(T) worst case CPR. \n Improving & Single Peaked Bandits. The improving bandit  and single peaked bandit  are both special cases of our tallying bandit setting, and deserve special attention. In improving bandits, the reward of an arm is an increasing, concave function of the number of times it has been pulled. The single peaked bandit generalizes this, so that the reward function of an arm is initially increasing and concave, but may become decreasing at some point. In our language, this means that the {hx}x∈𝒳subscriptsubscriptℎ𝑥𝑥𝒳\\{h_{x}\\}_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} functions are decreasing and convex, or decreasing and convex and then possibly increasing after some point. Both settings enforce m=T𝑚𝑇m=T, and algorithms for these settings do not handle general m<T𝑚𝑇m<T. By contrast, since we make no assumptions on the structure of the functions {hx}x∈𝒳subscriptsubscriptℎ𝑥𝑥𝒳\\{h_{x}\\}_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}, our Theorem 2 shows that when m𝑚m is Ω~​(T)~Ω𝑇\\widetilde{\\Omega}(T) then the worst case CPR scales as Ω~​(T)~Ω𝑇\\widetilde{\\Omega}(T). We remark that the CPR bounds in these works are asymptotic, whereas we provide non-asymptotic guarantees. We also remark that these works require the losses to be observed deterministically, and they only provide a heuristic to handle stochastic observations of the loss. \n Congested Bandits. In concurrent work, Awasthi et al.  introduced the congested bandit, which is a special case of the tallying bandit. Their formulation considers arbitrary m≤T𝑚𝑇m\\leq T, and the reward of an arm is a decreasing function of the number of times it has been pulled. Hence the congested bandit is the tallying bandit with the additional assumption that the {hx}x∈𝒳subscriptsubscriptℎ𝑥𝑥𝒳\\{h_{x}\\}_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} functions are increasing. This additional assumption enables them to provide an 𝒪~​(m​K​T)~𝒪𝑚𝐾𝑇\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\sqrt{mKT}\\right) CPR bound, although we note that their algorithm is computationally inefficient.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: has Θ~​(T)~Θ𝑇\\widetilde{\\Theta}(T) switches.
