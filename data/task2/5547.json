      "content": "Paper Title: Pseudo Contrastive Learning for Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPositive Pseudo Labeling. first proposes the idea of PPL which utilizes a trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by the confidence-based thresholding mechanism and then adds them to the training set. Then, several variants of PPL have been proposed and widely used in SSL field   . Considering the flexibility and effectiveness of PPL, some works [ref]15 [ref]16  [ref]18   attempt to adapt it to GNNs for more improvement in graph-based SSL. The major difference between these works is how to enhance the quality of positive pseudo-labels. [ref]15 absorbs PPL into graph-based SSL via combining co-/self-training strategies to find more training nodes in the unlabeled dataset. Similarly, [ref]16 introduces a self-checking mechanism via DeepCluster  to produce more confident pseudo-labels.  uses positive pseudo-labels as useful knowledge to teach each peer network and increase the training set. [ref]18 introduces Soft Label Confidence that computes personalized confidence values to label each unlabelled node. To reduce the redundant information carried by high-confidence nodes,  proposes an informativeness measurement to choose reliable nodes. Let 𝒗isubscript𝒗𝑖\\boldsymbol{v}_{i} denote node i𝑖i and pi​jsubscript𝑝𝑖𝑗p_{ij} denote the element of the prediction matrix P𝑃P. Generally, the positive pseudo-label yi+subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑖y^{+}_{i} for 𝒗isubscript𝒗𝑖\\boldsymbol{v}_{i} can be generated as: where γ+∈(0,1)superscript𝛾01\\gamma^{+}\\in(0,1) is a threshold and C𝐶C is the number of classes. yi+=0subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑖0y^{+}_{i}=0 indicates that 𝒗isubscript𝒗𝑖\\boldsymbol{v}_{i} does not have a positive pseudo-label. Negative Pseudo Labeling.\n combines PPL and NPL to select pseudo-labels according to their uncertainties. Then, the positive/negative pseudo-labels are used in classification objective/Negative Learning  to teach the model that 𝒗isubscript𝒗𝑖\\boldsymbol{v}_{i} does/does not belong to its positive/negative pseudo-labels. Let 𝒚i−=[yi​1−,…,yi​C−]⊆{0,1}Csuperscriptsubscript𝒚𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑖1…subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑖𝐶superscript01𝐶\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}^{-}=[y^{-}_{i1},...,y^{-}_{iC}]\\subseteq\\{0,1\\}^{C} be a multi-class binary vector indicating the selected negative pseudo label for 𝒗isubscript𝒗𝑖\\boldsymbol{v}_{i}. Then, the generation of 𝒚i−superscriptsubscript𝒚𝑖\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}^{-} for 𝒗isubscript𝒗𝑖\\boldsymbol{v}_{i} can be written as: where γ−∈(0,1)superscript𝛾01\\gamma^{-}\\in(0,1) and c𝑐c is a negative pseudo-label of 𝒗isubscript𝒗𝑖\\boldsymbol{v}_{i} when yi​c−=1subscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑖𝑐1y^{-}_{ic}=1.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: mechanism and then adds them to the training set.
