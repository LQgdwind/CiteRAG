      "content": "Paper Title: SuSketch: Surrogate Models of Gameplay as a Design Assistant\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMixed-initiative design tools are computer-aided design (CAD) software where both the human and the computer proactively make contributions to the problem solution . The computational initiative in CAD software has a rich history, dating back to the concept of human-computer symbiosis in the 1960s . Novick and Sutton [ref]6 treat mixed-initiative interaction as analogous to a conversation and identify components of initiative as: (a) task initiative (deciding the topic of the conversation), (b) speaker initiative (deciding when each actor can speak), and (c) outcome initiative (deciding how and when the discussion is resolved). A plethora of mixed-initiative tools have been introduced for engineering , art , and design . This section focuses on mixed-initiative tools in the field of game design, where domain-specific expert knowledge is integrated into the AI to support novices throughout the design process. Sentient Sketchbook [ref]4 supports the design of map sketches via a tile canvas interface, providing real-time evaluations of game level quality via heuristics and visual aids. The tool assists the level designer as it automatically tests maps for playability constraints, calculates and displays navigable paths, evaluates the map on gameplay properties and adds details to the coarse map sketch. Similar to SuSketch, Sentient Sketchbook uses a map recommendation system via computer-generated suggestions evolved from the users’ own creations. SuSketch extends the paradigm of Sentient Sketchbook by evaluating the level content through surrogate models of game simulations rather than static pathfiding. The same paradigm was taken to another direction by the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) , which allows the user to design a dungeon in a piece-meal fashion via a two-step process: at the macro-level where cell connectivity is determined and at the micro-level where the tiles of each cell are determined. EDD can indicate design patterns in work-in-progress levels, and provides suggestions based on symmetry, patterns or novelty. While Sentient Sketchbook and EDD use fitness functions primarily based on path distances to generate suggestions for a designer, playability can be tested in many different ways. Tanagra  provides platformer level suggestions in real-time which are guaranteed to be playable based on constraints on how high an avatar can jump. Tanagra uses constrained programming to achieve this, which is also used by Butler et al. to ensure playability of generated puzzles for the math game Refraction [ref]19. Refraction allows the designer to decide which operations are available to the player, and the generator ensures via constraints that any generated level can be solved with these operations. While puzzle games or top-down strategy levels can sufficiently be tested for playability in a static fashion from the initial game-state, other genres such as physics games require actual playthroughs. In this vein, Ropossum  allows designers to test their Cut The Rope (Chillingo, 2010) levels by playing them on their own or via an AI agent. Although computationally expensive, such AI playtests offer an animation of how the level is solved but also show which actions are required. Ropossum can provide playable suggestions by modifying some of the elements in the level, although the time needed to compute these makes it unwieldy as a design tool. SuSketch attempts to minimize this feedback delay by replacing simulations with a surrogate model that predicts the simulation’s outcomes. Finally, it is worth noting that not all mixed-initiative tools pertain to level design. For instance, Mek allows designers to define a set of spatial interaction rules by directly “painting” the rules’ effects . Machado et al.  introduced a mechanics recommendation system based on similarity to existing games in the corpus of GVGAI  games. The mechanics recommender was integrated into Cicero  which allowed users to design levels and mechanics, providing extensive visualizations and analytics. Since the games produced in Cicero are still in the GVGAI framework, the tool allows designers to pick any of the AI agents available and simulate the game, providing visualizations of e.g. the trajectories of enemies, events that occurred, and a frame-by-frame replay of the game. The mechanics recommender was extended in Pitako , which recommends mechanics and dynamics to the user on the game they are making. Through a confidence score, designers can apply suggestions that offer common mechanics for their game, or explore and try different possibilities. SuSketch follows a similar multi-facet recommendation system, orchestrating the level design and rule design facet  by providing suggestions on finding the most balanced powerup placement as well as class matchup.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: make contributions to the problem solution .
