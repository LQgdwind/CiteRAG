This work is done when N.

A multi-source status update system consists of a monitor which receives status updates from multiple sources through a shared communications channel . A common metric for quantifying timeliness in status update systems is the time average of the age of information (AoI) process, which we term as the mean AoI or average AoI , maintained at a certain device in the network, such as an intermediate node, a server, or the eventual destination, i.e., the monitor. In particular, the AoI process for source-nùëõn denoted by Œîn‚Äã(t)subscriptŒîùëõùë°\\Delta_{n}(t), t‚â•0ùë°0t\\geq 0, is defined as Œîn‚Äã(t)=t‚àígn‚Äã(t)subscriptŒîùëõùë°ùë°subscriptùëîùëõùë°\\Delta_{n}(t)=t-g_{n}(t), where gn‚Äã(t)subscriptùëîùëõùë°g_{n}(t) is the time of generation of the freshest update of source-nùëõn available at time tùë°t to the particular device of interest   . In this multi-source setting, status updates of some sources may be more critical than others, and therefore, weighted average of mean AoI values of the sources, termed weighted AoI, is often used as a system-wide metric for quantifying the timeliness of communication. To minimize the weighted AoI, source transmissions need to be scheduled appropriately. On the other hand, massive internet of things (IoT) networks are becoming commonplace that consist of a very large number of low cost and low power end users that report low frequency status updates to remote locations via 6G networks  or low power wide area networks (LPWAN) such as LoRaWAN 0. Development of scalable schedulers to be deployed in massive scale networks for weighted AoI minimization is the main scope of this paper. The first representative scenario (called Scenario A) for a massive IoT network we consider in this paper is an error-prone cellular wireless network with a server or a base station (BS) collecting time-sensitive information from a large number of users that are spread out at random locations in the wireless network. Each user is associated with an information source process, whose sample values are to be transmitted to the server, which is in charge of forwarding these messages to a remote monitor, which may or may not be co-located with the server. Consequently, the terms ‚Äúuser‚Äù and ‚Äúsource‚Äù will be used interchangeably throughout the paper. In case of co-location, which is the scope of the current paper, AoI processes at both the server and the monitor are identical. However, these AoI processes may very well be different in the case of remotely located monitors, a situation which is left outside the scope of the current paper. Similar uplink scenarios are investigated in 1 2 3, where the status update messages are generated according to a random process, or periodically. In this paper, we consider the generate-at-will (GAW) model introduced in 4 which is a pull-based model where the server is to decide which source to collect the time-sensitive information from. Once the decision is made by the server, polling multiple access will be used by which the server sends a polling message (query) to the scheduled user which subsequently samples the corresponding scheduled source process, generates a status update packet, and transmits to the server in the uplink direction, while avoiding collisions. Although random access is generally used for channel access technology for timely status updates 5 6 7 3, we propose to use polling multiple access as in 1 in order to prevent collisions that would stem from the cardinality of the number of sources attempting to transmit at the same time. Moreover, the polling message can be sent in the form of a wake-up radio signal upon reception of which the scheduled user wakes up and carries out the sampling and transmission operations before going back to sleep 8 9  . This prevents the unscheduled sources from wasting unnecessary energy, making it suitable for low power users in massive IoT networks. Fig.¬†1 illustrates Scenario A with NùëÅN sources. The users may use different modulation and coding schemes depending on their distance from the BS, and therefore, have heterogeneous packet service time (transmission time) requirements characterized with their first two moments. Moreover, packet drops are assumed to occur with different packet error rates for each user-to-server transmissions, and these statistics are a-priori known by the server. The second application scenario (Scenario B) also worth of investigation is the wireless downlink scenario where a base station sends time-sensitive information to a number of users through unreliable channels in a wireless broadcast network  and we are interested in minimizing the weighted AoI maintained at the users. Wake-up radio can also accompany the system model of  for energy efficiency purposes. In contrast to the first scenario, it is always the server which is sending time-sensitive information on the downlink and the feedback channel from the users back to the server may not exist. Therefore, maintaining a replica of the AoI processes at the server side may not even be possible, which presents another justification for the deployment of age-agnostic scheduling schemes. Both scenarios A and B can be addressed with the proposed methods of the current paper. Two main approaches stand out in the literature for scheduling in multi-source status update systems. In age-aware scheduling, there are schedulers that make use of the framework of Markov decision processes (MDP) and dynamic programming (DP) with proven optimality  2 . However, computing the optimal policy using DP becomes prohibitive for large values of NùëÅN since the state-space of the MDP grows exponentially with NùëÅN. Hence, curse of dimensionality inherent to MDP models  hinders one from developing schedulers for massive connectivity scenarios. The alternative age-aware approach is the sub-optimal index-based scheduling such as the ones proposed in   , for which the scheduling policy is relatively easier to develop off-line. However, their runtime implementation still requires the server to continuously keep track of the AoI of the sources, and O‚Äã(N)ùëÇùëÅO(N) computational complexity to choose the source with the highest index. Although far lower than the complexity of DP counterparts, the runtime computational burden of such algorithms is one of the limitations of age-aware schemes for massive IoT networks. Moreover, age-aware schemes fail to extend to scenarios in which the server cannot always perfectly maintain a replica of the actual AoI. This may happen since in the first scenario, monitors may be located away from the server introducing additional delays and losses in the forward and reverse channels from the server to monitors, and in the second scenario, ACK/NACK messages may not be sent from the users back to the server. In the alternative age-agnostic schemes, and in particular cyclic scheduling  [ref]29, the server does not need to keep track of the ages of the individual sources while making scheduling decisions. Instead, the server develops a cyclic schedule, i.e., a fixed pattern of user transmissions which repeats itself, with an off-line algorithm using a-priori known statistical information. Once the schedule is developed, its runtime complexity is O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) which makes it an exceptionally suitable scheme for massive IoT networks. The main scope of this paper is the off-line development of low complexity cyclic schedules for weighted AoI minimization that can scale to very large number of users encountered in massive IoT settings. In this work, we extend our previous work on cyclic scheduling [ref]29 in three directions: First, we provide an analytical method to compute the weighted AoI in the same setting as in [ref]29 but also taking into consideration the case of heterogeneous packet errors, whereas no packet errors were assumed in [ref]29. Second, [ref]29 shows in the absence of packet errors and for the specific case of two sources that, the optimal cyclic scheduler is of the form (1,Œò)1Œò(1,\\Theta), which represents a cyclic schedule where one scheduling instance of one of the sources is followed by ŒòŒò\\Theta scheduling instances of the other source. In this paper, we show that for two heterogeneous sources and in the presence of packet errors, a near-optimal cyclic scheduler is in the form of a mixture of (1,Œò)1Œò(1,\\Theta) and (1,Œò+1)1Œò1(1,\\Theta+1) cyclic schedulers, and we provide a novel algorithm for its construction. Although the N=2ùëÅ2N=2 case is definitely not a large-scale scenario, having the optimum solution in hand for this special case enables us to compare various heuristic approaches against the optimum solution. Third, [ref]29 proposes the IS (insertion search) heuristic algorithm for N>2ùëÅ2N>2 but its computational complexity exceeding O‚Äã(N5)ùëÇsuperscriptùëÅ5O(N^{5}) makes it unfit for massive connectivity scenarios. In the current paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm which is entirely different than IS and which can scale to massive IoT scenarios. A preliminary version of the current paper can be found in 0. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We provide two novel analytical frameworks, MC-based and MGF-based, for the weighted AoI computation of a given cyclic schedule, both of which are substantially different than the method described in [ref]29, since the behavior of the constructed cyclic schedule will no longer be cyclic due to packet drops. MC-based and MGF-based approaches both have their own merits which will become apparent in Section¬†5. For the special case of N=2ùëÅ2N=2, we prove that given any œµ>0italic-œµ0\\epsilon>0, our algorithm constructs a cyclic scheduler whose weighted AoI is within œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon of the actual optimum. Therefore, we establish a lower bound for the weighted AoI for the N=2ùëÅ2N=2 case, which can be used as a baseline for comparative evaluation of age-agnostic algorithms in this special case. We propose algorithms for the construction of a cyclic schedule appropriate for massive IoT scenarios with the goal of weighted AoI minimization, which are based on convex optimization and well-established packet spreading algorithms. We show through numerical results and simulations that our algorithms outperform existing age-agnostic multi-source schedulers in systems involving very large numbers of users, in terms of weighted AoI minimization. Moreover, their relatively low off-line complexity as well as O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1) runtime complexity makes them a good fit for massive connectivity scenarios. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section¬†2 overviews the related work. Section¬†3 presents the system model. Section¬†4 develops the analytical method to obtain the weighted AoI when cyclic scheduling is employed. Section¬†5 derives the optimum cyclic scheduler in closed form for the case of two sources. Section¬†6 presents the proposed scalable scheduling algorithm for general number of sources. Section¬†7 describes the existing baseline age-agnostic schemes along with the modifications we have introduced in this work. Section¬†8 presents extensive numerical results. Section¬†9 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Need for timely status updates arises naturally in many remote monitoring and networked control systems  [ref]2 .
