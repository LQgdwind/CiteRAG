      "content": "Paper Title: Don’t Watch Me: A Spatio-Temporal Trojan Attack on Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Augment Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutonomous driving (AD) is a long-researched area and a number of novel motion planning algorithms for AD have been proposed. Nevertheless, AD remains a major challenge. Traditional motion planning algorithms concentrate on the rule- or optimization-based methods  . However, these rules or models are designed manually with potentially inaccurate assumptions and thus, cannot scale to different real and complex scenarios, e.g., overtaking, roundabouts, interactions, and merging. This drawback has prompted communities to turn to learning-based approaches, which bear the promise of leveraging data to automatically learn complex driving policies. Among these approaches, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), embracing the perception capability of the deep neural network (DNN) and the decision-making capability of reinforcement learning (RL), has been widely investigated for AD tasks [ref]3 . DRL has been successfully used to address many sequential decision-making issues    [ref]3. Given different requirements of driving (e.g., speed, safety, and comfort), an DRL-augment AD system takes behaviors of the autonomous vehicle (AV) and surrounding human driving vehicles (HDVs) and the knowledge about road networks as input, and outputs vehicle control commands, e.g., steering, torque, and brake. The success of DRL depends on a large amount of training data and computing resources. However, the cost of human driving data collection at a large scale can be prohibitive. This dilemma can lead to the fact that, the DRL model is still not only prone to unexpected behavior in out-of-sample scenarios  , but also may be injected with malicious backdoors (also called “neural Trojan”, or “Trojan attack”) 0 1. In this paper, we focus on the backdoor threat to DRL-augment AD through manipulating its training stage. Many existing neural Trojans can be injected into AV’s capacities of vision perception 0 2, e.g., image classification, object recognition and tracking. A backdoored DNN model behaves normally on benign samples, but can produce malicious results once an attacker-specified trigger is presented in the input (images or other sensor data). Unlike these supervised learning, DRL is required to address sequential decision-making problems according to long-term rewards instead of supervision on immediate rewards. Backdoors on DRL are more challenging since the backdoored agent needs to disrupt the sequential decisions rather than isolated decision while maintaining good performance in absence of backdoor triggers 3. Hence, until now, there are still a few of related works. Kiourti et al.3 use image patterns as the backdoor trigger and manipulate the corresponding action and reward when the trigger is present. Ashcraft et al.4 studied a DRL backdoor that uses the action trajectory presented in the image observation as the trigger. 1 is the only work that studied backdoors to DRL-based AD, in which, the authors used the combinations of vehicles’ speeds and positions as the trigger and studied congestion and insurance attacks in the circuit scenario. These backdoor triggers are useful for DRL-based AD and motivate us to investigate stealthier and more practice backdoors that can be easy to be activated by real-world attackers. The DRL agent learns its optimal policy through interaction with the environment. Most DRL methods assumes that the state of the environment is fully observable for the agent. However, due to occlusions and noisy sensors of AV, the DRL agent can only glimpse a part of the system state. A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) 5 can better capture the dynamics of the AD environment, but finding an optimal policy for POMDP is notoriously difficult 6 7. A popular solution is to aggregate histories of observations over time by integrating a recurrent neural network (RNN) 6 or a generative model 7 to find hidden states for optimal policy generation. The partial observability can make better hackers 8 and hence, motivate us that hiding a backdoor trigger in unobservable states can be stealthier. In this paper, we aim to hide backdoor triggers into spatio-temporal traffic features which are the key factor to ensure the performance of AD 9. First, based on the gate recurrent unit (GRU) and attention mechanism, we design a spatio-temporal DNN model for DRL to capture spatio-temporal features from observations. Through our extensive evaluations, we can find that these features can significantly improve the efficiency and safety of DRL algorithms for different AD tasks. Then, we study the security of these features by designing a novel backdoor trigger in the form of the temporal and spatial relevance of a sequence of states, rather than in a single observation used in existing neural backdoors, and proposing a spatio-temporal-pattern stealthy Trojan attack on DRL-augment AD systems. With this backdoor, the attacker can drive a vehicle in the AV’s visual range, and control the spatial and temporal dependencies between the AV and her vehicle via specific driving behaviors in a short period (i.e., the spatio-temporal-pattern trigger) to activate the backdoor. After the trigger is present, the AV will be controlled by backdoor neurons which uses malicious rewards to generate actions. To ensure a stealthy attack, we keep the value of malicious rewards similar to the one of original genuine rewards. Compared to existing works 3 4 1, hiding backdoor triggers into spatio-temporal dependencies further ensures its stealthy, and using temporal driving behaviors ensures the practicality of attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores backdoor attacks to DRL both in the space and time domain. To evaluate our backdoor attacks, we compare our DRL algorithms with state-of-the-art (SOTA) DRL algorithms proposed for AD tasks. We evaluate their performance in several both clean and poisoned (with different triggers) driving scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance variance rate (PVR) of backdoored models is not more than 3.1%, and the attack success rate (ASR) is more than 98.5%, respectively. Besides, our experiments demonstrate that SOTA defense mechanisms for DNN Trojans fail to detect our backdoor. We summarize our contributions as follows: A spatio-temporal DRL algorithm using RNN and the attention mechanism for AD tasks; A stealthy Trojan attack on DRL algorithms using spatial and temporal features of vehicle driving; Extensive experiments with three different driving scenarios to evaluate the performance of clean and backdoored DRL models. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss the related work in §§\\SII. §§\\SIII provides the detailed design of our DRL algorithm for AD tasks. We then present our proposed backdoor attacks in §§\\SIV. §§\\SV describes the experimental design and the performance evaluation results, and provides analytical insights. Lastly, we conclude the paper and outline our future work in §§\\SVI.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: learning (DRL), embracing the perception capability of the deep neural network (DNN) and the decision-making capability of reinforcement learning (RL), has been widely investigated for AD tasks [ref]3 .
