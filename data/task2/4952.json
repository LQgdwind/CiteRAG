      "content": "Paper Title: RulE: Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Rule Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets \nWe choose six datasets for evaluation: FB15k-237 , WN18RR , YAGO3-10 , UMLS, Kinship, and Family . For Kinship and UMLS, we follow the data split from RNNLogic [ref]14, and for Family, we follow the split used by DRUM [ref]13. The logical rules used in the experiments are mined from RNNLogic. We consider chain rules, covering common logical rules in KG such as symmetry, composition, hierarchy rules, etc. More details of dataset statistics are summarized in Appendix H. Baselines \nWe compare with a comprehensive suite of embedding and rule-based baselines. (1) Embedding-based models: we include TransE [ref]7,\nDisMult , ComplEx , ConvE , TuckER  and RotatE .\n(2) Rule-based models: we compare with MLN , PathRank , as well as popular rule learning methods Neural-LP , DRUM [ref]13, RNNLogic+ (w/o emb.) [ref]14 and NCRL .\n(3) Joint KGE and logical rules: we also compare with baselines that ensemble embedding-based and rule-based method, including RNNLogic+ (with emb.) [ref]14 and Naive Combination . See more introduction to RNNLogic+ in Appendix B.\n(4) For our RulE, we present results of embedding-based, rule-based and integrated reasoning. The first variant only uses KGE scores obtained from joint entity/relation/rule embedding to reason unknown triplets, denoted by RulE (emb.). The second variant only uses the grounding score calculated from soft rule reasoning, denoted by RulE (rule.). The last one is the full model combining both, denoted by RulE (emb & rule.). Furthermore, to sufficiently verify the effect of rule embedding on different KGE models, we also experiment with a variant of RulE (emb.) using TransE [ref]7 as the KGE model, denoted by emb with TransE.. We conduct additional experiments on more datasets to compare RulE with the graph-based method NBFNet  (see Appendix I.4).\nConsidering the relation order of logical rules, we also design another variant of RulE using position-aware sum (see Appendix E). Evaluation protocols \nWe follow the setting in Qu et al. [ref]14 and evaluate models by Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) as well as Hits at N (H@N).\nFor above baselines, we carefully tune the parameters and achieve better results than reported in Qu et al. [ref]14. To ensure a fair comparison, in the KGE part of RulE, we use the same parameters as those used in TransE and RotatE without further tuning them and rerun RNNLogic+ with the same logical rules as RulE (See Appendix H.3 for details). Hyperparameter settings \nBy default, we use RotatE  as our KGE model. We search for hyper-parameters according to validation set performance.\nThe ranges of the hyperparameters in the grid search and final adopted values are provided in Appendix H.4.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Datasets \nWe choose six datasets for evaluation: FB15k-237 , WN18RR , YAGO3-10 , UMLS, Kinship, and Family . For Kinship and UMLS, we follow the data split from RNNLogic [ref]14, and for Family, we follow the split used by DRUM [ref]13. The logical rules used in the experiments are mined from RNNLogic.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
