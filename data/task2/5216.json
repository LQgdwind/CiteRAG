      "content": "Paper Title: Objects as Spatio-Temporal 2.5D points\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEach detected object b𝑏b is represented as b={C,△C,w,l,d,m}𝑏𝐶△𝐶𝑤𝑙𝑑𝑚b=\\{C,\\bigtriangleup C,w,l,d,m\\} where w∈[ref]0 [ref]1𝑤01w\\in[ref]0 [ref]1 and l𝑙l are confidence of the detection and an unique label associated with each detected object, m𝑚m is the object class, and d𝑑d is the distance between the camera center and the closest 3D object point (obtained from depth prediction network). Given a pair of images Itsuperscript𝐼𝑡I^{t} & It−1superscript𝐼𝑡1I^{t-1}, the goal is to uniquely identify each object with a label and track them across frames. For that purpose, we follow a tracking conditioned on detection based method used in [ref]47. In order to perform tracking and detection jointly, we restructure the inputs and outputs of the network detailed under Section 3.1. The network takes as input, the previous frame along with the current frame, and in addition the tracklets of the previous frame. Like [ref]47, the network also takes prior object detections {Y^t−1,Y^t−2,…​Y^0}subscript^𝑌𝑡1subscript^𝑌𝑡2…subscript^𝑌0\\{\\hat{Y}_{t-1},\\hat{Y}_{t-2},...\\hat{Y}_{0}\\}, but, unlike [ref]47 where the tracklets are 2D Gaussians constructed based on the object center and bounding box sizes, in our method, we model each object entirely in 3D. We model the distributions of each object in the tracklets in 3D, and for that purpose, in addition to using the 2D centers and 2D offsets alone (as in [ref]47), we also use the regressed depth maps to model the points in 3D. Feeding the previous frame as input along with the current allows the network to learn to model objects that appear or disappear due to change of scene or occlusion. We train the network to predict 3D displacements to compute object associations in 3D.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: Each detected object b𝑏b is represented as b={C,△C,w,l,d,m}𝑏𝐶△𝐶𝑤𝑙𝑑𝑚b=\\{C,\\bigtriangleup C,w,l,d,m\\} where w∈[ref]0 [ref]1𝑤01w\\in[ref]0 [ref]1 and l𝑙l are confidence of the detection and an unique label associated with each detected object, m𝑚m is the object class, and d𝑑d is the distance between the camera\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
