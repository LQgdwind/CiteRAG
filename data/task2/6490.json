      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion-Jump GNNs: Homophiliation via Learnable Metric Filters\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion-Jump GNNs are neural networks fΘ​(𝐀,𝐗,ℓ​(B))subscript𝑓Θ𝐀𝐗ℓ𝐵f_{\\Theta}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{X},\\ell(B)) resulting from the optimization problem stated in Eq. 3.\nThe interplay between the Dirichlet loss and the classification loss is described above. In this Section, we give some technical details about the architecture of the network. Diffusion pump. The pump is responsible for generating and updating the matrix of pairwise diffusion distances 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D}. For the generation, we solve any of the following equivalent problems: both s.t. 𝐔T​𝐔=𝐈superscript𝐔𝑇𝐔𝐈\\mathbf{U}^{T}\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{I}, where 𝐔n×p=fθ​(𝐀)subscript𝐔𝑛𝑝subscript𝑓𝜃𝐀\\mathbf{U}_{n\\times p}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{A}), n=|V|𝑛𝑉n=|V|. Since 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} is the diagonal degree matrix, we have △:=𝐃−𝐀\\triangle\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{A}.\nAs a result, the Min problem approximates the p𝑝p smallest nontrivial eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian △~:=𝐃−1/2△𝐃−1/2=𝐈−𝐀~\\tilde{\\triangle}\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}\\triangle\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}=\\mathbf{I}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}}, where 𝐀~:=𝐃−1/2𝐀𝐃−1/2\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}}\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2} is the normalized adjacency. Equivalently, the Max problem approximates the p𝑝p largest nontrivial\neigenvectors of the transition matrix 𝐏:=𝐃−1𝐀\\mathbf{P}\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\mathbf{D}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}. Note that 𝐀~~𝐀\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} and 𝐏~~𝐏\\tilde{\\mathbf{P}} have the same eigenvectors and also that if λ𝜆\\lambda is an eigenvalue of 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} then 1−λ1𝜆1-\\lambda an eigenvalue for △~~△\\tilde{\\triangle}. Note also, that we use \"approximates\" instead of \"finds\". This is due to the limitations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) when solving the Trace-Ratio problems [ref]28 in Eq. 3. In this regard, we have the following results with practical implications: The SGD solution of the Trace-Ratio Min problem in Eq. 3 can be posed in terms of Min​Tr​[𝐔T​(△−ρ​𝐃)​𝐔]MinTrdelimited-[]superscript𝐔𝑇△𝜌𝐃𝐔\\text{Min}\\;\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{U}^{T}(\\triangle-\\rho\\mathbf{D})\\mathbf{U}] under orthonormality constraints. This leads to △​𝐔=ρ∗​𝐃𝐔△𝐔superscript𝜌∗𝐃𝐔\\triangle\\mathbf{U}=\\rho^{\\ast}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{U}, i.e. to the orthogonal eigenfunctions of the normalized Laplacian △~~△\\tilde{\\triangle} associated with ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast}. However, ρ∗superscript𝜌∗\\rho^{\\ast} is not necessarily an eigenvalue of △~~△\\tilde{\\triangle}, but an approximation of the Fiedler value λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2}: ∃ϵ>0:|λ2−ρ∗|<ϵ:italic-ϵ0subscript𝜆2superscript𝜌∗italic-ϵ\\exists\\;\\epsilon>0\\;:|\\lambda_{2}-\\rho^{\\ast}|<\\epsilon. As a result, the p𝑝p columns 𝐮isubscript𝐮𝑖\\mathbf{u}_{i} of 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} satisfy: ∃δ>0:‖ϕ2−𝐮i‖<δ:𝛿0normsubscriptitalic-ϕ2subscript𝐮𝑖𝛿\\exists\\;\\delta>0\\;:\\|\\phi_{2}-\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\|<\\delta, where ϕ2subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\phi_{2} denotes the Fiedler vector. Then, we obtain what we call a Fiedler environment. The norm of ∇𝐔i​j:=𝐔i:−𝐔j:\\nabla\\mathbf{U}_{ij}\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\mathbf{U}_{i:}-\\mathbf{U}_{j:} (row-difference) is proportional to the approximate commute time between nodes i𝑖i and j𝑗j, which is d​(i,j)t→∞𝑑superscript𝑖𝑗→𝑡d(i,j)^{t\\rightarrow\\infty}, where d(i,j):=∥∇𝐔i​j∥d(i,j)\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\|\\nabla\\mathbf{U}_{ij}\\|. Therefore, the matrix 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D} relies on Euclidean distances. We proof both results in Appendix A: Formal Results with Practical Implications. We also give there practical evidence of the need of solving Trace-Ratio problems in an SGD context, instead of solving the original Trace problem in Eq. 3. We also justify the convenience of conditioning 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} to 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, 𝐔=fθ​(𝐀)𝐔subscript𝑓𝜃𝐀\\mathbf{U}=f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{A}). Actually, this setting is inspired in how the LINKX method [ref]29 exploits the graph topology. Jumps and Filters. The bank of learnable structural filters {𝐉0,𝐉1,…,𝐉K}superscript𝐉0superscript𝐉1…superscript𝐉𝐾\\{\\mathbf{J}^{0},\\mathbf{J}^{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{J}^{K}\\} is the core of the high-order exploration. Each filter 𝐉ksuperscript𝐉𝑘\\mathbf{J}^{k} has a support\nEk={(ik,jk)∈V×V:ik,jk∈Jk}subscript𝐸𝑘conditional-setsubscript𝑖𝑘subscript𝑗𝑘𝑉𝑉subscript𝑖𝑘subscript𝑗𝑘superscript𝐽𝑘E_{k}=\\{(i_{k},j_{k})\\in V\\times V:i_{k},j_{k}\\in J^{k}\\} with the pairs of nodes (edges of the filter) belonging to the jump Jksuperscript𝐽𝑘J^{k}. In Eq. 3, this is implicitly defined with the expression 𝐉k=Πk⋅exp⁡(−𝒟)superscript𝐉𝑘⋅superscriptΠ𝑘𝒟\\mathbf{J}^{k}=\\Pi^{k}\\cdot\\exp\\left(-{\\cal D}\\right), where ΠksuperscriptΠ𝑘\\Pi^{k} is a {0,1}n×nsuperscript01𝑛𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n\\times n} projection matrix defined, for k>0𝑘0k>0, as follows: with Π0=𝐈superscriptΠ0𝐈\\Pi^{0}=\\mathbf{I} and top​k−1​(i)={d​(i,j1),…,d​(i,jk)}topsuperscript𝑘1𝑖𝑑𝑖subscript𝑗1…𝑑𝑖subscript𝑗𝑘\\text{top}k^{-1}(i)=\\{d(i,j_{1}),\\ldots,d(i,j_{k})\\}, where d​(i,jl)≤d​(i,jl+1)𝑑𝑖subscript𝑗𝑙𝑑𝑖subscript𝑗𝑙1d(i,j_{l})\\leq d(i,j_{l+1}) for jl,jl+1∈Vsubscript𝑗𝑙subscript𝑗𝑙1𝑉j_{l},j_{l+1}\\in V and l=1,2,…,k−1𝑙12…𝑘1l=1,2,\\ldots,k-1.\nThen, Idx​[top​k−1​(i)]Idxdelimited-[]topsuperscript𝑘1𝑖\\text{Idx}[\\text{top}k^{-1}(i)] are the sorted positions of the distances wrt the node i𝑖i, i.e. the distance ranks. In this way, the product 𝐉k=Πk⋅exp⁡(−𝒟)superscript𝐉𝑘⋅superscriptΠ𝑘𝒟\\mathbf{J}^{k}=\\Pi^{k}\\cdot\\exp\\left(-{\\cal D}\\right) is derivable wrt 𝒟𝒟{\\cal D} as in . Alternatively, we could also rely on the topK network . Individual GNNs. Each structural filter 𝐉ksuperscript𝐉𝑘\\mathbf{J}^{k} feeds a vanilla GNN which obtains a partial embedding 𝐇k=σ​(𝐉k​𝐗𝐖k)superscript𝐇𝑘𝜎superscript𝐉𝑘superscript𝐗𝐖𝑘\\mathbf{H}^{k}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{J}^{k}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}^{k}). The GNN also receives the n×F𝑛𝐹n\\times F matrix of node features 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, and 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} denotes the transpose of the i−limit-from𝑖i-th row of 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}. Since 𝐉k=Πk⋅exp⁡(−𝒟)superscript𝐉𝑘⋅superscriptΠ𝑘𝒟\\mathbf{J}^{k}=\\Pi^{k}\\cdot\\exp\\left(-{\\cal D}\\right), then, for a given node i𝑖i, its aggregation is given by 𝐱i=∑je−d​(i,j)​𝐱jsubscript𝐱𝑖subscript𝑗superscript𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑗subscript𝐱𝑗\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\sum_{j}e^{-d(i,j)}\\mathbf{x}_{j} instead of being 𝐱i=𝐏k​𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖superscript𝐏𝑘subscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\mathbf{P}^{k}\\mathbf{x}_{i} as in MixHop [ref]15 or 𝐱i=(∑kβk​𝐏k)​𝐱jsubscript𝐱𝑖subscript𝑘subscript𝛽𝑘superscript𝐏𝑘subscript𝐱𝑗\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\left(\\sum_{k}\\beta_{k}\\mathbf{P}^{k}\\right)\\mathbf{x}_{j} as in Simple Graph Convolution (SGG) . As the asymptotic diffusion distances are approximations of commute times (Theorem 4.1), our aggregation works as a kernel depending on learnable Euclidean distances. Combining GNNs. Each partial embedding 𝐇k=σ​(𝐉k​𝐗𝐖k)superscript𝐇𝑘𝜎superscript𝐉𝑘superscript𝐗𝐖𝑘\\mathbf{H}^{k}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{J}^{k}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}^{k}) is weighted by a learnable parameter αksubscript𝛼𝑘\\alpha_{k}, where all the αksubscript𝛼𝑘\\alpha_{k} form a convex combination. Then, we concatenate all the weighted embeddings to form the global embedding 𝐇:=∥k=1Kαk𝐇k=∥k=1Kαkσ(𝐉k𝐗𝐖k)\\mathbf{H}\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}={\\|}_{k=1}^{K}\\alpha_{k}\\mathbf{H}^{k}={\\|}_{k=1}^{K}\\alpha_{k}\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{J}^{k}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}^{k}\\right). Since 𝐇𝐇\\mathbf{H} feeds an MLP in order to minimize the classification loss ℒcsubscriptℒ𝑐{\\cal L}_{c} as in MixHop, the global embedding tends to retain the best partial embeddings for each node. Homophilic Branch. One limitation of our method is that setting a small value for the hyperparameter K𝐾K is not enough to deal with homophilic graphs. For this reason, we have added an extra GNN (the homophilic branch) that works as follows: 𝐇H​B=σ​(𝐀𝐗𝐖H​B)superscript𝐇𝐻𝐵𝜎superscript𝐀𝐗𝐖𝐻𝐵\\mathbf{H}^{HB}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}^{HB}). Therefore we concatenate 𝐇:=𝐇|αH​B𝐇H​B\\mathbf{H}\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\mathbf{H}|\\alpha_{HB}\\mathbf{H}^{HB}, where ∑k=0Kαk+αH​B=1superscriptsubscript𝑘0𝐾subscript𝛼𝑘subscript𝛼𝐻𝐵1\\sum_{k=0}^{K}\\alpha_{k}+\\alpha_{HB}=1.

Note also, that we use \"approximates\" instead of \"finds\". This is due to the limitations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) when solving the Trace-Ratio problems [ref]28 in Eq. 3. In this regard, we have the following results with practical implications: The SGD solution of the Trace-Ratio Min problem in Eq. 3 can be posed in terms of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
