Approximation results for recoverable robust problems were also achieved.\nFor example, the recoverable traveling salesman problem was studied by Chassein and Goerigk , as well as Goerigk, Lendl, Wulf , where the latter showed a 4-approximation algorithm.\nBeyond that Bold and Goerigk  presented a 2-approximation for the recoverable robust single machine scheduling problem under interval uncertainty. Closely related to our work are the complexity studies by Goerigk, Lendl and Wulf  who analyze the problems independent set, traveling salesman and vertex cover and obtain Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-completeness for the three problems.\nAt the same time, Gr√ºne  introduced a gadget reduction framework to derive Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-completeness for various different optimization problems by reusing already known reductions for recoverable robust problems with so-called xor-dependency scenarios and ŒìŒì\\Gamma-set scenarios.\nAdditionally, Jackiewicz, Kasperski and Zieli≈Ñski  show that the shortest path problem with discrete budgeted interval uncertainty is Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Koster and Kutschka .\nFurther classical optimization problems that were studied in the recoverable robustness context are matching by Dourado, Meierling, Penso, Rautenbach, Protti and de Almeida [ref]13 and spanning tree under interval cost uncertainty by Hradovich, Kasperski, Zieli≈Ñski  [ref]24.\nAdditionally, Lendl, Peis, and Timmermans  examined matroidal problems.\nOne variant of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
