      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-document Summarization: A Comparative Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe selection of datasets for this study involved considering the popularity and novelty of the dataset. Datasets from different domains were selected, and the data type (i.e. short, long, or hybrid documents) was also taken into consideration. A variety of datasets were selected based on the aforementioned criteria (Table I). The Multi-News dataset  is a collection of news articles and their corresponding human-written summaries from the website newser.com333https://www.newser.com/. The summaries are created by professional editors and include links to the original articles . The dataset is available through Wayback-archived links and scripts that allow for easy reproduction of the data. It is the first large-scale dataset for MDS of news articles . The dataset is sourced from over 1,50015001,500 news sites, making it more diverse than previous datasets such as DUC, which come from only two sources. On the other hand, the Newsroom dataset  covers only 383838 news sources . A small group of 202020 editors contributed to 858585% of the summaries in the Multi-News dataset, providing a diverse range of perspectives for summarizing news articles . The Multi-XScience dataset [ref]22 is created by combining arXiv.org444https://arxiv.org/ papers and Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)  to form pairs of target summaries and multi-reference documents. The authors took care to maximize its usefulness by cleaning the LaTeX source of 1.31.31.3 million arXiv papers, aligning them with their references in MAG, and five cleaning iterations followed by human verification [ref]22. Multi-XScience has 606060% more references than Multi-News, making it suitable for the MDS setting. Despite being smaller than WikiSum, Multi-XScience is better suited for abstractive summarization because its reference summaries contain more novel n-grams than the source [ref]22 [ref]23. The dataset has a high novel n-grams score, which means it has less extractive bias, resulting in better abstraction for summarization models [ref]22. However, the high level of abstractiveness makes the dataset challenging because models cannot extract sentences from the reference articles [ref]22. The authors of the WikiSum dataset [ref]23 proposed using Wikipedia as a collection of summaries on various topics. They extract source material to be summarized from two subsets of all documents: 1) Cited sources: they extract text without markup from the crawlable citation documents for each article. 2) Web Search results: they crawl the search results from the Google search engine using the article section titles as queries, remove the Wikipedia article itself, and extract only the text. They supplement the source documents with web search results since many articles have few citations. The dataset is two orders-of-magnitude larger than previous summarization datasets in terms of the total words.\nThe WikiSum dataset is suitable for summarization tasks and provides a rich source of information [ref]23. Current datasets for summarization typically focus on either producing structureless summaries covering a few input documents or on summarizing a single document into a multi-section summary  . However, these datasets and methods do not meet the requirements of summarizing multiple academic papers into a structured summary. To address this issue, BigSurvey was proposed, which is a large-scale dataset for generating comprehensive summaries of academic papers on each topic . The authors collected target summaries from more than 7,00070007,000 survey papers and used the abstracts of their 430,000430000430,000 citations as input documents. BigSurvey contains two-level target summaries for multiple academic papers on the same topic. The long summary aims to comprehensively cover the salient content of the reference papers in different aspects, while the shorter summary is more concise and serves as a summary of the long summary. The authors built two subsets of the dataset: BigSurvey-MDS and BigSurveyAbs . In this research, we use the BigSurvey-MDS dataset, as it covers the salient content of the reference papers in different aspects.\nEach instance in the BigSurvey-MDS dataset corresponds to one survey paper from arXiv.org, which typically has tens or hundreds of reference papers. Due to copyright issues, BigSurvey-MDS does not include the body sections of these reference papers, but uses their abstracts as input documents. The abstracts can be regarded as summaries written by the authors of the reference papers, which include the papers’ salient information. For each survey paper, the authors collect up to 200200200 reference paper abstracts and truncate them to no more than 200200200 words, which are then used as input documents of the BigSurvey-MDS . The authors classified sentences in the introduction section of the survey paper into three sections and used them to compose the structured summary as the target in each example of the BigSurvey-MDS. The objective, result, and other types of content were merged into the section named as ”other”, since they appear less frequently than the background and method in the survey papers’ introduction section. To prepare these three sections in the target summary, the authors first collected the introduction section from a survey paper. If there is no introduction section, they extracted the first 1,024 words after the abstract part. Then, they classified the sentences and concatenated those classified as the same type to form the three sections in the target summary. The authors filtered out the examples with too short input sequences or target summaries . In addition to the BigSurvey-MDS dataset, we employed the MSˆ2 dataset to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art models in the biomedical domain. This dataset comprises more than 470,000470000470,000 documents and 20,0002000020,000 summaries drawn from scientific literature, and was specifically designed to support the development of systems that can assess and consolidate conflicting evidence from multiple studies. It is the first publicly available, large-scale, MDS dataset in the biomedical domain. Notably, each review in the MSˆ2 dataset summarizes an average of 232323 studies, and the input documents contain contradictory evidence, setting it apart from other datasets [ref]25. The Rotten Tomatoes (RT) dataset  comprises of movie reviews and meta-reviews constructed from professional critics and user comments. The meta-reviews, which summarize the constituent input reviews, are synthesized by professional editors and are associated with a numerical Tomatometer555http://rottentomatoes.com/ score that reflects the aggregate critic reception of a movie. The dataset provides a valuable resource for sentiment analysis and summarization research in the movie review domain. A BERT model has been trained to measure sentiment in movie reviews, showing a strong correlation with the ”Tomatometer” score 0. This stands in contrast with the earlier single docu- ment sentiment analysis datasets for RT  or otherwise .\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: small group of 202020 editors contributed to 858585% of the summaries in the Multi-News dataset, providing a diverse range of perspectives for summarizing news articles .
