      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Distillation via Token-level Relationship Graph\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning models have gained remarkable achievements across a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer vision , natural language processing  , speech recognition , game playing [ref]4, etc.  However, the high computation and memory requirements of deep neural networks (DNNs) limit their practical deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices and embedded systems. To address this challenge, Knowledge Distillation (KD)  has emerged as a promising research field.\nDrawing inspiration from the concept of transfer learning [ref]6, KD utilizes a high-capacity and complex teacher network to guide the training process of a lightweight student network\nso as to transfer the teacher’s knowledge. The knowledge can be transferred through two primary components: prediction logits  and intermediate features [ref]7  . Logit-based distillation is based on the idea that the soft prediction probabilities contain more information than hard labels. By using these probabilities, the performance of the student model can be maintained effectively after the distillation process. On the other hand, feature-based distillation methods directly align the feature activations of the teacher network and the student network. This approach achieves the transfer of knowledge at the feature level, facilitating effective learning on the student model. Recently, feature distillation methods have gained significant attention due to their ability to provide superior performance on various tasks compared to logit-based methods. The preference arises from the flexibility offered by feature representation in capturing rich information. Despite the outstanding achievements, both logit and feature distillation approaches face a notable challenge known as the capacity gap. This challenge stems from the disparity in scale between teacher and student models, resulting in a noticeable gap in their capacity even after the distillation process. Such capacity gap cannot be ignored,\nas it leads to the heavily rely of student model\non the teacher model for effective knowledge transfer.\n To tackle the issue of feature mismatch, Park et al. propose a novel approach to transfer knowledge utilizing the correlation information among instances 0. The authors argue that instead of relying solely on individual knowledge distillation, the mutual relationship between instances can offer additional structured information to alleviate the capacity gap encountered in previous distillations. This groundbreaking contribution lays the foundation for a new subfield within the KD paradigm, commonly referred to as relation-based distillation.\nThe underlying concept\nis that the information extracted from pairs of instances should remain invariant, regardless of the architecture differences between networks of teacher and student. Among various methods available for representing the structural information, graphs emerge as a prominent approach for capturing features and hierarchical relational patterns in a local connectivity manner. Consequently, graphs serve as suitable carriers for knowledge distillation. Graph-based distillation methods leverage the graph embedding 1 2 or incorporate additional graph neural networks (GNNs) 3 to effectively represent and transfer the relational knowledge during the KD process. Liu et al.  4 first propose to distill the instance-level relational information by constructing an instance relationship graph (IRG). Their approach distills graph-formed knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. Additionally, HKD 5 employs GNNs for the purpose of knowledge distillation. However, we observe that\nexisting graph-based distillation methods primarily focus on capturing relational knowledge at the instance level, which may lose fine-grained information in preserving the semantics inherent to individual images. Therefore, relying solely on distillation at the instance level may lead to potential information loss during the KD process. Moreover, in scenarios with imbalanced data, the effectiveness of the instance-level relation-based KD paradigm may be compromised due to the long-tail effect caused by imbalanced classes, introducing additional challenges. Consequently,\nthere is an urgent need to further explore existing graph-based KD methods to overcome these limitations. In Fig. 1, we illustrate a comparison of the information captured by instance-level graph and token-level graph. The token-level graph may offer a more detailed analysis by considering the intricate patterns and characteristics exhibited by various patch tokens both within individual images and across different images. For instance,\nwhen recognizing images of cat and dog,\nit is expected that the fur patches of both animals should share some similar pattern. By incorporating these fine-grained information into the relationship graph, we can effectively transfer knowledge that complements the instance-level knowledge.\nThus, utilizing a token-level graph to transfer knowledge may enhance the overall representation of relationships and similarities across various elements within and across images. In this work, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method called Token Relationship Graph (TRG) for KD. Our approach is motivated by the notion that the relationships between tokens can capture the semantics within individual images as well as the semantic congruity across multiple images.\nSpecifically, we partition the feature maps obtained from both teacher and student networks into fixed-sized patch tokens. These tokens then serve as the basis for constructing attributed graphs for each network, where each node represents a token and the node attributes correspond to the token embeddings. The graph edges are generated using the K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) of each node, establishing a relationship graph within each mini-batch of training data samples. Imbalanced data scenarios are often difficult to handle with individual KD methods owing to the long-tail effect. By focusing on the token-level relationships, our approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic content across images, even in the presence of imbalanced data. Additionally, to capture the contextual semantics within the instances, we also employ a contextual loss, aiming to preserve the semantics of individual instances. The flexibility of our KD method is demonstrated by its compatibility with novel network architectures, particularly the Vision Transformers 6 (ViTs), which are primarily based on patch tokenization. By incorporating the image-level token patching, we extend the applicability of our KD method to ViTs and other network architectures. To evaluate the effectiveness of TRG, we conduct extensive experiments and do comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several popular visual datasets, using various network architectures of both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and ViTs. These findings validate the superiority of TRG in distilling semantic knowledge and highlight its potential for improving performance in visual recognition tasks. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a new method called Token Relationship Graph (TRG) to efficiently distill the token-level relational knowledge across instances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes capturing the relational information among tokens rather than instances in the context of knowledge distillation. We incorporate the contextual similarity loss between tokens within the individual instances. By leveraging the inner-instance contextual loss and intra-instance token-level graph, our method captures the semantics of individual instances and the relationships between images, enabling the effective conveyance of inherent relational knowledge. Extensive experiments, utilizing various model architectures and popular visual datasets, are conducted to evaluate the superior performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: models have gained remarkable achievements across a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer vision , natural language processing  , speech recognition , game playing [ref]4, etc.  However, the high computation and memory requirements of deep neural networks (DNNs) limit their practical deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
