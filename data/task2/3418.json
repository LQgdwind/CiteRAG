      "content": "Paper Title: Data Heterogeneity-Robust Federated Learning via Group Client Selection in Industrial IoT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we categorize related works into four types according to the techniques they use. Data Sharing and Augmentation.\nThis type of approach aims to minimize the class distribution divergence among devices by sharing or augmenting FL clients‚Äô local datasets. For the sharing-based approaches, Zhao et al. propose to distribute a small portion of globally shared data (e.g., open available data) to clients‚Äô devices[ref]9. Yao et al. collect metadata shared by voluntary clients to perform controllable meta updating[ref]10. Yoshida et al. reward FL clients for contributing local datasets and propose a hybrid learning mechanism wherein the server updates the model using the shared data and clients‚Äô local models. These approaches achieve a considerable improvement in FL accuracy, but they are suspected of leaking private data due to the need to share clients‚Äô local datasets. Besides, open-available datasets do not always exist, especially in fields where data is highly confidential. For the augmentation-based approaches, Duan et al. observe that the imbalance among different classes can also degrade FL accuracy. Hence, they augment classes with fewer samples by simply random offset, rotation, cropping, and scaling. Jeong et al.[ref]33 propose to generate new samples using a globally trained conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to build unskewed local datasets. Similarly, Wang et al. generate synthetic data in the minority class based on linear interpolation to re-balance local datasets on edge devices. These approaches avoid the leakage of FL clients‚Äô private data. However, they still bring credibility crises. Speculative clients can use the synthetic data generated out of thin air to participate in FL training while hiding their original data. Also, they can pretend that the synthetic data is a large volume of high-quality data for more rewards. Therefore, these operations (i.e., data sharing, data augmentation) are high risk and should be prohibited. Hyperparameter Tuning.\nHyperparameters play an important role in FL training convergence. Some works have been explored in hyperparameter tunings, such as tunning the number of local iterations and the learning rate. Wang et al. point out that the optimal performance can be achieved when the number of local iterations equals one. However, the constrained resources (e.g., bandwidth, time, power) prevent us from doing this. In practice, large local iterations are more commonly used. For example, Yu et al. carefully set the number of local iterations and obtain a considerable convergence rate. In addition, Li et al. point out that decaying the learning rate is necessary for FL convergence with large local iterations. For a strongly convex and smooth objective function, FedAvg can converge to the optimal after applying learning rate decay, with a convergence rate of ùí™‚Äã(1/ùíØ)ùí™1ùíØ\\mathcal{O}(1/\\mathcal{T}), where ùíØùíØ\\mathcal{T} is the total number of local updates on a single device. These works give rigorous proofs for convergence analysis, which guides follow-up optimization on FL. However, carefully tuning these hyperparameters (e.g., number of local iterations, learning rate, and decay rate) requires multiple attempts and incurs high time costs. Client-Side Adaption.\nThis type of approach emphasizes that FL clients should adaptively retain global knowledge while improving local knowledge. Some examples are given to integrate them. Yao et al. point out that the global model contains more global knowledge and should be kept as a reference, rather than simply thrown away. Based on this idea, they adopt a two-stream model to transfer the global knowledge to the local model. By minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss, the two-stream model can extract more generalized features and learn better local representations. Then, in , they use the 1√ó1111\\times 1 convolution, vector weighted average, and scalar weighted average operators to fuse the global and local features. Li et al. point out that too many local updates will cause the FL training to diverge, especially under the non-i.i.d. data setting. Hence, they add a proximal penalty term to local objective loss functions to constrain the local model to be closer to the global model and avoid excessive divergence. Rieger et al. point out that clients express representations in different patterns and their shared knowledge may be obfuscated after synchronization. Hence, they adopt conditional gated activation units to enable clients to condition their units. In this way, clients can identify whether the global feature is expressed and how to modulate the global pattern. These approaches impose more storage footprint and computation on resource-constrained client-side devices, requiring higher resource allocation and also higher energy consumption. Server-Side Adaption.\nThis type of approach explores how local models can be adaptively aggregated and how the global model can be adaptively optimized on the server-side. Yeganeh et al. aggregate clients‚Äô local models according to their weights, by capitalizing an adaptive weighting approach based on the inverse distance between the local model parameters and the averaged model parameters. By using this approach, out-of-distribution models will be weighed down and the global model can have a lower variance. The authors also explored the combination with other metrics, such as the training accuracy and the data size. However, these variants did not perform well in our experiments, probably because some honest but ‚Äúout-of-distribution‚Äù devices were over-suppressed. On the other hand, inspired by the ability of momentum accumulation to dampen oscillations, Hsu et al. adopt the momentum optimizer on the server-side and observe a significant improvement in FL accuracy. Then, Reddi et al. introduce three advanced adaptive optimizers (i.e., Adagrad, Adam, and Yogi) to update the server-side global model. These adaptive federated optimizers enable the use of adaptive learning rates for different gradients and achieve great success, but unfortunately, they also require careful tunning of initial learning rates, and we observed drastic accuracy oscillation in the experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: or augmenting FL clients‚Äô local datasets.
