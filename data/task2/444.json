In each iteration, three partial differential equations (PDEs), namely the linearized Poisson equation and two DD equations are solved . These equations, together with the boundary conditions described above, are discretized using DG methods. The Poisson equation in the unit cell is expressed as a boundary value problem (BVP) where φ​(𝐫)𝜑𝐫\\varphi({\\mathbf{r}}) and 𝐄​(𝐫)𝐄𝐫{\\mathbf{E}}({\\mathbf{r}}) are the unknowns to be solved for, g​(r)𝑔rg(\\textbf{r}) and f​(r)𝑓rf(\\textbf{r}) are known coefficients, ε​(r)𝜀r\\varepsilon(\\textbf{r}) is the permittivity, ΩΩ\\Omega is the solution domain, ∂ΩνsubscriptΩ𝜈\\partial{\\Omega_{\\nu}} represents the surfaces perpendicular to the ν𝜈\\nu-direction, ν∈{x,y,z}𝜈𝑥𝑦𝑧\\nu\\in\\{x,y,z\\}, 𝐧^​(𝐫)^𝐧𝐫{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}({\\mathbf{r}}) is the outward pointing normal vector on ∂ΩνsubscriptΩ𝜈\\partial{\\Omega_{\\nu}}. The homogeneous Neumann boundary condition fN​(𝐫)=0subscript𝑓𝑁𝐫0f_{N}(\\mathbf{r})=0 is used in (9) [ref]23. Discretizing ΩΩ\\Omega into a set of non-overlapping elements, DG approximates the unknowns with basis functions (the nodal basis function  is used in this work) in each element and applies Galerkin testing to the resulting equations   . This process yields a matrix system as Here, Φ¯¯Φ\\bar{\\Phi} and E¯¯𝐸\\bar{E} are unknown vectors storing the basis expansion coefficients, M¯gsuperscript¯𝑀𝑔{{\\bar{M}}^{g}} and M¯𝐄superscript¯𝑀𝐄{\\bar{M}}^{\\mathbf{E}} are block diagonal mass matrices, G¯¯𝐺\\bar{G} and D¯¯𝐷\\bar{D} are block sparse matrices representing the gradient and divergence operators, respectively, and B¯φsuperscript¯𝐵𝜑\\bar{B}^{\\varphi} and B¯𝐄superscript¯𝐵𝐄\\bar{B}^{\\mathbf{E}} have contributions from the tested force term and boundary conditions. Detailed expressions of these vectors and matrices can be found in . The continuity of solutions across element interfaces is enforced through a uniquely defined numerical flux. For Poisson equation, the alternate flux  is used on each element surface in the interior of ΩΩ\\Omega, where “average” and “jump” operators are defined as {⊙}=0.5(⊙−+⊙+)\\left\\{\\odot\\right\\}=0.5({\\odot^{-}}+{\\odot^{+}}) and [[⊙]]=⊙−−⊙+\\left[\\kern-1.49994pt\\left[\\odot\\right]\\kern-1.49994pt\\right]={\\odot^{-}}-{\\odot^{+}}, respectively, with ⊙direct-product\\odot being a scalar or a vector variable. The same definitions of these operators are used throughout this paper. Superscripts “-” and “+” refer to variables defined in the interior and exterior of the surface, respectively. 𝜷^=𝐧^bold-^𝜷^𝐧\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}={\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}} determines the upwind direction of φ𝜑\\varphi and (ε​𝐄)𝜀𝐄(\\varepsilon{\\mathbf{E}})   . On ∂ΩNsubscriptΩ𝑁\\partial{\\Omega_{N}}, the numerical fluxes are chosen as φ∗=φ−superscript𝜑superscript𝜑{\\varphi^{*}}={\\varphi^{-}} and (ε​𝐄)∗=fNsuperscript𝜀𝐄subscript𝑓𝑁{\\left({\\varepsilon{\\mathbf{E}}}\\right)^{*}}={f_{N}} . Here, the variables are defined on the surfaces and the explicit dependency on 𝐫𝐫{\\mathbf{r}} is dropped for the simplicity of the notation. To enforce PBC, same meshes are created on the opposing surfaces of the unit cell and each element face on a given surface is “connected” to its counterpart on the opposing surface. This means that when calculating the numerical flux on the boundary, (11)-(12) are used but, for each element face, the exterior variable is taken from its “connected” face on the opposing surface where U∈{φ,(ε​𝐄)}𝑈𝜑𝜀𝐄U\\in\\{\\varphi,(\\varepsilon\\mathbf{E})\\}. For PDBC, the element faces on the opposing surfaces are “connected” just like it is done for the PBC.  An intermediate state is defined as φ∗=φ​(wx/2,y,z)+0.5​φdrop​(y,z)=φ​(−wx/2,y,z)−0.5​φdrop​(y,z)superscript𝜑𝜑subscript𝑤𝑥2𝑦𝑧0.5subscript𝜑drop𝑦𝑧𝜑subscript𝑤𝑥2𝑦𝑧0.5subscript𝜑drop𝑦𝑧\\varphi^{*}={\\varphi(w_{x}/2,y,z)}+0.5{\\varphi_{\\mathrm{drop}}}(y,z)={\\varphi(-w_{x}/2,y,z)}-0.5{\\varphi_{\\mathrm{drop}}}(y,z), and the exterior variables in the numerical flux expressions are set as The electron DD equations in the unit cell are expressed as a BVP  where n​(𝐫)𝑛𝐫n({\\mathbf{r}}) and 𝐪​(𝐫)𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}) are the unknowns to be solved for, and d​(𝐫)𝑑𝐫d({\\mathbf{r}}) 𝐯​(𝐫)𝐯𝐫{\\mathbf{v}}({\\mathbf{r}}), and R​(𝐫)𝑅𝐫R({\\mathbf{r}}) are known coefficients within the Gummel method .\nThe homogeneous Robin boundary condition fR​(𝐫)=0subscript𝑓𝑅𝐫0f_{R}({\\mathbf{r}})=0 is used in (23) [ref]23. The BVP for holes only differs by the sign in front of the drift term. DG discretization of (19)-(23) yields a matrix system as where N¯¯𝑁\\bar{N} and Q¯¯𝑄\\bar{Q} are unknown vectors storing the basis expansion coefficients, M¯𝐪superscript¯𝑀𝐪{\\bar{M}^{\\mathbf{q}}} is same as M¯𝐄superscript¯𝑀𝐄{\\bar{M}^{\\mathbf{E}}}, G¯¯𝐺\\bar{G} and D¯¯𝐷\\bar{D} are same as before, d¯¯𝑑\\bar{d} is a diagonal matrix, and C¯¯𝐶\\bar{C} corresponds to the drift term . The local Lax-Friedrichs flux  is used for the drift term and the alternate flux (11)-(12) is used for the diffusion term (φ𝜑\\varphi and (ε​𝐄)𝜀𝐄(\\varepsilon\\mathbf{E}) are replaced with n𝑛n and 𝐪𝐪\\mathbf{q}, respectively). The PBC (22) is enforced just like it is done in (13)-(14), with U∈{n,(d​𝐪)}𝑈𝑛𝑑𝐪U\\in\\{n,(d\\mathbf{q})\\}, and for (21) Solutions of the matrix systems (10) and (24) are computed using linear solvers at every iteration of the Gummel method. The steady-state solutions are obtained after the Gummel iteration converges and are used as inputs for the transient solver [ref]23.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: is the outward pointing normal vector on ∂ΩνsubscriptΩ𝜈\\partial{\\Omega_{\\nu}}.
