Furthermore, the combined explanation of interventional and dependent parts allow to motivate certain actions to change the expected result (fire or no fire). We can read that dropping water on this forest should directly decrease the probability of a fire (high interventional effects of relative humidity 𝑅𝐻𝑅𝐻\\mathit{RH} and 𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑛\\mathit{Rain}). A smaller (and possible delayed) but significant dependent effect is also expected. This information can not be distilled with the approach of [ref]15 (Figure 6b). The correlations between features and their SHAP values in Table 2 are supported by the partial correlations between features and output shown in Figure 7. Table 2 and Figure 7 both provide a limited view into the model-data structure: they are expected to show similarities but are not comparable in an absolute sense. The partial correlations between each input and the output fFsubscript𝑓𝐹f_{F} resemble the correlations between each input and its interventional SHAP part. Furthermore, the big positive correlation of R​a​i​n𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑛Rain with its dependent SHAP part (in contrast with its big negative correlation with its interventional SHAP part) can be attributed to positive partial correlations with other features (T𝑇T, 𝑊𝑠𝑊𝑠\\mathit{Ws}) and their high positive partial correlation with the output fFsubscript𝑓𝐹f_{F}. These observations validate the decomposition and show how it can give more insight into the model-data structure than other SHAP implementations. Note that Shapley flow [ref]24 would provide even more insight into the model and data dependencies, but their approach is less practical since it require a causal graph and the explanations can not be represented through the popular force plots [ref]15. In practice, our method can be used on any dataset (and model) regardless of its size and its number of features, and the computational cost can be controlled by the parameters of the method. If no reasonable estimation of the data distribution can be made (either data driven or knowledge driven) and/or the interest is clearly in interventional output effects, interventional SHAP is the method of choice. If sufficient causal knowledge is available it might be interesting to look into causal Shapley values [ref]8 or Shapley flow [ref]24. In all other cases we advise to use our method, since there is only information gain with regards to (standard) conditional SHAP. An overview of the insights our approach provides compared to related approaches is given in Table LABEL:full_comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: humidity 𝑅𝐻𝑅𝐻\\mathit{RH} and 𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑛\\mathit{Rain}). A smaller (and possible delayed) but significant dependent effect is also expected. This information can not be distilled with the approach of [ref]15 (Figure 6b). The correlations between features and their SHAP values in Table 2 are supported by the partial correlations between features and output shown in Figure 7.
