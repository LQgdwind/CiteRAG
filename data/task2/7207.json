Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Efficient Private Neighbor Generation for Subgraph Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe synthesize the distributed subgraph system with four widely used graph datasets, i.e., Cora¬†[ref]31, CiteSeer¬†[ref]31, PubMed [ref]25, and MSAcademic¬†[ref]32.\nWe follow FedSage  to synthesize the distributed subgraph system using the Louvain Algorithm¬†. We split every dataset into 3, 5, and 10 subgraphs of similar sizes, and due to the space limit, whose statistics are presented in Appendix E. We specify the GNN as a two-layer GraphSage with mean aggregator  and neighbor size 5. Batch size and training epochs are set to 32 and 50. Same parameters are used for F with embedding-fused graph convolution. The train-val-test ratio is 60%-20%-20% and all loss weights are set to 1. The graph impairing ratio h‚Ñéh is set to 0.5. SGD optimization is applied with 0.1 learning rate. dzsubscriptùëëùëßd_{z} is 128 for Cora, 64 for CiteSeer, 256 for both PubMed and MSAcademic, based on the grid search over {64,128,256}. We implement FedDEP on the FederatedScope platform¬† in Python. All experiments are on a server with 8 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs.222Code: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FedDEP-6F08/. We conduct comprehensive performance evaluations of FedDEP by comparing following baselines and ablations:\n(1) Global: A GraphSage model trained on the entire global graph without missing links (providing the performance upper bound);\n(2) Local: A set of GraphSage models trained on individual subgraphs;\n(3) FedAvg (FedDEP without DGen/Proto/NFDP): A GraphSage model trained across subgraphs by FedAvg;\n(4) FedGNN: A GraphSage model trained across subgraphs by FedGNN ;\n(5) FedGraph: A GraphSage model trained across subgraphs by FedGraph ;\n(6) FedGSL: A GraphSage model trained across subgraphs by FedGSL¬†0;\n(7) FedSage: A GraphSage model trained across subgraphs by FedSage+¬†;\n(8) FedDEP w/o DGenw/o DGen{}_{\\text{w/o DGen}}: FedDEP without deep neighbor generation; (9) FedDEP w/o Protow/o Proto{}_{\\text{w/o Proto}}: FedDEP without pseudo-FL or embedding prototype;\n(10) FedDEP w/o NFDPw/o NFDP{}_{\\text{w/o NFDP}}: FedDEP trained with DPSGD instead of noise-free edge LDP;\nand (11) FedDEP: The full FedDEP model with DGen, Proto and NFDP. Cluster numbers in FedDEP are chosen by grid search over C‚àà{3,5,10,15,20}ùê∂35101520C\\in\\{3,5,10,15,20\\} and will be studied in Section¬†4.4. For FedGNN and FedDEP w/o NFDPw/o NFDP{}_{\\text{w/o NFDP}}, we fix their œÉùúé\\sigma as 2.0 to achieve the same level of edge-LDP protection as other variations of FedDEP. We provide results with different privacy budgets in Section 4.5. The metric we use is node classification accuracy on the queries sampled from test nodes on the global graph. The reported average accuracy is over three random repetitions. For locally trained models, the scores are further averaged across local models. The corresponding standard deviations are also provided.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: We synthesize the distributed subgraph system with four widely used graph datasets, i.e., Cora¬†[ref]31, CiteSeer¬†[ref]31, PubMed [ref]25, and MSAcademic¬†[ref]32.\nWe follow FedSage  to synthesize the distributed subgraph system using the Louvain Algorithm¬†.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
