      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Multimodal Multitask Scene Understanding Models for Indoor Mobile Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDepth completion task. Following prior literature , we evaluate the performance of depth completion using the following metrics: mean absolute relative error (AbsRel), root mean squared error (RMS), and the accuracy under threshold δ<1.25𝛿1.25\\delta<{1.25}. The results are presented in Table I. We consider two baseline methods: MonoIndoor  and the Self-supervised Sparse-to-Dense [ref]20 method. MonoIndoor performs depth estimation based on monocular images only. Self-supervised Sparse-to-Dense performs depth completion from both monocular images and sparse Lidar points. We note that Self-supervised Sparse-to-Dense is a special case of MMISM: when performing a single-task training on depth completion in our model. First, we compare methods that utilize only monocular images versus monocular images and sparse Lidar points. We observe an obvious performance improvement from MonoIndoor to Self-supervised Sparse-to-Dense on AbsRel (0.2380.2380.238 to 0.0480.0480.048). The improvement suggests 1) indoor depth estimation is a challenging problem and 2) sparse Lidar points can greatly help improve the estimated depth even when these Lidar points are collected from accessible mobile hardware. Next, we compare single-task-training and multi-task-training models. We find AbsRel improves from Self-supervised Sparse-to-Dense to MMISM (0.0480.0480.048 to 0.0410.0410.041), which indicates there are benefits of jointly-training multiple correlated tasks. Semantic segmentation task. Recall that, for the semantic segmentation task, we perform knowledge distillation from the Mask2Former  model trained on the ADE20K  dataset.\nSince we do not have semantic segmentation labels in ARKitScenes, we instead evaluate the knowledge distillation performance. We treat the labels generated from the teacher model (Mask2Former) as true labels and compute the accuracy of the labels generated from the student model (MMISM). We consider the single-task training variant of MMISM as a baseline, reporting numbers in the left of Table II. We find that the multi-task training model performs on par with the single-task training model. 3D object detection task. We choose the evaluation metric to be the average precision with 3D IoU threshold 0.250.250.25 as proposed by prior literature [ref]1 [ref]22  between the estimated 3D bounding boxes and true 3D bounding boxes. For the baseline method, we consider the original VoteNet [ref]22 method in ARKitScenes [ref]1, representing a model that performs single-task-training, without RGB images in the input, and without fusing the predictions from the semantic segmentation task. We also consider other variants of MMISM by removing the RGB-images from the input or removing the fusion from the semantic segmentation predictions. We present results in Table III. First, we observe performance improvements from VoteNet to MMISM’s variants, which indicates that multi-task training can improve 3D object detection. Second, we compare different variants of MMISM. We find that removing the RGB-images from the input has the largest affect on performance, which drops from 0.4760.4760.476 to 0.4330.4330.433. Nonetheless, the fusion from the semantic segmentation predictions also helps to improve the model, which improves from 0.4680.4680.468 to 476476476 when considering semantic fusion as the changing factor. In a nutshell, both multi-task training and cross-task fusion help improve 3D object detection, with a 11.7%percent11.711.7\\% gain from 0.4260.4260.426 to 0.4760.4760.476. Human pose estimation task. We follow CenterNet 0 evaluation protocols to report average precision at IoU thresholds 0.75 between estimated and true human key points. We consider a baseline that performs only the single-task training. Results are presented in Table IV. The results are consistent with the previous tasks, showing that the multi-task training performs on par or better than the single-task training, where the performance improves from 0.4740.4740.474 to 0.4990.4990.499.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: error (RMS), and the accuracy under threshold δ<1.25𝛿1.25\\delta<{1.25}. The results are presented in Table I. We consider two baseline methods: MonoIndoor  and the Self-supervised Sparse-to-Dense [ref]20 method. MonoIndoor performs depth estimation based on monocular images only. Self-supervised Sparse-to-Dense performs depth completion from both monocular images and sparse Lidar points.
