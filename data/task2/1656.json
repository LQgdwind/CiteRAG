      "content": "Paper Title: Boundary-induced and Scene-aggregated Network for Monocular Depth Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDense and accurate depth is widely used in many computer vision applications,\nsuch as autonomous driving [ref]1 [ref]2 and robotics    .\nGenerally, acquiring dense depth depends on specific sensors,\ni.e., stereo cameras   and time-of-flight cameras.\nTo lower requirements of the sensor,\npredicting dense depth from a single image attracts the attention of many researchers. In recent years,\nmany deep learning based methods are proposed to tackle this task\nand achieve great performance gain.\nSome of them   [ref]11   are based on the encoder-decoder structure\nand utilize specific modules or extra labels to improve the ability of their networks for scene understanding.\nAlthough these methods achieve good performance in reducing pixel-wise depth error,\nthe ability to recover 3D space is still limited by the unstable 3D scene structure,\nwhich is expressed as mistakenly estimating the farthest region of the scene.\nAs shown in Fig.1,\nprevious methods mistakenly regard the bookcase or the wall as the global farthest region,\nleading to the\nscene distortion.\nThe intrinsic reason is that the encoder lacks consideration of the correlation between distant points when modeling the scene with high semantics,\nthus each pixel in the high-level feature only represents the depth inside a region of the input image.\nIt results in that when the decoder is utilized to recover the pixel-wise depth,\nthe farthest region probably be wrongly estimated.\nBesides,\nthe boundary of objects is an important cue in 3D space,\nwhich indicates the sudden change of depth.\nTo obtain a depth map with sharp boundary,\nseveral more recent methods [ref]11    focus on improving the accuracy of the boundary in the predicted depth.\nBut due to the insufficient use of low-level features,\nthe boundaries are still hard to be recovered accurately.\nThe black polygon in Fig.1 depicts the detail of the bookcase.\nObservably,\nprevious methods fail to recover the accurate shapes of the small objects in the bookcase. In this paper,\nthe Boundary-induced and Scene-aggregated network (BS-Net) is proposed.\nFirstly,\nto perceive the farthest region,\nwe design the Depth Correlation Encoder (DCE).\nOn the one hand,\ndilation convolutions are utilized to extract the correlation between long-distance pixels that are independent of each other, based on which the relative depth between different independent pixels is built.\nOn the other hand,\nthe Pyramid Scene Encoder (PSE) extracts the dominant features in multi-scale regions and fuses them to one,\nwhich obtains the correlation between different regions.\nSecondly,\nto effectively recover the boundary,\nwe design the Bottom-Up Boundary Fusion (BUBF) module.\nStarting from stage 2 of the encoder,\nthe module gradually fuses the feature of each two adjacent levels,\npassing the location information to the high-level feature.\nThus, it eliminates the ineffective edges (indicating small depth change) in the low-level cues by the guidance of high-level cues,\nand eventually extracts the boundary edges (indicating sudden depth change).\nTo effectively exploit the boundary,\nthe Stripe Refinement Module (SRM) is designed to replace the conventional regression module.\nThe convincing experiments on the NYUD v2 dataset  demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,\nand the additional results on the SUN-RGBD dataset  prove the generalization of our method. The main contributions of our method can be summarized as follows: To perceive the farthest region in a depth map,\nthe well-designed Depth Correlation Encoder (DCE) extracts the correlations between long-distance pixels and the correlations between multi-scale regions. To effectively extract and utilize the boundary,\nthe Bottom-Up Boundary Fusion (BUBF) module is designed to gradually fuse features of adjacent levels.\nMeanwhile,\nthe Stripe Refinement Module (SRM) is designed to refine depth around the boundary. Numerous experiments on the NYUD v2 dataset  prove the effectiveness of our method.\nThe proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nAnd the experiment on the SUN-RGBD dataset  proves the generalization of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Dense and accurate depth is widely used in many computer vision applications,\nsuch as autonomous driving [ref]1 [ref]2 and robotics    .\nGenerally, acquiring dense depth depends on specific sensors,\ni.e., stereo cameras   and time-of-flight cameras.\nTo lower requirements of the sensor,\npredicting dense\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
