      "content": "Paper Title: Road Network Guided Fine-Grained Urban Traffic Flow Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the past decades, a large number of people have poured into the cities, and the number of vehicles has increased sharply, which brings great challenges to urban transportation management  . In the construction of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic flow monitoring is a crucial component that provides significant information for traffic congestion warnings and traffic state prediction. To obtain citywide fine-grained traffic flow data (e.g., inflow, outflow, volume), transportation departments usually deploy large amounts of sensing devices (e.g., surveillance cameras and induction loops) to cover each small geographical region. However, it is a heavy economic burden to purchase these devices. For instance, it was reported that the ITS project of Hong Kong spent around 78 million USD on monitoring equipment expenditure . Moreover, as time goes by, a lot of equipment will be depreciated and updated, which also requires huge expenses. Under these circumstances, we desire a novel technology that can greatly reduce the number of deployed sensors while effectively maintaining the fine granularity of traffic flow information. In this work, we focus on how to accurately generate fine-grained data from coarse-grained data collected with a small number of traffic sensors, which is termed fine-grained urban traffic flow inference. Due to its great social benefits, this problem has recently received increasing attention in both industry and academic communities. In most preliminary works [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6, the city being studied is first divided into a coarse grid map and a fine grid map on the basis of latitude and longitude coordinates, as shown in Fig. 1-(b,c). Note that the traffic flow observed on the coarse grid map is termed a coarse-grained traffic flow map. Likewise, the fine-grained traffic flow map is observed on the fine grid map. Inspired by the success of deep learning  , conventional methods usually employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn mapping functions between coarse-grained traffic flow maps and fine-grained ones. Following  0, some external factors (e.g., weather and timestamp) are incorporated to learn the fine-grained traffic flow distribution. Despite recent progress, fine-grained traffic flow inference remains a challenging task. First, different from image super-resolution where low-resolution images still have obvious structures 1 2, our coarse-grained traffic flow maps are relatively rough, without any structural information, as shown in Fig. 1-(b). It is very difficult to directly transform coarse-grained maps to fine-grained maps. Fortunately, we observe that the urban road network has an obvious structure that is perfectly aligned with the fine-grained traffic flow distribution, as shown in Fig. 1-(d), since most vehicles drive on these traffic roads. In this case, the road network can be regarded as an instructive prior knowledge for traffic flow inference. Nevertheless, most previous methods [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6 were not aware of this knowledge.\nSecond, how to model the road network is still an open problem. We can see that blank background dominates the road network map, while those traffic roads are thin and long. We argue that it is suboptimal to model the road network with 2D convolutional layers commonly used in image analysis since the square filters would indulge in the dominant background and belittle those traffic roads. Thus, a more effective method is desired to capture the road network distribution.\nThird, despite short-range spatial dependencies were widely explored in [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6, we argue that long-range spatial dependencies are also crucial for traffic flow inference. For instance, two distant regions may have similar or correlative traffic flow, if they belong to the same traffic road, such as the regions A and B in Fig. 1-(c). Therefore, it is meaningful to capture the traffic flow long-range dependencies, especially for traffic road regions. Taking into consideration the above challenges, we propose a novel Road-Aware Traffic Flow Magnifier (RATFM), which fully exploits the prior knowledge of road network to learn the distribution patterns of fine-grained traffic flow. Specifically, our RATFM is composed of a road network modeling module, a short-range road-aware inference module, a long-range road-aware inference module, and an external factor modeling module.\nFirst, we crawl the traffic network map of the studied city from Internet, and introduce a unified multi-directional 1D convolutional layer to effectively model traffic roads with four groups of 1D filters in various directions. Then, the road network feature and the coarse-grained traffic flow feature are incorporated and fed into stacked residual blocks 3 to better model the short-range spatial distribution of road-relative traffic flow. Moreover, we take the road network feature as query priori and capture the long-range spatial distribution of traffic flow using a global attention transformer 4. Thanks to the tailor-designed road-aware mechanism, our method is capable to generate high-quality traffic flow maps with a spatial fine-granularity. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks, and the evaluation results show that the proposed RATFM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under various scenarios. In summary, our major contributions of this paper are summarized in the following aspects: We re-examined the problem of fine-grained traffic flow inference from the perspective of urban road network relevance, and extend the existing pure data-driven representation learning to knowledge-guided representation learning. Specifically, we propose a novel Road-Aware Traffic Flow Magnifier, which takes the road network as prior guidance to effectively learn the fine-grained distribution of urban traffic flow. For road network modeling, a multi-directional 1D convolutional layer is specially introduced to better capture the distribution patterns of those spindly traffic roads and alleviate the distraction of background. We introduce a transformer-based long-range inference module, which takes the road network knowledge as a query to jointly reason the traffic flow distribution of all regions with fine granularity. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed RATFM for fine-grained urban traffic flow inference. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, we review some related works of traffic flow analysis in Section II. We then introduce the proposed Road-Aware Traffic Flow Magnifier in Section III. To verify the effectiveness of RATFM, we perform extensive experiments conducted in Section IV, and conclude this paper in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: urban traffic flow inference.
