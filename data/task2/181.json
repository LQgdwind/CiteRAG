      "content": "Paper Title: Maximum Clique in Disk-Like Intersection Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMIS, which boils down to Maximum Clique on the complement graphs, is APX-hard on subcubic graphs .\nA folklore self-reduction first discovered by Poljak¬† consists of subdividing each edge of the input graph twice (or any even number of times).\nOne can show that this reduction preserves the APX-hardness.\nTherefore, a way to establish such an intractability for Maximum Clique on a given intersection graph class is to show that for every (subcubic) graph Gùê∫G, its complement of 2-subdivision Subd2‚Äã(G)¬Ø¬ØsubscriptSubd2ùê∫\\overline{\\text{Subd}_{2}(G)} (or Subds‚Äã(G)¬Ø¬ØsubscriptSubdùë†ùê∫\\overline{\\text{Subd}_{s}(G)} for a larger even integer sùë†s, see¬†) is representable.\nMIS admits a PTAS on planar graphs, but remains NP-hard.\nHence showing that for every (subcubic) planar graph Gùê∫G, the complement of an even subdivision of Gùê∫G is representable shows the simple NP-hardness (see¬†[ref]16 ). So far, representing complements of even subdivisions of graphs belonging to a class on which MIS is NP-hard (resp. APX-hard) has been the main, if not unique111Admittedly Butman et al.¬† showed that Maximum Clique is NP-hard on 3-interval graphs, by reducing from Max 2-DNF-SAT which is very close to Max Cut. However this result was later subsumed by¬†., approach to show the NP-hardness (resp. APX-hardness) of Maximum Clique in geometric intersection graph classes.\nThis approach was used by Middendorf and Pfeiffer  for some restriction of string graphs, the so-called B1subscriptùêµ1B_{1}-VPG graphs, by Cabello et al. [ref]16 to settle the then long-standing open question of the complexity of Maximum Clique for segments (with the class of planar graphs), by Francis et al.¬† for 2-interval, unit 3-interval, 3-track, and unit 4-track graphs (with the class of all graphs; showing APX-hardness), and unit 2-interval and unit 3-track graphs (with the class of planar graphs; showing only NP-hardness), by Bonnet et al.¬†[ref]9 for filled ellipses and filled triangles, and by Bonamy et al.¬† for ball graphs, and 4-dimensional unit ball graphs.\nBonnet et al.¬†[ref]9 show that the complement of two mutually induced odd cycles is not a disk graph.\nAs a consequence, to show the NP-hardness of Maximum Clique on disk graphs with the described approach, one can only hope to represent all the graphs without two mutually induced odd cycles.\nHowever we do not know if MIS is even NP-hard in that class. The main conceptual contribution of the paper is to suggest an alternative to that approach.\nWe introduce a technical intermediate problem that we call Max Interval Permutation Avoidance (MIPA, for short), which is a convenient way of seeing Max Cut.\nWe prove that MIPA is unlikely to have an approximation scheme running in subexponential time.\nWe then transfer that lower bound to Maximum Clique in the intersection graphs of objects that can be either unit disks or axis-parallel rectangles;\na class for which the co-2-subdivision approach does not seem to work.\nRecall that when all the objects are unit disks or when all the objects are axis-parallel rectangles, polynomial-time algorithms are known. Anticipating on Section¬†3 where MIPA is defined, one can already see on Figure¬†1 that both approaches require to represent an antimatching (i.e., a complement of an induced matching), a clique, and some relation between them.\nAntimatchings (and obviously cliques) of arbitrary size are representable by half-planes and unit disks.\nThe difficulty in both cases is to get the right adjacencies between the antimatching and the clique.\nThe MIPA approach only needs the vertices of the clique to avoid two vertices in the antimatching, whereas this number is at least three in the co-2-subdivision approach.\nThis seemingly small difference is actually crucial, as we will see in Section¬†3. A transparent reduction from MIPA yields APX-hardness, which is ruled out for disks, due to the EPTAS.\nTo be usable for disk graphs, one will thus need to scale MIPA down222for instance, by replacing the arbitrary matching MùëÄM by pseudo-disk-like objects to a NP-hard problem admitting a PTAS.\nIn doing so, one should keep in mind that Planar Max Cut  and Planar Not-All-Equal SAT  are solvable in polynomial-time.\nA next step could be to show the NP-hardness of Maximum Clique for (convex) pseudo-disks.\nIt turns out to be already quite delicate.\nThere is a distinct possibility that convex pseudo-disks have constant induced odd cycle packing number (see Section¬†2 for the definitions).\nThis would imply a subexponential-time algorithm and an EPTAS [ref]9 , and that one would need a scaled down version of MIPA to establish NP-hardness even in that case.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: PTAS on planar graphs, but remains NP-hard.\nHence showing that for every (subcubic) planar graph Gùê∫G, the complement of an even subdivision of Gùê∫G is representable shows the simple NP-hardness (see¬†[ref]16 ). So far, representing complements of even subdivisions of graphs belonging to a class on which MIS is NP-hard (resp. APX-hard) has been the main, if not unique111Admittedly Butman et al.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
