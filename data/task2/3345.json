      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos: A Survey and Future Directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSliding window and the early proposal-generated methods follow the two-stage propose-and-rank pipeline which suffers from various drawbacks. Researchers then source for alternative structures without pre-cutting proposal candidates at the input stage. One kind of solution is anchor-based methods, which incorporate proposal generation into answer prediction and maintain the proposals with various learning modules. According to how the anchors are produced and maintained, we further classify them into standard anchor-based and 2D-Map methods. Standard Anchor-based Method. Methods in this category produce proposal candidates with multi-scale anchors and maintain them sequentially or hierarchically in the model. They aggregate contextual multimodal information and generate the final grounding result in one pass. The first anchor-based method for TSGV is Temporal GroundNet (TGN) by Chen et al. , shown in Fig. 14. TGN temporally captures the evolving fine-grained frame-by-word interactions between video and query. At each time step, multi-scale proposal candidates ending at the current time are generated using pre-set anchors. Then a sequential LSTM grounder simultaneously scores the group of proposals. TGN adopts weighted binary cross-entropy loss (ref. Eqn. 9) to optimize the model. In contrast, MAN  and SCDM   adopt temporal convolutional networks to produce proposal candidates hierarchically. That is, proposals with different scales are generated at different levels of the stacked temporal convolution module. SCDM also adopts different multi-scale anchors compared to the standard version.\nSpecifically, it imposes different scale anchors based on a basic span centered at each time step. Subsequent work generally follows the strategies of TGN or SCDM with more sophisticated learning modules and/or auxiliary objectives. To be specific, CMIN  , CBP [ref]62, FIAN , HDRR , and MIGCN [ref]67 adopt the strategy of TGN, while CSMGAN , RMN , IA-Net , and DCT-Net  apply the strategy of SCDM. These solutions design various cross-modal reasoning strategies to perform a more fine-grained and deeper multimodal interaction between video and query for precise moment localization. In addition, CBP [ref]62 introduces an auxiliary boundary module to compute the confidence of the feature at each time step to be the boundary of the target moment. Some works adopt boundary regression modules to refine the generated moments’ start and end time points. MIGCN [ref]67 develops a rank module apart from the boundary regression module to distinguish the optimal proposal from a set of similar proposal candidates. ECCL  designs a sliding convolution locator to iteratively predict the best proposal candidates. MA3SRN  incorporates optical-flow-guided motion-aware, detection-based appearance-aware, and 3D-aware object features to interact with the query for better grounding. 2D-Map Anchor-based Method. Standard anchor-based method produces proposal candidates with preset multi-scale anchors and maintains them sequentially or hierarchically. These proposals are individually processed and their temporal dependencies are not well considered. Furthermore, the lengths of proposals are restricted by preset anchors. 2D-Map methods use a two-dimensional map to model the temporal relations between proposal candidates, shown in Fig. 5(d). Theoretically, 2D-Map could enumerate all possible proposals at any length, while maintaining their adjacent relations. Before 2D-Map methods, a prior work TMN  first proposes to enumerate all possible consecutive segments as proposals and predict the best-matched proposal as the result through interacting each proposal with the query. However, TMN generates proposals in the answer predictor; its enumeration strategy is more like a variant of a standard anchor-based strategy. 2D-TAN  is the first solution modeling proposal with a 2D temporal map, and its overall architecture is shown in Fig. 15 left. 2D-TAN first extracts visual features and converts them into a 2D feature map, while the query is encoded in sentence-level representation. A temporal adjacent network is proposed to fuse the query feature with each proposal feature and embed the video context information with a convolutional network. As shown in Fig. 15 right, 2D-TAN divides the video into evenly spaced video snippets with duration τ𝜏\\tau, where (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) on the 2D map denotes a proposal candidate from time i​τ𝑖𝜏i\\tau to j​τ𝑗𝜏j\\tau666i≤j𝑖𝑗i\\leq j, i.e., only the upper triangular area of 2D map is valid. Instead of enumerating all possible consecutive segments as proposals, 2D-MAN proposes a sparse sampling strategy to remove redundant moments which have large overlaps with the selected proposals. The model adopts binary cross-entropy loss for model learning. 2D-TAN is further extended  with multi-scale modeling to achieve a larger receptive field and obtain richer contexts. The extended version reduces the complexity of proposal generation from quadratic to linear, making dense video prediction more efficient. Due to its effectiveness, a series of work follows 2D-TAN’s proposal generation777Some methods follow 2D-TAN’s proposal generation to produce proposal candidates, but they may not maintain the proposals in a 2D map. or its overall structure. As illustrated in Fig. 15, 2D-TAN directly encodes the query into the sentence-level feature and interacts with proposals via a simple Hadamard product. In this sense, multimodal interaction is overlooked. To remedy, PLN , SMIN , CLEAR [ref]74, and STCM-Net  disentangle video proposals into different temporal granularities   or different semantic contents  [ref]74, and perform cross-modal reasoning at both coarse- and fine-grained granularities. VLG-Net  and RaNet  maintain query words and video proposals in a graph and adopt GCN   to conduct both intra- and inter-modal interactions. SV-VMR  decomposes the query into semantic roles  and performs multi-level cross-modal reasoning at the semantic level. MATN  further concatenates proposals and query words into a sequence and encodes them through a single-stream transformer network. It also devises a novel multi-stage boundary regression to refine the predicted moments. Instead of using the simple Hadamard product, DMN  proposes to project proposals and query features to a common embedding space and leverage metric learning for cross-modal pair discrimination. FVMR  and CCA  devise joint semantic embedding module for multimodal interaction to facilitate the cross-modal reasoning. Guo et al.  introduce the Wasserstein distance  to match video-text domain. DCLN  and TACI  decompose 2D-Map into start and end channels for cross-modal reasoning and then fuses to 2D-Map features to facilitate model training. Xu et al.  propose a contrastive language-action pre-training framework for TSGV. Bao et al.  address the bias issue via a sample-reweighting-based debiased temporal localizer. Moreover, a series of recent work      focuses on developing multi-stage cross-modal fusion module in hierarchy, sequence, or multi-granularity, for better moment prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [62]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]62: span centered at each time step.
