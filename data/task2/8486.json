      "content": "Paper Title: A Review of Multimodal Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present and Future\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection, we explore the intrinsic interpretability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on two main categories of tasks: multimodal understanding and multimodal generation [ref]307. Tasks for multimodal understanding include image-text, video-text, audio-text, and multimodal-text understanding. In image-text understanding, BLIP-2  enhances interpretability by aligning visual and textual data through a two-stage pre-training process, which improves the coherence and relevance of image descriptions. LLaVA [ref]308 generates instruction-following data by converting image-text pairs into formats compatible with GPT-4 40, linking CLIP’s visual encoder with LLaMA’s language decoder, and fine-tuning them on visual language instruction datasets. Variants such as LLaVAMoLE , LLaVA-NeXT 71, and LLaVA-Med 72 build on this foundation, with enhancements tailored to specific domains and tasks. For video-text understanding, unlike images, videos incorporate temporal dimensions, requiring models to process static frames and understand dynamic relationships between them. This adds complexity to multimodal models but also offers richer semantic information and broader application scenarios. VideoChat 73 constructs a video-centric instruction dataset emphasizing spatio-temporal reasoning and causal relationships. This dataset enhances spatio-temporal reasoning, event localization, and causal inference, integrating video and text to improve model accuracy and robustness. Dolphins 74 combines visual and language data to interpret the driving environment and interact naturally with the driver. It provides clear, contextually relevant instructions, generates explanations for its suggestions, and continuously learns from new experiences to adapt to changing driving conditions. For audio-text understanding, audio data, with its time-series nature, necessitates models that can parse and understand temporal dynamics. This extends the capabilities of multimodal understanding. Salmonn 75 integrates a pre-trained text-based LLM with speech and audio encoders into a unified multimodal framework. This setup allows LLMs to process and comprehend general audio inputs directly, enhancing multimodal interpretability and providing insights into the relationship between text and audio data. Despite its strengths, Salmonn faces limitations in achieving comprehensive audio understanding. In contrast, Qwen-audio 76 advances this field by developing large-scale audio-language models. By leveraging extensive audio and text datasets, Qwen-audio improves the model’s ability to process and interpret diverse auditory inputs, thus pushing the boundaries of multimodal comprehension and delivering robust performance across various audio-related tasks. In multimodal-text understanding, models integrate and correlate information from various modalities (e.g., image, video, audio) with text. This involves comprehending each modality’s features and aligning them effectively. For example, Flamingo 77 merges diverse inputs to understand cross-modal correlations, addressing aspects such as temporal ordering and semantic consistency. However, it struggles with dense visual data and maintaining accuracy across modalities. To overcome these challenges, MM-REACT 78 introduces a novel prompt design that represents text descriptions, spatial coordinates, and filenames for visual signals like images and videos. This design facilitates seamless multimodal integration and improves collaboration between text and vision models. Despite the strong zero-shot performance, MM-REACT may face difficulties with new visual contexts without further training. Building on Flamingo and MM-REACT, models such as X-LLM 79, X-InstructBLIP 80, and AnyMAL 81 aim to advance multimodal understanding and response generation. By enhancing multimodal integration, these models strive to process and interpret complex real-world information with greater accuracy and versatility.\n\nReference markers found: [307]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]307: In this subsection, we explore the intrinsic interpretability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on two main categories of tasks: multimodal understanding and multimodal generation [ref]307.
