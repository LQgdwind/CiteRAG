      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Adaptive Threshold based Learning for Noisy Annotations Robust Facial Expression Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent DL based FER methods are aimed at either representation learning [ref]1 [ref]2  [ref]4   or uncertain label based learning 1    . Attention based CNN methods like SCAN [ref]2, OADN [ref]1, GACNN 2, RAN [ref]4 learn local and global features based on attention scores of different facial regions for learning robust expression features in the presence of occlusion and pose variations. FDRN  uses feature decomposition and reconstruction networks respectively for capturing similarities across different expressions and distinctive feature for each expression. Efficient-face  is a light-weight model designed using dept-wise convolution and channel modulator for capturing local-global features for robustness against occlusion and pose variations. In the same line, CERN 3 is a low-calorie power-packed architecture with 1.45M parameters which is robust to occlusion and pose variations. Although, DL based methods have achieved great success for robustness against occlusion and pose variations in FER, their unique and strong memorization learning ability makes them overfit on the noisy annotations  . Recently, some works like SCN , ULC-AG , DMUE , LDL , IPA2LT 4, CCT  and RUL 1 have attempted to mine the latent label distribution to correct the uncertain labels in FER datasets. SCN  learns the confidence score of each sample for loss-reweighing using a self-attention module. It corrects the labels of uncertain samples (low score samples) based on prediction probability. In Inconsistent Pseudo Annotations to Latent Truth (IPA2LT), multiple inconsistent human and machine predicted labels are assigned to each sample, and subsequently the true label is learnt by maximizing the log-likelihood of these inconsistent annotations. Rayleigh loss  introduces a constraint to ensure that class center is far away from nearest neighbours along with center loss. RUL 1 utilises a model to learn uncertainties of input images and uses these uncertainties to mix the features of two different labels. In CCT , three networks are trained using a convex combination of supervision loss and consistency combined using a dynamic balancing scheme to combat the influence of noisy annotated samples. LDL  proposed a label distribution learning using auxiliary-label space graphs based on action-units similarity with different expressions. DMUE  designed an uncertainty estimation module which dynamically learns from mined label distribution and ground truth label of the samples. Though these methods mine the label distribution but these have not observed effect of noisy labels in the presence of inter-class sample size imbalance and intra-class imbalance of difficulty level. To mitigate this, a dynamic class adaptive learning based framework is proposed for robust expression representation learning in the presence of noisy annotated samples .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Recent DL based FER methods are aimed at either representation learning [ref]1 [ref]2  [ref]4   or uncertain label based learning 1    .
