Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Condense-then-Select Strategy for Text Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our framework with the following strong baselines for text summarization: NeuSUM¬†[ref]14: An extractive model that applies a pointer-network¬†4 to jointly score and select the document sentences. JECS¬†: A hybrid method that follows the select-then-compress framework. It compresses each selected sentence by removing words from the sentence. Pointer-Gen. + Cov¬†: The pointer-generator network with the coverage mechanism. Deep-Reinforce¬†: An abstractive method that augments the pointer-generator network with an intra-attention mechanism and proposes a mixed training objective (RL+ML) to train the model. Sentence Rewriting¬†: A hybrid method that follows the select-then-compress framework. It uses the pointer-generator network to condense each of the selected sentences. SENECA¬†2: A hybrid method that follows the select-then-compress framework. It explicitly incorporates the entity information into the extractor. MATCHSUM¬†: An extractive model that performs extraction at the summary level by enumerating all possible combinations of sentences from a pruned document and fine-tune a BERT-based model to rank the summary candidates. SAGCopy¬†7: An abstractive model that utilizes the self-attention distribution to guide the copying process in a large pre-trained language model. PEGASUS¬†6: A large-scale pre-trained abstractive summarization model. It introduces a gap-sentences generation objective during pre-training. We also compare our framework with the following baselines for long document summarization: Discourse-aware¬†: An abstractive summarization model for a long document. It uses a hierarchical encoder to capture the discourse structure of the document and a discourse-aware decoder to generate a summary. Global-local Attentive¬†[ref]44: An extractive summarization model for a long document. It combines the global context representation of the document and the local context representation of the current section/topic using an attention mechanism. Global-local Concat¬†[ref]44: An extractive summarization model for a long document. It is similar to Global-local Attentive but it uses a concatenation operation to combine the global and local context representations. Dancer¬†: An abstractive summarization model for a long document. It divides a document into different parts and uses an abstractor to summarize each part of the document separately. Sent-PTR¬†: An extractive summarization model for a long document. It uses a hierarchical LSTM¬† to encode the document sentences and uses a pointer network¬†4 to extract sentences. Extr-Abst-TLM¬†: A hybrid summarization model for a long document. It uses the Sent-PTR model to encode document sentences then uses a Transformer language model to condense the sentences. BIGBIRD-PEGASUS¬†: A large-scale pre-trained abstractive summarization model for a long document. It introduces a sparse attention mechanism to reduce the dependency on the sequence length. The results of our framework with different abstractors are reported. We use one2one-long-short, compress-ctrl, and two-to-one to denote the results of our framework using the one-to-one long-short abstractor, compression-controllable abstractor, and two-to-one abstractor respectively. We use one2one-topùê§ùê§\\mathbf{k} to denote the results of the one-to-one top-kùëòk abstractor, e.g., one2one-top2 indicates that we take the top-222 output sequences from the beam search algorithm as the generated concise versions. We evaluate the performance of different summarization methods using the full-length ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} scores with stemming¬†. For brevity, we refer to ROUGE F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} scores as ROUGE scores.\nWe use the official Perl script to compute ROUGE scores in our experiments.\n\nFor the CNN/DM and DUC-2002 datasets, we specify the parameters444-c 95 -r 1000 -n 2 -m according to Chen and Bansal¬†. For the Pubmed dataset, we specify the parameters555-a -n 2 -r 1000 -f A according to Xiao et al.¬†[ref]44.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: We compare our framework with the following strong baselines for text summarization: NeuSUM¬†[ref]14: An extractive model that applies a pointer-network¬†4 to jointly score and select the document sentences.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
