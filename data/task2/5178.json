Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

A detailed description of the dataset is presented in Table III. Compared methods.\nThe compared methods include four parametric-free methods\n(tSNE ,\nUMAP ,\nPHATE121212https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/PHATE ,\nPaCMAP )\nand two parametric methods (\nIvis131313https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis [ref]49,\nand parametric UMAP (PUMAP)141414https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap \n) All methods map the input data to a 2-dimensional latent space for evaluation to be consistent with the visualization requirements. All models are fitted on the training set (80%) and tested on the test set (20%). The metrics of the test set are introduced to evaluate the model’s generalization performance.\nThe output of the ‘transform’ function in the official code 151515https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transform.html is used to test the generalization performance of the baseline.

Experimental Setup.\nWe initialize the parameter 𝐖𝐖\\mathbf{W} of the lasso network to 0.20.20.2 and use the Kaiming initializer to initialize the other NN parameters.
