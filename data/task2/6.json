Broader applications: By 2025, it is estimated that there will be more than to 75 billion IoT (Internet of Things) devices all connected to the internet and sharing data with each other [ref]51. Organizing, processing, and learning from device data will use federated learning techniques. It has already been shown to be a promising approach for applications such as learning the social activities of mobile phone users, early forecasting of health events like heart attack risks from wearable devices, and localization of pedestrians for autonomous vehicles . The societal impacts revolving around more invasive federated learning technologies have to be taken into account as we design future systems that increasingly leverage distributed mobile data. Applications in mental health: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of high school students report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more suicide attempts (CDC, 2015). Despite these alarming statistics, there is little consensus concerning imminent risk for suicide  . Given the impact of suicide on society, there is an urgent need to better understand the behavior markers related to suicidal ideation. “Just-in-time” adaptive interventions delivered via mobile health applications provide a platform of exciting developments in low-intensity, high-impact interventions . The ability to intervene precisely during an acute risk for suicide could dramatically reduce the loss of life. To realize this goal, we need accurate and timely methods that predict when interventions are most needed. Federated learning is particularly useful in monitoring (with participants’ permission) mobile data to assess mental health and provide early interventions. Our data collection, experimental study, and computational approaches provide a step towards data intensive longitudinal monitoring of human behavior. However, one must take care to summarize behaviors from mobile data without identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable information) or protected attributes (e.g., race, gender). This form of anonymity is critical when implementing these suicide detection technologies in real-world scenarios. Our goal is to be highly predictive of STBs while remaining as privacy-preserving as possible. We outline some of the potential privacy and security concerns below and show some possibilities brought about from the flexibility of our local models. Privacy: There are privacy risks associated with making predictions from mobile data. Although federated learning only keeps data private on each device without sending it to other locations, the presence of one’s data during distributed model training will likely affect model predictions. Therefore it is crucial to obtain user consent before collecting device data. In our experiments with real-world mobile data, all participants have given consent for their mobile device data to be collected and shared with us for research purposes. All data was anonymized and stripped of all personal (e.g., personally identifiable information) and protected attributes (e.g., race, gender). Security: Communicating model updates throughout the training process could possibly reveal sensitive information, either to a third-party, or to the central server. Federated learning is also particularly sensitive to external security attacks from adversaries . Recent methods to increase the security of federated learning systems come at the cost of reduced performance or efficiency. We believe that our proposed local-global models make federated learning more interpretable and flexible since local models can be appropriately adjusted to be more secure. However, there is a lot more work to be done in these directions, starting by accurately quantifying the trade-offs between security, privacy and performance in federated learning . Social biases: We acknowledge that there is a risk of exposure bias due to imbalanced datasets, especially when personal mobile data is involved. Models trained on biased data have been shown to amplify the underlying social biases especially when they correlate with the prediction targets . Our experiment showcased one example of maintaining fairness via adversarial training, but leaves room for future work in exploring other methods tailored for specific scenarios (e.g. debiasing words , sentences , and images 6). These methods can be easily applied to local representations before input into the global model. Future research should also focus on quantifying the trade-offs between bias and performance [ref]58. Overall, we believe that our proposed approach can help quantify the tradeoffs between local and global models regarding performance, communication, privacy, security, and fairness. Its flexibility also offers several exciting directions of future work in ensuring privacy and fairness of local representations. We hope that this brings about future opportunities for large-scale real-time analytics in healthcare and transportation using federated learning.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: and policy.
