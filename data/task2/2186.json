      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised Incremental Deep Graph Learning for Ethereum Phishing Scam Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEthereum , one of the most popular and scalable blockchains, has reached $28 billion market cap so\nfar. It unleashes the full potential of smart contracts which automatically manage and approve transactions without a\ncentralized entity, and thus attracts a lot of attention and resources via its various decentralized finance (DeFi)\napplications atop of smart contracts. However, the thriving of Ethereum also puts millions of its users at risk of\nmalicious attacks . Especially, many of these attacks, such as the phishing\nscam [ref]5[ref]34\nand Ponzi scheme , aim to extort money from their victims in\nEthereum, which is hard to defend with the software security approaches or smart contract analysis alone. Therefore, intelligent analytics at the transactional activity level is necessary. Recently, deep graph\nlearning[ref]24495\nhas shown its superior ability to learn good node representations for graphs, which is useful to downstream tasks.\nSince all transactional activities in Ethereum can naturally form a large-scale transaction graph (formulation details\nare described in Section 2.1), the effectiveness of security analytics could be greatly improved\nif leveraging the advantages of deep graph learning methods on Ethereum. Unfortunately, there are two key challenges\nwhen introducing deep graph learning on such a large-scale transaction graph for the task category of anomaly\ndetections. The first challenge is the data scalability. The size of the Ethereum transaction graph is extremely large, with over 1,151,443,821 transactions (excluding internal transactions) so far. This graph continues evolving by adding new transactions every second. After the deployment of Ethereum 2.0 in 2022, there will be thousands of transactions generated in a second. The other challenge is the label scarcity. It is in general hard to\nobtain positive samples for the training of anomaly detections. Moreover, it is usually hard to find labeled data in\nrecently-generated graph parts which need inspections most, creating an issue of temporal labeling imbalance. Existing works [ref]5[ref]34 are not able to handle large\nevolving graph and few positive labels. Instead, most of them alleviate these two challenges via the graph sampling mechanism.\nThe whole graph is shrunk to a proper computable size by picking nodes and edges related to labeled positive data.\nHowever, such a biased sampling process could lead to serious data distribution distortion and still suffers from the\nissue of temporal labeling imbalance. Additionally, most of these methods are transductive and not suitable to inductive\nscenarios like Ethereum and all other evolving graphs. In this paper, we attempt to address in a different way the challenging anomaly detection tasks on large-scale evolving\ngraphs. First, we would like to take advantage of all data we have, rather than getting rid of them. The self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) path is taken in our work because it can dig out more information through the supervision signals\ndirectly from data themselves without worrying about annotations. The SSL effectiveness has been proven by many successful cases\nin natural language processing, computer vision, and graph data 7. However, existing unsupervised methods on\ngraphs [ref]2445\ncannot directly apply onto the large-size graph, and their pretext tasks cannot fully capture both spatial and temporal\ndynamics in the graph evolving. Second, we therefore would like to design an incremental learning paradigm for such a large and evolving graph category which represents many real-world graph learning scenarios. Last, we would like to make\nour method inductive, and use the anomaly detection task of Ethereum phishing scam as an example to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our work to the downstream tasks in blockchains. Therefore, we propose a Self-supervised IncrEmental deep Graph lEarning\nmodel (SIEGE) for anomaly detection tasks like phishing scam detection on large scale evolving graphs like\nEthereum transaction graph. Instead of learning the whole graph at once, SIEGE splits the transaction graph into\npieces of suitable size (i.e. a set of Ehereum transaction blocks) and incrementally consumes them one by one in the\ntemporal order to learn the node representation. The intermediate learning results of one graph piece are passed by our\ndesign to the next piece to enable incremental computing. In this way, the size of the in-memory graph is containable\nand adaptive to changes up to date. For the learning inside a graph piece, to address the label scarcity, we employ self-supervised learning to\ngenerate the node embedding with an unsupervised representation learning approach, and design two spatial and temporal\npretext tasks to ensure that the final node representations are as informative as possible, with respect to the phishing\nscam detection task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SIEGE, we collected transaction data of about half a year on Ethereum to build the graph dataset (more than 70 million transactions), and then extensive experiments conducted in both transductive and inductive settings show that SIEGE consistently outperforms baselines by 4% ~16% in F-1 score.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: atop of smart contracts.
