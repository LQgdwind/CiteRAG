      "content": "Paper Title: Scheduling Algorithms for Federated Learning with Minimal Energy Consumption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany works in the FL community model the energy consumption or execution time of training with each data unit as constants [ref]18  [ref]20 [ref]17   .\nThis has the benefit of simplifying the problem at the cost of generality.\nOn the other hand, Khaleghzadeh, Manumachu, and Lastovetsky  have shown that the actual performance of parallel applications running on heterogeneous resources may vary with workload size (i.e., costs are not constant).\nKhaleghzadeh et al.  have later shown that this is also the case for energy.\nWe employ a general model with an optimal solution in Sections 3 and 4, and we move to more constrained scenarios in Section 5. The energy consumed by a device during training is strongly dependent on its resources and the machine learning model being used.\nFor instance, Lane et al.  have shown that the energy consumption for a single inference may vary between one and three orders of magnitude depending on the device and ML model.\nQiu et al.  illustrate differences in energy consumption during training dependending on the model, device, and FL strategy.\nAdditionally, besides hardware heterogeneity, the models being trained together may differ among devices, as is the case for personalized FL . Obtaining accurate energy consumption information for scheduling on mobile devices can be done by monitoring the devices’ utilization.\nFor instance, Walker et al.  are able to model power consumption for multiple applications with low error (<3.5%absentpercent3.5<3.5\\% on average) using performance monitoring counters available on mobile devices.\nKim and Wu  use external power meters to gather power information from different devices at different clock frequencies and states (busy or idle).\nThey then organize devices at different power and performance levels, and use this information in combination with processor utilization information (from Unix commands) to model energy. In the specific case of FL, I-Prof  has been proposed for profiling FL devices in order to predict the largest mini-batch size they can handle while respecting energy consumption and execution time limits.\nWe believe I-Prof could be adapted to gather the energy consumption information required for our scheduling needs.\nAnother option lies in Flower , a FL framework that already has the capacity to measure energy consumption on different devices, and that has been shown to be extensible . Finally, for a more general review of techniques to estimate the energy consumption of ML models, we point our readers to the survey by Garcia-Martin et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Many works in the FL community model the energy consumption or execution time of training with each data unit as constants [ref]18  [ref]20 [ref]17   .\nThis has the benefit of simplifying the problem at the cost of generality.\nOn the other hand, Khaleghzadeh, Manumachu, and Lastovetsky  have shown that the actual\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
