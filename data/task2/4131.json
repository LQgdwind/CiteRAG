      "content": "Paper Title: GraphMLP: A Graph MLP-Like Architecture for 3D Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3DHuman pose estimation from images is important in numerous applications, such as action recognition, motion capture, and augmented/virtual reality.\nMost existing works solve this task by using a 2D-to-3D pose lifting method, which takes graph-structured 2D joint coordinates detected by a 2D keypoint detector as input [ref]1   .\nThis is an inherently ambiguous problem since multiple valid 3D joint locations may correspond to the same 2D projection in the image space.\nHowever, it is practically solvable since 3D poses often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, which can provide important structural priors to mitigate the depth ambiguity  . Early works attempt to employ fully-connected networks (FCN) [ref]1 to lift the 2D joints into 3D space.\nHowever, the dense connection of FCN often results in overfitting and poor performance .\nTo address this problem, recent works consider that the skeleton of a human body can be naturally represented as the graph structure and utilize graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for this task   .\nAlthough GCN-based methods are effective in aggregating neighboring nodes to extract local features, they typically rely on learning relationships between human body joints utilizing first-order neighbors, while ignoring higher-order neighbors.\nHowever, global information between distant body joints is crucial for understanding overall body posture and movement patterns. For instance, the position of the hand relative to the foot can indicate whether the body is standing, sitting, or lying down.\nOne way to capture global information is by stacking multiple GCN layers, which expands the model’s receptive fields to cover the entire kinematic chain of a human.\nHowever, this can be computationally expensive and may lead to valuable information loss in deeper layers. Recently, Transformers  with global receptive fields have shown promising advances on various vision tasks    .\nNevertheless, the strong performance of Transformers comes at a relatively high computational cost in the self-attention block whose complexity increases quadratically with the number of input sequences.\nConsidering this, recent progress on modern multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, in particular MLP-Mixer , provides new architectural designs in vision.\nThe MLP model stacks only fully-connected layers without self-attention and consists of two types of blocks.\nThe spatial MLP aggregates global information among tokens, and the channel MLP focuses on extracting features for each token.\nBy stacking these two MLP blocks, it can be simply built with less inductive bias and achieves impressive performance in learning visual representations.\nThis motivates us to explore an MLP-Like architecture for skeleton-based representation learning. However, there remain two critical challenges in adapting the MLP models from vision to skeleton:\n(i) Despite their successes in vision, existing MLPs are less effective in modeling graph-structured data due to their simple connections among all nodes.\nDifferent from RGB images represented by highly dense pixels, skeleton inputs are inherently sparse and graph-structured data (see Fig. 2 (left)).\nWithout incorporating the prior knowledge of human body configurations, the model is prone to learning spurious dependencies, which can lead to physically implausible poses.\n(ii)\nWhile such models are capable of capturing global interactions between distant body joints (such as the hand and foot) via their spatial MLPs, they may not be good at capturing local interactions due to the lack of careful designs for modeling relationships between adjacent joints (such as the head and neck).\nHowever, local information is also essential for 3D human pose estimation, as it can help the model to understand fine-grained movement details.\nFor example, the movement of the head relative to the neck can indicate changes in gaze direction or subtle changes in posture. To overcome both limitations, we present GraphMLP, a graph-reinforced MLP-Like architecture for 3D human pose estimation, as depicted in Fig. 2.\nOur GraphMLP is conceptually simple yet effective: it builds a strong collaboration between modern MLPs and GCNs to construct a global-local-graphical unified architecture for learning better skeletal representations.\nSpecifically, the GraphMLP mainly contains a stack of novel GraphMLP layers.\nEach layer consists of two Graph-MLP blocks where the spatial graph MLP (SG-MLP) and the channel graph MLP (CG-MLP) blocks are built by injecting GCNs into the spatial MLP and channel MLP, respectively.\nBy combining MLPs and GCNs in a unified architecture, our GraphMLP is able to obtain the prior knowledge of human configurations encoded by the graph’s connectivity and capture both local and global spatial interactions among body joints, hence yielding better performance. Furthermore, we extend our GraphMLP from a single frame to a video sequence.\nMost existing video-based methods  [ref]19 0 typically model temporal information by treating each frame as a token or treating the time axis as a separated dimension.\nHowever, these methods often suffer from redundant computations that make little contribution to the final performance because nearby poses are similar 1.\nAdditionally, they are too computationally expensive to process long videos (e.g., 243 frames), thereby limiting their practical utility in real-world scenarios.\nTo tackle these issues, we propose to utilize a simple and efficient video representation of pose sequences.\nThis representation captures complex temporal dynamics by mixing temporal information in the feature channels and treating each joint as a token, offering negligible computational cost gains in the sequence length.\nIt is also a unified and flexible representation that can accommodate arbitrary-length sequences (i.e., a single frame and variable-length videos). The proposed GraphMLP is evaluated on two challenging datasets, Human3.6M 2 and MPI-INF-3DHP 3.\nExtensive experiments show the effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach, which advances the state-of-the-art performance for estimating 3D human poses from a single image.\nIts performance surpasses the previous best result 4 by 1.4 m​m𝑚𝑚mm in mean per joint position error (MPJPE) on the Human3.6M dataset.\nBesides, as shown in Fig. 1, it brings clear 6.6 m​m𝑚𝑚mm and 6.9 m​m𝑚𝑚mm improvements in MPJPE for the MLP model  and the GCN model  on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset, respectively.\nSurprisingly, compared to video pose Transformer (e.g., PoseFormer [ref]19), even with 5×5\\times fewer computational costs, our MLP-Like architecture achieves better performance. Overall, our main contributions are summarized as follows: We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first MLP-Like architecture called GraphMLP for 3D human pose estimation.\nIt combines the advantages of modern MLPs and GCNs, including globality, locality, and connectivity. The novel SG-MLP and CG-MLP blocks are proposed to encode the graph structure of human bodies within MLPs to obtain domain-specific knowledge about the human body while enabling the model to capture both local and global interactions. A simple and efficient video representation is further proposed to extend our GraphMLP to the video domain flexibly.\nThis representation enables the model to effectively process arbitrary-length sequences with negligible computational cost gains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed GraphMLP, and show new state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets, i.e., Human3.6M 2 and MPI-INF-3DHP 3.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: augmented/virtual reality.\nMost existing works solve this task by using a 2D-to-3D pose lifting method, which takes graph-structured 2D joint coordinates detected by a 2D keypoint detector as input [ref]1   .\nThis is an inherently ambiguous problem since multiple valid 3D joint locations may correspond to the same 2D projection in the image space.\nHowever, it is practically solvable since 3D\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
