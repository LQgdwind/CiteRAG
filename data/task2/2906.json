      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Cross-Modal Prediction and Relation Consistency for Semi-Supervised Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn real-world applications, object can always be represented by multiple source information, i.e., multiple modalities  [ref]2. For example, the news always contains image and text information, the video can be divided into image, audio and text information. Along this line, the study of cross-modal learning has emerged for bridging the connections among different modalities, so as to better perform downstream tasks, in which the image captioning is one of the important research directions. Specifically, image captioning aims to automatically generate natural language descriptions for images, and has emerged as a prominent research problem in both academia and industry  [ref]4  [ref]6. For example, we can automatically broadcast road conditions by learning visual images to assist driving, and can also help visually impaired users to read more conveniently. In fact, the challenge of image captioning is to learn the generator between two heterogeneous modalities (i.e., the image and text modalities), which needs to recognize salient objects in an image using computer vision techniques and generate coherent descriptions using natural language processing. To solve this problem, researchers firstly explored the neural encoder-decoder models  , which are composed of a CNN encoder and a LSTM (or Transformer) decoder. In detail, these methods firstly encode the image into a set of feature vectors using a CNN based model, each segmentation captures semantic information about an image region, then decode these feature vectors to words sequentially via a LSTM-based or Transformer-based network. Furthermore, [ref]4   adopted the single or hierarchical attention mechanism that enables the model to focus on particular image regions during decoding process. To mitigate the incorrect or repetitive content, several researches consider to edit inputs independently from the problem of generating inputs 0 . However, note that all these methods require full image-sentence pairs in advance, i.e., all the images need to be described manually, which is hard to accomplish in real-world applications. A more general scenario is shown in Figure 1, we have limited described images with corresponding label ground-truths, and a large number of undescribed images. Therefore, a resulting challenge is the “Semi-Supervised Image Captioning”, which aims to conduct the captioning task by reasonably using the huge number of undescribed images and limited supervised data. The key difficulty of semi-supervised image captioning is to design the pseudo supervision for the generated sentences. Actually, there have been some preliminary attempts recently. For example, 1 2 proposed unsupervised captioning methods, which combined the adversarial learning 3 with traditional encoder-decoder models to evaluate the quality of generated sentences. In detail, based on the traditional encoder-decoder models, these approaches employ adversarial training to generate sentences such that they are indistinguishable from the sentences within auxiliary corpus. In order to ensure that the generated captions contain the visual concepts, they additionally distill the knowledge provided by a visual concept detector into the image captioning model. However, the domain discriminator and visual concept distiller do not fundamentally evaluate the matching degree and structural rationality of the generated sentence, so the captioning performance is poor. As for semi-supervised image captioning, a straightforward way is directly utilizing the undescribed images together with their machine-generated sentences 4 5 as the pseudo image-sentence pair, to fine-tune the model. However, limited amount of parallel data can hardly establish a proper initial generator to generate precisely pseudo descriptions, which may have negative affection to the fine-tuning of visual-semantic mapping function. To circumvent this issue, we attempt to utilize the raw image as pseudo supervision. However, heterogeneous gap between modalities always leads the supervision difficulty if we directly constrain the consistency between global embedding of image and sentence. Thereby, we switch to use the broader and effective semantic prediction information, rather than directly utilize the embedding, and introduce a novel approach, dubbed semi-supervised image captioning by exploiting the Cross-modal Prediction and Relation Consistency (CPRC). In detail, there are two common approaches for traditional semi-supervised learning: 1) Pseudo labeling: it minimizes the entropy of unlabeled data using predictions; 2) Consistency regularization: it transforms the unlabeled raw images using data augmentation techniques, then constrains the consistency of transformed instances’ outputs. Different form these two techniques, we design cross-modal prediction and relation consistency by comprehensively considering the informativeness and representativeness: 1) Prediction consistency: we utilize the soft label of image to distill effective supervision for generated sentence; 2) Relation consistency: we work on encouraging the generated sentences to have similar relational distribution to the augmented image inputs. The central tenet is that the relations of learned representations can better present the consistency than individual data instance 6. Consequently, CPRC can effectively qualify the generated sentences from both the prediction confidence and distribution alignment perspectives, thereby to learn more robust mapping function. Note that CPRC can be implemented with any current captioning model, and we adopt several typical approaches for verification 7 8. Source code is available at https://github.com/njustkmg/CPRC. In summary, the contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows: We propose a novel semi-supervised image captioning framework for processing undescribed images, which is universal for any captioning model; We design the cross-modal prediction and relation consistency to measure the undescribed images, which maps the raw image and corresponding generated sentence into the shared semantic space, and supervises the generated sentence by distilling the soft label from image prediction and constraining the cross-modal relational consistency; In experiments, our approach improves the performance under semi-supervised scenario, which validates that knowledge hidden in the content and relation is effective for enhancing the generator.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: In real-world applications, object can always be represented by multiple source information, i.e., multiple modalities  [ref]2.
