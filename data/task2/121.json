      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Dynamic Belief Graphs to Generalize on Text-Based Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDynamic graph extraction: Numerous recent works have focused on constructing graphs to encode structured representations of raw data, for various tasks.\nKipf et al.,  propose contrastive methods to learn latent structured world models (C-SWMs) as state representations for vision-based environments. Their work, however, does not focus on learning policies to play games or to generalize across varying environments.\nDas et al.,  leverage a machine reading comprehension mechanism to query for entities and states in short text passages and use a dynamic graph structure to track changing entity states.\nFan et al.,  propose to encode graph representations by linearizing the graph as an input sequence in NLP tasks.\nJohnson,  construct graphs from text data using gated graph transformer neural networks.\nYang et al.,  learn transferable latent relational graphs from raw data in a self-supervised manner.\nCompared to the existing literature, our work aims to infer multi-relational KGs dynamically from partial text observations of the state and subsequently use these graphs to inform general policies.\nConcurrently, Srinivas et al.,  propose to learn state representations with contrastive learning methods to facilitate RL training.\nHowever, they focus on vision-based environments and they do not investigate generalization. More generally, we want to note that compared to traditional knowledge base construction (KBC) works, our approach is more related to the direction of neural relational inference .\nIn particular, we seek to generate task-specific graphs, which tend to be dynamic, contextual and relatively small, whereas traditional KBC focus on generating large, static graphs. Playing Text-based Games: Recent years have seen a host of work on playing text-based games.\nVarious deep learning agents have been explored    [ref]51  [ref]3  .\nFulda et al.,  use pre-trained embeddings to reduce the action space.\nZahavy et al., [ref]51, Seurin et al., , and Jain et al.,  explicitly condition an agent’s decisions on game feedback.\nMost of this literature trains and tests on a single game without considering generalization.\nUrbanek et al.,  use memory networks and ranking systems to tackle adventure-themed dialog tasks.\nYuan et al.,  propose a count-based memory to explore and generalize on simple unseen text-based games.\nMadotto et al.,  use GoExplore  with imitation learning to generalize.\nAdolphs and Hofmann,  and Yin and May, 2019b 8 also investigate the multi-game setting.\nThese methods rely either on reward shaping by heuristics, imitation learning, or rule-based features as inputs.\nWe aim to minimize hand-crafting, so our action selector is optimized only using raw rewards from games while other components of our model are pre-trained on related data.\nRecently, Ammanabrolu and Riedl, , Ammanabrolu and Hausknecht, [ref]3, Yin and May, 2019b 8 leverage graph structure by using rule-based, untrained mechanisms to construct KGs to play text-based games.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: KBC focus on generating large, static graphs.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
