      "content": "Paper Title: A hybrid classification-regression approach for 3D hand pose estimation using graph convolutional networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe classify 3D hand pose estimation methods based on the input modality into three categories depth-based, multiview RGB-based, and monocular RGB-based. In the past few years, numerous studies adopt deep learning techniques to handle various types of inputs for depth methods, such as 2D pixels  [ref]2  , a set of 3D points [ref]6  or voxels . In the second category, several studies use many RGB cameras on different angles to alleviate the occlusion problem  . RGB cameras are more available compared to the two-mentioned categories. There are several attempts to solve the problem with model-based methods  0 1. These methods search the closest configuration that fits the hand model via an optimization process. They require powerful prior knowledge about many dynamic and physics hypotheses, which leads to poor performances. Deep generative-based approaches exhibit promising performances and generate accurate 3D poses. 0 employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) 2 to translate synthetic labeled data to realistic images to reduce the domain gap. 3 uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) 3 to learn a shared latent space across RGB and depth modalities to remedy the missing depth ambiguity. However, These methods model black-box latent representations, which synthesize a single 3D pose for a given RGB image. To address this issue, 4 5 disentangle the diverse factors that affect the hand visualization, including camera viewpoint, scene context and background. Discriminative methods act as a function that maps directly between the RGB image and the 3D pose using large-scale annotated datasets. 7 is one of the first attempts that estimates the 3D hand pose from a monocular RGB image. It employs synthetic data and three concatenated networks: hand segmenter, 2D keypoint and 3D hand pose predictors. After this work, many deep-based studies have been proposed to improve 3D hand pose estimation. 6 estimates 3D hand poses by combining CNN with a kinematic 3D hand model. 8 leverage depth information to supervise the training by having a pair of RGB-RGBD images. 9 uses a two-stack hourglass with latent 2.5D heatmaps and lift them to 3D. Other approaches achieve reliable 3D poses by regressing the hand mesh and estimating the 3D pose from it  4  5. However, these methods require additional supervision since the datasets must include both the meshes and the 3D poses. More recently, 6 proposed a knowledge distillation and generalization framework for RGB-based pose estimation. GCN [ref]22 became a hot topic of research in the computer vision field since there exist several problems that have graph-like structures as input.  applies GCNs [ref]22 to estimate the 3D pose with the help of a weakly-supervised training strategy that employs depth regularizer.  exploits spatial and temporal relationships for 3D human and hand pose estimation tasks.  introduces a self-supervised module that uses 2D relationships and 3D geometric knowledge to reduce the gap between 2D and 3D spaces.  proposes a UNet-based GCNs to estimate the 3D hand pose and the 6D object pose. It learns global geometric relationship constraints for all hand poses. This paper introduces a GCN-based framework for 3D hand pose estimation using a single RGB image. It exploits the spatial dependencies information between joints to learn per-pose relationship constraints yielding better performance than the global one. The proposed approach does not require depth nor meshes supervision.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: multiview RGB-based, and monocular RGB-based.
