      "content": "Paper Title: Information Symmetry Matters: A Modal-Alternating Propagation Network for Few-Shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe choose fourteen popular meta-learning based methods as competitors, including both nonsemantic-based methods and semantic-based methods: (1) Nonsemantic-based methods. Metric-based methods: Matching Networks [ref]5, Prototypical Networks [ref]6, Relation Networks , TADAM [ref]45 and FEAT . Optimization-based methods: MAML , ARML . Data-augmentation-based methods: AFHN . (2) Semantic-based methods. Guiding embeddings with semantics: AM3 , Multi-Semantics , Comp. , SoSN-ArL , AGAM . Generating embeddings with semantics: Dual TriNet . We compare our MAP-Net with these methods with both ConvNet-4 and ResNet-12 on CUB. Since there is no method in previous conduct the experiments with ResNet-12 on SUN and Flower, we compare our method with these methods on them only with the ConvNet-4. Table II, III, IV show the results on three benchmark datasets respectively. It can be observed that our method outperforms all methods on three datasets in cases of ConvNet-4 and ResNet-12 backbones. Particularly, our MAP-Net achieves 5.05% and 4.22% performance gains on CUB, 2.58% and 0.22% on SUN, and 1.2% and 1.14% on Flower with the backbone ConvNet-4 against the second-best method on both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. For ResNet-12 on CUB, MAP-Net also obtains the best performance on both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, which outperforms the second-best approach AGAM  in 2.87% and 1.13% respectively. Besides, we have the following three observations.\n(1) The improvements are more significant on 1-shot setting than those on 5-shot setting. It proves that the auxiliary semantic information is more beneficial in the occasion with extremely few visual samples.\n(2) The improvements with ResNet-12 are inferior to those with ConvNet-4. It demonstrates that the complex feature encoder suppresses the effectiveness of semantic information. When the feature encoder extracts more discriminative embeddings, the balance between visual and semantic modalities is broken due to that the information carried from semantic vectors is finite.\n(3) It is observed that the performance is improved slightly on 5-shot setting of SUN. We suppose the main reason is that the attribute vectors of SUN are too sparse that the effectiveness is suppressed when the visual information increasing.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: popular meta-learning based methods as competitors, including both nonsemantic-based methods and semantic-based methods: (1) Nonsemantic-based methods.
