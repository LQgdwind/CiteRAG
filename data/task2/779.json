SCM come in different types based on the technology used and they\ndiffer in size, density, latency, throughput, power and cost.\nAn ideal SCM for tomorrow‚Äôs data center has TBs of memory capacity,\nprovides at worst microsecond latency, offers high memory bandwidth,\nhas very low power consumption, offers high memory parallelism, and is very cheap. Unfortunately, none of the existing SCM in literature and products satisfy all the requirement\nof ideal SCM needed for tomorrow‚Äôs data center main memory.\nThe new 3DXPoint memory technology provides an access latency of less than 1Œºùúá\\mus but is only about four times denser than DRAM at a density of 0.62Gbit/mm2¬† compared to DRAM‚Äôs density of 0.132Gbit/mm2¬†.\nFurthermore, it suffers from limited memory size, DRAM like energy consumption, and\nhigh costs at $6.75/GB¬†.\nIn fact the only storage class memory that satisfies most of the requirements is the mature Flash memory technology.\nFlash offers high throughput, thanks to several levels of parallelism,\nprovides high density at 4.34Gbit/mm2¬†, consumes very low power per memory access,\nand is very cheap at $0.1/GB¬†. Using Flash based SSDs as part of main memory has been shown to be a practical\napproach to address the memory capacity requirements for data intensive applications¬†.\nThis is because Flash random access latency has now been reduced to just few tens of microseconds¬† [ref]22.\nState-of-the-art systems support large memory capacities by memory-mapping SSDs and leveraging the\npaging mechanism to access the data.\nHowever, such a scheme suffers from long latencies and low throughput due to high overhead from the software stack.\nPrior work such as¬† 5 [ref]20 has tackled this high\noverhead by enabling cache line access to the SSD¬†[ref]20 , using host DRAM as a cache¬†5, merging multiple translation layers\ninto one layer, and promoting pages from SSD when locality is detected¬†.\nDue to its benefits, Flash memory is abundantly available, extensively used, and continues to be optimized to provide better performance¬† [ref]22 [ref]35.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: a practical\napproach to address the memory capacity requirements for data intensive applications¬†.\nThis is because Flash random access latency has now been reduced to just few tens of microseconds¬† [ref]22.\nState-of-the-art systems support large memory capacities by memory-mapping SSDs and leveraging the\npaging mechanism to access the data.\nHowever, such a scheme suffers from long latencies and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
