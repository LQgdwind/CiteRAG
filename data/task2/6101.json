The new filters are based\non graphs that were introduced by Cai, Fürer and Immerman \nabout 30 years ago to show limitations of the Weisfeiler-Lehman\nmethod  , a particular\nheuristic for graph isomorphism. The simplest instantiation of this\nmethod is the so-called color refinement algorithm, which compares\nthe iterated degree sequences of two graphs. This sequence is identical\nfor isomorphic graphs, but already very simple non-isomorphic graphs\nmay have identical iterated degree sequences. The k𝑘k-dimensional\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (k𝑘k-WL) algorithms for k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} are higher-dimensional\nvariants of color refinement that compare iterated neighborhoods of\nk𝑘k-tuples of vertices. These algorithms have also been linked to\nhomomorphism counts  \nand were investigated in group-theoretic, algebraic and category-theoretic\nsettings [ref]3  . Cai, Fürer and Immerman \nshowed that, for every k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, there exist two non-isomorphic\ngraphs that are not distinguished by k𝑘k-WL. It follows that no fixed\nlevel in the hierarchy of k𝑘k-WL algorithms can solve the graph isomorphism\nproblem. By a known slight modification of the original CFI construction [ref]37 [ref]35,\nwe can transform any connected colorful graph S𝑆S into two S𝑆S-colored\ngraphs X=X​(S)𝑋𝑋𝑆X=X(S) and X~=X~​(S)~𝑋~𝑋𝑆\\tilde{X}=\\tilde{X}(S), as shown in Figure 1. These graphs each have 2Δ​(S)−1superscript2Δ𝑆12^{\\Delta(S)-1} vertices per color class\nand come with a remarkable property: For any edge i​j∈E​(S)𝑖𝑗𝐸𝑆ij\\in E(S), deleting\nall edges between colors i𝑖i and j𝑗j renders X𝑋X and X~~𝑋\\tilde{X}\nisomorphic. Intuitively speaking, this means that X𝑋X and X~~𝑋\\tilde{X}\ncan only be distinguished by inspecting all of their edge-color classes.\nThus, if some edge-color class of S𝑆S is missing in a graph H𝐻H,\nthen homomorphisms from H𝐻H cannot distinguish X𝑋X and X~~𝑋\\tilde{X},\nsince they cannot inspect this edge-color class, and we have hom⁡(H,X)=hom⁡(H,X~)hom𝐻𝑋hom𝐻~𝑋\\hom(H,X)=\\hom(H,\\tilde{X})\nand thus hom⁡(H,X−X~)=0hom𝐻𝑋~𝑋0\\hom(H,X-\\tilde{X})=0.333Similar features of CFI graphs were observed by Roberson [ref]37\nin the study of oddomorphisms in an uncolored setting. For the surjectively S𝑆S-colored graph S𝑆S itself however, it can\nbe shown that hom⁡(S,X−X~)=2|E​(S)|−|V​(S)|+1hom𝑆𝑋~𝑋superscript2𝐸𝑆𝑉𝑆1\\hom(S,X-\\tilde{X})=2^{|E(S)|-|V(S)|+1}. We can thus\nnormalize by this number and obtain: Given a colorful graph S𝑆S that is connected\nand has no isolated vertices, there exists a quantum graph 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}\nwith two constituents, each with at most 2Δ​(S)−1superscript2Δ𝑆12^{\\Delta(S)-1} vertices\nper color class, that filters {S}𝑆\\{S\\} out of {S}∪𝒩​(S)𝑆𝒩𝑆\\{S\\}\\cup\\mathcal{N}(S),\nwhere 𝒩​(S)𝒩𝑆\\mathcal{N}(S) is the set of graphs that are not surjectively\nS𝑆S-colored. The constituents and coefficients of 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} can\nbe computed in time O​(4Δ​(S)​|V​(S)|)𝑂superscript4Δ𝑆𝑉𝑆O(4^{\\Delta(S)}|V(S)|). Note that 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} is not actually a filter for surjectively\nS𝑆S-colored graphs, as it only filters {S}𝑆\\{S\\} out of {S}∪𝒩​(S)𝑆𝒩𝑆\\{S\\}\\cup\\mathcal{N}(S).\nThis will however suffice to prove Theorem 9 along\nthe lines of Facts 18 and 21\nif we replace the inclusion-exclusion based filter from Fact 21\nby our new CFI-graph based filters from Lemma 22. Finally, in order to obtain the full Theorem 9,\nwe need to reduce from hom⁡(S,⋅)hom𝑆⋅\\hom(S,\\,\\cdot\\,) for colorful S𝑆S to graph\nmotif parameters p𝑝p with T∘◁p◁superscript𝑇𝑝T^{\\circ}\\triangleleft\\,p for some supergraph\nT⊇S𝑆𝑇T\\supseteq S. This requires adding “dummy edges”, which yields\ntechnicalities that lead to requirements (a)–(c) in the theorem\nto avoid unwanted cancellations.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: iterated neighborhoods of\nk𝑘k-tuples of vertices.

Cai, Fürer and Immerman \nshowed that, for every k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, there exist two non-isomorphic\ngraphs that are not distinguished by k𝑘k-WL.
