      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Graph Transformer with Adaptive Node Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, Transformer [ref]33 has shown its superiority in an increasing number of domains [ref]7 [ref]8 , e.g. Bert [ref]7 in NLP and ViT [ref]8 in CV.\nExisting works attempting to generalize Transformer to graph data mainly focus on two problems: (1) How to design dedicated positional encoding for the nodes; (2) How to alleviate the quadratic computational complexity of the vanilla Transformer and scale the Graph Transformer to large graphs.\nAs for the positional encoding, GT  firstly uses Laplacian eigenvectors to enhance node features. Graph-Bert  studies employing Weisfeiler-Lehman code to encode structural information. Graphormer  utilizes centrality encoding to enhance node features while incorporating edge information with spatial (SPD-indexed\nattention bias) and edge encoding.\nSAN  further replaces the static Laplacian eigenvectors with learnable positional encodings and designs an attention mechanism that distinguishes local connectivity.\nFor the scalability issue, one immediate idea is to restrict the number of attending nodes. For example, GAT  and GT-Sparse  only consider the 1-hop neighboring nodes; Gophormer  uses GraphSAGE  sampling to uniformly sample ego-graphs with pre-defined maximum depth; Graph-Bert  restricts the receptive field of each node to the nodes with top-k intimacy scores (e.g., Katz and PPR). However, these fixed node sampling strategies sacrifice the advantage of the Transformer architecture. SAC  tries to use an LSTM edge predictor to predict edges for self-attention operations. However, the fact that LSTM can hardly be parallelized reduces the computational efficiency of the Transformer.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Recently, Transformer [ref]33 has shown its superiority in an increasing number of domains [ref]7 [ref]8 , e.g. Bert [ref]7 in NLP and ViT [ref]8 in CV.\nExisting works attempting to generalize Transformer to graph data\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
