      "content": "Paper Title: A Practical Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables, I\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we develop a Hoare-style logic for quantum programs with classical variables, termed 𝑄𝐻𝐿+\\mathit{QHL}^{+}. It incorporates the following key features: support for quantum arrays and parameterised quantum gates, enabling more versatile quantum programming; and a syntax for quantum predicates, allowing the construction of complex quantum predicate formulas from atomic predicates using logical connectives. These quantum predicate formulas can also be parameterised by classical variables. Consequently, preconditions and postconditions can be expressed as pairs consisting of a classical first-order logical formula (describing properties of classical variables) and a quantum predicate formula (describing properties of quantum variables). The first feature enhances the convenience of quantum programming, while the second facilitates the derivation of a simple proof system for quantum programs through minimal modifications to classical Hoare logic. As a result, 𝑄𝐻𝐿+\\mathit{QHL}^{+} allows for more intuitive specification of quantum program correctness and enables more effective verification compared to previous approaches. In particular, classical first-order logic can be seamlessly integrated with 𝑄𝐻𝐿+\\mathit{QHL}^{+} for verifying quantum programs with classical variables. To conclude this paper, we would like to point out several topics for further research: Formalisation of the logic 𝑄𝐻𝐿+\\mathit{QHL}^{+} for quantum programs with classical variables in proof assistants such as Coq, Isabelle/HOL, or Lean. Applications to the verification of quantum algorithms, QEC (quantum error correction) codes and quantum communication and cryptographic protocols, leveraging the tools developed in point (1). Extension of 𝑄𝐻𝐿+\\mathit{QHL}^{+} to parallel and distributed quantum programs   as well as its applications to relational reasoning   0 , local reasoning [ref]27 , and reasoning about incorrectness  of quantum programs. Broader applications of the quantum programming language 𝑞𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑒+\\mathit{qWhile}^{+} and the assertion language defined in Section 4, beyond verification. For instance, these could be utilised to develop more advanced techniques of abstract interpretation   7, refinement 5  and symbolic execution  [ref]7 4  for quantum programs.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: the tools developed in point (1).
