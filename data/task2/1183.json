      "content": "Paper Title: Attentional Separation-and-Aggregation Network for Self-supervised Depth-Pose Learning in Dynamic Scenes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised joint depth-pose learning is an emerging topic in recent years, which links depth and ego-motion via structure-from-motion (SfM). Zhou et al. [ref]10 proposed a pioneering work in this area. On this basis, some of the follow-up works put forward new consistency constraints  [ref]11 , and some added occlusion processing in the training framework [ref]13 . Moving objects are also a concern in this genre because they are not satisfied with the transformation calculated by ego-motion. The auto-masking approach proposed by Godard et al. [ref]13 can avoid the influence of objects that are relatively stationary with the agent. Casser et al.  and Gordon et al.  proposed to segment all instances in advance by a pre-trained Mask R-CNN  model and then to estimate the motion field for these individuals. As a similar self-supervised video learning task, self-supervised scene flow learning is also facing moving objects, where some works   use residual flow to narrow the gap caused by moving objects. Unlike these methods, our method uses the attention mechanism to explore the dynamic features of the scene directly and automatically adapts to the static and dynamic elements during training. On the other hand, some recent works attempted to incorporate geometric VO into the self-supervised manner. Zhen et al.  first proposed to utilize a FlowNet to predict bi-directional optical flows and samples corresponding points from flows with least forward-backward flow inconsistency to solve fundamental matrix. Zhao et al.  further introduced the self-supervised manner to this paradigm and enhanced the generalization ability. However, these geometric VO methods all spend most of their time on feature extraction (or flow estimation) and matching, which makes the method difficult to achieve high running speed. Despite a performance gap from geometric VO, end-to-end VO (or called direct VO) has good potential and can run in real-time.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Self-supervised joint depth-pose learning is an emerging topic in recent years, which links depth and ego-motion via structure-from-motion (SfM).
