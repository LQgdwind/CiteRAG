      "content": "Paper Title: 6GAN: IPv6 Multi-Pattern Target Generation via Generative Adversarial Nets with Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n1) Traditional Design Algorithms. Traditional design algorithms refer to target generation algorithms designed based on human experience and assumptions. Ullrich et al. [ref]12 used a recursive algorithm for the first attempt to target generation. The algorithm greedily determines the bit by reaching the most addresses in the seed set in each recursion until remaining reserved bits. Foremski et al.  proposed Entropy/IP, which employs a Bayesian network to model the statistical dependence between the values of different entropy segments. The statistical model could generate addresses for scanning. Murdock et al.  introduced 6Gen, which generates the densest address range clusters by combining the closest Hamming distance addresses in each iteration. Zhizhu et al. [ref]15 implemented 6Tree, which performs information entropy to construct a space tree to discover active regions and dynamically adjust the exploration direction according to the scan results. The work achieves a faster linear time complexity compared to 6Gen. 2) Deep Learning Approaches. The exploitation of deep learning approaches to achieve the algorithm has recently been developed because of the adaptability to different datasets. Cui et al. [ref]16 proposed 6GCVAE to complete the first attempt to employ deep learning architecture. They used the Variational Autoencoder  with gated convolutional layers to discover active addresses and proved that seed classification can improve the experimental performance. Cui et al.  introduced 6VecLM, which utilizes a Transformer network  to build an IPv6 language model, i.e., learning sequence relationships and using softmax temperature  to generate creative addresses. Table I compares the instantiations of these works with our approach. 6GAN achieves address discovery in multiple patterns and detecting aliased regions during model training to generate high-quality candidate sets without wasting budget.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: 1) Traditional Design Algorithms.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
