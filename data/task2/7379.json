      "content": "Paper Title: OpenMoE: An Early Effort on Open Mixture-of-Experts Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBefore all, we highlight that we did not hack the benchmarks at all and the pre-training is purely on the open-sourced datasets mentioned above. Since our model is relatively small in terms of training budget, we mainly evaluate the raw model on established but not that hard benchmarks, i.e., TriviaQA [ref]22, HumanEval [ref]8, WMT16-En-Ro , BigBench-Lite (24 tasks) [ref]4, and a subset of the lm-evaluation-harness collection  with 13 tasks. For popular but relatively challenging benchmarks like 5-shot MMLU , our OpenMoE-8B/32E achieves around 26.2% accuracy, which means the model is almost randomly guessing from the four options. We mainly compare with the open-sourced models with more training cost, i.e., TinyLLaMA-1.1B  and OpenLLaMA-3B . On BigBench-Lite, we also compare with GPT-3 , Big-G [ref]4 and Big-G-Sparse [ref]4. Big-G and Big-G-Sparse are two sets of Google in-house Transformer models evaluated on BigBench-Lite, and Big-G-Sparse models are MoE-based Transformers. We first report our results on Commonsense QA (TriviaQA), Coding (HumanEval), and Low-resource Machine Translation (WMT16 En-Ro). We think these three benchmarks are meaningful for us because (1) Commonsense is to check whether OpenMoE can memorize more commonsense given its efficient parameter scaling advantage; (2) Coding is important because of its prevalent use cases in solving coding-related user prompts, LLM as agents, and embodied AI; (3) Low-resource Machine Translation is important because we want to share the benefits of foundation models to everyone on earth. As shown in Table 4, OpenMoE-8B/32E outperforms baselines clearly with less training cost (Activated parameter×\\timesTotal Training tokens). Also, please note that TinyLLaMA-1.1B performs significantly worse than other models on TriviaQA although it has a comparable training cost with OpenLLaMA-3B. Therefore, this highlights the importance of the number of parameters to keeping knowledge in LLMs, which also indicates the significance of using MoE. In Table 5, OpenMoE models achieve better performance than baselines. OpenMoE-34B/32E only used 70B code data, while it still performs relatively well on HumanEval, which shows the scalability of OpenMoE, although we don’t have enough computation resources to train it until the end. OpenLLaMA-3B struggles on HumanEval because consecutive whitespaces are treated as one, contradicting the Python syntax. Table 6 shows our results on WMT16 En-Ro translation task. Note that our model did not include much multi-lingual data intentionally. Most multi-lingual data should be from the multi-lingual version of Wikipedia in the RedPajama, which is also used in TinyLLaMA-1.1B and OpenLLaMA-3B. However, OpenMoE models still show better results than baselines, which potentially highlights the importance of umT5 tokenizer. In Figure 3, the relative cost is computed based on multiplying activated parameters (Act. Params) in Transformer blocks and the number of training tokens. The size of the color dots denotes the number of activated parameters, and the size of the shadow denotes the number of total parameters for MoE models. We can observe that OpenMoE achieved a better cost-effectiveness trade-off on BigBench-Lite, in terms of both training and inference cost. We also evaluate OpenMoE on the 13 tasks from the LM-Evaluation-Harness collection. As shown in Table 7, both OpenMoE and TinyLLaMA performed worse than OpenLLaMA. However, the scores achieved by OpenMOE are acceptable. We suggest that the initial high sampling rate on the code data may harm the results on these text-dominated benchmarks, which is one of the issues we will discuss in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: open-sourced datasets mentioned above.
