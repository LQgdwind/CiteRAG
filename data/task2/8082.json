      "content": "Paper Title: SiTe CiM: Signed Ternary Computing-in-Memory for Ultra-Low Precision Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized a variety of fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, etc. due to their ability to transcend human accuracy for a multitude of complex cognitive tasks . However, this success has come at the cost of enormous computation and storage demands, which has limited their deployment in energy-constrained applications such as edge devices . DNN compression using reduced precision weights and activations is a widely adopted approach to decrease network complexity and resources [ref]3 [ref]4  [ref]6. Many works have demonstrated aggressive scaling to ultra-low precisions, all the way up to binary precision (one bit per parameter) [ref]3 [ref]4  [ref]6. Amongst such ultra-low precision DNNs, ternary precision, in which DNN parameters are quantized to {-1,0,1}, has been proposed    as a sweet spot of trade-off for energy and accuracy needs. Offering large energy savings, it suffers a mild loss in accuracy compared to full precision DNNs while showing significant accuracy improvements over binary DNNs, especially for complex tasks. An eventual objective of optimizations such as reduced precision at the software level is that they are successfully realized onto a hardware substrate. After commercial success of hardware accelerators with reduced precision (e.g., 4, 8-bit fixed point implementations 0, 1), ongoing efforts have continued to push the boundary towards designing accelerators that support ultra-low precisions (2-4 bits) 2, 3 This motivates us to explore hardware accelerator designs for ternary precision leveraging its amicable trade-offs for energy and accuracy. The paradigm of computing-in-memory (CiM) is a great fit for hardware acceleration since it alleviates concerns faced by von-Neumann based accelerators. Although traditional accelerators such as TPU and GPU Tensor cores 0, 1 leverage their specialized architectures for vector-matrix multiplications (which form the dominant kernels in DNNs), they suffer from the memory wall problem caused by repeated interaction of the processor with memory. CiM performs vector-matrix multiplications within a memory macro, thereby limiting processor-memory calls and mitigating the memory wall problem 4, 5. Over time, CiM has been successfully demonstrated using CMOS based memories such as SRAM 4 as well as post-CMOS non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as RRAM, STT MRAM and FEFET 5. While the former offers low write power, maturity of technology and high endurance, NVMs bring attractive attributes for DNNs such non-volatility, high area efficiency and zero stand-by leakage. Given a large promise of ultra-low precision DNNs and CiM for edge computing, energy efficient hardware accelerators coupling both these design aspects have been in the fore 4, 5. Several of them have been designed for signed binary inputs and signed binary weights, unsigned binary inputs and signed binary weights, signed binary inputs with signed ternary weights and unsigned binary inputs with signed ternary weights. For example, XNOR-SRAM 6 and XNOR-RRAM 7 have demonstrated CiM for signed binary inputs and weights. Other proposals include 6T-SRAM 6 and embedded-DRAM (eDRAM) 8 based ternary cells that function with ternary weights and binary operands/activations. However, little work has been done in the design of CiM-based primitives in the signed ternary regime, with both weights and activations encoded as signed ternary. Such designs can be highly useful not only for ternary precison DNNs but potentially can also be generalized for higher precision DNNs with signed activation functions such as transformer models 9. To that end, an in-memory DNN architecture utilizing a specially designed SRAM 0 was proposed that performs dot product computation in the signed ternary regime and shows the benefits of massive parallelism, low energy and small accuracy loss. However, this comes at the cost of area. Taking this effort forward, we explored a signed ternary hardware accelerator design with ferroelectric metal transistor (FEMFET) in 1. The proposed 3T-FEMFET based ternary cell is realized with an overhead of two additional transistors which are used to cross-couple two underlying FEMFET bit-cells. This resulted in a ∼similar-to\\sim3.3X lower cell area than the SRAM based implementation 0, 1. In this paper, we expand on our FEMFET-based design 1 by exploring two techniques to achieve cross-coupling between memory cells for signed ternary CiM and analyzing their implications for three memory technologies. The specific contributions of this work are outlined below. We propose designs of signed ternary CiM (SiTe CiM) for two CMOS memories, (a) 8T-SRAM, and (b) 3T-eDRAM, and (c) a post-CMOS non-volatile 3T-FEMFET memory. We focus on two flavors of SiTe CiM: (a) SiTe CiM I for optimizing latency-energy and (b) SiTe CiM II aimed at higher area efficiency. We perform array level analysis of SiTe CiM I/II based on 8T-SRAM, 3T-eDRAM and 3T-FEMFET cells and compare their energy, performance and area metrics with the respective near-memory baseline designs. We evaluate the system-level performance and energy of SiTe CiM I/II by incorporating the proposed arrays in a ternary DNN accelerator for a wide range of state-of-the-art benchmarks, including both deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: in energy-constrained applications such as edge devices .
