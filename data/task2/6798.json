      "content": "Paper Title: PDPK: A Framework to Synthesise Process Data and Corresponding Procedural Knowledge for Manufacturing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile learning systems and machine learning enjoy a streak of successes in academic and industrial settings, their lack of the ability to reason and to generalise to unseen data remain hindrances to several use cases in practice.\nIncluding background knowledge, e. g. through knowledge infusion or neurosymbolic learning, could provide one possible solution to these problems .\nOften, knowledge graphs are employed to represent background knowledge and are embedded into low dimensional vector representations   to facilitate their use in other downstream tasks and learning systems .\nWhile factual and conceptual knowledge—knowledge of terminologies, classifications and generalisations [ref]5—is often encountered in knowledge graphs     procedural and metacognitive knowledge—that describe knowledge of techniques and when to apply them as well as contextual knowledge [ref]5—is seldom researched 0.\nConsequently, knowledge graph embedding methods are primarily developed and benchmarked on knowledge graphs containing factual and conceptual knowledge.\nThis leads to a situation where potential downstream systems are only capable of including factual or conceptual knowledge.\nIn practice, however, procedural and metacognitive knowledge play a significant part in representing reasoning and problem mitigation strategies, e. g. in manufacturing 1.\nHere, incorporating tacit operator knowledge presents itself as one alternative to improve learning systems, e. g. for predictive quality use cases, which suffer from scarce data due to manually optimized production processes. In this domain, however, procedural knowledge and its representations in knowledge graphs exhibit several characteristics that differentiate it from factual knowledge, e. g. ternary or chained binary relations, which introduce indirections, as well as asymmetry and literals, depending on the modelling detail 0 2.\nAlso, the overall size of the knowledge graphs is significantly smaller than those of established knowledge bases, e. g. Freebase  or WordNet .\nConsequently, we surmise that studying established knowledge graph embedding methods on knowledge graphs containing procedural knowledge is an interesting research topic which, to the best of our knowledge, lacks public datasets.\nTo address this issue, we present a framework for generating synthetic datasets in manufacturing contexts which is highly configurable to suit a multitude of manufacturing scenarios, modular to ensure adaptability to unforeseen scenarios, and synthesises process data according to underlying rules for which representations in procedural knowledge graphs are generated. While a detailed simulation of the reality is beyond the scope of this framework datasets can be synthesised that have characteristics similar to those exhibited by real-world procedural knowledge.\nThese datasets can be used to enable research into the interplay of procedural knowledge and process data, e. g. evaluating predictive quality systems, approaches of knowledge-infused machine learning, data-based knowledge extraction as well as embeddings of procedural knowledge. Apart from presenting the framework, we investigate its capability to produce datasets with characteristics that are exhibited by procedural knowledge in real-world manufacturing processes.\nTo this end, we compare a synthesised dataset to one gained in a fused-deposition-modelling (FDM) process—an additive manufacturing technique—on a link prediction task as well as on a metric designed to indicate downstream applicability of embeddings. Based on related works and the state of the art (see Section 2), Section 3 describes the underlying assumptions and inner workings of the dataset generation founded on an understanding of production processes according to 3.\nBuilding on this, we present our benchmark dataset on which we evaluate several established knowledge graph embedding methodologies (see Section 4).\nWhile future work is presented in Section 5, Section 6 concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: representations   to facilitate their use in other downstream tasks and learning systems .\nWhile factual and conceptual knowledge—knowledge of terminologies, classifications and generalisations [ref]5—is often encountered in knowledge graphs     procedural and metacognitive knowledge—that describe knowledge of techniques and when to apply them as well as contextual knowledge [ref]5—is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
