      "content": "Paper Title: Spatial Reasoning for Few-Shot Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFew-shot learning aims to recognize novel categories utilizing a few training examples. To solve this problem, most researchers have focused on few-shot classification where an object is clearly placed in an image   [ref]26. In other words, the approaches do not consider the concept of backgrounds and bounding box regression. On the other hand, few-shot object detectors where the goal is to detect multiple objects of various sizes and locations have been recently developed to address a more challenging problem. For example, FSRW  uses a sub-network to predict categorical attention vectors that are exploited to re-wight feature maps from YOLOv2 [ref]27. Then, a prediction layer is re-modeled based on the category-attentive feature maps. To ensure the attention vector is generalizable to unseen categories, a meta learning approach is adopted during training base categories. As a result, this process enables a model to learn where to attention with only a few training examples for each category using a re-weighting network. At the same time, Meta R-CNN [ref]17 and FSIW  were developed with the same motivation but use Faster R-CNN  as a backbone. Instead of using an attention mechanism, MetaDet  aims at directly generating classification and regression weights given an image. This approach utilizes information from base categories with a large-scale dataset to produce the weights of novel categories. MPSR  tackled an improper scale issue where positive RoI samples in a test image (e.g., the face of a dog) can be treated as negetive RoI samples in a training image (e.g., the whole body of a dog) and argued that it becomes worse in few-shot environments. To suppress the effect of improper negative samples, an object-wise multi-scale feature extractor was developed to increase the number of positive samples using an image pyramid. Overall, the previous approaches train an auxiliary branch on base categories, apply it to the output of a backbone, and fine-tune object detectors to adapt to novel categories. Meanwhile, TFA  revealed that simply adding classification and regression weights to the last layer of existing detectors and only fine-tuning the weights significantly improved the few-shot detection performance without any auxiliary branch. However, the existing methods focus on how to extract discriminative features in terms of a single RoI and do not consider the innate properties present in an image. In general, the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets are composed of real-life images where multiple objects co-exist. Thus, there is an opportunity to further exploit the relationships among objects as additional information to overcome a few-shot environment. To address this issue, we propose a spatial reasoning framework to consider the co-occurrence property of objects.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: aims to recognize novel categories utilizing a few training examples.
