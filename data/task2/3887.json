      "content": "Paper Title: Rapid Locomotion via Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRunning fast on natural terrain is challenging.\nDifferent terrains exhibit different characteristics, ranging from variable friction and softness to sloped and uneven geometry.\nAs a robot attempts to move at faster speeds, the impact of terrain variation on controller performance increases [ref]6 [ref]12. Some physical considerations only begin to influence the robot’s dynamics at high speeds, including the enforcement of\nactuator limits   [ref]15, the regulation of large contact forces , and body control during flight phases  .\nOne possibility is to resolve these issues by making targeted improvements to the hand-designed models used in model-based control. Impressive progress has been made in this direction  [ref]6    [ref]12 [ref]15 . However, in model-based control, the robot’s behavior and robustness are dependent on the creativity and investment of the human designer, who must invent simplified reduced-order models that\nallow the robot to infer the appropriate actions\nunder the constraint of real-time computation. How can we perform real-time control in complex environments where efficient reduced-order models may not exist or are currently unknown?\nOne possibility is to optimize the robot’s actions with respect to a full physics model.\nThe problem is that trajectory optimization with a full model is not possible in real-time for a complex task such as fast running on natural terrains. An alternative is to amortize the cost of trajectory optimization by learning a direct mapping from sensory observations to actions (a policy) using high-reward trajectories sampled from the full model. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a way to learn such a policy.\nIn this approach, the human designs a set of training environments\nand reward functions to specify a set of tasks. RL algorithms automatically discover the policy that maximizes reward across these environments and tasks.\nBecause the RL framework does not require a human engineer to design accurate and efficient reduced-order models, it is less reliant on human effort. Consequently, RL offers a scalable controller synthesis scheme for complex tasks in challenging environments. Recent works have successfully employed RL to learn locomotion controllers      . Our goal is to construct a system that can traverse terrains at a large range of linear and angular velocities. This corresponds to a multi-task RL setup where running with each combination of linear and angular velocity constitutes a separate task.\nAkin to prior work, we found that when the robot is trained to walk with a narrow range of commanded velocities, a multi-task policy can be successfully learned  . However, increasing the range of commanded velocities to include high speeds results in training failure. This issue is reminiscent of difficulty in learning multi-task policies via RL on a broad set of tasks .\nTo understand the reason for failure, consider the naive approach of training a multi-task RL policy by uniformly sampling from all tasks. If most of the tasks are challenging or infeasible, the agent will not gather significant reward, and the training will fail. This is the case in high-speed locomotion: learning to run at rapid velocities from scratch is difficult because physical considerations such as centrifugal force constrain the combinations of linear and angular speed that are realizable. Training can be made easier by initially providing simple tasks to the agent and then slowly increasing their complexity using a curriculum . Curriculum learning has been leveraged for training robotic systems in the past    1. Manual curriculum design can fail when\nthe difficulty or feasibility of tasks is not known in advance. For omnidirectional running, manual curriculum design involves finding feasible linear and angular velocity combinations that satisfy physical constraints and ranking velocity commands based on their difficulty. Task difficulty is a function of both the system dynamics and the optimization algorithm, making manual curriculum design tedious and problem-dependent. Instead, we implement an automatic curriculum strategy that expands the set of tasks while respecting the physical constraints of locomotion. The proposed strategy yields significant performance improvements in learning omnidirectional high-speed locomotion. When deployed in the real world on flat ground, our learned policy sustained a top speed of 3.9 m/stimes3.9ms3.9\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s}, the highest reported speed for this robot (first row of Figure 1). On uneven outdoor terrain covered with grass, our robot achieved an average speed of 3.4 m/stimes3.4ms3.4\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} for a 10 mtimes10meter10\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m} dash (second row of Figure 1). The same policy can spin the robot at 5.7 rad/stimes5.7rads5.7\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{rad}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} on flat ground and also enables the robot to spin on the more challenging icy terrain (bottom row of Figure 1). We observed additional emergent behaviors during our experiments, including recovery from tripping and compensation for a malfunctioning motor. These results are reported qualitatively, and corresponding videos highlight the diversity of responses that emerge from end-to-end learning. Our policy uses a minimal sensing suite, consisting only of gyroscope and joint encoders, and is therefore suitable for any typical robot quadruped, including relatively inexpensive commercially available robots.\nOverall, our system performs rapid locomotion both indoors and outdoors and successfully negotiates\nchallenging terrains and disturbances.\nOur work fills a gap in the literature.\nWe show that reinforcement learning can be used to learn locomotion controllers that simultaneously achieve linear and angular high-speed behaviors and operate on diverse natural terrains.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: ranging from variable friction and softness to sloped and uneven geometry.\nAs a robot attempts to move at faster speeds, the impact of terrain variation on controller performance increases [ref]6 [ref]12.
