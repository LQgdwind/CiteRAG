      "content": "Paper Title: Unlocking the Potential of Multimodal Unified Discrete Representation through Training-Free Codebook Optimization and Hierarchical Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans’ capacity to integrate multimodal information, such as text, audio, and visual, has inspired research on extracting unified information from multimodal data  [ref]16 [ref]23 . Researchers aim to develop models that learn unified representations across modalities, using techniques like contrastive learning to map semantically similar multimodal data closer in the embedding space   , achieving notable results in downstream tasks like zero-shot and cross-modal retrieval. However, the unbounded nature of the continuous embedding space poses challenges in interpretability. To address this, recent works have explored constructing discrete embedding spaces with prototypes or codebooks, enhancing cross-modal learning and model interpretability    .\nNevertheless, these methods might be less effective in complex scenarios, such as audio-visual localization tasks in misaligned situations, due to their assumption of complete alignment of modal information. To address the aforementioned challenges, Xia et al. 1 proposed Uni-code. Their method utilizes a codebook as the discrete embedding space for a unified representation of multimodal data and introduces the Dual Cross-modal Information Disentanglement (DCID) module. The core concept of this approach is to distinguish and refine the shared semantic content within cross-modal data while eliminating the redundant information specific to each modality. This design philosophy enables the model to learn a more refined and universal cross-modal representation, capable of extracting common semantics even in the absence of perfect alignment between modalities. Consequently, this approach enhances the model’s performance in more complex tasks. While Uni-code 1 has demonstrated incredible achievements in multimodal unified representation, there are limitations in terms of the efficiency of embedding space utilization and the granularity of alignment. 1) According to previous work  0, the significance of features varies across different channels, and the selection of appropriate channels can accelerate inference speed and enhance model performance. However, Uni-code and preceding efforts    overlook this issue due to the inherent constraints of the codebook and the quantization method based on Euclidean distance. This approach treats all channels equally without considering the importance of individual channels, resulting in interference from irrelevant channel information. 2) During the pre-training process, models primarily focus on aligning the common major information, emphasizing the alignment of shared events across modalities. However, this approach may neglect critical event information unique to a specific modality, thereby constraining the model’s performance in fine-grained tasks. Inspired by the concept of feature importance  0 3  and\nthe training-free adapter in tip-adapter 5, we introduce the Training-free Optimization of Codebook (TOC) mechanism to address limitation 1. TOC optimizes the codebook through calculations without requiring additional training parameters, thereby enhancing the ability to compute and select features within the codebook of the Uni-code pre-trained model in downstream tasks. This approach achieves a training-free effect improvement, reducing additional training costs and decreasing the training parameter requirements for downstream tasks. As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), TOC selects specific channels from quantized features for downstream tasks and feeds them into the decoder. This selection process is completed after pre-training and does not require recalculation for different downstream tasks. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of downstream task execution. As for limitation 2, we design a new framework: Hierarchical Dual Cross-modal Information Disentanglement (H-DCID) illustrated in Fig. 1(a). H-DCID retains the advantages of DCID 1 in achieving unified multimodal expression while significantly enhancing the model’s flexibility and precision in processing fine-grained information through a hierarchical alignment mechanism. As illustrated in Fig. 1(c), the visual modality encompasses information about a dog and a woman, while the audio modality encompasses only the women. In the traditional DCID framework, information about the dog is disregarded as modality-specific, resulting in the exclusion of relevant visual events. This poses a challenge for audio-to-visual cross-modal generalization tasks, as the audio label lacks information about the dog. To address this, we propose a further alignment step, focusing on this specific information. We introduce a secondary alignment process to extract and align this information effectively. To ensure the robustness of this secondary alignment, we employ a warm-start technique, initiating the secondary alignment training only after the primary alignment is completed. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose the TOC, a novel approach that precisely identifies the importance of channels through calculations without the need for additional training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at training-free optimization of the codebook, and we have demonstrated its universality and transferability to other scenarios. We introduce H-DCID, which employs a hierarchical alignment strategy to extract primary and secondary alignment events in multimodality. This approach significantly improves the model’s ability to understand details and has shown considerable performance enhancements in downstream tasks with higher granularity requirements. Our method significantly outperformed the previous best model, DCID, across various tasks in the cross-modal generalization setup, showcasing its effectiveness in multimodal learning. Specifically, TOC, H-DCID, and their combination outperformed DCID 1 by 1.70%, 3.64%, and 4.43% respectively, on four downstream tasks. Additionally, we explored the impact of different quantization methods on the codebook, providing valuable insights for future research in this area.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Humans’ capacity to integrate multimodal information, such as text, audio, and visual, has inspired research on extracting unified information from multimodal data  [ref]16 [ref]23 .
