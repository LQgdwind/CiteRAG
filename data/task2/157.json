      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial algorithms for p-dispersion problems in a planar Pareto Front\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the case of population MOO meta-heuristics like EAs, selection operators may be called iteratively among the current n𝑛n non-dominated points to operate cross-overs or mutations (or applying a trajectory local search) among a restricted number of p≪nmuch-less-than𝑝𝑛p\\ll n solutions .\nRandomized selection operators may be used in that goal .\nDeterministic strategies can also provide representative and diverse solutions, in addition to or as a replacement for random selection operators for some iterations.\nIn such context, the number of points to select p𝑝p may be large, regarding the maximal size of the archive, the maximal number of points that would be in memory.\nSelecting such p𝑝p points algorithms running in O​(p​n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑝𝑛𝑛O(pn\\log n) time are of major interest in such context, it is the case with Max-min p𝑝p-dispersion, continuous p𝑝p-center problems [ref]16, and hypervolume subset selection .\nDiscrete p𝑝p-center is even faster to compute in O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time .\nNote that it is not required to have optimal solutions of such problems inside EAs.\nEven k-medoids heuristics may be used as in  as long as the calculation time of the heuristic remains fast,\ncomplexity calculations guide for such an heuristic design.\nPolishing procedures are of interest to have better balanced solutions as presented in Section 8.1.\nThe fastest DP algorithms may be used to initialize local search heuristics for other problems, as in . Having several types of deterministic selection operators is of interest for EAs to diversify the points where mutations or intensification are operated among consecutive iterations.\nOn the contrary, it is a source of inefficiency to call the operators of mutations and selections always on the same points.\nVarying the value of p𝑝p gives a first solution of this problem for deterministic operators.\nSelecting points in a 2D PF, many optimization measures and algorithms are available, and have different properties; another solution is to solve iteratively different selection problems.\nWhen selecting points in a PF, the rule of thumb is using hypervolume measures and variants  .\nHSS has useful properties to explain such popularity .\nClustering with k𝑘k-means or k𝑘k-medoids define dense zones in the PF where little intensification is needed .\nPartial p𝑝p-center variants detect outliers (isolated points) simultaneously with a rough definition of clusters [ref]16.\nIn a 2D PF, isolated points should be preferred to try intensification strategies in such zones, to have better-balanced points along the 2D PF [ref]16.\nWithout the partial extension, p𝑝p-center problems are faster to compute, but the clustering and selection are less relevant; fast DP algorithms for p𝑝p-center problems are useful to design quick heuristics fr other selection or clustering optimization.\nHSS and p𝑝p-dispersion measures find diverse points in the 2D PF, but can lead to very different solutions: HSS would avoid points that are close to local Nadir points (of knee-points) contrary to p𝑝p-dispersion problems. An open perspective is to design EAs combining randomized selection operators with different deterministic and complementary strategies.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: such p𝑝p points algorithms running in O​(p​n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑝𝑛𝑛O(pn\\log n) time are of major interest in such context, it is the case with Max-min p𝑝p-dispersion, continuous p𝑝p-center problems [ref]16, and hypervolume subset selection .\nDiscrete p𝑝p-center is even faster to compute in O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time .\nNote that it is not required to have optimal solutions of such problems\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
