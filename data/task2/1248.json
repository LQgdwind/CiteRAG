      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Characterize Matching Experts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern industrial and business processes require intensive use of large-scale data alignment and integration techniques to combine data from multiple heterogeneous data sources into meaningful and valuable information. Such integration is performed on structured and semi-structured data sets from various sources such as SQL and XML schemata, entity-relationship diagrams, ontology descriptions, Web service specifications, interface definitions, process models, and Web forms. Data integration plays a key role in a variety of domains, including data warehouse loading and exchange, data wrangling , aligning ontologies for the Semantic Web, Web service composition , and business document format merging (e.g., orders and invoices in e-commence) . As an example, a shopping comparison app that supports queries such as “the cheapest computer among retailers” or “the best medical specialist for Crohn’s disease in Crete” requires integrating and matching several data sources of product purchase orders and medical records. A major challenge in data integration is a matching task, which creates correspondences between model elements, may they be schema attributes, ontology concepts, model entities, or process activities. Matching research has been a focus for multiple disciplines including Databases , Artificial Intelligence , Semantic Web , Process Management [ref]26, and Data Mining . Most studies have focused on designing high quality matchers, automatic tools for identifying correspondences. Several heuristic attempts (e.g., COMA ) were followed by theoretical grounding (e.g., see  ). Matching problems have been historically defined as semi-automated tasks in which correspondences are generated by matching algorithms and outcomes are subsequently validated by one or more human experts. The reason for that is twofold. First, automatic matchers were unable to overcome the inherent uncertainty in the matching process due to ambiguity and heterogeneity of data description concepts . Second, there was an inherent assumption that humans “do it better,” leading to the necessity of humans in the loop. Human-in-the-loop data alignment and integration has been recently challenged by the need to handle large volumes of data, arriving at high velocity from a variety of sources, and demonstrating varying levels of veracity. Existing matching techniques, especially human-intensive methods, become obsolete in the presence of such data. Solutions in the form of crowdsourcing (e.g., 9 ) and pay-as-you-go frameworks (e.g., 0 ), were therefore proposed to flexibly use human input in the matching process. Such an approach may have its drawbacks , and, in turn, requires a deeper understanding on human capabilities when it comes to matching. Several recent works that study human matching abilities have raised concerns about the existing conception of human superiority in matching. Dragisic et al. have pointed out that schema and ontology matching require domain expertise . Following this insight, Zhang et al. stated that users that match schemata are typically non experts, and may not even know what is a schema . Others, e.g., 5 , have observed the diversity among human inputs. Recently, Ackerman et al. have challenged both traditional and new methods for human-in-the-loop matching, showing that humans have cognitive biases decreasing their ability to perform matching tasks effectively . For example, the study shows that over time, human matchers are willing to determine that an element pair matches despite their low confidence in the match, leading to poor performance. Finally, to date there has been little agreement on what makes a human a matching expert, which is the focus of this work.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: concepts, model entities, or process activities.
