Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

The models are trained using Adam optimizer with exponential decay rates Œ≤1subscriptùõΩ1\\beta_{1} and Œ≤2subscriptùõΩ2\\beta_{2} equal to 0.9 and 0.999, respectively. The initial learning rate and batch-size are set to 0.0002 and 16, respectively. We use cosine annealing strategy [ref]19 to adjust the learning rate. We empirically set the penalty parameter Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta to 0.1 and the total number of epoch to 100. We set the L1 distance loss in Eq. (4) after the latent features of the 111st, 333rd, 555th, 999th and 131313th layers from the fixed pre-trained VGG-19, and their corresponding coefficients œâi,i=1,‚ãØ,5formulae-sequencesubscriptùúîùëñùëñ1‚ãØ5\\omega_{i},i=1,\\cdots,5 to 132132\\frac{1}{32}, 116116\\frac{1}{16}, 1818\\frac{1}{8}, 1414\\frac{1}{4} and 111, respectively. Datasets.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on synthetic dataset and real-world datasets. RESIDE  is a widely used synthetic dataset, which consists of five subsets: Indoor Training Set (ITS), Outdoor Training Set (OTS), Synthetic Objective Testing Set (SOTS), Real World task-driven Testing Set (RTTS), and Hybrid Subjective Testing Set (HSTS). ITS, OTS and SOTS are synthetic datasets, RTTS is the real-world dataset, HSTS consists of synthetic and real-word hazy images. Following the works   3 , we select ITS and SOTS indoor as our training and testing datasets. In order to further evaluate the robustness of our method in the real-world scene, we also adopt two real-world datasets: Dense-Haze [ref]1 and NH-HAZE . More details are provided in the supplementary. Evaluation Metric and Compatitors.\nTo evaluate the performance of our method, we adopt the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the Structural Similarity index (SSIM) as the evaluation metrics, which are usually used as criteria to evaluate image quality in the image dehazing task. We compare with the prior-based method (e.g. DCP ), physical model based methods (e.g. DehazeNet  and AOD-Net 5), and hazy-to-clear image translation based methods (e.g. GridDehazeNet , FFA-Net , MSBDN  and KDDN 3).\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: and Œ≤2subscriptùõΩ2\\beta_{2} equal to 0.9 and 0.999, respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
