They usually suffer from a limited accuracy because of the insufficient encoding of the topology structure. For example, NAO[ref]30 directly encodes the whole architecture with a flatted vector followed by an embedding layer.\nRecently, many predictors explore how to use GCNs[ref]9    to model the graph format data(e.g. adjacency matrix and node features) of architectures. Neural Predictor encodes each node in architecture with the mean of two modified GCN layers, which use the adjacency matrix and the transpose of adjacency matrix to propagate information, respectively. When the input architecture becomes deeper, there is a quadratically increase of encoding dimension in these methods caused by the adjacency matrix.\nThere are methods   that use other models for representation learning. HOP proposes an adaptive attention module to model the relative significance of different network nodes for the first time, and achieved attractive prediction performance. However, the lacking consideration of the networks’ overall characteristics leads to the fact that these methods are not suitable for extending to whole networks. Latency prediction often needs to take the information of whole network into consideration when modeling the input architecture. TPU-Performance  and nn-Meter encode architectures by dividing a whole network inference pass into multiple kernels, and calculate the sum of kernels’ latency. In real applications, the hardware graph fusion may bring a gap between the sum of kernel latencies and the real latency of the whole network. To alleviate this problem, NNLQP  proposes a unified GNN-based representation model for various neural architectures and predicts the latency in model level.\nBut the model in NNLQP is rather preliminary since it generates architecture representations by directly summing up the features of all nodes and is not good at capturing mode sequence information.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: representation learning is essential for implementing downstream tasks (e.g. accuracy prediction and latency prediction).\nMany accuracy predictors model the input architectures by adopting LSTM[ref]30   and MLP [ref]6, which are used to accelerate NAS.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
