Since the publication of the seminal work by Szegedy et al. [ref]1 in which the existence of adversarial examples was first observed, a large number of gradient-based methods have been proposed to implement adversarial attacks against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in white-box and black-box scenarios. Most of the attacks proposed so far rely on greedy algorithms that permit to find an effective adversarial example in a reasonable amount of time [ref]2     . Most attacks create the adversarial examples by minimizing a cost function subject to a constraint on the maximum perturbation introduced in the image.\nMoreover, they focus on classifiers based on one-hot encoding. In this setting,\nthe final activation layer consists in the application\nof an activation function (usually a softmax) and a normalization, mapping the last layer outputs, called logits,\ninto a probability vector,\nassociating a probability value to\neach class.\nThe loss function corresponds to the\ncategorical cross entropy. As a consequence,\nin the targeted case, adversarial examples focus on raising the probability value of the target class.\nThis is obviously the best strategy\nwith one-hot encoding in the presence of a softmax function,\nhowever, this strategy is no more optimal in the presence of output encoding schemes based on channel coding, and in the case of multi-label classification.\n A more flexible attack working at the logits level has been proposed by Carlini and Wagner .\nThe attack works by decreasing the difference between the largest logit and the logit of the target class (in the targeted case).\nWorking at the logits level allows to avoid vanishing gradient problems , hence Carlini and Wagner method often yields better performance compared to methods that directly minimize the loss term.\nHowever, working on two logits at a time, without considering the effect of the perturbation on the other logits, is clearly suboptimum in general, with the consequence that the approach in  often results in a greedy, lengthy, iterative minimization process.\nThe problem is more evident when the attacker aims at attacking a DNN adopting different encoding mechanisms, like Error Correction Output Coding (ECOC) [ref]9, and also multi-label DNNs. In this case, all the logits have to be modified simultaneously. Crafting adversarial examples for networks adopting a generic output encoding scheme,\nand for multi-label classification, is a very challenging task, that, to the best of our knowledge,\nhas not been given much attention, with the exception of some scattered works proposing suboptimum approaches  .\nFrom the attacker side, the difficulties of applying an optimal attack in this case are due to the fact\nthat the labels are not mutually exclusive (like in the one-\nhot case), and decreasing or increasing the network output\nin correspondence of some nodes may change the values\ntaken by the other nodes in an unpredictable way. To overcome the above drawbacks, we introduce a new, theoretically sound, targeted adversarial attack,\nnamed Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance Attack\n(JMA).\nJMA solves the original formulation of the adversarial example problem introduced by\nSzegedy et al. [ref]1,\nwhich aims at minimizing the strength of the adversarial perturbation subject to the constraint that the image is classified as belonging to the target class.\nThe solution is found via a two-step procedure: i) given a target point in the output space, the optimum perturbation moving the input sample to the target point is first determined, under a linear assumption on the effect of the distortion on the model output; ii) then,\nthe target point that minimizes the perturbation introduced by the attack is determined by minimizing the Mahalanobis distance induced by the Jacobian matrix of the network input-output function.\nBy exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, we reduce the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem, that can be efficiently solved numerically. The optimal perturbation derived in this way is then applied to the input image.\nIdeally, the JMA attack should produce the desired adversarial image in just one-shot. However, due to the local optimality of the proposed approach, in practice, it is sometimes necessary to carry out some iterations to obtain a valid adversarial example, recomputing the Jacobian matrix every time.\n The experiments we carried out confirm that the proposed attack is more efficient than state-of-the-art attacks from a computational perspective, requiring a much lower number of iterations to carry out the attack. State-of-the-art attacks are also outperformed in terms of distortion and attack success rate.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed adversarial attack method is particularly evident when it is used to attack networks adopting Error Correction Output Coding (ECOC) [ref]9\nand in multi-label classification scenarios, where the JMA attack\nis capable to simultaneously change in a desired way up to 10 out of 20 labels\nof the output label vector, a capability which is out of reach\nof the algorithms proposed so far.\nWe also verified that the method has a very good behavior in the one-hot encoding scenario, where it achieves performance that are comparable to the state-of-the-art with a significant reduction of the computing time.\nIn summary, the main contributions of the paper are:\n We introduce a new targeted adversarial attack,\nnamed Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance Attack\n(JMA).\nThe attack resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced\nMAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, with the Jacobian matrix taking into\naccount the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space\nrepresentation of the input sample in a given direction. In theory, the algorithm is one-shot.\n We solve the constrained minimization of the Mahalanobis distance\nby exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem\nto the solution of a non-negative least square (NNLS) problem, that can be solved numerically. We validate the new attack considering several datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, MNIST, VOC2012) and networks adopting different encoding schemes, namely the ECOC scheme, multi-label classification, and also one-hot encoding. Our experiments confirm that the proposed attack is very general and can work in all these cases, being very efficient, often requiring only very few iterations to attack the image. We compare JMA against several state-of-the-art methods, showing that the proposed attack is more efficient and requires a much lower number of iterations.\nIn the cases of ECOC and multi-label classification, it also achieves lower distortion and higher attack success rate. In particular, in the multi-label classification scenario, the proposed attack is capable to change up to half labels of the sample output vector, even when the number of labels increases.\n The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we provide the main formalism and describe the various classification frameworks addressed in the paper. In Section 3, we review\nthe most relevant adversarial attacks introduced so far, with particular attention to the attacks against DNNs adopting with output channel encoding. Then, in Section 4, we present the JMA adversarial attack. The experimental methodology and setting are described in Section 5. Sections 6 and 7 report and discuss the results of the experiments. The papers ends in Section 8 with our final conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Adversarial examples, namely, quasi-imperceptible perturbations capable to induce an incorrect decision, are a serious threat to deep-learning classifiers [ref]1 [ref]2.
