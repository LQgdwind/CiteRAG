Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

To further demonstrate the simplicity and versatility of our method, we use the original code and teachers as the authors to compare to our proposed method in the same experimental setup.  use the same MMDetection2  framework, while  use Detectron2 . For the comparison with  we furthermore adopt inheritance, a practice proposed by the authors in which the FPN  and head of the student are initialized with teacher parameters. This leads to faster training convergence, but may not be applicable when architectures differ between teacher and student. As the teachers and exact configurations slightly vary, we split up the comparison into two parts, as shown in table¬†3. It can be observed that: (i) the adoption of our ‚ÑìSSIMsubscript‚ÑìSSIM\\ell_{\\text{SSIM}} as the distillation function results in an improvement of +3.7 AP, and outperforms  for all box sizes and IoU thresholds. (ii) Both our ‚ÑìSSIMsubscript‚ÑìSSIM\\ell_{\\text{SSIM}} and  result in an improvement of +3.3 AP over the vanilla network. In particular, our method scores high for A‚ÄãPLùê¥subscriptùëÉùêøAP_{L}, while  mainly show better performance in the small object A‚ÄãPSùê¥subscriptùëÉùëÜAP_{S} category.
