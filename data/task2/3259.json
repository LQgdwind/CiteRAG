The majority of results throughout this example are reported using a fixed setting: The GP nodes are considered as uniformly distributed points in the 2D square 𝑵∈ 2𝑵superscript012\\bm{N}\\in ^{2}. The right-hand side 𝒚𝒚\\bm{y} is also a randomly generated (uniformly distributed) vector with ‖𝒚‖2=1subscriptnorm𝒚21\\|\\bm{y}\\|_{2}=1. The normalized errors are computed with respect to true solutions that are obtained from direct inversions. We consider only one hyperparameter ℓℓ\\ell in this example and, if not stated, results are associated with the squared exponential kernel. We provide results associated with data in higher dimensions i.e. d=10𝑑10d=10 and d=4𝑑4d=4 in the second and third numerical examples cf. Sections 5.1 and 5.2. A number of other empirical studies are provided in 14. Smoothness of kernels and the effect of permutation on rank: In the first experiment, we consider n=1500𝑛1500n=1500 nodes to compute the kernel matrix. In the left pane of Figure 2, the decay of kernel value with respect to Euclidean distance for three different kernels, i.e. squared exponential, exponential, and a kernel that considers l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} distance as a distance function, is shown. In the first two kernels, f=‖𝒙i−𝒙j‖22/ℓ2𝑓superscriptsubscriptnormsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒙𝑗22superscriptℓ2f=\\|\\bm{x}_{i}-\\bm{x}_{j}\\|_{2}^{2}/\\ell^{2} and we set ℓ=0.3ℓ0.3\\ell=0.3. To generate the data, we compute the kernel values k​(𝒙0,𝒙)𝑘subscript𝒙0𝒙k(\\bm{x}_{0},\\bm{x}) where 𝒙0= subscript𝒙000\\bm{x}_{0}= . From this figure, it is seen that the last kernel with l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} distance function exhibits non-smooth decay with respect to r𝑟r, i.e. the l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} distance. The first two kernels are clearly more smooth in terms of decay of the kernel; however, the more important factor is the rank of submatrices, in particular, the off-diagonal blocks that are generated using these kernels. To study the rank of off-diagonal blocks, we decompose the nodes with size #​ℐ=1500#ℐ1500\\#\\mathcal{I}=1500 to two aggregates with predefined sizes of #​ℐ1=500#subscriptℐ1500\\#\\mathcal{I}_{1}=500 and #​ℐ2=1000#subscriptℐ21000\\#\\mathcal{I}_{2}=1000 and we consider two scenarios: 1) we do not permute the original nodes, i.e. we consider the first 500500500 random nodes as the first aggregate and the rest i.e. 100010001000 random nodes as the second aggregate; the singular value decay of the resulting kernel matrix 𝑨12subscript𝑨12\\bm{A}_{12} (i.e. k​(𝒙1,𝒙2)𝑘subscript𝒙1subscript𝒙2k(\\bm{x}_{1},\\bm{x}_{2}) with 𝒙1≡𝑵​(:,ℐ1)subscript𝒙1𝑵:subscriptℐ1\\bm{x}_{1}\\equiv\\bm{N}(:,\\mathcal{I}_{1}) and 𝒙2≡𝑵(:,ℐ2))\\bm{x}_{2}\\equiv\\bm{N}(:,\\mathcal{I}_{2})) is shown in the middle pane of Figure 2, and 2) we permute the original nodes with index ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} by applying the algorithm described in Section 2.2, referred to as permute. The singular value decay of the resulting kernel matrix 𝑨12subscript𝑨12\\bm{A}_{12} is shown in the right pane of Figure 2. The rank of 𝑨12subscript𝑨12\\bm{A}_{12} (using the built-in r​a​n​k𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘{rank} function) for three cases in the middle pane is 133,500,500133500500133,500,500. After permutation with the permute algorithm, the resulting rank of 𝑨12subscript𝑨12\\bm{A}_{12} is 85,206,5008520650085,206,500. It is apparent that the last case, i.e. the one with l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} distance function is always a full rank matrix and the permutation has no impact on it. However, node permutation has a favorable effect on the rank of the squared exponential kernel and even more impact on the exponential kernel.\n{remark_new}\nDetermining the rank of a matrix 𝑨∈ℝm×n𝑨superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛\\bm{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n} (for large m𝑚m and n𝑛n) is an intensive task. Assuming it is similar to the scalability of full SVD, the cost scales as 𝒪​(n​m2)𝒪𝑛superscript𝑚2\\mathcal{O}(nm^{2}) (where m<n𝑚𝑛m<n). A more computationally efficient proxy to rank is the numerical (or stable) rank defined as r​(𝑨)=‖𝑨‖F2/‖𝑨‖22𝑟𝑨superscriptsubscriptnorm𝑨𝐹2subscriptsuperscriptnorm𝑨22r(\\bm{A})=\\|\\bm{A}\\|_{F}^{2}/\\|\\bm{A}\\|^{2}_{2} where r​(𝑨)≤r​a​n​k​(𝑨)𝑟𝑨𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑨r(\\bm{A})\\leq rank(\\bm{A}), ∀𝑨for-all𝑨\\forall~{}\\bm{A} . Although numerical rank is efficient, it is not informative in terms of revealing the actual rank of the matrix in the above experiment. Therefore, for unstructured GP matrices, the computation of actual rank is recommended. These results motivate more in-depth numerical research on the hierarchical low-rank partitioning of matrices e.g. possibly some direct nuclear norm optimization of the matrix. We deem our partitioning to be efficient, easily implementable, and sufficient for the scope of current paper. Practical Recommendation: As a practical recommendation for utilizing the approach for inversion of different kernels, one can perform a simple similar test of one-level dyadic decomposition of a small size matrix and inspect rank k𝑘k of the off-diagonal block 𝑨12∈ℝm×nsubscript𝑨12superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛\\bm{A}_{12}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n} before and after application of the permute procedure (the cost is insignificant for small m𝑚m and n𝑛n cf. Remark 5.1). If after permutation, k≪min⁡{m,n}much-less-than𝑘𝑚𝑛k\\ll\\min\\{m,n\\} (e.g. the red curves associated with squared exponential kernel) is observed, the overall framework will be successful however if the rank reduction is negligible i.e. k≃min⁡{m,n}similar-to-or-equals𝑘𝑚𝑛k\\simeq\\min\\{m,n\\} (e.g. the black curves associated with l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} distances), the low-rank factorization of off-diagonal blocks yields inaccurate (or erroneous) results for inversion and determinant computation. In those instances, a different class of approaches, i.e. iterative approaches such as conjugate gradient, might be more effective; however, the rate of convergence in those approaches is also dependent on the decay rate of singular values [ref]40. Comparison with respect to (1) aggregation strategy and (2) low-rank approximation:\nIn this part of the example, we investigate the performance of two main building blocks of our framework with available approaches in the literature: \n(1) Aggregation strategy: We test accuracy and timing of our aggregation strategy, permute, with the maximal independent set: MIS(1)1(1) and MIS(2)2(2)  cf. 8. The test is performed on a matrix with n=5000𝑛5000n=5000 and η=1050𝜂1050\\eta=1050. The MIS approach depends on a tunable aggregation parameter denoted by θ𝜃\\theta. This parameter results in different numbers and sizes of aggregates. In each case, we sort the aggregates based on their size, select the largest as the first aggregate and the combination of the rest as the second one. In cases where the procedure results in one aggregate, we divide the aggregate into two equal size aggregates (roughly equal for odd sizes). The first plot in Figure 3 shows the accuracy in the solution of 𝑨​𝒙=𝒚𝑨𝒙𝒚\\bm{A}\\bm{x}=\\bm{y} for two choices of coarse and fine aggregation parameter i.e. θ=0.3,0.9𝜃0.30.9\\theta=0.3,~{}0.9. The accuracy of the three approaches are almost similar (although the coarse θ𝜃\\theta exhibits larger errors), but to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we specifically measure only the aggregation time using the three approaches within the hierarchical construction for a wide range of θ𝜃\\theta, i.e. θ∈[0.25,0.95]𝜃0.250.95\\theta\\in[0.25,~{}0.95]. The efficiency of permute is apparent compared to other approaches. This experiment also shows that our aggregation strategy is not dependent on θ𝜃\\theta. It always divides the input set to two sets with pre-defined sizes cf. Equation (2.1), which results in more efficiency. \n(2) Low-rank approximation: As mentioned in Section 1, the Nyström approximation and its variants have been extensively used in the GP literature. To test this approach, we replace our low-rank factorization approach, randomized SVD with ID denoted by RSVD_ID, with two versions of the Nyström approximation. In the Nyström approximation, an efficient factorization is achieved via k​(𝒙l,𝒙r)≃k​(𝒙l,𝒙m)​k−1​(𝒙m,𝒙m)​k​(𝒙m,𝒙r)similar-to-or-equals𝑘subscript𝒙𝑙subscript𝒙𝑟𝑘subscript𝒙𝑙subscript𝒙𝑚superscript𝑘1subscript𝒙𝑚subscript𝒙𝑚𝑘subscript𝒙𝑚subscript𝒙𝑟k(\\bm{x}_{l},\\bm{x}_{r})\\simeq k(\\bm{x}_{l},\\bm{x}_{m})k^{-1}(\\bm{x}_{m},\\bm{x}_{m})k(\\bm{x}_{m},\\bm{x}_{r}) where the nodes 𝒙l∈ℝd×n1subscript𝒙𝑙superscriptℝ𝑑subscript𝑛1\\bm{x}_{l}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times n_{1}} and 𝒙r∈ℝd×n2subscript𝒙𝑟superscriptℝ𝑑subscript𝑛2\\bm{x}_{r}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times n_{2}} are known. The main difficulty, however, is the determination of 𝒙m∈ℝd×ksubscript𝒙𝑚superscriptℝ𝑑𝑘\\bm{x}_{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times k}. We consider two scenarios for 𝒙msubscript𝒙𝑚\\bm{x}_{m}: 1) k𝑘k uniformly distributed random nodes 𝒙m∈U​ 2subscript𝒙𝑚𝑈superscript012\\bm{x}_{m}\\in U ^{2} denoted by Nyström-Rand (similarly to 3), and 2) first obtaining randomized range finder 𝑸𝑸\\bm{Q} from 𝒀=k​(𝒙l,𝒙r)​𝛀𝒀𝑘subscript𝒙𝑙subscript𝒙𝑟𝛀\\bm{Y}=k(\\bm{x}_{l},\\bm{x}_{r})\\bm{\\Omega}, i.e. [𝑸,𝑹Y]←q​r​(𝒀)←𝑸subscript𝑹𝑌𝑞𝑟𝒀[\\bm{Q},\\bm{R}_{Y}]\\leftarrow qr(\\bm{Y}) and then finding k𝑘k pivots i.e. important row indices ℐksubscriptℐ𝑘\\mathcal{I}_{k} by performing pivoted QR factorization on 𝑸Tsuperscript𝑸𝑇\\bm{Q}^{T} cf. Section 3, which yields 𝒙m←𝒙l​(:,ℐk)←subscript𝒙𝑚subscript𝒙𝑙:subscriptℐ𝑘\\bm{x}_{m}\\leftarrow\\bm{x}_{l}(:,\\mathcal{I}_{k}). The second scenario is denoted by Nyström-QR. From the third plot in Figure 3, which shows the normalized error in 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}, it is again obvious that the randomized SVD approach significantly outperforms Nyström approximations. This empirical result is indeed in accordance with the fundamental result of the Eckart–Young theorem 6, which states that the best rank k𝑘k approximation to 𝑨𝑨\\bm{A} (in the spectral or Frobenius norm), is given by its singular value decomposition with k𝑘k terms. Empirical cost - scalability: A major aspect of hierarchical matrix representation is the cost of the approach, which we empirically study via wall-clock time (real time) in this part of the example. In Section 4.3,\nwe found an estimate in the form of 𝒪​(n​log⁡(n)​k)𝒪𝑛𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n)k) where k𝑘k is the rank in the off-diagonal blocks. The theoretical scalability has linear dependence on n​log⁡(n)𝑛𝑛n\\log(n) and k𝑘k. To study the scalability with respect to these terms, we time the code (via tic-toc in MATLAB) for different choices of n𝑛n and k𝑘k. In particular, we consider n={105,2×105,5×105,1×106}𝑛superscript1052superscript1055superscript1051superscript106n=\\{10^{5},~{}2\\times 10^{5},~{}5\\times 10^{5},~{}1\\times 10^{6}\\} and k={5,10,20,30,50}𝑘510203050k=\\{5,~{}10,~{}20,~{}30,~{}50\\}, and set η=1050𝜂1050\\eta=1050. The expression for ν𝜈\\nu is according to (2.1). Figure 4 (left pane) shows the relationship between actual time and n​log⁡(n)𝑛𝑛n\\log(n). For every choice of k𝑘k, we find the slope of the fitted line (in the log-log scale), denoted by r𝑟r, via least square on the pair (log⁡(n​log⁡(n)),log⁡(t))𝑛𝑛𝑡(\\log(n\\log(n)),\\log(t)) where t𝑡t is the wall-clock time. As seen, the scalability of the code slightly degrades as k𝑘k increases. We note that these are actual/empirical results from the code and they depend on the implementation and the platform in which the code is implemented. Nonetheless, for a relatively large k𝑘k, i.e. k=50𝑘50k=50 we deem the slope r≃1.1similar-to-or-equals𝑟1.1r\\simeq 1.1 and as a result the scalability of almost 𝒪​(n​log⁡(n))𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n)), promising for our empirical results. We also compute the scalability with respect to k𝑘k for different choices of n𝑛n, cf. middle pane in Figure 4. While the relationship between k𝑘k and time in log-log scale is not necessarily linear as seen in the plot, we perform the same line fitting and find slopes for different cases of n𝑛n. The slope for the scalability of k𝑘k is around r=0.5𝑟0.5r=0.5. Our theoretical cost estimate shows linear scalability with respect to k𝑘k while the reality is more promising i.e. the empirical scalability based on these experiments is 𝒪​(n​log⁡(n)​k)𝒪𝑛𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n)\\sqrt{k}). Finally, to compare the code with built-in MATLAB capabilities i.e. \\\\\\backslash, as a baseline approach, we time kernel matrix computation, \\\\\\backslash execution, and the sum of two operations with respect to different sizes. Note that the data points are associated with significantly smaller n𝑛n as a direct inversion of larger size matrices e.g. n=5×104𝑛5superscript104n=5\\times 10^{4}, can be very time consuming (or impossible). From these results, the HMAT solver is clearly superior in terms of both scalability and actual time for matrices with large sizes. A sufficiently accurate estimate (i.e. k=50𝑘50k=50) for n=105𝑛superscript105n=10^{5} is obtained in almost 101010 seconds with HMAT while using built-in capabilities, but it takes more than 101010 seconds to find a solution for only n=1.5×104𝑛1.5superscript104n=1.5\\times 10^{4} which involves both (vectorized, i.e. no for loop) kernel computation and \\\\\\backslash.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: approaches, i.e. iterative approaches such as conjugate gradient, might be more effective; however, the rate of convergence in those approaches is also dependent on the decay rate of singular values [ref]40.
