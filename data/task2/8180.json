      "content": "Paper Title: Whole-Graph Representation Learning For the Classification of Signed Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph representation learning is a general task consisting of automatically learning a data-driven, low-dimensional and fixed-size vector representation of graphs, or parts of graphs such as vertices, edges, and subgraphs, that preserves the information conveyed by their structure . The main benefit of such representations is that one can feed them to standard machine learning tools, and thus process graphs indirectly with general and efficient methods, instead of designing task-specific methods required to handle graphs directly. Due to this advantage over traditional feature engineering methods, the development of graph representation learning approaches has been the object of many publications in the last few years, as attested by the many recent surveys on the topic   . Most existing methods focus on vertices or edges, which is very useful in several tasks such as community detection or link prediction. However, the representation of graphs as a whole is also crucial, especially in graph classification  [ref]41. This task typically involves a collection of graphs, each one belonging to a specific class to be predicted. In addition, the vast majority of existing representation learning methods are meant to handle unsigned graphs. This is understandable, as the number of available unsigned graph datasets is much larger than that for signed graphs. Nevertheless, signed graphs appear in many application domains such as Sociology , Neurosciences , International Relations , Business Science , Finance , Political Science , and Computer Science [ref]1; and their processing requires appropriate tools. Such graphs were originally introduced in Psychology, to represent the attitudes of people toward other people or objects [ref]25. More generally, they can be used to model any system involving two types of semantically opposed relationships (like/dislike, similar/different, etc.). In general, this duality makes it impossible to directly apply standard unsigned methods. Several methods have been proposed recently to handle signed graph representation learning at the level of vertices   . However, to the best of our knowledge, only one approach  allows learning whole-graph representations of signed graphs, and it is limited to fully connected graphs (i.e., every vertex is connected to all other vertices). As a consequence, it cannot handle most of the real-world signed networks from the literature, which are typically sparse (e.g.,  ). In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing two approaches to learning the whole-graph representation of signed networks. The first is a signed generalization of the unsigned whole-graph embedding method Graph2vec . The second one is a whole-graph generalization of the signed vertex embedding method Signed Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) . Our contributions are threefold: The first is methodological and concerns the two proposed representation learning approaches, for which we define several variants. All are able to handle not only fully connected graphs, but also sparse ones. The second is resource-oriented, as we constitute and share a benchmark annotated for signed graph classification, and constituted of three distinct collections. This is a first, as all similar datasets only focus on unsigned graphs. The third contribution is experimental, as we apply our proposed methods to our benchmark to assess their performance. Our results show that the proposed approaches perform better than the baseline. The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the main concepts and notations used later and review existing methods for graph representation learning. Next, we present our signed graph classification benchmark, in Section 3. Then, in Section 4, we describe the methods that we propose to handle signed whole-graph representation learning. We present and compare our results in Section 5. Finally, we summarize our main findings in Section 6, and discuss possible perspectives.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: or edges, which is very useful in several tasks such as community detection or link prediction.
