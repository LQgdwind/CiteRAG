      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approaches: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n[ref]48 propose a concept attribution-based approach (i.e., sensitivity to the concept) that provides an interpretation of the neural network’s internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. Their approach, Testing with CAV (TCAV), quantifies the prediction’s sensitivity to a high dimensional concept. For example, a user-defined set of examples that defines the concept ’striped’, TCAV can quantify the influence of ’striped’ in the prediction of ’zebra’ as a single number. However, their work is only for image classification and falls under the post-modeling notion (i.e., post-hoc) of explanation.  propose a knowledge-infused learning that measures information loss in latent features learned by the neural networks through Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This external knowledge incorporation (via KGs) aids in supervising the learning of features for the model. Although much work remains, they believe that (KGs) will play a crucial role in developing explainable AI systems. [ref]50 and  infuse popular domain principles from the domain in the model and represent the output in terms of the domain principle for explainable decisions. In [ref]50, for a bankruptcy prediction problem they use the 5C’s of credit as the domain principle which is commonly used to analyze key factors: character (reputation of the borrower/firm), capital (leverage), capacity (volatility of the borrower’s earnings), collateral (pledged asset) and cycle (macroeconomic conditions) , . In , for an intrusion detection and response problem, they incorporate the CIA principles into the model; C stands for confidentiality—concealment of information or resources, I stands for integrity—trustworthiness of data or resources, and A stands for availability—ability to use the information or resource desired . In both cases, the infusion of domain knowledge leads to better explainability of the prediction with negligible compromises in performance. It also comes with better execution time and a more generalized model that works better with unknown samples. Although these works [ref]50  come with unique combinations of merits such as model agnosticism, the capability of both local and global explanation, and authenticity of explanation—simulation or emulation free, they are still not fully off-the-shelf systems due to some domain-specific configuration requirements. Much work still remains and needs further attention.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: [ref]48 propose a concept attribution-based approach (i.e., sensitivity to the concept) that provides an interpretation of the neural network’s internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
