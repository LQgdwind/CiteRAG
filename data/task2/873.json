      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Generalizability of Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction: Meta-Modeling and an Analytic Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the preceding issues, now we summarize representative research studies on STTP with STAnalytic. Since in recent years we have witnessed numerous STTP efforts, we thus only select some representative studies from both classical statistical learning and new deep learning methodologies to give an overview. Regarding RQ1, we select two main streams of traffic prediction studies to analyze with STAnalytic. The first stream only considers the temporal factors with classical statistical methods (e.g., ARIMA) or recent deep learning methods (e.g., LSTM); the second stream leverages the deep learning techniques with both temporal and spatial knowledge in consideration. As shown in Table I, most of the first stream of works are much older, including Hamed et al. (1995) , Williams et al. (1998) , and Williams et al. (2003) . All of them take the traffic prediction problem as time-series data analysis and thus solve the problem with ARIMA methods. The results from Williams et al. (1998, 2003)   reveal that the daily and weekly periodicity widely exists and thus it is important to consider them in the temporal factors of the traffic prediction. More recently, researchers start leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as LSTM, to learn the temporal patterns in traffic prediction . For the second stream of works, we list several representatives    5 [ref]8 [ref]25 [ref]26 , which are published in prestigious venues and highly cited.  All of these studies apply deep learning techniques into STTP with both temporal and spatial knowledge in consideration. Note that their modeling techniques are distinct (see ‘modeling technique’ in Table I), thus not directly comparable from the technique perspective. However, with STAnalytic, we put more focus on analyzing which types of temporal and spatial knowledge are taken into consideration, and then these studies are clearly comparable as follows: 1) From temporal knowledge (RQ2), ST-ResNet , ST-MGCN [ref]8, and ASTGCN [ref]25  consider both closeness and daily/weekly periodicity, while others only consider closeness. 2) From spatial knowledge (RQ3), ST-MGCN [ref]8 considers multiple factors including proximity, functionality, and road connectivity. In comparison, other studies only consider one spatial knowledge of proximity or functionality. Note that Graph-WaveNet [ref]26 and AGCRN  use data-driven methods to automatically extract spatial knowledge, which has the potential to outperform specified spatial knowledge with adequate high-quality historical data. Based on the above comparison, among these approaches investigated by STAnalytic, we can infer that ST-MGCN [ref]8 is probably more generalizable over various scenarios, as it considers more temporal and spatial factors which have been verified effective in literature. That is, the more knowledge, the better prediction. Later in Section 5, we will quantitatively compare most of these representative approaches with real-life STTP datasets. Another interesting observation from the analysis is based on RQ4. While the literature has shown that various external factors, such as weather and events, can influence traffic patterns, most spatio-temporal traffic prediction methods ignore external factors completely. There may be several reasons. First, how to extract useful external factors, such as events, is a non-trivial problem itself . Second, how external factors impact traffic patterns is highly application-dependent (e.g., the event impacts on metro passenger volume may not be generalized to traffic speed). Then, it is still challenging for general-purpose traffic prediction approaches to incorporate external factors in a unified way for diverse applications. According to this state and making the method comparison fair, we then ignore external factors for all the approaches in our quantitative benchmark experiment (Section 5). Nevertheless, we believe that investigating external factors is a promising research direction for STTP.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: start leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as LSTM, to learn the temporal patterns in traffic prediction .
