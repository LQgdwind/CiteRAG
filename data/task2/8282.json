      "content": "Paper Title: Extensions of the Cylindrical Algebraic Covering Method for Quantifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-linear real arithmetic (NRA) (or real algebra) is the first-order theory whose atoms are polynomial constraints over real variables.\nWe consider three fundamental questions with regard to this theory: (1) Satisfiability of quantifier-free formulas; that is, deciding whether an assignment to the formula’s variables exists such that the formula evaluates to True. (2) Truth of sentences; that is, deciding whether formulas where all variables are quantified are equivalent to True or False. Satisfiability is a special case of this question, as we can existentially quantify all free variables to obtain a sentence. (3) Quantifier elimination in formulas containing both free variables (parameters) and quantified variables; that is, computing an equivalent quantifier-free formula over the parameters. Deciding the truth of sentences is a special case of this question, as we can eliminate all quantifiers. The field of satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) solving deals with the first two problems; while checking the satisfiability of quantifier-free non-linear real arithmetic formula has fairly good support, checking the truth of sentences still lacks accessible and efficient tools. The tools for quantifier elimination work a bit differently from SMT tools and might benefit from integrating ideas from SMT solving. Tarski  established the existence of quantifier elimination methods for non-linear real arithmetic, although his method was practically unusable due its non-elementary complexity bounds. Today, the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD)  method is the only complete procedure for answering all these questions that is used in practice, despite its doubly exponential worst-case complexity that severely limits the scalability of the method.\nFor the satisfiability problem of conjunctions of constraints, motivated by the application in SMT solving, the cylindrical algebraic covering (CAlC) method [ref]3 has been developed based on cylindrical algebraic decomposition. Although it retains the doubly exponential complexity, its performance is significantly better in practice [ref]3  while its implementation requires only a simple bookkeeping data structure. Furthermore, it more closely resembles human reasoning and is more amenable to proof production [ref]2 . This paper extends  in which we propose a novel reformulation and extension of the cylindrical algebraic covering method that goes beyond the satisfiability problem of conjunctions to allow solving arbitrary quantified formulas as well as quantifier elimination queries. This work elaborates the details of the algorithm, proposes some optimizations and extensions, and provides an evaluation of its implementation.\nWe first consider checking truth where all variables are explicitly quantified, either existentially or universally, in Section 4, and then expand to the quantifier elimination problem in Section 5. The presented method does not rely on a SAT solver to solve a Boolean abstraction; we will elaborate in Section 6 how the Boolean structure is incorporated. Afterwards, we present a divide-and-conquer adaption in Section 7 and a fine-grained proof system for CAlC in Section 8. Finally, we elaborate on heuristics for directing the search in Section 9.1 and evaluate them in Section 9.2, comparing with state-of-the-art tools. We conclude in Section 10.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: limits the scalability of the method.\nFor the satisfiability problem of conjunctions of constraints, motivated by the application in SMT solving, the cylindrical algebraic covering (CAlC) method [ref]3 has been developed based on cylindrical algebraic decomposition.
