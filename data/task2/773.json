      "content": "Paper Title: Matching Guided Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCorrespondence Problem.\nFinding optimal correspondence between two sets of instances is a crucial step for a wide range of computer vision problems, such as shape retrieval 6, image retrieval 9, object categorization  and video action recognition .\nLinear Assignment (LA) is the most classical correspondence problem that can be efficiently solved with Hungarian algorithm , unlike the NP-hard quadratic assignment problem .\nMatching based training losses [ref]7 5 contain the ideology of matching features, but they have a heavy computation.\nFor example, the Wasserstein loss [ref]7 uses the iterated optimization  to approximate the matching matrix, its computation cost will dramatically become large along with the growth of feature dimensions.\nIt only can be used for the feature from the last fully-connected layer, so does 5.\nIn this paper, we treat relationships modeling between teacher and student channels as a LA problem, particularly the min cost assignment problem.\nThe total matching cost function would be minimized by the Hungarian method to achieve a bipartite assignment graph.\nThis graph represents the high related channel pairs between teacher and student feature sets. Knowledge Distillation.\nPioneered by 3, the classic method for knowledge distillation contains two constituents: logits from the last teacher layer used as the soft targets, and Kullback-Leibler divergence loss used to let student match these targets.\nHowever, the performance of output distillation is limited due to the very similar supervised signal from teacher model with ground-truth.\nMore works  9  switch to feature distillation by combining intermediate features together to strongly supervise the student.\nAll these works rely on certain adaptation modules between hidden layers, in order to solve the contrast of semantic feature structures.\nFeature correlation based methods provide more fine-grained recipes to perform knowledge distillation, such as attention transfer  2, neuron selectivity transfer 5.\nThese works focus on capturing and transferring the spatial information for intermediate feature maps.\nAnother technique fashion for distillation is to design the loss function, including activation transfer loss with boundaries formed by hidden neurons 2, the loss for penalizing structural differences in relations 6.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel perception that performing distillation after matching intermediate channels between teacher and student.\nOur proposed approach is intuitive and lightweight. It introduces marginal computation costs during training.\nIn the end, although the work of Jacobian matching-based distillation 1 seems related to ours, it still suffers from the problems discussed in Section. 1.\nBecause it not only uses adaption modules but also a specialized loss function. Transfer Learning.\nCommonly fine-tuning is one of the effective methods for knowledge transfer learning.\nThe student has been already pre-trained on a specific domain data, and then it’s fine-tuned for another task with priori knowledge.\nThe work  finds that the model with random initialization could be trained no worse than using pre-trained parameters.\nHowever, the model may suffer from the low capacity trained on a small dataset like Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 3.\nA number of previous works use ImageNet pre-trained models on different tasks such as detection and segmentation 7.\nIn this paper, we show that MGD can be also used for knowledge transfer learning with a pre-trained student for the further performance improvements in another task, particularly for the fine-grained categorization.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: (LA) is the most classical correspondence problem that can be efficiently solved with Hungarian algorithm , unlike the NP-hard quadratic assignment problem .\nMatching based training losses [ref]7 5 contain the ideology of matching features, but they have a heavy computation.\nFor example, the Wasserstein loss [ref]7 uses the iterated optimization  to approximate the matching matrix, its\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
