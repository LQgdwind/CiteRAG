      "content": "Paper Title: Measure Theoretic Reeb Graphs and Reeb Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA Reeb graph  starts with a topological space X𝑋{{X}} equipped with a continuous real-valued function f:X→ℝ:𝑓→𝑋ℝf:{{X}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}.\nIt captures the evolution of the level sets of f𝑓f. The Reeb graph is the quotient space R(X,f):=X/∼fR({{X}},f):={{X}}/{\\sim_{f}} obtained by identifying equivalent points where, for every x,y∈X,x∼fyformulae-sequence𝑥𝑦𝑋subscriptsimilar-to𝑓𝑥𝑦x,y\\in{{X}},x\\sim_{f}y if and only if x𝑥x and y𝑦y belong to the same connected component of the level set f−1​(f​(x))superscript𝑓1𝑓𝑥f^{-1}(f(x)). By construction, as shown in fig. 1, there is a natural quotient map π:X→R​(X,f):𝜋→𝑋𝑅𝑋𝑓\\pi:{{X}}\\to R({{X}},f) that sends a point x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in{{X}} to its equivalence class [x]∈R​(X,f)delimited-[]𝑥𝑅𝑋𝑓[x]\\in R({{X}},f).\nMeanwhile, f𝑓f naturally induces a function f~:R​(X,f)→ℝ:~𝑓→𝑅𝑋𝑓ℝ\\tilde{f}:R({{X}},f)\\to\\mathbb{R} defined as f~​([x])=f​(x)~𝑓delimited-[]𝑥𝑓𝑥\\tilde{f}([x])=f(x).\nWith some appropriate regularity conditions (for example, f𝑓f being a piecewise linear function on a finite simplicial complex or a Morse function on a compact manifold), the Reeb graph R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R({{X}},f) is a finite graph and f~~𝑓\\tilde{f} is a monotonic function on the edges of R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R({{X}},f).\nThe pair (X,f)𝑋𝑓({{X}},f) is referred to as an ℝℝ{\\mathbb{R}}-space .\nIn this paper, we assume that X𝑋{{X}} and f𝑓f are regular enough (e.g. constructible ℝℝ{\\mathbb{R}}-spaces ) so that the Reeb graph R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R({{X}},f) is a finite graph.\nWe will use this regularity assumption of Reeb graphs throughout the paper. Let (X,f)𝑋𝑓({{X}},f) and (Y,g)𝑌𝑔({{Y}},g) be two ℝℝ{\\mathbb{R}}-spaces.\nFollowing the terminology in , we say that a continuous map ϕ:X→Y:italic-ϕ→𝑋𝑌\\phi:{{X}}\\to{{Y}} is a function preserving map if f=g∘ϕ𝑓𝑔italic-ϕf=g\\circ\\phi. A function preserving map ϕ:X→Y:italic-ϕ→𝑋𝑌\\phi:X\\to Y induces a map ϕ~:R​(X,f)→R​(Y,g):~italic-ϕ→𝑅𝑋𝑓𝑅𝑌𝑔\\tilde{\\phi}:R({{X}},f)\\to R({{Y}},g) between the Reeb graphs by sending [x]delimited-[]𝑥[x] to [ϕ​(x)]delimited-[]italic-ϕ𝑥[\\phi(x)].\nAdditionally, ϕ~~italic-ϕ\\tilde{\\phi} is also a function preserving map between (R​(X,f),f~)𝑅𝑋𝑓~𝑓(R({{X}},f),\\tilde{f}) and (R​(Y,g),g~)𝑅𝑌𝑔~𝑔(R({{Y}},g),\\tilde{g}).\nThis comes from the universal property of quotient maps; for a proof in the setting of Reeb graphs, see [31, Proposition 2.8]. To simplify the notation, we write a Reeb graph R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R({{X}},f) as G:=(G,f)assign𝐺𝐺𝑓G:=(G,f) with G𝐺G being a finite graph and f𝑓f being a real-valued function on G𝐺G such that f𝑓f is monotonic on each edge of G𝐺G. We omit f𝑓f from (G,f)𝐺𝑓(G,f) when it is clear from the context. In particular, G𝐺G is a special case of an ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-space. We say two Reeb graphs are isomorphic if there exist function preserving maps between them that are inverse to each other. We review the smoothing of Reeb graphs  that facilitates the study of the stability of Reeb graphs.\nIt is used to define the interleaving distance between Reeb graphs. Given a Reeb graph G𝐺G, let Gεsubscript𝐺𝜀G_{\\varepsilon} denote the space G×[−ε,ε]𝐺𝜀𝜀G\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon] and define the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-smoothing of G𝐺G as the Reeb graph of the function That is, the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-smoothing of a Reeb graph is the quotient space Gε/∼fεG_{\\varepsilon}/\\sim_{f_{\\varepsilon}}, denoted as Sε​(G,f)subscript𝑆𝜀𝐺𝑓S_{\\varepsilon}(G,f). The space G×[−ε,ε]𝐺𝜀𝜀G\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon] is referred to as the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-thickening of G𝐺G. Then the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-smoothing is the Reeb graph of the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-thickening. See fig. 2 for an example, where the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-thickening is tilted slightly to reveal its structure.\nWe have the following maps associated with the smoothing of a Reeb graph: The zero-section inclusion η:G→Sε​(G,f):𝜂→𝐺subscript𝑆𝜀𝐺𝑓\\eta:G\\to S_{\\varepsilon}(G,f) is defined as η​(x)=[x,0]𝜂𝑥𝑥0\\eta(x)=[x,0], where we use [x,0]𝑥0[x,0] to denote the equivalence class of (x,0)𝑥0(x,0) in Sε​(G,f)subscript𝑆𝜀𝐺𝑓S_{\\varepsilon}(G,f); Let ϕ:(G,f)→(H,g):italic-ϕ→𝐺𝑓𝐻𝑔\\phi:(G,f)\\to(H,g) be a function preserving map between two Reeb graphs. Then we have the induced map Sε​[ϕ]subscript𝑆𝜀delimited-[]italic-ϕS_{\\varepsilon}[\\phi] between their smoothings Sε​[ϕ]:Sε​(G,f)→Sε​(H,g):subscript𝑆𝜀delimited-[]italic-ϕ→subscript𝑆𝜀𝐺𝑓subscript𝑆𝜀𝐻𝑔S_{\\varepsilon}[\\phi]:S_{\\varepsilon}(G,f)\\to S_{\\varepsilon}(H,g) defined as ϕε​([x,t])=[ϕ​(x),t]subscriptitalic-ϕ𝜀𝑥𝑡italic-ϕ𝑥𝑡\\phi_{\\varepsilon}([x,t])=[\\phi(x),t]. With the above preparations, we can now present the definition of interleaving distance between Reeb graphs introduced by de Silva et al. . For any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-interleaving between two Reeb graphs (G,f)𝐺𝑓(G,f) and (H,g)𝐻𝑔(H,g)\nis a pair of maps, φ:(G,f)→Sε​(H,h):𝜑→𝐺𝑓subscript𝑆𝜀𝐻ℎ\\varphi:(G,f)\\to S_{\\varepsilon}(H,h) and ψ:(H,h)→:𝜓→𝐻ℎabsent\\psi:(H,h)\\to Sε​(G,f)subscript𝑆𝜀𝐺𝑓S_{\\varepsilon}(G,f) such that the diagram commutes,\nwhere Sε​[ϕ]subscript𝑆𝜀delimited-[]italic-ϕS_{\\varepsilon}[\\phi] is the map induced by Φ:G×[−ε,ε]→Sε​(H,g)×[−ε,ε]:Φ→𝐺𝜀𝜀subscript𝑆𝜀𝐻𝑔𝜀𝜀\\Phi:G\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon]\\to S_{\\varepsilon}(H,g)\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon] defined as Φ​(x,t)=(ϕ​(x),t)Φ𝑥𝑡italic-ϕ𝑥𝑡\\Phi(x,t)=(\\phi(x),t).\nThe interleaving distance dI​((G,f),(H,h))subscript𝑑𝐼𝐺𝑓𝐻ℎd_{I}((G,f),(H,h)) is defined as It is shown in  that the interleaving distance is a pseudometric on the set of isomorphism classes of Reeb graphs that takes values in [0,∞]0[0,\\infty]. Additionally, the interleaving distance is zero if and only if the two Reeb graphs are isomorphic. Let (G,f)𝐺𝑓(G,f) and (H,g)𝐻𝑔(H,g) be two Reeb graphs. Then if and only if (G,f)𝐺𝑓(G,f) is isomorphic to (H,g)𝐻𝑔(H,g). Note that the smoothing can also be applied to the ambient space directly, that is, we consider Sε(X,f)=X×[−ε,ε]/∼fεS_{\\varepsilon}({{X}},f)={{X}}\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon]/\\sim_{f_{\\varepsilon}} where fε:X×[−ε,ε]→ℝ:subscript𝑓𝜀→𝑋𝜀𝜀ℝf_{\\varepsilon}:{{X}}\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon]\\to\\mathbb{R} is defined as fε​(x,t)=f​(x)+tsubscript𝑓𝜀𝑥𝑡𝑓𝑥𝑡f_{\\varepsilon}(x,t)=f(x)+t. Indeed, the above smoothing construction is discussed in [31, Definition 4.19], and this construction is naturally isomorphic to the one used in definition 3.2 (in the sense of category theory) as shown in [31, Theorem 4.21];\nsee also lemma 6.3, where we prove this result in the general context of Reeb spaces.\nThis fact allows the following construction of interleaving maps between Reeb graphs. Let (X,f)𝑋𝑓({{X}},f) and (Y,g)𝑌𝑔({{Y}},g) be two ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-spaces.\nThen R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R(X,f) and R​(Y,g)𝑅𝑌𝑔R(Y,g) are ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-interleaved if\nthere are function preserving maps ϕ:X→Y×[−ε,ε]:italic-ϕ→𝑋𝑌𝜀𝜀\\phi:{{X}}\\to{{Y}}\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon] and ψ:Y→X×[−ε,ε]:𝜓→𝑌𝑋𝜀𝜀\\psi:{{Y}}\\to{{X}}\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon] such that the following diagram commutes: where Tε​[ϕ~]subscript𝑇𝜀delimited-[]~italic-ϕT_{\\varepsilon}[\\tilde{\\phi}] is the map induced by Tε​[ϕ]:X×[−ε,ε]→Y×[−2​ε,2​ε]:subscript𝑇𝜀delimited-[]italic-ϕ→𝑋𝜀𝜀𝑌2𝜀2𝜀T_{\\varepsilon}[{\\phi}]:{{X}}\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon]\\to{{Y}}\\times[-2\\varepsilon,2\\varepsilon] defined as We use Pr1subscriptPr1\\mathrm{Pr}_{1} and Pr2subscriptPr2\\mathrm{Pr}_{2} to denote the projection maps from Y×[−ε,ε]𝑌𝜀𝜀{{Y}}\\times[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon] to Y𝑌{{Y}} and [−ε,ε]𝜀𝜀[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon] respectively. Finally, we present the following stability result of Reeb graphs R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R({{X}},f) and R​(X,g)𝑅𝑋𝑔R({{X}},g) that are built from the same ambient space X𝑋{{X}}. Let R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R({{X}},f) and R​(X,g)𝑅𝑋𝑔R({{X}},g) be two Reeb graphs built from the same ambient space X𝑋{{X}}. Then the interleaving distance defined in definition 3.3 satisfies The Reeb space  is a natural generalization of the Reeb graph to a multivariate function f:X→ℝd:𝑓→𝑋superscriptℝ𝑑f:{{X}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}.\nAgain, we will assume that X𝑋X and f𝑓f are regular enough (e.g. constructible cosheaves [ref]30). For any continuous ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}-valued functions f:X→ℝd:𝑓→𝑋superscriptℝ𝑑f:{{X}}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d}, the Reeb space R(X,f):=X/∼fR({{X}},f):={{X}}/{\\sim_{f}} is a quotient space of X𝑋{{X}} obtained by identifying points that belong to the same connected component of the level set f−1​(c)superscript𝑓1𝑐f^{-1}(c) for any c∈ℝd𝑐superscriptℝ𝑑c\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}. As in the case of the Reeb graph, the multivariate function f𝑓f also induces a continuous function f~:R​(X,f)→ℝd:~𝑓→𝑅𝑋𝑓superscriptℝ𝑑\\tilde{f}:R({{X}},f)\\to\\mathbb{R}^{d} on the Reeb space R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R({{X}},f) by f~​([x])=f​(x)~𝑓delimited-[]𝑥𝑓𝑥\\tilde{f}([x])=f(x) for any x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in{{X}}.\nFor two Reeb spaces R​(X,f)𝑅𝑋𝑓R({{X}},f) and R​(Y,g)𝑅𝑌𝑔R({{Y}},g), a map ϕ:X→Y:italic-ϕ→𝑋𝑌\\phi:{{X}}\\to{{Y}} is function preserving if f=g∘ϕ𝑓𝑔italic-ϕf=g\\circ\\phi.\nThen the function preserving map ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi induces a map ϕ~:R​(X,f)→R​(Y,g):~italic-ϕ→𝑅𝑋𝑓𝑅𝑌𝑔\\tilde{\\phi}:R({{X}},f)\\to R({{Y}},g) on the Reeb spaces by ϕ~​([x])=[ϕ​(x)]~italic-ϕdelimited-[]𝑥delimited-[]italic-ϕ𝑥\\tilde{\\phi}([x])=[\\phi(x)] for any x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in{{X}}.\nWith an abuse of notation, similar to the Reeb graph, we also use the notation (G,f)𝐺𝑓(G,f) to denote a Reeb space in section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: generalization of the Reeb graph to a multivariate function f:X→ℝd:𝑓→𝑋superscriptℝ𝑑f:{{X}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}.\nAgain, we will assume that X𝑋X and f𝑓f are regular enough (e.g. constructible cosheaves [ref]30).
