      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerated Sparse Neural Training: A Provable and Efficient Method to Find N:M Transposable Masks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have established themselves as the first-choice tool for a wide range of applications, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, their impressive performance comes at a price of extensive infrastructure costs — as state-of-the-art DNNs may contain trillions of parameters [ref]10 and require thousands of petaflops  for the training process. For this reason, compression of DNNs training and inference process is a research topic of paramount importance in both academia and industry. The main techniques of compression include quantization  , knowledge distillation , and pruning  3. Pruning DNNs is one of the most popular and widely studied methods to improve DNN resource efficiency. The different pruning methods can be categorized into two different groups: unstructured and structured pruning. While the former can achieve a very high compression ratio, it usually fails in reducing the computational footprint in modern hardware. In contrast, structured pruning methods, such as block  or filter 3 pruning, are more hardware friendly. Unfortunately, these methods usually fail to keep the original accuracy for high compression ratios . Finding an optimal structured sparsity pattern is still an ongoing research topic. Recently, Nvidia [ref]36 announced the A100 GPU, containing sparse tensor cores which are able to accelerate fine-grained sparse matrix multiplication. The sparse tensor cores in A100 enable a 2x acceleration of regular matrix multiplication in DNNs, Y=W​X𝑌𝑊𝑋Y=WX, where W𝑊W and X𝑋X are weight and input matrices, respectively. The only requirement is that W𝑊W would have a fine-grained 2:4 sparsity structure, i.e. out of every four contiguous elements in W𝑊W, two are pruned. Nvidia [ref]36 suggested a two-fold scheme for pruning a pretrained dense model: (a) Define a fine-grained 2:4 fixed mask, and (b) retrain with the masked weights using original training schedule. Indeed, the Nvidia [ref]36 approach is very appealing for the common case where a pretrained dense model is given. While the Nvidia [ref]36 method works well on many models, a pretrained model is not always given. In those cases, one has to first train a dense model and only then try to prune it. To alleviate this demand, Zhou et al.  suggested a method that trains from scratch a model with N:M:𝑁𝑀N:M fine-grained mask, using a sparse-refined straight-through estimator (SR-STE). Similarly to the quantization-aware-training methods , they maintain a dense copy of the weights and prune it in every iteration, passing the gradients using the straight-through estimator . Since the mask dynamically changes while training, they suggest adding an extra weight decay on the masked (i.e. pruned) elements to reduce the mask changes during the training process.\nAs opposed to Evci et al.  that aims to reduce memory footprint for sparse training from scratch, Zhou et al.  only eliminates the need to train a dense model before pruning it. Motivated by these promising results, our goal here is to answer three remaining questions: (Fig. 1) How to rank different types of sparsity masks? We suggest a new measure called “mask diversity\", which is the first to connect mask constraints and network accuracy (Section 3). Can fine-grained sparsity masks accelerate training? We start by observing both the forward and the backward matrix-multiplications involving the weight matrix W𝑊W. Since the backward pass requires using the transposed matrix WTsuperscript𝑊𝑇W^{T}: and in general WTsuperscript𝑊𝑇W^{T} does not have an N:M:𝑁𝑀N:M fine-grained sparsity structure (even if W𝑊W has this structure), the methods suggested in  [ref]36 accelerate only the forward pass matrix-multiplication, Y=W​X𝑌𝑊𝑋Y=WX. Consequently, the current methods only utilize in part the sparse tensor cores to accelerate training. We propose a novel N:M:𝑁𝑀N:M transposable-fine-grained sparsity mask, where the same mask can be used for both forward and backward passes (Fig. 2). We focus on accelerating sparse training in the two settings detailed above: (a) starting from a pretrained model, and (b) starting from scratch. For (a) we derive a novel algorithm to determine the optimal transposable-mask using a reduction to a min-cost flow problem. For (b) we devise an approximation algorithm with an (almost) linear (in input-size) time complexity that produces a mask whose ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} norm is within a factor of 2 from the optimal mask. We show the effectiveness of both methods (Section 4). Can we change the type of sparsity mask structure without re-training? Different hardware devices can support different types of fine-grained sparsity masks. Therefore, we suggest the \"Adaprune\" method, which converts between types of sparsity masks (even from unstructured masks) without the need of re-training, and almost no degradation in accuracy (Section 5).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: vision and natural language processing.
