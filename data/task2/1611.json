      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerated Sparse Neural Training: A Provable and Efficient Method to Find N:M Transposable Masks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed transposable N:M:ùëÅùëÄN:M fine-grained structured sparsity in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. We evaluate the suggested method in two cases: (i) initialize from a trained dense model and re-train with a fixed mask, similar to APEX‚Äôs Automatic Sparsity (ASP [ref]36), (ii) train from scratch and update the mask frequently, as done by Zhou et¬†al. .\nWe show comparable accuracy to previous methods, while achieving a significant reduction of the training process resources ‚Äî by exploiting the sparse tensor core abilities, allowing their use both in forward and backward passes. In all the experiments we use a 4:8 transposable-mask, which as shown in Table¬†1, have a similar MD as 2:4 mask used in previous works [ref]36 . Experimental details appear in Section¬†A.4. In Section¬†A.8 we show additional experiments with the 2:4 transpose mask showing that: (1) in most cases, 2:4 transpose is enough to achieve high accuracy, (2) in some cases where the 4:8 transpose is necessary, and (3) this is consistent with the MD results shown in Section¬†3. Initialization from a trained dense model\nWe evaluate the suggested N:M:ùëÅùëÄN:M transposable mask using a trained dense model as initialization. In order to find the transposable mask, we solve the min-cost flow reduction (Fig.¬†4) on the dense trained network and then fix the mask.\nIn Table¬†3 we compare our method with ASP [ref]36 on classification (ResNet50 - ImageNet dataset), detection (MaskRCNN - COCO dataset) and question answering (BERT-large - SQuAD dataset) tasks.\nWhile both methods initialized from the pre-trained models, the 4:8 transposable enables propagation acceleration in the retraining phase where ASP does not. Sparse Training from scratch.\nIn order to avoid the training of a dense model, we also evaluate the proposed transposable N:M:ùëÅùëÄN:M mask in the training from scratch setting. Similar to Zhou et¬†al.  we keep a dense copy of the weights and before each forward pass we mask the weights with a N:M:ùëÅùëÄN:M transposable mask. In contrast to Zhou et¬†al.  who changed the mask every iteration, we found that we can use 2-approximation scheme to extract the transposable mask every 40 iterations. Empirically we found that the 2-approximation scheme is on average within a factor of 1.2 from the optimal mask. The hyper-parameters used for training are equal to the ones suggested by Zhou et¬†al. . In Table¬†4 we test the proposed method over ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNext50, Vgg11 (ImageNet dataset) and fine-tune of Bert (SQuAD-v1.1 dataset) and compare to Zhou et¬†al.  results. As can be seen, we achieved comparable accuracy with 2x sparse tensor cores utilization in the training process.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: natural language processing tasks.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
