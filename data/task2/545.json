      "content": "Paper Title: Approximation of the Diagonal of a Laplacian’s Pseudoinverse for Complex Network Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct experiments to demonstrate the performance\nof our approach compared to the state-of-the-art competitors.\nUnless stated otherwise, we implemented all algorithms\nin C++, using the NetworKit  graph APIs.\nOur own algorithm is labelled UST in the sections below.\nAll experiments were conducted on a cluster with 16 Linux machines, each\nequipped with an Intel Xeon X7460 CPU (2 sockets, 12 cores each), and 192 GB of\nRAM. To ensure reproducibility, all experiments were managed by the\nSimexPal  software.\nWe executed our experiments on the graphs in\nTables 2, 3,\n4, and 5\nin Appendix D.2.\nAll of them are unweighted and undirected. They have been downloaded from the\npublic KONECT [ref]37 repository and reduced to their\nlargest connected component. To evaluate the diagonal approximation quality, we measure the maximum absolute\nerror (maxi⁡𝐋i​i†−𝐋i​i†~subscript𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐋†𝑖𝑖~subscriptsuperscript𝐋†𝑖𝑖\\max_{i}\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger}_{ii}-\\widetilde{\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger}_{ii}}) on each instance, and we\ntake both the maximum and the arithmetic mean over all the instances.\nSince for some applications 0 1 a correct ranking of the\nentries is more relevant than their scores, in our experimental\nanalysis we compare complete rankings of the elements of 𝐋†~~superscript𝐋†\\widetilde{\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger}}.\nNote that the lowest entries of 𝐋†superscript𝐋†\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger} (corresponding to the vertices with highest\nelectrical closeness) are distributed on a significantly narrow interval.\nHence, to achieve an accurate electrical closeness ranking of the top k𝑘k vertices,\none would need to solve the problem with very high accuracy.\nFor this reason, all approximation algorithms we consider do not yield a precise\ntop-k𝑘k ranking, so that we (mostly) consider the complete ranking. Using pinv in NumPy or Matlab as a baseline would be too\nexpensive in terms of time (cubic) and space (quadratic) on large graphs\n(see\nAppendix D.2).\nThus, as quality baseline we employ the LAMG\nsolver  (see also next paragraph)\nas implemented within NetworKit  in\nour experiments (with 10−9superscript10910^{-9} tolerance).\nThe results in\nTable 6 in Appendix E.4\nindicate that\nthe diagonal obtained this way is sufficiently accurate. In practice, the fastest way to compute electrical closeness so far\nis to combine a dimension reduction via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss\nlemma  (JLT) with a numerical solver.\nIn this context, Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) solvers exhibit\nbetter empirical running time than fast Laplacian\nsolvers with a worst-case guarantee .\nFor our experiments we use JLT combined with LAMG  (named Lamg-jlt);\nthe latter is an AMG-type solver for complex networks.\nWe also compare against a Julia implementation of JLT together with the fast\nLaplacian solver proposed by Kyng et al. , for which a Julia implementation\nis already available in the package Laplacians.jl.333 https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl\nThis solver generates a sparse approximate Cholesky\ndecomposition for Laplacian matrices with provable approximation guarantees in\n𝒪​(m​log3⁡n​log⁡(1/ϵ))𝒪𝑚superscript3𝑛1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(m\\log^{3}{n}\\log(1/\\epsilon)) time; it is based purely on random\nsampling (and does not make use of graph-theoretic concepts such\nas low-stretch spanning trees or sparsifiers).\nWe refer to the above implementation as Julia-jlt throughout the experiments. For both Lamg-jlt and Julia-jlt, we try different input error bounds\n(they correspond to the respective numbers next to the method names in Figure 1).\nThis is a relative error, since these algorithms use numerical approaches with a\nrelative error guarantee, instead of an absolute one\n(see\nAppendix E\nfor results in terms of different quality measures). Finally, we compare against the diagonal estimators due to Bekas et al. [ref]9,\none based on random vectors and one based on Hadamard rows.\nTo solve the resulting Laplacian systems, we use LAMG in both cases.\nIn our experiments, the algorithms are referred to as Bekas and Bekas-h, respectively.\nExcluded competitors are discussed in\nAppendix D.1.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: software.\nWe executed our experiments on the graphs in\nTables 2, 3,\n4, and 5\nin Appendix D.2.\nAll of them are unweighted and undirected. They have been downloaded from the\npublic KONECT [ref]37 repository and reduced to their\nlargest connected component.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
