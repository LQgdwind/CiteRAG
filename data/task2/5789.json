      "content": "Paper Title: Time Series as Images: Vision Transformer for Irregularly Sampled Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIrregularly sampled time series. \nAn irregularly sampled time series is a sequence of observations with varying time intervals between them. In a multivariate setting, different variables within the same time series may not align. These characteristics present a significant challenge to standard time series modeling methods, which usually assume fully observed and regularly sampled data points.\nA common approach to handling irregular sampling is to convert continuous-time observations into fixed time intervals [ref]24 [ref]20. To account for the dynamics between observations, several models have been proposed, such as GRU-D [ref]3, which decays the hidden states based on gated recurrent units (GRU) .\nSimilarly,  proposed an approach based on multi-directional RNN, which can capture the inter- and intra-steam patterns. Besides the recurrent and differential equation-based model architectures, recent work has explored attention-based models. Transformer  is naturally able to handle arbitrary sequences of observations. ATTAIN  incorporates attention mechanism with LSTM to model time irregularity. SeFT  maps the irregular time series into a set of observations based on differentiable set functions and utilizes an attention mechanism for classification. mTAND  learns continuous-time embeddings coupled with a multi-time attention mechanism to deal with continuous-time inputs. UTDE  integrates embeddings from mTAND and classical imputed time series with learnable gates to tackle complex temporal patterns. Raindrop  models irregularly sampled time series as graphs and utilizes graph neural networks to model relationships between variables. While these methods are specialized for irregular time series, our work explores a simple and general vision transformer-based approach for irregularly sampled time series modeling. Numerical time series modeling with transformers. \nTransformers have gained significant attention in time series modeling due to their exceptional ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. A surge of transformer-based methods have been proposed and successfully applied to various time series modeling tasks, such as forecasting    , classification , and anomaly detection . However, these methods are usually designed for regular time series settings, where multivariate numerical values at the same timestamp are viewed as a unit, and temporal interactions across different units are explicitly modeled. A recent work  suggests dividing each univariate time series into a sequence of sub-series and modeling their interactions independently.\nThese methods all operate on numerical values and assume fully observed input, while our proposed method deals with time series data in the visual modality. By transforming the time series into visualized line graphs, we can effectively handle irregularly sampled time series and harness the strong visual representation learning abilities of pre-trained vision transformers.\n Imaging time series. \nPrevious studies have explored transforming time series data into different types of images, such as Gramian fields , recurring plots  , and Markov transition fields . These approaches typically employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification tasks. However, they often require domain expertise to design specialized imaging techniques and are not universally applicable across domains. Another approach  involves utilizing convolutional autoencoders to complete images transformed from time series, specifically for forecasting purposes.\nSimilarly,  utilized CNNs to encode images converted from time series and use a regressor for numerical forecasting. These approaches, however, still need plenty of specialized designs and modifications to adapt to time series modeling. Furthermore, they still lag behind the current leading numerical techniques.\nIn contrast, our proposed method leverages the strong abilities of pre-trained vision transformer to achieve superior results by transforming the time series into line graph images, sidestepping the need of prior knowledge and specific modifications and designs.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: methods, which usually assume fully observed and regularly sampled data points.\nA common approach to handling irregular sampling is to convert continuous-time observations into fixed time intervals [ref]24 [ref]20.
