      "content": "Paper Title: Unknown Sniffer for Object Detection: Don’t Turn a Blind Eye to Unknown Objects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDetecting objects with a limited number of classes in the closed-world setting           has been the  norm for years.\nRecently,\nthe popularity of autonomous driving 9 0   9 8  4 3 5 5 has  raised the bar for object detection.\n That is, the detector should  detect both known and unknown objects.\n‘Known Objects’ are those that belong to pre-defined categories,\n while ‘Unknown Objects’ are those that the detector has never seen during training.\nDetecting unknown objects  is crucial in coping with more challenging environments,\nsuch as autonomous driving scenes with potential hazards. Since unknown objects  do not have labels in the training set,\nhow to learn knowledge that can be generalized to unknown classes from finite pre-defined categories is the key issue in detecting unknown objects.\nIn recent years,\na series of groundbreaking works have been impressive on open-set detection (OSD)   8  and open-world object detection (OWOD) [ref]18 [ref]12 0 7.\nSeveral OSD  methods have  used uncertainty measures to distinguish unknown objects from known ones.\nHowever, they primarily focus on improving the  discriminatory power of uncertainty and tend to suppress non-objects along with many potential unknowns in the training phase.\nAs a result, these methods  miss many unknown objects.\nFig. 1 (a) shows that VOS  misses many unknown objects, such as bags, stalls and surfboards.\nFurthermore,\nOWOD requires generating high-quality boxes for both known and unknown objects.\nORE [ref]18 and OW-DETR [ref]12 collect the pseudo-unknown samples by an auto-labelling step for supervision\nand perform knowledge transfer from the known to the unknown by contrastive learning or foreground objectness.\n But\nthe pseudo-unknown samples are unrepresentative of the unknown objects, thus limiting the model’s ability to describe unknowns.\nFig. 1 (b) shows that ORE [ref]18 mis-detects many unknown objects,\neven though some are apparent. In philosophy,\nthere is a concept called ‘Analogy’ 4,\nwhich describes unfamiliar things with familiar ones.\nWe argue that despite being ever-changing in appearance,\nthe unknown objects are often visually similar to the objects  of pre-defined classes,\nas observed in Fig. 1 (d).\nThe t-SNE visualization shows that the unknown objects tend to be  among several pre-defined classes,\nwhile the non-objects are far away from them.\n This inspires us to express a unified concept of ‘object’ by the proposed generalized object confidence (GOC) score learned from the known objects only.\nTo this end,\nwe first discard the background bounding boxes and only collect the object-intersected boxes for training to prevent potential unknown objects from being  classified as backgrounds.\nThen, a combined loss function is designed to enforce the detector to assign relatively higher scores to boxes tightly enclosing objects.\n Unlike ‘objectness’,\nnon-object boxes are not used as the negative samples for supervision.\nFig. 1 (e) shows that the GOC score distinctly separates  non-objects and  ‘objects’.\nIn addition,\nwe design a negative energy suppression loss on top of VOS’s energy calculation  to further widen the gap between the non-object and the ‘object’.\nFig. 1 (f) shows three distinct peaks for the  knowns, unknowns and non-objects.\nNext,\ndue to the absence of the unknown’s semantic information in training,\nthe detector hardly determines the best bounding box by a constant threshold when the number of objects cannot be  predicted ahead of time.\nIn our model,\nthe best box determination is modelled as a graph partitioning problem,\nwhich adaptively clusters high-score proposals into several groups and selects one from each group as the best box. As far as we know,\nthe existing methods are evaluated on the COCO 2 and Pascal VOC benchmarks  that do not thoroughly label unknown objects.\nTherefore, the  accuracy of unknown object detection cannot be evaluated.\nMotivated by this practical need,\nwe propose the Unknown Object Detection Benchmark (UOD-Benchmark),\nwhich takes the VOC’s training set as the training data and contains two test sets.\n(1) COCO-OOD containing objects with the unknown class only;\n(2) COCO-Mix with both unknown and known objects.\nThey are collected from the original COCO dataset 2 and annotated  according to the COCO’s instance labeling standard.\nIn addition,\nthe Pascal VOC testing set is employed for evaluating known object detection. Our key contributions  can be summarized as follows: To better separate non-object and ‘object’,\nwe propose the GOC score learned from known objects to express unknown objects and design the negative energy suppression to further limit non-object. The graph-based box determination is designed to adaptively select the best bounding box for each object  during inference for higher unknown detection precision. We propose the UOD-Benchmark containing annotation of both known and unknown objects,\nenabling us to evaluate the precision of unknown detection.\nWe comprehensively evaluate our method on this benchmark which facilitates future use of unknown detection in real-world settings.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: is the key issue in detecting unknown objects.\nIn recent years,\na series of groundbreaking works have been impressive on open-set detection (OSD)   8  and open-world object detection (OWOD) [ref]18 [ref]12 0 7.\nSeveral OSD  methods have  used uncertainty measures to distinguish unknown objects from known ones.\nHowever, they primarily focus on improving the  discriminatory power of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
