      "content": "Paper Title: Heuristics for Vehicle Routing Problem: A Survey and Recent Advances\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section surveys the state-of-the-art heuristics for four widely studied vehicle routing problems: capacitated VRP, time windows VRP, multi-depot VRP, and Heterogeneous VRP . The triumph of the cutting-edge methods benefits from a combination of several heuristic concepts rather than the implementation of a single specific metaheuristic algorithm. Despite there are various kinds of implementation, they all adhere to a general algorithm framework shown in Fig. 11. Besides solution initialization, there are three key components in the flow chart, which are the solution perturbation, improvement, and selection; just as their names suggest, the first one is to diversify the solution candidates, while the second is to intensify them, and the last one is to decide whether to store some new solutions or to discard some old ones. To see how SOTA methods follow the general framework in Fig. 11, we list in Table 1 some representative ones, together with their detailed configurations with respect to different algorithm components. It should be noted that we are far from being able to review all the SOTA methods, such as the works on exact methods        and those for routing problems with other attributes , but by ”representative” we suppose the included methods are enough to shed light on the success of SOTA methods, which we summarize as follows: Collaboration: The vast majority of these methods are not simply a specific instance of some certain metaheuristic, but rather a fusion of multiple different concepts. On the one hand, effective intensification procedures, typically improvement heuristics, are combined with diversification procedures, like crossover , shaking , and restart  . On the other hand, the algorithm framework may utilize multiple metaheuristic concepts to tailor the search landscape. For example,  used both iterated local search and simulated annealing. Initialization: It is generally believed that a wise initialization eases the burden of the subsequent optimization process, which eventually benefits global convergence. The majority of SOTA methods achieve this by employing one or multiple constructive heuristics in the solution initialization phase. Some exceptions use simpler ways for initialization with corresponding refinement procedures. For example, in , initial solutions were merely generated at random. As a remedy, it integrated powerful heuristics in solution improvement and management phases.  merely constructed one route for each customer to build the initial solution. A route-reduction strategy is designed to drive the search forward. Solution Perturbation and Improvement: Most SOTA methods combine a variety of intra-route and inter-route improvement heuristics in the solution improvement phase. Several revised improvement heuristics, such as Swap* proposed in , have been shown to be efficient outside the classical ones. Compared with the improvement, the choices for perturbation are more diverse. Crossover , shaking 54 , restart  , among others, are typical examples. One exception is LNS , which employs the ruin and recreate for both perturbation and improvement. The ruin procedure removes some customers subjected to their relatedness and the recreate inserts the unassigned customers into the incumbent partial solution. Random removal, cluster removal, and string removal are typical removal heuristics used in ruin procedure. The recreate can be carried out using constructive heuristics, e.g., the insert method along with its extensions  [ref]215, or be solved exactly as constrained programming . Solution Selection: A proper management of solution(s) is vital for the long-term performance of routing heuristics. A wise solution management scheme should always avoid being short-sighted or too greedy. For the single-solution-based method, it is reflected in the designing of acceptance criteria for a new solution. Rather than accepting the new solution in a greedy way, a better strategy is to allow accepting a worse solution under a certain probability or threshold  [ref]59. For the population-based method, an adaptive replacement strategy is required to select the offspring generation to balance the divergence and convergence. Indeed, diversity control has been recognized as a vital component of population-based methods’ competitive performance. It can be considered in various ways, such as formulated in the acquisition function  and defined in the perturbation control method 8. The degree of diversity is typically measured by the distance between two solutions. For routing problems, edit distance , broken pair distance 1, and Hamming distance  are among the most commonly used measurements. Two-phase Paradigms: Many successful population-based heuristics for routing problems use giant tour  in the representation of solution. The paradigm behind this is first to generate a giant tour and then segment it into several feasible routes. The segmentation of the giant tour can be reduced to the shortest path problem on an acyclic graph, which can be solved exactly and efficiently . This two-phase paradigm is usually referred to as the ”routing first clustering second” approach 2. Correspondingly, ”clustering first routing second” is another two-phase approach, which is now commonly used in solving large-scale VRPs  . It separates customers into several clusters, then constructs a route for each cluster. The routing for each cluster can be served as a TSP variant and solved efficiently using heuristics.\n\nReference markers found: [215]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]215: removal, and string removal are typical removal heuristics used in ruin procedure. The recreate can be carried out using constructive heuristics, e.g., the insert method along with its extensions  [ref]215, or be solved exactly as constrained programming .
