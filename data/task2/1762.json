      "content": "Paper Title: Large Pre-trained Language Models Contain Human-like Biases of What is Right and Wrong to Do\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial writing is permeating our lives due to recent advances in large-scale, transformer-based language models (LMs) such as BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others. Using them as pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended state of the art for many NLP tasks and shown that they capture not only linguistic knowledge but also retain general knowledge implicitly present in the data. Unfortunately, LMs trained on unfiltered text corpora suffer from\ndegenerated and biased behaviour.\nWhile this is well established, we show that recent LMs also contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do, some form of ethical and moral norms of the society\n—they bring a\n“moral direction” to surface. That is, we show that\nthese norms can be captured geometrically by a direction, which can be computed, e.g., by a PCA, in the embedding space, reflecting well the agreement of phrases to social norms implicitly expressed in the training texts and providing a path for attenuating or even preventing toxic degeneration in LMs. Being able to rate the (non-)normativity of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, we demonstrate the capabilities of the “moral direction” for guiding (even other) LMs towards producing normative text and showcase it on RealToxicityPrompts testbed, preventing the neural toxic degeneration in GPT-2. Large-scale, transformer-based language models (LMs) such as BERT [ref]1, its variants [ref]2 , GPT-2/3 , and others have shown improvements on various NLP tasks. By now, they are so good at generating human-like text that\narticles and social media often describe it as the “world’s most impressive AI” and “terrifyingly good”[ref]5.\nSeveral studies revealed improved syntactic and semantic abilities of large-scale transform-based LMs\n     compared to previous models such as RNNs.\nFurthermore, Talmor et al.  demonstrated that\nLMs exhibit reasoning abilities, although not in an abstract manner, and\nRoberts et al. \nshowed that LMs’ capability to store and retrieve knowledge scales with model size.\nPetroni et al.  demonstrated that, besides learning linguistic knowledge, recent transformer-based LMs even retain general knowledge implicitly present in the training data. While these successes are very exciting, there are also risks associated with developing them     as also discussed in  [ref]5 .\nMany of these issues are reflections of training data characteristics. Already language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historical biases, and Machine Learning algorithms such as LMs may capture these regularities, as e.g. Caliskan et al.  have demonstrated.\nLearning from unfiltered data, such as Twitter or Reddit, further induces possibly undesirable learned knowledge into the models. LMs used for downstream tasks such as credit risk prediction are propagating this implicit knowledge to the classifier, and LMs with generative capabilities are suffering from toxic degeneration , i.e. they are prone to generating non-normative text. Approaches have been developed to decrease the level of bias in these models   and to prevent the toxic degeneration in language models   .\nSince AI systems get more and more embedded into our day to day lives, it is important to ensure AI models do not inadvertently show such unwanted behaviour. However, while stereotypical associations or negative sentiment towards certain groups is undesirable, LMs may also reflect desirable knowledge and biases such as our social, ethical, and moral choices  .\nWe here move beyond that work and investigate modern LMs, in particular the masked pre-trained language model (PLM) BERT [ref]1, and argue that they themselves pave a way to mitigate the associated risks.\nSpecifically, we show that they contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do, i.e., ethical and moral norms of society and actually bring a “moral direction” to the surface. More precisely, both Jentzsch et al.  and Schramowski et al.  used encodings of sentences into embedding vectors to compute a “moral score” using a template list of “moral” questions and corresponding answers. Philosophically, morality has referred to the “right” and “wrong” of actions at the individual’s level, i.e., an agent’s first-personal practical reasoning about what they ought to do .\nThis view is inherently connected to deontological ethics, which reasons about morality with reference to the rules one should follow when deciding and acting.\nTherefore, we move from question-answer templates to templates for general sentence-level prompts to compute a moral score of phrases.\nGeometrically, this moral score is then shown to be captured by a direction within BERT’s embedding space.\nThis is the first time that a “moral direction” is identified for transformers, and two user studies on regional and crowd-sourced group of subjects indicate that it correlates well with people’s opinion on moral norms. Furthermore, we investigate the generalisability of the moral direction and employ it as a (non-)normativity score for text.\nSince non-normativity is a superset of toxic language in the sense that toxic language, e.g. hate speech is non-normative (but not all non-normative descriptions are toxic) , we show that the identified direction can help\nattenuating or even preventing the toxic degeneration in LMs. To summarise, we make the following contributions:\n(i) To investigate the importance of contextual information on the judgement of an action or behaviour, i.e., normative vs. non-normative, we conducted a regional controlled user study. To evaluate the moral scores extracted from PLMs, we conducted an additional global user study using Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n(ii) Moreover, we propose a novel approach —called the MoralDirection (MD) of a pre-trained language model— for retrieving mirrored human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do.\nThis approach enables one to query any kind of phrases or sentences by learning a simple linear transformation of the sentence representations that carry information about moral norms.\n(iii) We demonstrate BERT’s moral direction’s capabilities in preventing toxic degeneration in LMs, outperforming previous approaches. A preprint with preliminary results of this study can be found at 0. We proceed as follows. We start by briefly reviewing theories of morality and clarifying the moral context of this work.\nNext, we present the results of a user study investigating the importance of context in moral statements. Then, we introduce that task of moral knowledge retrieval, including our novel approach to extract scores of the language model’s mirrored moral norms and rate phases that carry information about moral normativity.\nBefore concluding, we present our experimental evaluation on preventing toxic degeneration of language models in text production. Before proceeding, please note that the PLMs and their outputs used in the present study do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of the authors and their associated affiliations. Importantly, the study does not aim at teaching AI systems of what is right or wrong to do, or even to show that they are able to “understand” morality. Instead, we aim at investigating to which extend PLMs contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do, which surface from the (unknown) group of people that have generated the data. PLMs do not offer a view on what is actually right or wrong and, hence, should not be used to give actual advice. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the goal of putting human values into AI systems may not be insurmountable in the long run.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: towards producing normative text and showcase it on RealToxicityPrompts testbed, preventing the neural toxic degeneration in GPT-2.
