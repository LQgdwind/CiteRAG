      "content": "Paper Title: Smaller3d: Smaller Models for 3D Semantic Segmentation Using Minkowski Engine and Knowledge Distillation Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Distillation(KD) is a model compression technique that started its main journey by Hinton, Vinyals, and Dean (2015) that involves transferring knowledge from a larger, cumbersome model (teacher) to a smaller, faster model (student). The main idea is to use the teacher‚Äôs output probabilities (softmax) as \"soft labels\", which makes the process of class learning much more efficient, by using Temperature in loss calculations. It is shown in formula 2. The same paper also suggested using hyperparameter Œ±ùõº\\alpha to balance the loss between student-teacher and student-ground truth losses, to find a better loss for distillation. See formula on 2. Later Furlanello, T., Lipton, Z., Tschannen, M., Itti, L. &amp; Anandkumar, A.. (2018) suggested Born Again Neural Networks[ref]8 which shows, that without softening labels, it is possible to achieve same results with similar architecture. They use multiple student models, which we will discuss further, that are trying to iteratively teach student models. With each step, the student model becomes a new teacher for further distillation. There are also early approaches, that suggested mimicking the teacher‚Äôs output distribution with regularization, which is adding hint and guide layers on teacher and student models that help against overfitting. (Romero, A., Ballas, N., Kahou, S. E., Chassang, A., Gatta, C., & Bengio, Y.\n(2014)). It suggests classic regression layers, as additional layers, and also custom MSE loss between those layers to help mimic. Also, there are approaches, that use an idea of an additional layer adding(similar to our approach), but on a 2D Semantic Segmentation task. For example, He, T., Shen, C., Tian, Z., Gong, D., Sun, C., & Yan, Y. (2019) suggests, using the bilinear function for upsampling, to make teacher and student networks on the same space. By our estimations, it is not relevant to our task, as they learn affinity module, which is not clear to implement with sparse tensors. Another point is, that in their tested models, the architecture is not similar to ours, and it is not relevant to the Knowledge Distillation on 3D Semantic Segmentation task. Some other examples are shown by (Shu, C., Liu, Y., Gao, J., Xu, L., & Shen, C. (2020).), (Wang, Y., Zhou, W., Jiang, T., Bai, X., & Xu, Y. (2020))[ref]12. Some new methods are trying to train a smaller model by using multiple teacher models. It helps inter-data-exchange over the training process between small student models, and also generalization by combining multiple methods. Also, there are approaches when multiple teacher models train smaller student models, and student model loss is decided by cross-function with weights to distill knowledge from multiple teacher models, and approximate information in students (Wang, L., & Yoon, K. J. (2021).). A similar approach is suggested by different papers, which in general is designed to find an optimal number of teacher networks, and what kind of loss is needed to use, in order to make the student model less biased, and better in general. Such examples are (You, S., Xu, C., Xu, C., & Tao, D. (2017, August))[ref]14, (Tarvainen, A., & Valpola, H. (2017)), (Liu, I. J., Peng, J., & Schwing, A. G. (2019)), (Zhang, Y., Xiang, T., Hospedales, T. M., & Lu, H. (2018)), (Mirzadeh, S. I., Farajtabar, M., Li, A., Levine, N., Matsukawa, A., & Ghasemzadeh, H. (2020)), (Chen, D., Mei, J. P., Wang, C., Feng, Y., & Chen, C. (2020, April)), (Park, S., & Kwak, N. (2019)). In KENet (Liu, H., Zhang, C., Xu, C., & Li, G. (2020)) there is a similar idea, that we used, which is loss over feature map. However, their loss function is based on attention map distances between students and teachers in some feature map layers. However, as their Degree of Freedom is different, the distance is rather an approximation, but regular L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} or L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} losses. These are also special frameworks, designed for Knowledge Distillation for neural network architectures, which helps to speed up the process of architectural design, data loading, and parallel training of student teachers (maybe teachers), and also to make the process faster for research. It is mainly using config files, to call build-in functions(mainly yaml config files). It enables to easy use of state-of-the-art Knowledge Distillation methods, for analyzing different models.\n(Matsubara, Y. (2021, May)). In our case, this is quite difficult, because we are using Minkowski Engine (Choy, C., Gwak, J., & Savarese, S. (2019).), which itself is a built-in C++ library, and is not easy to integrate to any torch standard frameworks.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: truth losses, to find a better loss for distillation.
