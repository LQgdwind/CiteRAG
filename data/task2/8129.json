      "content": "Paper Title: Communication Separations for Truthful Auctions: Breaking the Two-Player Barrier\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCombinatorial Auctions are a paradigmatic problem at the intersection of Economics and Computation; see e.g.         and many others. Here, an auctioneer has m𝑚m items to allocate among n𝑛n bidders, where each bidder i𝑖i has a combinatorial valuation visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} over subsets of items (that is, vi:2[m]→ℝ≥0:subscript𝑣𝑖→superscript2delimited-[]𝑚subscriptℝabsent0v_{i}:2^{[m]}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}), and seeks to do so in a way that maximizes the welfare. That is, the auctioneer seeks to partition the items into n𝑛n subsets, A1,…,Ansubscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}, so as to maximize ∑ivi​(Ai)subscript𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑖\\sum_{i}v_{i}(A_{i}). The challenge is that only Bidder i𝑖i knows her valuation vi​(⋅)subscript𝑣𝑖⋅v_{i}(\\cdot), and therefore: (a) the auctioneer must communicate with the bidders to learn sufficient information about vi​(⋅)subscript𝑣𝑖⋅v_{i}(\\cdot) to find a high-welfare allocation, and (b) the bidders may strategically manipulate the protocol, and therefore the auctioneer must further design a truthful communication protocol.111See Section 2 for a formal definition – informally, a protocol is truthful if every player is incentivized to follow the protocol. Subject only to constraint (a), the problem is fairly well understood for several canonical valuation classes.\nFor example, poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication (not necessarily truthful) protocols are known to achieve:\nan asymptotically tight Θ​(1/m)Θ1𝑚\\Theta(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{\\sqrt{m}}})-approximation for arbitrary monotone valuations  ,\na tight 1/212\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}-approximation for subadditive valuations , a tight (1−1/e)11𝑒(1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}})-approximation is known for XOS valuations  , and the tight constant for submodular valuations is known to lie in [1−1/e+1/105,1−1/2​e]11𝑒1superscript105112𝑒[1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}}+\\nicefrac{{1}}{{10^{5}}},1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2e}}]   .\nThus, for all of these problems, the optimal approximation guarantee of poly-communication non-truthful protocols are well-understood. Subject only to constraint (b), the problem can be solved optimally by the classical Vickrey-Clark-Groves (VCG) mechanism  [ref]5 ; however, this solution requires exponential communication for any of the above-mentioned valuation classes.222The VCG mechanism reduces non-truthful protocols to truthful ones, but only for protocols that exactly optimize welfare.\nThus, the VCG mechanism makes the problem easy in any setting where describing a valuation function only takes polynomially-many bits.\nRicher classes, like the four mentioned, require exponentially-many bits to describe, and require high communication for exact welfare maximization, thus motivating approximations.\nSubject to both constraints (a) and (b), the problem is still quite poorly understood despite significant effort over the past two decades.\nFor example, the state-of-the-art deterministic truthful mechanisms with poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication achieve approximation guarantees of Ω​(ln⁡(m)/m)Ω𝑚𝑚\\Omega(\\nicefrac{{\\ln(m)}}{{m}}) for arbitrary monotone valuations, and just Ω​(ln⁡(m)/m)Ω𝑚𝑚\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\nicefrac{{\\ln(m)}}{{m}}}) for each of subadditive/XOS/submodular valuations .\nThus, these canonical settings each have a Θ~​(m)~Θ𝑚\\widetilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{m}) gap in approximation guarantees for state-of-the-art truthful vs. non-truthful protocols.\nDespite these massive gaps, corresponding impossibility results remain starkly rare; indeed, for each of the above examples, no lower bounds for truthful mechanisms are known beyond those that also hold for non-truthful protocols.\nThus, for each of these canonical settings, it remains unknown whether there should be any gap at all! This question has received significant attention since  introduced the study of communication complexity for combinatorial auctions, and it is generally conjectured that the more significant missing piece is stronger impossibility results. Developing such impossibility results necessarily requires leveraging truthfulness, which imposes significant technical barriers. For example, a natural first attempt would be to characterize all truthful auctions in a given setting, perhaps a là Roberts’ Theorem , and then prove impossibility results for communication-efficient auctions using this classification.\n  push the classification approach roughly to its limit, but bizarre deterministic truthful mechanisms exist and it appears that any classification attempt may be intractable (see the discussion in 3, for example). Interest in the question revitalized when 5 proposed an alternative framework termed Taxation Complexity.\nThis framework does not attempt to classify truthful mechanisms,\nbut merely identifies one key complexity measure that bounds the communication complexity of a truthful auction: namely,\nthe logarithm of the maximum number of menus presented to a player, also called the taxation complexity.\nThe Taxation Complexity framework further implies the following corollary: communication lower bounds on two-player simultaneous (non-truthful) protocols imply communication lower bounds on two-player interactive truthful mechanisms (whereas simultaneous lower bounds certainly do not generally imply interactive lower bounds for non-truthful protocols ).\nEven this corollary proved challenging to leverage, but  later established an impossibility of 3/4−1/240341240\\nicefrac{{3}}{{4}}-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{240}} for two XOS bidders, which exhibits the first separation of truthful and non-truthful protocols, since there is a non-truthful protocol that gives a\n3/434\\nicefrac{{3}}{{4}}-approximation for two XOS bidders  .  remains to-date the only known separation between what is achievable by poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication truthful mechanisms and poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication (non-truthful) protocols. Yet, this separation holds only for two bidders. Indeed, while a poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication non-truthful protocol can guarantee a 3/434\\nicefrac{{3}}{{4}}-approximation for two XOS bidders, the best possible guarantee for even three XOS bidders is 18/27<3/4−1/2401827341240\\nicefrac{{18}}{{27}}<\\nicefrac{{3}}{{4}}-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{240}}.333\nMoreover,  design a simultaneous protocol for two XOS bidders achieving an approximation guarantee of 23/32>18/2723321827\\nicefrac{{23}}{{32}}>\\nicefrac{{18}}{{27}}, so no lower bound via two-player simultaneous protocols can possibly achieve a separation for more than 222 players.\nThat is, while we now know that two-bidder poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication protocols achieve strictly better guarantees than two-bidder poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication truthful mechanisms, it is still plausible that truthful mechanisms are just as powerful as non-truthful protocols for n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3 XOS bidders. Moreover, the approach of  heavily leverages the two-bidder corollary of 5: their result follows from a communication lower bound on simultaneous protocols, which does not imply anything about interactive truthful mechanisms for n≥3𝑛3n\\geq 3 bidders. In our main result, we provide the first separation of poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication truthful vs. non-truthful protocols for more than 222 bidders. Specifically, we consider the class of bidders that are either Single-Minded or Subadditive (and term the class 𝖲𝗎𝖻𝖠𝖽𝖽∪𝖲𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗅𝖾𝖬𝖲𝗎𝖻𝖠𝖽𝖽𝖲𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗅𝖾𝖬\\mathsf{SubAdd}\\cup\\mathsf{SingleM}). We show that for this class, any deterministic truthful mechanism beating a (3−1)/2≈0.3663120.366\\nicefrac{{(\\sqrt{3}-1)}}{{2}}\\approx 0.366 approximation requires exp⁡(m)𝑚\\exp(m) communication, whereas a simple extension of  achieves a 1/212\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}-approximation with a non-truthful protocol.444\nWe also include novel results on related classes of valuations with two bidders; see Section 1.1.\n We leverage the Taxation Complexity framework of 5, which hinges around the concept of a menu.\nThe menu for Bidder i𝑖i of an auction 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a function M=𝖬𝖾𝗇𝗎i𝒜​(v−i)𝑀superscriptsubscript𝖬𝖾𝗇𝗎𝑖𝒜subscript𝑣𝑖M=\\mathsf{Menu}_{i}^{\\mathcal{A}}(v_{-i}), parameterized by v−isubscript𝑣𝑖v_{-i}, that takes as input visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and outputs the set of items (and price paid) that Bidder i𝑖i gets on input (vi,v−i)subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖(v_{i},v_{-i}).\nThat is, a menu fixes the valuations of bidders other than i𝑖i, and stores the impact that Bidder i𝑖i’s valuation visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} has on i𝑖i’s own allocation and prices. Informally speaking, one can think of the results of 5 as showing that, in terms of the communication-efficiency of truthful auctions (in sufficiently rich settings), the auction might as well be implemented by fully learning a bidder’s menu, and then allocating to that bidder according to their menu and their valuation.\nIndeed, in these settings, 5 proves that for any truthful auction, the communication complexity of the auction is at least (some polynomial function of) the communication complexity of learning one bidder’s menu.555\n5 provides other ways to bound the communication complexity of truthful auctions, as we discuss below.\n\nTo prove our main result, we establish that in order for a truthful mechanism to beat a 0.3660.3660.366-approximation for 𝖲𝗎𝖻𝖠𝖽𝖽∪𝖲𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗅𝖾𝖬𝖲𝗎𝖻𝖠𝖽𝖽𝖲𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗅𝖾𝖬\\mathsf{SubAdd}\\cup\\mathsf{SingleM},\nthe Communication Complexity of learning a bidder’s menu must be exponential in the number of items m𝑚m.\nThe Communication Complexity of all truthful mechanisms achieving the same approximation ratio then follows via results from 5. We defer technical details, but now briefly give intuition for the role of both Subadditive bidders and the Single-Minded bidder, and how the 0.3660.3660.366-approximation factor arises. A construction of 4 establishes that exponential communication is necessary in order for a (not necessarily truthful) protocol to beat a 1/212\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}-approximation for two subadditive bidders. So intuitively, truthful welfare-maximizing auctions face the following challenge.\nSuppose there is one Single-Minded and two Subadditive bidders.\nImagine that the maximum possible welfare between the two Subadditive bidders is c𝑐c. Then if, based on the two Subadditive bidders, the price of set S𝑆S for the Single-Minded bidder is set to p​(S)𝑝𝑆p(S), it could be that: Perhaps the Single-Minded bidder has interest set S𝑆S, has value barely exceeding p​(S)𝑝𝑆p(S) (and therefore chooses to purchase set S𝑆S), and yet the maximum welfare achievable between the two Subadditive bidders for S¯¯𝑆\\overline{S} is ≈0absent0\\approx 0. Therefore, we could have welfare as bad as ≈p​(S)absent𝑝𝑆\\approx p(S) when the optimum is c𝑐c. Perhaps the Single-Minded bidder has interest set S𝑆S, has value barely below p​(S)𝑝𝑆p(S) (and therefore chooses not to purchase anything), and yet the maximum welfare achievable between the two Subadditive bidders for S¯¯𝑆\\overline{S} is also c𝑐c. Moreover, even when allocating all items to the two Subadditive bidders, we don’t expect to achieve welfare greater than c/2𝑐2c/2 without exp⁡(m)𝑚\\exp(m)-communication, based on the results of 4. Therefore, we could have welfare as bad as c/2𝑐2c/2 when the optimum is c+p​(S)𝑐𝑝𝑆c+p(S). Therefore, the best ratio we can hope to achieve is min⁡{p​(S)c,c/2c+p​(S)}𝑝𝑆𝑐𝑐2𝑐𝑝𝑆\\min\\{\\frac{p(S)}{c},\\frac{c/2}{c+p(S)}\\}, which (it turns out) is at most 3−12≈0.3663120.366\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}\\approx 0.366 no matter how we set p​(S)𝑝𝑆p(S). Of course, this is just intuition—we need an actual construction where the above arguments hold even after the bidders have engaged in polynomial communication. For example, if we know the Single-Minded Bidder is interested in a particular set S𝑆S, then it is trivial to determine whether the maximum welfare achievable between the two Subadditive bidders for S¯¯𝑆\\overline{S} is ≈0absent0\\approx 0 or ≈cabsent𝑐\\approx c. Nevertheless, the high-level intuition of our proof closely follows the outline above.\nIn particular, the role of the two Subadditive Bidders in the is to: (a) have uncertainty regarding whether S¯¯𝑆\\overline{S} can generate non-trivial welfare between them, and (b) require exp⁡(m)𝑚\\exp(m) communication to beat welfare c/2𝑐2c/2 allocating any set of items to them. The role of the Single-Minded Bidder is for a clean and direct analysis of what the price of a single set S𝑆S might mean for the resulting allocation, thus allowing us to reason about the menu presented to the Single-Minded Bidder.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: guarantee of poly-communication non-truthful protocols are well-understood.
