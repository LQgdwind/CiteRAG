      "content": "Paper Title: Automatic Microprocessor Performance Bug Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe importance as well as the challenge of processor performance debug\nwas recognized 26 years\nago [ref]9 . However, the followup\nstudy has been scarce perhaps due to the difficulty. The few known\nworks [ref]9    \ngenerally follow the same strategy although with different\nemphasis. That is, an architecture model or an architecture\nperformance model is constructed, and compared with the new design on\na set of applications. Then, performance bugs can be detected if a\nperformance discrepancy is observed in the comparison. In prior work\nby Bose [ref]9, functional unit and instruction level models\nare developed as golden references. However, a performance bug often\nmanifests in the interactions among different components or different\ninstructions. Surya et al.  built\nan architecture timing model for PowerPC processor. It is focused on\nenforcing certain invariants in executing loops. For example, the IPC\nfor executing a loop should not decrease when the buffer queue size\nincreases. Although this technique is useful, its effectiveness is\nrestricted to a few types of performance bugs.\nIn work by Utamaphethai et al. , a\nmicroarchitecture design is partitioned into buffers, each of which is\nmodeled by a finite state machine (FSM). Performance verification is\ncarried out along with the functional verification using the FSM\nmodels. This method is effective only for state dependent performance\nbugs. The model comparison-based approach is also applied for the\nIntel Pentium 4 processor . Similar approach is also\napplied for identifying I/O system performance\nanomaly . A parametric machine learning model is\ndeveloped for architecture performance\nevaluation . This technique is mostly for guiding\narchitecture design parameter (e.g., cache size) tuning. Overall, the model comparison based approach has two main\ndrawbacks. First, the same performance bug can appear in both the\nmodel and the design as described by Ho , and\nconsequently cannot be detected. Although some works strive to find\nan accurate golden reference [ref]9, such effort is\nrestricted to special cases and very difficult to generalize. In\nparticular, in presence of intrinsic performance\nvariability  ,\nfinding golden reference for general cases becomes almost impossible.\nSecond, constructing a reference architecture model is labor intensive\nand time consuming. On one hand, it is very difficult to build a\ngeneral model applicable across different architectures. On the other\nhand, building one model for every new architecture is not\ncost-effective.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: The importance as well as the challenge of processor performance debug\nwas recognized 26 years\nago [ref]9 .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
