      "content": "Paper Title: An Extendable, Efficient and Effective Transformer-based Object Detector\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection aims to predict both the bounding box and object class for each object of interest in an image.\nRecent deep object detectors rely heavily on meticulously designed components, such as anchor generation and non-maximum suppression [ref]1 [ref]2.\nAs a result, the performance of these object detectors depends on specific postprocessing steps, which involve complex pipelines and make fully end-to-end training difficult. Motivated by the recent success of Transformers  in NLP, numerous models\nhave been developed for various vision tasks, especially in recognition and detection.\nCarion et al. [ref]4 propose the Detection Transformers (DETR) to replace the meticulously designed components with a transformer encoder and decoder architecture, which serves as a neck component to bridge a CNN body for feature extraction and a detector head for prediction.\nAs such, DETR enables end-to-end training of deep object detectors.\nOn the other hand, Dosovitskiy et al.  show that a fully-transformer\nbackbone without any convolutional layers, Vision Transformer (ViT), achieves state-of-the-art results on image classification benchmarks.\nDETR and ViT have been shown to learn effective representation models without relying strongly on human inductive biases, e.g., meticulously designed components in object detection (DETR), convolutional layers and pooling mechanisms for locality-aware designs (ViT).\nHowever, no attempt has been made to synergize DETR and ViT for a better object detection architecture.\nIn this work, we integrate both approaches to construct a fully transformer-based, end-to-end object detector that achieves state-of-the-art performance without increasing computational load. (a) DETR (ViT).                                    (b) YOLOS.                                 (c) ViDT (Ours). Straightforward integration of DETR and ViT can be achieved by replacing the ResNet backbone (body) of DETR with ViT as shown in Figure 2(a).\nThis naive integration, DETR (ViT)111We refer to each model based on the combinations of its body and neck. For example, DETR (DeiT) indicates that DeiT (vision transformers) is integrated with DETR (detection transformers)., has two limitations.\nFirst, as the original ViT suffers from the quadratic increase in complexity w.r.t. image size, this approach does not scale up well.\nFurthermore, the attention operation at the transformer encoder and decoder (i.e., the “neck” component) adds significant computational overhead to the detector.\nThus, the naive integration of DETR and ViT would cause high latency, as shown in the blue lines of Figure 1. Recently, Fang et al.  propose the YOLOS model\nby appending the detection tokens [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] to the patch tokens [𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷]delimited-[]𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷[\\mathtt{PATCH}]  (see Figure 2(b)), where [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] tokens are learnable embeddings to specify different objects to detect.\nYOLOS is a neck-free architecture and removes the additional computational costs from the neck encoder.\nHowever, YOLOS shows limited performance because it cannot exploit additional optimization techniques on the neck architecture, e.g., multi-scale features and auxiliary loss.\nIn addition, YOLOS can only accommodate the original transformer due to its architectural limitation, resulting in a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the input size. In this paper, we propose a novel integration of Vision and Detection Transformers (ViDT) (see Figure 2(c)).\nOur contributions are three-fold.\nFirst, ViDT introduces the Reconfigured Attention Module (RAM), to facilitate any ViT variant to handle the appended [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] and [𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷]delimited-[]𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷[\\mathtt{PATCH}] tokens for object detection.\nThus, we can integrate the Swin Transformer  backbone with RAM to be an object detector and obtain high scalability using its local attention mechanism with linear complexity.\nSecond, ViDT adopts a lightweight encoder-free neck architecture to reduce the computational overhead\nwhile still enabling the additional optimization techniques on the neck module.\nNote that the neck encoder is unnecessary because RAM directly extracts fine-grained representation for object detection, i.e., [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET]} tokens.\nAs a result, ViDT achieves better performance than its neck-free counterparts.\n\nFinally, we extend the vanilla ViDT to an end-to-end architecture named ViDT+, thereby enabling multi-task learning of object detection and instance segmentation.\nFor effective multi-task learning, ViDT+ equips efficient feature pyramid layers on top of its body for multi-scale feature fusion, and leverages two additional training losses i.e., IoU-aware loss  and token labeling loss . ViDT+ only adds 1M learnable parameters and barely reduces its inference speed than ViDT, but achieves a significant accuracy gain.\n ViDT has three architectural advantages over existing approaches.\nFirst, similar to YOLOS, ViDT takes [𝙳𝙴𝚃]delimited-[]𝙳𝙴𝚃[\\mathtt{DET}] tokens as the additional input, maintaining a fixed scale for object detection, but constructs hierarchical representations starting with small-sized image patches for [𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷]delimited-[]𝙿𝙰𝚃𝙲𝙷[\\mathtt{PATCH}] tokens.\nSecond, ViDT can use the hierarchical (multi-scale) features and additional techniques without a significant computation overhead. Thus, as a fully transformer-based object detector, ViDT facilitates better integration of vision and detection transformers.\n\nThird, ViDT accommodates numerous tasks and transformer models.\nIt can be extended to be an end-to-end architecture for multi-task learning, and easily combined with ViT variants such as CoaT  and PVT-v2  other than the Swin Transformer.\n\nExtensive experiments on Microsoft COCO  show that ViDT is highly scalable even for large ViT models, such as Swin-base with 0.1 billion parameters, and achieves the best AP and latency trade-off among existing fully transformer-based detectors.\n\nIn particular, ViDT+ with Swin-base achieves 53.2AP for object detection, which is 2.62.62.6AP higher than that of the vanilla ViDT.\n This work is an extensive version of our ICLR 2022 . Compared to the ICLR 2022 work, this paper includes the following additional contributions: (1) a new joint-learning framework named ViDT+, an extension of the vanilla ViDT, by incorporating three additional components: an efficient pyramid feature fusion module, a unified query representation module, and an IoU-aware and token labeling losses, (2) a detailed computational complexity analysis of the proposed VIDT compared to the YOLOS detector, (3) a performance comparison for object detection and instance segmentation compared with other CNN-based state-of-the-art methods, (4) an ablation study for the three new components of ViDT+ and a complete analysis of all the proposed components, (5) the reconfigured attention module combined with ViT variants such as CoaT and PVT-v2 other than the Swin Transformer.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: box and object class for each object of interest in an image.\nRecent deep object detectors rely heavily on meticulously designed components, such as anchor generation and non-maximum suppression [ref]1 [ref]2.\nAs a result, the performance of these object detectors depends on specific postprocessing steps, which involve complex pipelines and make fully end-to-end training difficult.
