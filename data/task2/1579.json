In this paper, we set out with the best configuration\nidentified therein999This means layered clause selection with second-level ratio 2:1 (as explained in Sect. 2)\nand lazy model evaluation and abstraction caching (see ).\nand focus on evaluating various aspects of the neural architecture itself\nand do that using the problems from the Mizar mathematical library. Following Jakubův and Urban [ref]21, we use the Mizar40  benchmark\nconsisting of 57 8805788057\\,880 problems from the MPTP  and, in particular, the small (bushy, re-proving) version.\nThis version emulates the scenario where some form of premise selection has already occurred and allows us to directly focus on evaluating internal guidance in an ATP.\nTo allow for a direct comparison with Jakubův and Urban’s remarkable results [ref]21,\nwe adopt the base time limit of 10 stimes10second10\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{s} per problem\nand use comparable hardware for the evaluation.101010A server with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6140 CPUs @ 2.3 GHztimes2.3gigahertz2.3\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{GHz} with 500 GBtimes500gigabyte500\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{GB} RAM.\n This section has several parts. First, we explain the details concerning the initial run from which\nthe training derivations got collected, describe the various ways of setting up the training procedure we experimented with,\nand evaluate the performance of the obtained models (Sects 4.1–4.3).\nWe then set out to establish how the individual aspects of our architecture (as discussed in Sect. 3.2)\ncontribute to the overall performance (Sect. 4.4).\nFinally, we follow Jakubův and Urban [ref]21 in training better and better models\nusing the growing set of solved problems for more training and compare with their results (Sect. 4.5).\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: abstraction caching (see ).\nand focus on evaluating various aspects of the neural architecture itself\nand do that using the problems from the Mizar mathematical library.
