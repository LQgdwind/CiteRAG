      "content": "Paper Title: Action Duration Prediction for Segment-Level Alignment of Weakly-Labeled Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nActivity analysis covers a wide range of applications from monitoring systems to smart shopping and entertainment, and it is a topic that has been extensively studied in recent years. While good results have been obtained in recognizing actions in single-action RGB videos       , there are many real-life scenarios where we want to recognize a sequence of multiple actions, whose labels and start/end frames are unknown. Most work done in this area is fully supervised     [ref]28    , requiring each frame in the training videos to be annotated. Given the need of deep learning algorithms for ever-larger training datasets, frame-level annotation can be expensive and unscalable. “Weak supervision” is an alternative, where each training video is only annotated with the ordered sequence of actions occurring in that video, with no start/end frame information for any action [ref]3  [ref]8     . This paper focuses on weakly-supervised action alignment, where it is assumed that the sequence of video-level action labels are provided as input for training and inference, and the output is the start and end time of each action. A key challenge in weakly supervised action alignment is correctly predicting the duration of actions. To achieve this goal, we propose a Duration Network (DurNet) that, unlike previous methods, takes video features into account. Video features contain valuable information that existing duration models ignore. As an example, video features can capture the pace (slow or fast) at which an action is performed. As another example, video features can capture the fact that an ongoing “frying” action is likely to continue for a longer time if the cook is currently away from the frying pan. Our duration model learns to estimate the remaining duration of an ongoing action based on the current visual observations. More specifically, the proposed DurNet mainly consists of a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which takes as inputs the set of frame features in a short temporal window at a given time, a hypothesized action class and its elapsed duration. The network outputs the probability of various durations (from a discretized set) for the remainder of that action. We also introduce a Segment-Level Beam Search algorithm to efficiently maximize our factorized probability model for action alignment. This algorithm modifies the vanilla beam search to predict the most likely sequence of action segments without looping through all possible action-duration combination in all frames. Instead, it predicts the action and duration of segments by selecting a small subset of the frames that are significant enough to maximize the posterior probability.\nThe time complexity of our Segment-Level Beam Search is linear to the number of action segments in the video, which is theoretically better than that of other Viterbi based alignment methods  [ref]28  . In particular Richard et al.  considered visual and length models’ frame-level outputs and their combinations over all the frames for action alignments. More recently  extended Richard et al.’s work  by incorporating all invalid action sequences in the loss function during training, but follows the same frame-level inference technique as in . The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) We introduce a Duration Network for action alignment, that is explicitly designed to exploit information from video features and show its edge over the Poisson model used in previous work  . (2) We propose a Segment-Level Beam Search that can efficiently align actions to frames without exhaustively evaluating each video frame as a possible start or end frame for an action (in contrast to    ). (3) In our experiments, we use two common benchmark datasets, the Breakfast  and Hollywood Extended [ref]3, and we measure performance using three metrics from [ref]8. Depending on the metric and dataset, our method leads to results that are competitive or superior to the current state-of-the-art for action alignment.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: , there are many real-life scenarios where we want to recognize a sequence of multiple actions, whose labels and start/end frames are unknown.
