Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Trains.\nThe goal is to find a hypothesis that distinguishes eastbound and westbound trains . Chess.\nThe task is to learn chess patterns in the king-rook-king (krk) endgame .\nThis dataset contains relations with arity greater than two, such as distance/3 and cell/4. Zendo.\nZendo is a multiplayer game where players must discover a secret rule by building structures.\nZendo is a challenging game that has attracted much interest in cognitive science . IMDB.\nThis real-world dataset  contains relations between movies, actors, and directors.\nThis dataset is frequently used to evaluate rule learning systems [ref]14.\nNote that this dataset has non-trivial numbers of training examples.\nFor instance, the imdb3 task has 121,801 training examples. IGGP.\nThe goal of inductive general game playing  (IGGP) is to induce rules to explain game traces from the general game playing competition [ref]20.\nThis dataset is notoriously difficult for ILP systems: the currently best-performing system can only learn perfect solutions for 40% of the tasks.\nMoreover, although seemingly a toy problem, IGGP is representative of many real-world problems, such as inducing semantics of programming languages .\nWe use six games: minimal decay (md), rock - paper - scissors (rps), buttons, attrition, centipede, and coins.\nThese tasks all require learning rules with relations of arity more than two, which is impossible for some rule learning approaches . Graph problems.\nWe use frequently used graph problems [ref]15 .\nAll of these tasks require the ability to learn recursive programs. Program synthesis.\nInducing complex recursive programs is a difficult problem 1 and most ILP systems cannot learn recursive programs.\nWe use a program synthesis dataset  augmented with two new tasks contains and reverse.\nThe motivating example in the introduction describes the task contains.\nThese tasks all require the ability to learn recursive programs and to learn from non-factual data.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: much interest in cognitive science .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
