      "content": "Paper Title: WISDOM: An AI-powered framework for emerging research detection using weak signal analysis and advanced topic modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWISDOM employs BERTopic [ref]8 to extract the main research themes from the dataset. The primary advantage of the BERTopic model lies in its ability to learn coherent language patterns and excel across a variety of tasks [ref]8, unlike other common models that tend to specialize in a single area . Furthermore, following the training of a BERTopic model, it is possible to reduce the number of topics further [ref]31, which enables researchers to refine and choose a more precise number of topics based on their objectives. In addition, BERTopic is very flexible as it decouples the document embedding process from topic representation which allows utilizing different preprocessing and fine-tuning techniques. BERTopic has four major components. Document embeddings are first generated using pre-trained transformer-based language models to obtain document-level information. Leveraging the Sentence-BERT (SBERT) framework [ref]32, the embedding process generates document representations in a vector space, allowing for semantic comparisons between embeddings. The underlying assumption is that documents sharing the same topic exhibit semantic similarity [ref]8. Once embeddings are constructed, BERTopic reduces their dimensionality by compressing them into a lower-dimensional space using the uniform manifold approximation and production (UMAP) technique . UMAP can retain a greater portion of both local and global features of high-dimensional data when projected into lower dimensions. Furthermore, UMAP’s flexibility extends to accommodating varying dimensional spaces in different language models due to its lack of computational constraints on embedding dimensions . Next, HDBSCAN clustering  which is a hierarchical, density-based method is applied to the generated reduced embeddings. HDBSCAN allows the modeling of noise as outliers, ensuring that unrelated documents are not arbitrarily assigned to any cluster, hence; enhancing the quality of topic representations [ref]8. Furthermore, reducing high-dimensional embeddings using UMAP can lead to enhanced performance for HDBSCAN, in terms of both clustering accuracy and computational efficiency . Ultimately topic representations are created through the class-based term frequency-inverse document frequency (c-TF-IDF) procedure. Conventional topic modeling techniques, e.g., latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) , are static and cannot capture the sequential organization of documents . Dynamic topic modeling techniques address this limitation by considering the evolution of topics over time and assessing the degree to which topic representations mirror this evolution. BERTopic achieves this modeling capability by using the c-TF-IDF representations of topics [ref]8. In our experiments focusing on underwater sensing publications (as the case technology), following the data cleaning and preprocessing procedures outlined in Section 3.1, we trained the BERTopic model using the lemmatized data. We initially set the number of topics to 100, allowing the model to autonomously determine the optimal number of topics based on the data’s characteristics. We also employed an n-gram range of (1,2), which encompassed both single words and bigrams. As a result, the model identified and extracted 73 distinct topics from the corpus which will be presented and discussed in Section 4.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: WISDOM employs BERTopic [ref]8 to extract the main research themes from the dataset.
