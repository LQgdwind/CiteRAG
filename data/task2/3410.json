      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section gives a brief overview of related works in both the study of runtime distributions and the research on CDCL solvers. In previous works, the runtime distributions of algorithms were studied.\nIn , the authors presented empirical evidence for the fact that the distribution of the effort (more precisely, the number of consistency checks) required for backtracking algorithms to solve constraint satisfaction problems randomly generated at the 50 % satisfiable point can be approximated by the Weibull distribution (in the satisfiable case) and the lognormal distribution (in the unsatisfiable case).\nLater, these results were extended to a wider region around the 50 % satisfiable point .\nIn , the cost profiles of combinatorial search procedures were studied.\nThe authors showed that Pareto-Lévy type heavy-tails often characterize the distributions and empirically demonstrated how rapid randomized restarts can effectively eliminate heavy-tail behavior. In the paper , the hardness distributions of several SLS SAT solvers on logically equivalent modifications of a base instance were studied.\nThe authors included different instance generation models to rule out any influence of the model. Introducing the procedure Alfa that we adapt to CDCL solvers in our work, the paper found that lognormal distributions characterize this hardness distribution perfectly.\nThe approach of  lends itself to the analysis of existing SLS-CDCL hybrid solvers, like GapSAT [ref]15.\nThe advantage of the approach studied in  is that the conducted work is not lost in the case of a restart: only the logically equivalent instance could be changed while keeping the current assignment.\nThe paper  studied the solvers Sparrow and CCASAT and found that for randomly generated instances, the lognormal distribution is a good fit for the runtime distributions. This study was performed on the domains of randomly generated and crafted instances. Barrero et al.  observed empirical evidence suggesting lognormally distributed runtimes in several types of population-based algorithms like evolutionary and genetic algorithms. The reason behind the fact that CDCL algorithms also incorporate a mechanism to delete (subsets of the) learned clauses from time to time was explained by Mitchell in :\nEven when sufficient memory is available, the time required to perform unit propagation becomes impractical for extensive clause sets, thus reducing the solver’s performance.\nAudemard and Simon  observed that despite this phenomenon, deleting too many learned clauses can break the learning benefit. Thus, many CDCL solvers let the maximum number of learned clauses grow exponentially. The paper  lead to the development of the Glucose solver using “aggressive clause deletion” together with the “Literals Block Distance (LBD)” measure. Some solvers also incorporate a dynamic clause management policy, allowing the solver to freeze some learned clauses for later use instead of deleting them .\nIn , CDCL solver heuristics such as restarts and clause database management frameworks were analyzed by studying the resolution proofs produced by the solvers. While our study is purely empirical, it is interesting nevertheless to mention a selection of papers that study CDCL from a theoretical perspective.\nThe field of proof complexity aims at gaining a theoretical understanding of the reasoning power of different proof systems.\nIt is well-known that an implicit CDCL run can be interpreted as resolution proof.\nIn the opposite direction, there has been a line of research    investigating the proof-theoretic strength of CDCL. This research culminated in papers proving that CDCL (with non-deterministic variable decisions) can efficiently reproduce resolution proofs  and CDCL (with random variable decisions) can efficiently find bounded-width resolution proofs [ref]25.\nThe complexity-theoretic power of restart in SAT solvers was studied in .\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: work, the paper found that lognormal distributions characterize this hardness distribution perfectly.\nThe approach of  lends itself to the analysis of existing SLS-CDCL hybrid solvers, like GapSAT [ref]15.\nThe advantage of the approach studied in  is that the conducted work is not lost in the case of a restart: only the logically equivalent instance could be changed while keeping the current\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
