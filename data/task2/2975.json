      "content": "Paper Title: OSOA: One-Shot Online Adaptation of Deep Generative Models for Lossless Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOSOA de facto defines a paradigm to compress the distribution (model) sequence.\nThe high level principle of it can trace back to a simple mathematical fact: a sequence can be uniquely determined by an initial point and a deterministic transition dynamics.\nIn this section, we provide a non-exhaustive list of how this high level principle can be instantiated in compression related literature.   showcased the potential of neural networks as static context models for text compression and discussed the possibility of adaptive modelling with neural networks.\n and DeepZip [ref]44 [ref]12 then instantiated the above principle for neural network based adaptive modelling with AC.\nThis line of work focuses on the sequential modelling of entries in one data point and thus is intra-data adaptive modelling; we focus on DGMs of the data distribution and thus is inter-data adaptive modelling.\nMoreover, our work additionally bridges the initial probabilistic model with the adaptation process which enables the adaptation of a pretrained model and the benefit from pretrained models of datasets sharing common structures.\nAnother line of work is sequential data lossy compression like videos  .\nThey introduce encoder-decoder networks for compression, where the encoder network is adapted to sequential data during compression and the decoder network is used for decompression.\nHowever, the setting is quite different from OSOA.\nFirst, they are the lossy compression method and could only use VAEs for compression, while ours mainly deals with lossless ones and works on any explicit generative model.\nSecond, they mainly deal with sequential data, while ours can compress any data batches, including the sequential ones. The model storage cost for deep learning based data lossless compression is also considered in [ref]5.\nThe work [ref]5 formulates the problem in a supervised learning paradigm, where both the sender and receiver need the base model and an auxiliary dataset for the label transmission, whereas our work formulates in the unsupervised learning paradigm and only the base model is needed.\nMoreover, in order for the auxiliary dataset needed in [ref]5 to effectively reduce the bitrate of the label (data to transfer), the label data needs high mutual information with the auxiliary dataset, which can form a stronger constraint. The same principle also applies to pseudo-random generators, where a unique sample can be identified by the index of the sample generated from a shared pseudo-random source.\n leveraged this fact and proposed an autoregressive style algorithm to compress the network parameter partition by partition with the sample indices of each partition and a predefined parameter prior.\nIn the setting of lossy compression of Bayesian neural networks,  chooses one sample from the learned approximate posterior distribution to compress and thus deviates from the setting of data lossless compression where the data is given instead of chosen. Prior to the developments in the deep learning literature, this high level principle has also been investigated for data compression.\nAdaptive dictionary methods, e.g., LZ77 , dynamically maintain a dictionary of substrings to gradually recover the optimal dictionary containing the repeated patterns in the sequence.\nApart from dictionaries, the probability simplex can also be dynamically maintained to gradually converge to the ground truth probabilities or to capture the distribution shifts, e.g., context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC)  .\nFurthermore, for context mixture modelling methods, the mixture weights can be adapted during compression to favour the context models that make more accurate predictions, e.g., PAQ .\nDue to the functional form of deep generative models, conducting OSOA of DGMs for lossless compression uniquely leverages the inductive bias of DGMs and could admit more flexible compression purpose modelling.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: related literature.   showcased the potential of neural networks as static context models for text compression and discussed the possibility of adaptive modelling with neural networks.\n and DeepZip [ref]44 [ref]12 then instantiated the above principle for neural network based adaptive modelling with AC.\nThis line of work focuses on the sequential modelling of entries in one data point and thus\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
