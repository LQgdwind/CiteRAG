Function-as-a-Service is an integral part of the serverless world as it enables hosting business logic in the form of functions that are typically stateless and driven by events.\nThis means that the deployed function code can be triggered by events originating from multiple heterogeneous event sources such as databases, message queues, or streaming platforms.\nMoreover, functions can be exposed as HTTP endpoints via API Gateways, or invoked on a scheduled basis, e.g., using cron jobs.\nThe actual list of supported event sources and possible ways to integrate events from third party services depends on the employed FaaS platform.\nSince the provider is responsible for managing functions, autoscaling comes out-of-the-box, also including scaling to zero instances when functions are not needed.\nThis introduces a new, more flexible cost model, where users do not need to pay for idle components as for Platform-as-a-Service deployments.\nHowever, in some cases the costs might become less appealing than with classic cloud service models [ref]14.\nMoreover, aside from its benefits, FaaS also has some well-known limitations  such as the cold start issue, limited execution time which might also vary on different FaaS platforms, or tighter-coupling with provider’s specifics due to outsourced management efforts .\nHowever, the combination of the above mentioned properties and limitations is what essentially affects the ways how FaaS platforms need to be chosen. The FaaS technology landscape comprises a variety of heterogeneous platforms, which are offered as-a-service, or can be installed on-premises.\nFor example, Microsoft introduced Azure Functions  while IBM started offering its Cloud Functions  based on the open source FaaS platform Apache Openwhisk .\nThe landscape of open source FaaS platforms started to evolve rapidly too, also due to the popularity of container orchestration brought by Kubernetes .\nMultiple open source products such as OpenFaaS , Kubeless , or Fission  that provide serverless, FaaS-based application development experience on top of Kubernetes.\nTypically, since functions are event-driven, FaaS platforms can be integrated with multiple possible event sources such as databases, messaging and streaming platforms, or provider-specific services such as AWS Alexa .\nAs a result of this heterogeneity, there is an ongoing work on maintaining the list of available technologies with high-level details such as web-site and documentation pointers curated by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) .\nMoreover, CNCF is also curating the work on standardization of event specification format called CloudEvents 0.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: where users do not need to pay for idle components as for Platform-as-a-Service deployments.\nHowever, in some cases the costs might become less appealing than with classic cloud service models [ref]14.\nMoreover, aside from its benefits, FaaS also has some well-known limitations  such as the cold start issue, limited execution time which might also vary on different FaaS platforms, or\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
