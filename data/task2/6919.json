Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

We compare our method with 5 traditional methods: FGR , TEASER [ref]50, GC-RANSAC , RANSAC , CG-SAC 2, 2 unsupervised learning-based methods: LEAD , Ppf-foldnet , and 4 supervised learning-based methods: 3DRegNet , DGR , DHVR [ref]32, PointDSC [ref]2. All learning-based methods are trained on the 3DMatch dataset and follow the same experiment setup for fair comparison. As shown in Table 1, our method improves the registration recall of DGR  and DHVR [ref]32 by about 1%, and PointDSC [ref]2 by about 0.5%, as well as the RE and TE have significantly decreased for all three backbones (on average 7.3% and 21%). More importantly, our method with PointDSC [ref]2 as backbone outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods. Figure 3 shows qualitative results comparison on challenging examples of 3DMatch  and 3DLoMatch  datasets when applying our TTA method to DGR . Our meta-auxiliary framework enables the model to better capture the internal features of each test-instance, leading to performance improvement. Figure 4 shows the 3DMatch registration results per scene. As an ablation study, we remove the meta learning diagram and simply optimize the joint loss Eq. 7 during training111At test-time, we still perform Eq. 10 for TTA.. By doing so, we obtain superior results than the backbone DGR , which demonstrates that our proposed auxiliary tasks can complement the primary PCR task and thus improves accuracy. Moreover, our final meta-auxiliary framework achieves the best. Figure 5 shows the robustness of our approach under different rotation and translation error thresholds.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: We first evaluate our method on the 3DMatch dataset and report the results in Table 1.
