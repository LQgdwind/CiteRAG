      "content": "Paper Title: Lower Bounds on the Running Time of Two-Way Quantum Finite Automata and Sublogarithmic-Space Quantum Turing Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we established strong lower bounds on the expected running time of 2QCFA, or sublogarithmic-space QTMs, that recognize particular languages with bounded error. In particular, the language Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} had been shown by Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2 to be recognizable with bounded error by a single-qubit 2QCFA in expected time 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(n)}. We have given a matching lower bound: no 2QCFA (of any size) can recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} with bounded error in expected time 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)}. Moreover, we have shown that no QTM, that runs in expected time 2n1−Ω​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛1Ω12^{n^{1-\\Omega(1)}} and uses space o​(log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\log n), can recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} with bounded error. This latter results is especially interesting, as a deterministic TM can recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} using space O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) (and, of course, polynomial time); therefore, polynomial time quantum TMs have no (asymptotic) advantage over polynomial time deterministic TMs in terms of the amount of space needed to recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal}. Our main technical result, Theorem 16, showed that, if a language L𝐿L is recognized with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected time T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n), then ∃a∈ℝ>0𝑎subscriptℝabsent0\\exists a\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0} (that depends only on the number of states of the 2QCFA) such that T​(n)=Ω​(DL​(n)a)𝑇𝑛Ωsubscript𝐷𝐿superscript𝑛𝑎T(n)=\\Omega(D_{L}(n)^{a}), where DLsubscript𝐷𝐿D_{L} is the Dwork-Stockmeyer nonregularity of L𝐿L. This result is extremely (qualitatively) similar to the landmark result of Dwork and Stockmeyer [10, Lemma 4.3], which showed that, if a language L𝐿L is recognized with bounded error by a 2PFA in expected time T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n), then ∃a∈ℝ>0𝑎subscriptℝabsent0\\exists a\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0} (that depends only on the number of states of the 2PFA) such that T​(n)=Ω​(2DL​(n)a)𝑇𝑛Ωsuperscript2subscript𝐷𝐿superscript𝑛𝑎T(n)=\\Omega(2^{D_{L}(n)^{a}}). We again note that both of these lower bounds are tight. We conclude by stating a few interesting open problems. While our lower bound on the expected running time T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n), of a 2QCFA that recognizes a language L𝐿L, in terms of DL​(n)subscript𝐷𝐿𝑛D_{L}(n) cannot be improved, it is natural to ask if one could establish a lower bound on T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n) in terms of a different hardness measure of L𝐿L that would be stronger for certain languages. Generalizing the definitions made in Section 4.1, let ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} denote a class of finite automata (e.g., DFA, NFA, 2DFA, etc.), let L𝐿L be a language over some alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma, and let AL,≤ℱ​(n)=min⁡{|M|:M∈ℱ​ and ​L​(M)∩Σ≤n=L∩Σ≤n}superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿ℱ𝑛:𝑀𝑀ℱ and 𝐿𝑀superscriptΣabsent𝑛𝐿superscriptΣabsent𝑛A_{L,\\leq}^{\\mathcal{F}}(n)=\\min\\{\\lvert M\\rvert:M\\in\\mathcal{F}\\text{ and }L(M)\\cap\\Sigma^{\\leq n}=L\\cap\\Sigma^{\\leq n}\\} denote the smallest number of states of an automaton of type ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} that agrees with L𝐿L on all strings of length at most n𝑛n. As discussed earlier, AL,≤D​F​A​(n)=DL​(n)superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛subscript𝐷𝐿𝑛A_{L,\\leq}^{DFA}(n)=D_{L}(n), for any language L𝐿L and for any n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}. Recall that DFA and 2DFA both recognize precisely the regular languages [ref]30, but for some L^∈𝖱𝖤𝖦^𝐿𝖱𝖤𝖦\\widehat{L}\\in\\mathsf{REG}, the smallest 2DFA that recognizes L^^𝐿\\widehat{L} might have many fewer states than the smallest DFA that recognizes L^^𝐿\\widehat{L}. In fact, there is a sequence of regular languages (Lk)k∈ℕsubscriptsubscript𝐿𝑘𝑘ℕ(L_{k})_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}} such that Lksubscript𝐿𝑘L_{k} can be recognized by a 5​k+55𝑘55k+5-state 2DFA, but any DFA that recognizes Lksubscript𝐿𝑘L_{k} requires at least kksuperscript𝑘𝑘k^{k} states ; however, this is (essentially) the largest succinctness advantage possible, as any language recognizable by a d𝑑d-state 2DFA is recognizable by a (d+2)d+1superscript𝑑2𝑑1(d+2)^{d+1}-state DFA . Of course, for any language L𝐿L, we have AL,≤2​D​F​A​(n)≤AL,≤D​F​A​(n)superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿2𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛A_{L,\\leq}^{2DFA}(n)\\leq A_{L,\\leq}^{DFA}(n), ∀nfor-all𝑛\\forall n. For certain languages L𝐿L, we have AL,≤2​D​F​A​(n)≪AL,≤D​F​A​(n)much-less-thansuperscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿2𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛A_{L,\\leq}^{2DFA}(n)\\ll A_{L,\\leq}^{DFA}(n), ∀nfor-all𝑛\\forall n; most significantly, this holds for the languages Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} and Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} shown by Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2 to be recognizable with bounded error by 2QCFA in, respectively, expected exponential time and expected polynomial time. In particular, it is easy to show that ALp​a​l,≤D​F​A​(n)=2Θ​(n)superscriptsubscript𝐴subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛superscript2Θ𝑛A_{L_{pal},\\leq}^{DFA}(n)=2^{\\Theta(n)}, ALe​q,≤D​F​A​(n)=Θ​(n)superscriptsubscript𝐴subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛Θ𝑛A_{L_{eq},\\leq}^{DFA}(n)=\\Theta(n), and ALp​a​l,≤2​D​F​A​(n)=nΘ​(1)superscriptsubscript𝐴subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙2𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛superscript𝑛Θ1A_{L_{pal},\\leq}^{2DFA}(n)=n^{\\Theta(1)}; moreover, ALe​q,≤2​D​F​A​(n)=logΘ​(1)⁡(n)superscriptsubscript𝐴subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞2𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛superscriptΘ1𝑛A_{L_{eq},\\leq}^{2DFA}(n)=\\log^{\\Theta(1)}(n) [21, Theorem 3 and Corollary 4]. In fact, this same phenomenon occurs for all the group word problems that we can show [ref]31 are recognized by 2QCFA. Might this be true for all languages recognizable by 2QCFA? If a language L𝐿L is recognizable with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected time T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n), does a stronger lower bound than T​(n)=(AL,≤2​D​F​A​(n))Ω​(1)𝑇𝑛superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿2𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛Ω1T(n)=(A_{L,\\leq}^{2DFA}(n))^{\\Omega(1)} hold? We have shown that the class of languages recognizable with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected polynomial time is contained in 𝖫/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{L/poly}. This type of dequantization result, which shows that the class of languages recognizable by a particular quantum model is contained in the class of languages recognizable by a particular classical model, is analogous to the Adleman-type  derandomization result 𝖡𝖯𝖫⊆𝖫/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖡𝖯𝖫𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{BPL}\\subseteq\\mathsf{L/poly}. It is natural to ask if our dequantization result might be extended, either to 2QCFA that run in a larger time bound, or to small-space QTM. Note that 𝖫/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒={L:AL,=2​D​F​A​(n)=nO​(1)}={L:AL,≤2​D​F​A​(n)=nO​(1)}⊋{L:AL,≤D​F​A​(n)=nO​(1)}𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒conditional-set𝐿superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿2𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛superscript𝑛𝑂1conditional-set𝐿superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿2𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛superscript𝑛𝑂1superset-of-and-not-equalsconditional-set𝐿superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛superscript𝑛𝑂1\\mathsf{L/poly}=\\{L:A_{L,=}^{2DFA}(n)=n^{O(1)}\\}=\\{L:A_{L,\\leq}^{2DFA}(n)=n^{O(1)}\\}\\supsetneq\\{L:A_{L,\\leq}^{DFA}(n)=n^{O(1)}\\}. This further demonstrates the value of the preceding open problem, as any improvement in the lower bound on T​(n)𝑇𝑛T(n) in terms of AL,≤2​D​F​A​(n)superscriptsubscript𝐴𝐿2𝐷𝐹𝐴𝑛A_{L,\\leq}^{2DFA}(n) would directly translate into an improved dequantization result. The seminal paper of Lipton and Zalcstein  showed that, if a finitely generated group G𝐺G has a faithful finite-dimensional (linear) representation over a field of characteristic 00, then WG∈𝖫subscript𝑊𝐺𝖫W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{L} (deterministic logspace). We [ref]31 recently adapted their technique to show that 2QCFA can recognize the word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} of any group G𝐺G that belongs to a certain (proper) subset of the set of groups to which their result applies: any group G𝐺G that has a faithful finite-dimensional unitary representation of a certain special type. The requirement, imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics, that the state of the quantum register of a 2QCFA must evolve unitarily, prevents a 2QCFA from (directly) implementing the Lipton-Zalcstein algorithm for any other groups; on the other hand, for those groups G𝐺G that do have such a representation, these same laws allow a 2QCFA to recognize WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} using only a constant amount of space. The word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} of any group G𝐺G that lacks such a representation (for example, all G∈𝒢vNilp∖𝒢vAb𝐺subscript𝒢vNilpsubscript𝒢vAbG\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}}\\setminus\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}}, or any infinite Kazhdan group, or any group of intermediate growth) seems to be a plausible candidate for a hard problem for 2QCFA (see [ref]31 for further discussion). Is there a finitely generated group G𝐺G that does not have a faithful finite-dimensional projective unitary representation for which WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖤𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖤𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQE2QCFA}? Concerning those groups with word problem recognizable by a 2QCFA in expected polynomial time, we have shown that, if G∈𝒢vAb𝐺subscript𝒢vAbG\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}}, then WG∈𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠ℚ¯​(2)⊆𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺subscript𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠¯ℚ2𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{coRQP2QCFA}_{\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}}(2)\\subseteq\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA} [31, Theorem 1.2]; moreover, if WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}, then G∈𝒢vNilp𝐺subscript𝒢vNilpG\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}} (Theorem 28). We have also shown, if WH∉𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐻𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{H}\\not\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}, where H∈𝒢vNilp𝐻subscript𝒢vNilpH\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}} is the (three-dimensional discrete) Heisenberg group, then the classification of those groups whose word problem is recognizable by a 2QCFA in expected polynomial time would be complete; in particular, we would have WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠⇔G∈𝒢vAb⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠𝐺subscript𝒢vAbW_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}\\Leftrightarrow G\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}} (Proposition 30). This naturally raises the following question. Is there a group G∈𝒢vNilp∖𝒢vAb𝐺subscript𝒢vNilpsubscript𝒢vAbG\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}}\\setminus\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}} such that WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}?
