All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe algebraic\ncharacterisation\nof the power of local consistency  \nwas one of the fundamental milestones of the algebraic theory of constraint satisfaction problems\n(CSPs)  5, and a key step towards the positive resolution of Feder–Vardi’s Dichotomy Conjecture  obtained, independently, by\nBulatov 6 and Zhuk .\nFix a relational structure 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} (consisting of a finite domain A𝐴A and a finite\nlist of relations over A𝐴A). The constraint satisfaction problem parameterised\nby 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} (in short, CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A})) is the following computational problem: Given an\ninstance structure 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} that admits a homomorphism (i.e., a\nrelation-preserving map) to 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, find an explicit such\nhomomorphism.111We denote the presence of a homomorphism from 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} to\n𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} by the expression 𝐗→𝐀→𝐗𝐀\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{A}. Suitably choosing the template 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}\nallows for casting as a CSP many diverse problems, including graph\ncolouring (if 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is a clique 𝐊csubscript𝐊𝑐\\mathbf{K}_{c}), graph homomorphism (if 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is\nan undirected graph), linear equations over a finite field (if 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}\nencodes the affine spaces over the field), and several variants of the\nBoolean satisfiability problem such as Horn Sat, k𝑘k-in-n𝑛n Sat, and Not-All-Equal Sat. Enforcing local consistency is one of the — if not the —\nmain algorithmic approaches developed\nfor solving CSPs.222Another approach is based around the idea of finding a\nsmall generating basis of the solution\nspace (generalising Gaussian elimination)  ; there are also combinations of the two approaches, cf.    .\nThe κ𝜅\\kappa-th level of the local-consistency algorithm searches a system of locally compatible homomorphisms from substructures of 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} of size up to\nκ𝜅\\kappa to 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. We call such system a κ𝜅\\kappa-strategy.\nThe width of CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A}) is then the minimum κ𝜅\\kappa for which a κ𝜅\\kappa-strategy can always be extended to a global solution.\nIf κ𝜅\\kappa is a constant, the κ𝜅\\kappa-th level of the algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the instance. Hence, any CSP having bounded width is in P.333For CSPs, the notion of bounded width admits various equivalent descriptions, in\nterms of expressibility via Datalog programs , pebble\ngames , tree-width duality ,\nand robust tractability , as well as solvability via\ndifferent algorithmic techniques including linear programming \nand semidefinite programming  .\nBoth\nBulatov’s 6\nand Zhuk’s  algorithms use local-consistency checking as a subroutine. Indeed, the ability to capture the power of local consistency   via\ntame congruence theory \nwas a\nkey step towards the resolution of the Dichotomy Conjecture. In particular,\nin [ref]42, it was established that the class of bounded-width CSPs admits a natural characterisation in terms of universal-algebraic objects known as polymorphisms — i.e., homomorphisms f:𝐀n→𝐀:𝑓→superscript𝐀𝑛𝐀f:\\mathbf{A}^{n}\\to\\mathbf{A}, where 𝐀nsuperscript𝐀𝑛\\mathbf{A}^{n} is\nthe n𝑛n-th direct power of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}.\nMore precisely, it was shown that\nCSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbf{A}) has bounded width precisely when it admits weak near-unanimity (WNU)\npolymorphisms of all arities — where f𝑓f is a WNU operation when it\nsatisfies the identities\nf​(a,b,b,…,b,b)=f​(b,a,b,…,b,b)=…=f​(b,b,b,…,a,b)=f​(b,b,b,…,b,a)𝑓𝑎𝑏𝑏…𝑏𝑏𝑓𝑏𝑎𝑏…𝑏𝑏…𝑓𝑏𝑏𝑏…𝑎𝑏𝑓𝑏𝑏𝑏…𝑏𝑎f(a,b,b,\\dots,b,b)=f(b,a,b,\\dots,b,b)=\\ldots=f(b,b,b,\\dots,a,b)=f(b,b,b,\\dots,b,a). Despite its success in the realm of CSPs, the algebraic description of the\npower of local consistency\nhas a\nlimitation — it does not extend to the promise variant of CSPs.\nThis can be formulated as follows: Fix two structures 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} such that 𝐀→𝐁→𝐀𝐁\\mathbf{A}\\to\\mathbf{B}; given some structure 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} such that 𝐗→𝐀→𝐗𝐀\\mathbf{X}\\to\\mathbf{A} as input, find an explicit homomorphism from 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} to 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}.\nHere, 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} should be interpreted as the strong and the weak versions of the template, respectively. Hence, the promise CSPCSP\\operatorname{CSP} parameterised by 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} (in short, PCSP⁡(𝐀,𝐁)PCSP𝐀𝐁\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})) asks to find an explicit, weakly satisfying assignment for an instance that is promised to be strongly satisfiable; in this sense, it captures approximability of the CSP   .\nMany fundamental computational questions that are inexpressible as standard CSPs\nadmit a formulation as PCSPs. Primary examples are the approximate graph colouring problem and its natural generalisation, the approximate graph homomorphism problem. The former corresponds to letting 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} be two cliques 𝐊csubscript𝐊𝑐\\mathbf{K}_{c} and 𝐊dsubscript𝐊𝑑\\mathbf{K}_{d}, respectively, with c≤d𝑐𝑑c\\leq d; the latter corresponds to letting 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} be two undirected graphs.\nThe complexity of both these problems is notoriously open. This is in striking\ncontrast with their non-promise variants — the graph colouring and the graph\nhomomorphism problems — whose complexity was classified already in 1972 by\nKarp 7 and in 1990 by Hell–Nešetřil 2, respectively. Part of the algebraic machinery developed in the decades of research on CSPs can be transferred to PCSPs.\nIn particular, polymorphisms have a natural promise version (homomorphisms 𝐀n→𝐁→superscript𝐀𝑛𝐁\\mathbf{A}^{n}\\to\\mathbf{B}) and, just like for CSPs, they completely determine the complexity of PCSPs, as established in  .\nYet, the CSP tools appear to lose a substantial part of their sharpness when they are adapted to the promise world.\nThe ultimate reason for this weakening is that the common, universal-algebraic\ncore underpinning many distinct CSP phenomena is less structured for PCSPs. In\nparticular, PCSP polymorphisms do not compose, which makes it\nimpossible to obtain new polymorphic identities from old ones. A clear example\nof this phenomenon is the break of the “WNU – local consistency” bond: While the local-consistency algorithm can be applied to solve PCSPs and, thus, the notion of width is well defined in the promise setting,\nthe presence of WNU polymorphisms of all arities does not guarantee bounded width for PCSPs, as established in . For example,\nthe PCSP parameterised by the structures encoding 222-in-444 Sat and Not-All-Equal Sat\nhas WNU polymorphisms of all arities although\nits width is unbounded — and, in fact, linear; see later.444Unless P==NP, WNU polymorphisms do not even guarantee polynomial-time tractability (via any algorithm): For instance, PCSP⁡(𝐊c,𝐊2​c)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑐subscript𝐊2𝑐\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{K}_{c},\\mathbf{K}_{2c}) has WNUs of all arities; yet, it was shown in  that the problem is NP-hard for c≥6𝑐6c\\geq 6.\nIn particular, this makes it infeasible to investigate the width of promise problems such as approximate graph homomorphism using the polymorphic tools currently available.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: as a subroutine.
