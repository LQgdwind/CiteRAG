      "content": "Paper Title: Provably Efficient Learning in Partially Observable Contextual Bandit\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work is related to prior research on causal bounds.\nIn , a general calculus known as do-calculus is developed for identifying causal effects using probabilistic tools.\nFor non-identifiable causal problems, Tian and Pearl  derives a model-free causal bound.\nZhang and Bareinboim  formulates a linear programming approach to obtain a causal bound in a discrete setting,\nwhile Shridharan and Iyengar  makes this approach scalable.\nLi and Pearl [ref]18  extend these methods to non-binary outcomes,\nand Zhang and Bareinboim [ref]41 employs instrumental variables to extend them to continuous outcomes.\nHowever, these LP-based methods may not be tight and rely on structural assumptions on hidden confounders.\nLi and Pearl  is the first to consider partially observable back-door and front-door criteria and employs a non-linear optimization problem to compute causal bounds.\nNonetheless, solving a non-linear optimization problem is computationally intensive and may get trapped in local optima.\nDuarte et al.  summarize these optimization-based methods and provides an automated approach to causal inference in discrete settings.\nZhang et al. [ref]42 employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to approximate causal bounds using observational and experimental data.\nHowever, this method is not directly applicable in our setting because the agent in our scenario has access to partial knowledge about latent confounders,\nwhereas Zhang et al. [ref]42 make structural assumptions on latent confounders.\nAs a result, Zhang et al. [ref]42 only need sample a random vector from Dirichlet distributions\nwhile we need to sample constrained table from distributions supported on more complex simplex. Our work is also closely linked to transfer learning.\nZhang and Bareinboim , Lazaric et al.  investigate transfer learning in multi-armed bandit problems.\nCai et al.  examine transfer learning in contextual bandits with covariate shift,\nwhere two tasks share the same reward function (causal effects) across two bandits.\nLiu et al.  apply transfer learning techniques in recommendation systems.\nLiu et al.  extend the ideas in  [ref]41 to reinforcement learning settings.\nA similar work is 5, which uses a partially missing offline dataset to enhance the performance of online learning in linear bandits.\nThough several papers   investigate partially observable contextual bandits,\nwe found few papers focusing on transfer learning in partially observable contextual bandits. Partially Observable Markov decision process (POMDP), including general partially observable dynamical systems 7, also shares the similarity with our setting.\nResearchers have developed various methods to address causal inference in POMDPs.\nFor example, Guo et al.  use instrumental variables to identify causal effects,\nwhile Shi et al. 2, Lu et al.  extend this approach to general proxy variables in offline policy evaluation.\nIn online reinforcement learning, Jin et al. , Wang et al. 8 use the backdoor criterion to explicitly adjust for confounding bias when confounders are fully observable.\nThey also incorporate uncertainty from partially observable confounders into the Bellman equation and demonstrate provably optimal learning with linear function approximation in both fully and partially observable tasks.\nHowever, due to the complexity of reinforcement learning, transfer learning in POMDPs with the general function approximation still remains unknown.\nIn our task 3, we address the problem of partially observable contextual bandit with the general function approximation under realizability assumption,\nwhich shows the potential to generalize to POMDPs and other related settings.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: causal bound.\nZhang and Bareinboim  formulates a linear programming approach to obtain a causal bound in a discrete setting,\nwhile Shridharan and Iyengar  makes this approach scalable.\nLi and Pearl [ref]18  extend these methods to non-binary outcomes,\nand Zhang and Bareinboim [ref]41 employs instrumental variables to extend them to continuous outcomes.\nHowever, these LP-based methods may not be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
