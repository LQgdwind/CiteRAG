      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing Parameters for Static Equilibrium of Discrete Elastic Rods with Active-Set Cholesky\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe solve the primal, box-constrained nonlinear minimization subproblem (12) using a Newton-type optimizer. One could approximate the box constraints with a penalty objective to ensure fully unconstrained inner linear systems  [ref]5, but penalty methods often require tedious parameter tuning to achieve acceptable results. Even with carefully tuned parameters, these methods may lead to compromises that violate box constraints. Therefore, instead of relying on penalty methods, we incorporate box constraints directly when computing the Newton directions, which is equivalent to solving box-constrained quadratic programs (BCQPs) . The Newton direction Δ​𝐩\\Delta\\mathbf{p} at k+1k+1 iteration can be computed by solving the following BCQP: where Δ​𝐩mink\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{min}}^{k} and Δ​𝐩maxk\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{max}}^{k} denote lower and upper bounds for Δ​𝐩\\Delta\\mathbf{p}, respectively. We omit 𝝀k\\bm{\\lambda}^{k} in the argument of ∇2L​(𝐩)\\nabla^{2}L(\\mathbf{p}) as it is independent of 𝝀k\\bm{\\lambda}^{k} (23). Assuming the ideal step length of one , we have 𝐩min≤𝐩k+1=𝐩k+Δ​𝐩k+1≤𝐩max\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\leq\\mathbf{p}^{k+1}=\\mathbf{p}^{k}+\\Delta\\mathbf{p}^{k+1}\\leq\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{max}}, giving Δ​𝐩mink=𝐩min−𝐩k\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{min}}^{k}=\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{min}}-\\mathbf{p}^{k} and Δ​𝐩maxk=𝐩max−𝐩k\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{max}}^{k}=\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{max}}-\\mathbf{p}^{k} . Given the augmented Lagrangian objective (15), we can compute its gradient as where ∇R​(𝐩)=𝐖​(𝐩−𝐩0)\\nabla R(\\mathbf{p})=\\mathbf{W}(\\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{p}_{0}), and we denote the Jacobian of 𝐟​(𝐩)\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{p}) with respect to 𝐩\\mathbf{p} by 𝐉(=∂𝐟​(𝐩)∂𝐩)∈ℝ(4​N−8)×(7​N−14)\\mathbf{J}\\left(=\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{p})}{\\partial\\mathbf{p}}\\right)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(4N-8)\\times(7N-14)} (details are provided in Sec. IV-E). Note that we treat 𝐌\\mathbf{M} (which is computed with the initial rest length 𝐥¯\\mathbf{\\bar{l}}  ) as constant, as 𝐌\\mathbf{M} is introduced to properly scale forces (14). Because the force formulations are primarily linear with respect to the rest shape and stiffness parameters, the second order derivatives of the forces with respect to 𝐩\\mathbf{p} are mostly zero. An exception is the second order derivatives with respect to 𝐥¯\\mathbf{\\bar{l}}; however, these components would be projected to zero to ensure SPD inner systems and valid Newton descent directions . Thus, using the exact Hessian with SPD projections would have only negligible benefits while increasing the implementation complexity and computational cost due to the involvement of third order tensors [ref]5. Therefore, we ignore the second order derivatives with respect to 𝐥¯\\mathbf{\\bar{l}} and approximate the Hessian in a Gauss-Newton style (excluding 𝝀\\bm{\\lambda} from arguments): As this approximated Hessian is guaranteed to be SPD, we can solve the convex BCQP (20) using MPRGP , accelerated with our active-set Cholesky preconditioner (see Sec. V).\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: nonlinear minimization subproblem (12) using a Newton-type optimizer.
