      "content": "Paper Title: Designing Efficient and High-performance AI Accelerators with Customized STT-MRAM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe demand for Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing at a rapid pace across a wide range of applications such, as self-driving vehicles, image and voice recognition, medical imaging and diagnosis, finance and banking, defense operations, etc. Because of these data-driven analytics and AI boom, demands in deep learning and AI will emerge at both data centers and the edge [ref]1  . In a recent market research [ref]1, it has been reported that AI-related semiconductors will see a growth of about 18 percent annually over the next few years - five times greater than the rate for non-AI applications. By 2025, AI-related semiconductors could account for almost 20 percent of all semiconductor demand, which would translate into about $67 billion in revenue [ref]1. As a result, significant R&D efforts in developing AI accelerators - optimized to achieve much higher throughput in deep learning compared to GPUs - are underway from academia, big techs, as well as startups . In AI technology innovation and leadership, high-throughput AI accelerator hardware chips will serve as the differentiator  [ref]1. On-chip memory capacity plays a significant role in the performance and energy efficiency of AI tasks    . In AI accelerator, off-chip Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) accesses can take 200 times and 10 times more energy compared to the local register file and global buffer memory, respectively . Larger on-chip buffer memory is needed to minimize DRAM accesses, and it can improve the energy efficiency and speed of the accelerator. However, conventional Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) based solutions suffer from area constraints and leakage power at advanced technology nodes  , which is a major concern for the energy-constraint IoT domain. STT-MRAM has the potential to replace SRAM as the global buffer in high-performance AI accelerators that require large on-chip memory  . For AI accelerators used in inference-only applications, the pre-trained weights need to be stored on-chip. As conventional embedded Flash storage suffers from scalability and reliability issues at advanced nodes , emerging memory-based solutions are required for AI accelerators. As analyzed in detail in , because of weight reuse in Deep Learning, radiation-induced soft errors in the memory block of the accelerator can impact the accuracy of AI models. This is especially a concern for safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles with rigid FIT requirements , and STT-MRAM can be a better option for these types of applications. At scaled technologies (e.g., 10nm and newer), static energy loss from the high leakage current dominates the overall energy dissipation in DRAM and SRAM technologies . Although Trench cap based embedded DRAM (eDRAM) has a higher density compared to SRAM, the leakage power and scaling challenges of eDRAM at advanced process nodes make it less competitive in the future technology roadmap . Beyond 28nm node eFlash faces scaling challenges, and eMRAM technology becomes superior over eFlash because of its lower write voltage and energy, higher endurance, lower area, and faster read/write time . The emerging resistive RAM (RRAM) and Phase Change (PCM) based cross-point memory suffers from endurance, reliability and variability problems  . Among all the emerging embedded memory technologies, STT-MRAM is one of the most promising due to its high energy efficiency, write endurance (e.g., more than 1 million cycles), high cell density, high-temperature data retention capability, operating voltage comparable with CMOS logic, and immunity to soft errors       . Moreover, STT-MRAM is higly compatible with CMOS and requires only 2 to 6 extra masks in the backend-of-the-line (BEOL) process  . Because of the leakage power issue, beyond a certain memory size, embedded MRAM becomes more energy efficient compared to SRAM . While performing Deep Learning/AI tasks, the throughput of the AI accelerator primarily depends on, (i) the number of Processing Elements (PE), and (ii) the size of on-chip buffer memory  . As a result, area-efficiency is of paramount importance for AI accelerators, and the critical design goal is to increase PE density and on-chip memory capacity. Because of compact size ( 6​F26superscript𝐹2\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ 6F^{2} of STT-MRAM vs.  100​F2100superscript𝐹2\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ 100F^{2} of SRAM  ), STT-MRAM has the potential to outperform conventional SRAM as the on-chip memory in accelerators. At iso-memory capacities, the MRAM module occupies much lower area compared to SRAM . Additionally, for power constraint mobile/edge/IoT applications, STT-MRAM based AI accelerators can significantly minimize static power compared to SRAMs. However, the higher write energy and write latency of conventional eMRAM can be a deterrent in their full adoption in AI accelerators. In this paper, we present a methodology to design efficient AI accelerators with customized STT-MRAM that can provide high bit cell density while still ensuring fast write speed and decreased write energy. We achieve this feat by analyzing the volatility requirement of weight and input/output feature-map (ifmap/ofmap) data on-chip, and scaling the eMRAM’s retention time accordingly without incurring unacceptable bit error rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive work on designing AI/Deep Learning accelerators with STT-MRAM based on-chip memory systems. The key contributions and highlights of this paper are, We present an innovative runtime reconfigurable core design that can be optimized for both dot products of convolution layers and matrix multiplications of fully connected layers. We derive the analytical expressions of occupancy times of weights and input/output feature maps in the global memory of the AI accelerator between different stages (i.e., Conv. layer followed by Conv., Conv. layer followed by Fully-Connected (FC) layer, and FC-FC) of AI/Deep Learning operation. Guided by this data activity duration, we scale the retention time of STT-MRAM and customize the design for application as the global buffer memory in energy-efficient AI accelerator. We consider Process variations and runtime Temperature fluctuations in this scaling procedure to ensure negligible read/write Bit Error Rates (BER) and retention failures across all corners. Based on detailed design space exploration using state-of-the-art AI/Deep Learning models, an AI accelerator system and MRAM technology co-design framework is presented with the key innovations, - (i) Optimizes STT global buffer size to minimize DRAM accesses. (ii) A novel scratchpad-assisted STT-MRAM based global buffer architecture is presented to minimize the writes to the MRAM by bypassing writes of the partial ofmaps to the scratchpad. (iii) For inference-only tasks, to store the trained weights a specially customized embedded STT-MRAM - as a Flash replacement - with optimized retention time (e.g., 3 to 4 years) and robust BER is used. To further improve the energy and area efficiency, we exploited the inherent error tolerance of Deep Learning/AI models and created two STT-MRAM banks for the global buffer. For the first bank, the thermal stability factor is scaled further to a relaxed BER, and the less critical half of the weights/fmap bits (e.g., LSB groups) are assigned to this memory block. The second bank has scaled retention time with a robust BER, and the other remaining half of the bits (e.g., MSB groups) are stored in this bank. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The background is discussed in Section II. STT-MARM based optimum AI/Deep learning accelerator design methodology is presented in Section III. The AI accelerator-aware eMRAM technology co-design methodology is presented in Section IV. We present Simulation Results in Section V, Related work in Section VI, and Conclusions in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: imaging and diagnosis, finance and banking, defense operations, etc. Because of these data-driven analytics and AI boom, demands in deep learning and AI will emerge at both data centers and the edge [ref]1  .
