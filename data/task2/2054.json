      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Problems Complete for Nondeterministic FPT time and Logarithmic Space1footnote 11footnote 1This paper contains the results reported in [17], with the exception of results on reconfiguration, and one result from [5] (the reduction in the proof of Theorem 25).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection, we discuss the XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP}-completeness problem of the Bandwidth problem. The question\nwhere the parameterized complexity of Bandwidth lies was actually the starting point for the\ninvestigations whose outcome is reported in this paper; with the main result of this subsection (Theorem 25) we answer a question that was asked over a quarter of a century ago. In the Bandwidth problem, we\nask if the bandwidth of a given graph G𝐺G is\nat most k𝑘k.\nThe problem models the question to permute rows and columns of a symmetric matrix, such that all\nnon-zero entries are at a small ‘band’ along the main diagonal.\nAlready in 1976, the problem was shown to be NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-complete by Papadimitriou . Later,\nseveral special cases were shown to be hard; these include caterpillars with hairs of length at most three . A caterpillar is a tree where all vertices of degree at least three are on a common path; the hairs are the paths attached to this main path. We are interested in the parameterized variant of the problem, where the target bandwidth is the parameter: Bandwidth\nGiven: Integer k𝑘k, undirected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E)\nParameter: k𝑘k\nQuestion: Is there a bijection f:V→[1,|V|]:𝑓→𝑉1𝑉f:V\\rightarrow[1,|V|] such that for all edges\n{v,w}∈E𝑣𝑤𝐸\\{v,w\\}\\in E: |f​(v)−f​(w)|≤k𝑓𝑣𝑓𝑤𝑘|f(v)-f(w)|\\leq k? Bandwidth belongs to XPXP\\mathrm{XP}. In 1980, Saxe  showed that Bandwidth can be solved\nin O​(nk+1)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑘1O(n^{k+1}) time; this was later improved to O​(nk)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑘O(n^{k}) by Gurari and Sudborough [ref]37.\nIn 1994, Bodlaender and et.  reported that Bandwidth for trees is W​[t]Wdelimited-[]𝑡\\mathrm{W}[t]-hard\nfor all t∈𝐙+𝑡superscript𝐙t\\in{\\bf Z}^{+} — the proof of that fact was published 26 years later [ref]5.\nA sketch of the proof appears in the monograph by Downey and Fellows . More recently,\nDregi and Lokshtanov  showed that Bandwidth is\nW​Wdelimited-[]1\\mathrm{W}-hard for trees of pathwidth at most two. In addition, they showed that there is no\nalgorithm for Bandwidth on trees of pathwidth at most two with running time\nof the form f​(k)​no​(k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘f(k)n^{o(k)} assuming the\nExponential Time Hypothesis. Below, we show that Bandwidth is\nXNLP-complete for caterpillars with hairs of\nlength at most three.444The reduction from\nUniform Emulation of Weighted Paths\nto this problem was reported in\n[ref]5, at WG 2020, where it was used\nto show that\nBandwidth is W​[t]Wdelimited-[]𝑡\\mathrm{W}[t]-hard for all t𝑡t.\nThis reduction uses gadgets from the NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-completeness proof by Monien . Bandwidth is in XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP}. This can be seen in different ways: one can look at the XPXP\\mathrm{XP} algorithms for Bandwidth from\n or [ref]37, and observe that when instead of making full tables in the dynamic programming algorithm, we guess from each table one entry,\none obtains an algorithm in XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP}. Alternatively, we loop over all connected components W𝑊W of G𝐺G, compute its size and for each, guess for i𝑖i from 111 to |W|𝑊|W| the i𝑖ith vertex in the linear ordering, i.e., f−1​(i)superscript𝑓1𝑖f^{-1}(i). Keep\nthe last 2​k+12𝑘12k+1 guessed vertices in memory, and verify that all neighbors of f−1​(i−k)superscript𝑓1𝑖𝑘f^{-1}(i-k) belong to\nf−1​[i−2​k,i]superscript𝑓1𝑖2𝑘𝑖f^{-1}[i-2k,i].\n∎ Bandwidth is XNLP-complete, when restricted to caterpillars with hair length at most three. To prove Theorem 25, we transform from the Weighted Path Emulation with f​(1)=M𝑓1𝑀f(1)=M problem (cf. 23). Let PNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} and PMsubscript𝑃𝑀P_{M} be paths with weight function\nw:{1,…,N}→{1,…,c}:𝑤→1…𝑁1…𝑐w:\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rightarrow\\{1,\\ldots,c\\}, and let c=∑i=1Nw​(i)/M𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁𝑤𝑖𝑀c=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}w(i)/M is the emulation factor. (Note that we may always restrict our weights to be between 111 and c𝑐c since otherwise no emulation can exist.)\nThus, ∑i=1Nw​(i)=c​Msuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁𝑤𝑖𝑐𝑀\\sum_{i=1}^{N}w(i)=cM. Recall that we parameterized this problem by the value c𝑐c. Assume that c>6𝑐6c>6; otherwise, obtain an equivalent instance by multiplying all weights by 7. Let b=12​c+6𝑏12𝑐6b=12c+6. Let k=9​b​c+b𝑘9𝑏𝑐𝑏k=9bc+b. Note that k𝑘k is even.\nWe give a caterpillar G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with hair length at most three, with the property that\nPNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} has a uniform emulation on PMsubscript𝑃𝑀P_{M}, if and only if G𝐺G has bandwidth at most k𝑘k. G𝐺G is constructed in the following way: We have a left barrier: a vertex p0subscript𝑝0p_{0} which has 2​k−12𝑘12k-1 hairs of length one, and is neighbor to p1subscript𝑝1p_{1}. We have a path with 5​M−35𝑀35M-3 vertices, p1,…,p5​M−3subscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝5𝑀3p_{1},\\ldots,p_{5M-3}. As written above, p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} is\nadjacent to p0subscript𝑝0p_{0}. Each vertex of the form 5​i−25𝑖25i-2 or 5​i5𝑖5i (1≤i≤M−11𝑖𝑀11\\leq i\\leq M-1) receives\n2​k−2​b2𝑘2𝑏2k-2b hairs of length one. See Figure 5. We call this part the floor. Adjacent to vertex p5​M−3subscript𝑝5𝑀3p_{5M-3}, we add the turning point from the proof of Monien .\nWe have vertices va=p5​M−3subscript𝑣𝑎subscript𝑝5𝑀3v_{a}=p_{5M-3}, vbsubscript𝑣𝑏v_{b}, vcsubscript𝑣𝑐v_{c}, vdsubscript𝑣𝑑v_{d}, vesubscript𝑣𝑒v_{e}, vfsubscript𝑣𝑓v_{f}, vgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g}, which are successive vertices on\na path.\nI.e., we identify one vertex of the turning point (vasubscript𝑣𝑎v_{a}) with the last vertex of the floor p5​M−3subscript𝑝5𝑀3p_{5M-3}.\nTo vcsubscript𝑣𝑐v_{c}, we add 32​(k−2)32𝑘2\\frac{3}{2}(k-2) hairs of length one; to vdsubscript𝑣𝑑v_{d}, we add k𝑘k hairs of length three, and to vfsubscript𝑣𝑓v_{f} we add 32​(k−2)32𝑘2\\frac{3}{2}(k-2) hairs of length one. Note that this construction is identical to the one by Monien ; vertex names are chosen to facilitate comparison with Moniens proof. See Figure 7. Add a path with 6​N−56𝑁56N-5 vertices, say y1,…​y6​n−5subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦6𝑛5y_{1},\\ldots y_{6n-5}, with y1subscript𝑦1y_{1} adjacent to vgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g}. To each vertex of the form y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5}, add 9​b⋅w​(i)⋅9𝑏𝑤𝑖9b\\cdot w(i) hairs of length one.\nWe call this part the weighted path gadget. Note that the number of vertices that we defined so far and that is not part of the turning point equals\n2​k+5​M−3+2​(M−1)​(2​k−2​b)+6​N−5+9​b​∑i=1Nwi=5​M+4​M​k−2​k−4​M​b+4​b+9​b​c​M2𝑘5𝑀32𝑀12𝑘2𝑏6𝑁59𝑏superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁subscript𝑤𝑖5𝑀4𝑀𝑘2𝑘4𝑀𝑏4𝑏9𝑏𝑐𝑀2k+5M-3+2(M-1)(2k-2b)+6N-5+9b\\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i}=5M+4Mk-2k-4Mb+4b+9bcM.\nLet this number be α𝛼\\alpha. One easily sees that α≤(5​M−2)​k−1𝛼5𝑀2𝑘1\\alpha\\leq(5M-2)k-1.\nAdd a path with (5​M−2)​k−1−α5𝑀2𝑘1𝛼(5M-2)k-1-\\alpha vertices and make it adjacent to y6​nsubscript𝑦6𝑛y_{6n}.\nWe call this the filler path. Let G𝐺G be the remaining graph. Clearly, G𝐺G is a caterpillar with hair length at most three. It is interesting to note that the hair lengths larger than one are only used for the turning point. The correctness of the construction follows from the following lemma. Suppose PNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} has a uniform emulation g𝑔g on PMsubscript𝑃𝑀P_{M} with emulation factor c𝑐c with f​(1)=M𝑓1𝑀f(1)=M. Then the bandwidth of G𝐺G is at most k𝑘k. Suppose we are given a uniform emulation f:{1,…,N}→{1,…,M}:𝑓→1…𝑁1…𝑀f:\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rightarrow\\{1,\\ldots,M\\} of PNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} on\nPMsubscript𝑃𝑀P_{M} (for weight function w𝑤w). We now can construct a layout g𝑔g\nof G𝐺G with bandwidth at most k𝑘k as follows. For 1≤i≤5​M−31𝑖5𝑀31\\leq i\\leq 5M-3, set g​(pi)=(i+1)​k+1𝑔subscript𝑝𝑖𝑖1𝑘1g(p_{i})=(i+1)k+1.\nEach of the hairs of p0subscript𝑝0p_{0} is mapped by g𝑔g to\na different value in {1,…,2​k}∖{k+1}1…2𝑘𝑘1\\{1,\\ldots,2k\\}\\setminus\\{k+1\\}. (We later define how to map the hairs of\nother vertices of the floor.) For the turning point, we set g​(vg)=g​(va)−1=(5​M−2)​k𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎15𝑀2𝑘g(v_{g})=g(v_{a})-1=(5M-2)k. The other vertices of the turning point\nreceive values larger than (5​M−2)​k5𝑀2𝑘(5M-2)k; the remaining layout for the turning point is identical to the one described by Monien . Each position of the form (i+1)​k+1+j𝑖1𝑘1𝑗(i+1)k+1+j for 1≤i≤5​M−31𝑖5𝑀31\\leq i\\leq 5M-3 with j∈{−1,+1}𝑗11j\\in\\{-1,+1\\} is said\nto be reserved. Note these are the positions before and after the image of the vertices pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}.\nThese positions are reserved for the filler path. We call the positions between g​(p5​i−4)𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖4g(p_{5i-4}) and g​(p5​i−3)𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖3g(p_{5i-3}) the i𝑖ith gap, for 1≤i≤M1𝑖𝑀1\\leq i\\leq M.\nGaps 111 till M−1𝑀1M-1 have at this point k−1𝑘1k-1 unused integers of which two are reversed; in\ngap M𝑀M we have k−1𝑘1k-1 unused integers (vgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g} is mapped in the gap) of which one is reserved.\n(The gaps are used to layout ‘most of’ the vertices of the weighted path gadget.) We now show how to map the weighted path gadget. We start with fixing the images of vertices\nof the form y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5}.\nFor each i𝑖i, 1≤i≤N1𝑖𝑁1\\leq i\\leq N, set g​(y6​i−5)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖5g(y_{6i-5}) to be the first integer in the f​(i)𝑓𝑖f(i)th gap\nthat is so far not used and\nis not reserved. As there are at most c𝑐c vertices of PNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} mapped by f𝑓f to a specific vertex of PMsubscript𝑃𝑀P_{M},\nwe have that g​(y6​i−5)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖5g(y_{6i-5}) is in the interval [f​(p5​(i−1))+3,f​(p5​(i−1))+c+2]𝑓subscript𝑝5𝑖13𝑓subscript𝑝5𝑖1𝑐2[f(p_{5(i-1)})+3,f(p_{5(i-1)})+c+2],\nthus |g​(y6​i−5)−g​(y6​i+1)|≤5​k+c𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖5𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖15𝑘𝑐|g(y_{6i-5})-g(y_{6i+1})|\\leq 5k+c; i.e., they can be in the same, or neighboring gaps. As f​(1)=M𝑓1𝑀f(1)=M, we have that y1subscript𝑦1y_{1} is placed in the M𝑀Mth gap, as is, by construction its neighbor\nvgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g}; thus |g​(y1)−g​(vg)|≤k𝑔subscript𝑦1𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔𝑘|g(y_{1})-g(v_{g})|\\leq k. The next step is to map the vertices of the form yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} with j𝑗j not of the form 6​i−56𝑖56i-5. We must do this\nin such a way, that neighboring vertices are mapped to integers that differ at most k𝑘k, taking into\naccount the mapping vertices of the form y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5} as defined above. So, we consider, for i∈{1,…,N−1}𝑖1…𝑁1i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N-1\\}, the vertices on the path from y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5} to y6​i+1subscript𝑦6𝑖1y_{6i+1} are mapped as follows.\nIf y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5} and y6​i+1subscript𝑦6𝑖1y_{6i+1} are mapped to the same gap, then map the five vertices on this path also to this gap, to so far unused and unreserved values.\nOtherwise, define a ‘largest possible step to the right’ from an integer α𝛼\\alpha as the largest integer\nthat is at most α+k𝛼𝑘\\alpha+k and is not used or reserved. If g​(y6​i−5)<g​(y6​i+1)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖5𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖1g(y_{6i-5})<g(y_{6i+1}), then put\ng​(y6​i−4)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖4g(y_{6i-4}) at the largest possible step to the right from g​(y6​i−5)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖5g(y_{6i-5}), and then\ng​(y6​i−3)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖3g(y_{6i-3}) at the largest possible step to the right from g​(y6​i−4)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖4g(y_{6i-4}), and continue doing so,\ntill we placed g​(y6​i)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖g(y_{6i}). If g​(y6​i+1)<g​(y6​i−5)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖1𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖5g(y_{6i+1})<g(y_{6i-5}), a similar construction is followed. For each j𝑗j, 1≤j≤5​M−41𝑗5𝑀41\\leq j\\leq 5M-4, we map at most 11​c11𝑐11c vertices of the form yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} to integers in\nthe interval [g​(pj),g​(pj+1)]𝑔subscript𝑝𝑗𝑔subscript𝑝𝑗1[g(p_{j}),g(p_{j+1})]. If the interval is a gap, then for each such yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}, there is a vertex of the form y6′−5subscript𝑦superscript6′5y_{6^{\\prime}-5} s at distance at most five from yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} mapped to this gap. As we have at most\nc𝑐c vertices of the form y6​i′−5subscript𝑦6superscript𝑖′5y_{6i^{\\prime}-5} in the gap, we have at most 11​c11𝑐11c vertices of the form yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} mapped to this gap. If the interval is not a gap, then for each such yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}, there is a vertex of the form y6′−5subscript𝑦superscript6′5y_{6^{\\prime}-5} s at distance at most five from yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} mapped to the last gap before the interval. Thus, we have\nat most 10​c10𝑐10c vertices of the form yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} mapped to this gap. (A more precise counting argument can give a smaller bound.)\n∎ For all i𝑖i, 1≤i<N1𝑖𝑁1\\leq i<N, |g(y6​i)−g(y6​i+1|≤k|g(y_{6i})-g(y_{6i+1}|\\leq k. The result clearly holds when y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5} and y6​i+1subscript𝑦6𝑖1y_{6i+1} are placed in the same gap. If they are\nplaced in different gaps, then we consider the\ncase that g​(y6​i−5)<g​(y6​i+1)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖5𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖1g(y_{6i-5})<g(y_{6i+1}); the other case is similar. Note that each largest possible step to the right makes a jump that is at least k−22​c−5𝑘22𝑐5k-22c-5: from\nany k𝑘k consecutive integers, we have used at most 22​c22𝑐22c for vertices of the form yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} (by Claim 26.1, with vertices possible in two consecutive intervals), reserved four integers,\nand used one for a vertex of the form pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}. Recall that |g​(y6​i−5)−g​(y6​i+1)|≤5​k+c𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖5𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑖15𝑘𝑐|g(y_{6i-5})-g(y_{6i+1})|\\leq 5k+c. Five largest jumps to the right bridge\nat least 5​(k−22​c−5)5𝑘22𝑐55(k-22c-5), hence g​(6​i+1)−g​(6​i)≤23​c+25<k𝑔6𝑖1𝑔6𝑖23𝑐25𝑘g(6i+1)-g(6i)\\leq 23c+25<k.\n∎ The next step is to map an initial part of the filler part, to ‘move it’ to the last number in the M−1𝑀1M-1st\ngap.\nSuppose f​(vN)=i𝑓subscript𝑣𝑁𝑖f(v_{N})=i. Now, map the first vertex of the filler\npath to f​(p5​i−3)−1𝑓subscript𝑝5𝑖31f(p_{5i-3})-1, i.e., the last number in the i𝑖ith gap (which was reserved), and then,\nwhile we did not yet place a vertex on f​(p​(5​(M−1)−3))−1𝑓𝑝5𝑀131f(p(5(M-1)-3))-1 (the last number in the M−1𝑀1M-1st gap), map\nk𝑘k larger than its predecessor on the path,\ni.e., the second vertex goes to g​(p5​i−3)+k−1𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖3𝑘1g(p_{5i-3})+k-1, the third to g​(p5​i−3)+2​k−1𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖32𝑘1g(p_{5i-3})+2k-1, etc. In each\ncase, we place the vertex on the last number in the gap; these were reserved so not used by other vertices. At this point, each open interval (g(pi),g(pi+1)(g(p_{i}),g(p_{i+1}) has at most 11​c+111𝑐111c+1 used positions, and at at most\nfour reserved positions. Thus, at least k−1−(11​c+5)≥k−b=9​b​c𝑘111𝑐5𝑘𝑏9𝑏𝑐k-1-(11c+5)\\geq k-b=9bc positions are unused and not reserved\nin this interval. For each vertex of the form p5​i−2subscript𝑝5𝑖2p_{5i-2} or p5​isubscript𝑝5𝑖p_{5i} (1≤i≤M−1)1𝑖𝑀1(1\\leq i\\leq M-1),\nsay pi′subscript𝑝superscript𝑖′p_{i^{\\prime}}\nwe map k−b𝑘𝑏k-b of its hairs to the interval before it: i.e., to integers in (g​(pi′−1),g​(pi′))𝑔subscript𝑝superscript𝑖′1𝑔subscript𝑝superscript𝑖′(g(p_{i^{\\prime}-1}),g(p_{i^{\\prime}})) that\nare unused and not reserved, and k−b𝑘𝑏k-b hairs to the interval after it, i.e., to integers in (g​(pi′),g​(pi′+1))𝑔subscript𝑝superscript𝑖′𝑔subscript𝑝superscript𝑖′1(g(p_{i^{\\prime}}),g(p_{i^{\\prime}+1})) that\nare unused and not reserved. For each j𝑗j, 1≤j≤M1𝑗𝑀1\\leq j\\leq M, the total number of hairs adjacent to vertices of the form y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5}, 1≤i≤N1𝑖𝑁1\\leq i\\leq N with y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5} mapped to the j𝑗jth gap equals 9​b​c9𝑏𝑐9bc. As f𝑓f is uniform, we have that ∑i:f​(i)=jwi=csubscript:𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑗subscript𝑤𝑖𝑐\\sum_{i:f(i)=j}w_{i}=c. A vertex y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5} is placed in the j𝑗jth gap, if and only if it contributes to this sum. As the number of hairs of y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5} equals\n9​b⋅w​(i)⋅9𝑏𝑤𝑖9b\\cdot w(i), the result follows.\n∎ For each vertex of the form y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5}, 1≤i≤N1𝑖𝑁1\\leq i\\leq N, we map all its hairs to the gap to which it\nbelongs. I.e., if f​(i)=j𝑓𝑖𝑗f(i)=j, then all hairs of y6​i−5subscript𝑦6𝑖5y_{6i-5} are mapped to unused and not reserved\nintegers in (g(p5​j−4,g(p5​j−3)(g(p_{5j-4},g(p_{5j-3}). From the analysis above, we have sufficiently many such integers\nto map all hairs. Finally, we lay out the filler path to fill up all remaining unused values: go from f​(p​(5​(M−1)−4))−1𝑓𝑝5𝑀141f(p(5(M-1)-4))-1\nto the last unused number of the M𝑀Mth gap (which is smaller than f​(p​(5​(M−1)−4))+k−1𝑓𝑝5𝑀14𝑘1f(p(5(M-1)-4))+k-1, and then,\nwhile there are unused numbers left, place each next vertex of the filler gap on the largest so far unused number.\nThus, from this point on, the filler gap goes from right to left, skipping only used numbers.\nThe reserved numbers of the form (i+1)​k+1𝑖1𝑘1(i+1)k+1 guarantee that by doing so, we never skip more than k−1𝑘1k-1 numbers, thus preserving the bandwidth condition. This finishes the construction of the linear ordering g𝑔g. From the analysis above, it follows that g𝑔g\nhas bandwidth k𝑘k.\n∎ Suppose the bandwidth of G𝐺G is at most k𝑘k. Then PNsubscript𝑃𝑁P_{N} has a uniform emulation on PMsubscript𝑃𝑀P_{M} with emulation factor c𝑐c with f​(1)=M𝑓1𝑀f(1)=M. Suppose we have a linear ordering g𝑔g of G𝐺G of bandwidth at most k𝑘k. First we note that all vertices outside the left barrier and the turning point have to be mapped between\nthe left barrier and the turning point. For the left barrier, this is easy to see: p0subscript𝑝0p_{0} has 2​k2𝑘2k neighbors, which will occupy all 2​k2𝑘2k positions with distance at most k𝑘k to g​(p0)𝑔subscript𝑝0g(p_{0}), and thus all other vertices\nmust be at the same side of p0subscript𝑝0p_{0} as p1subscript𝑝1p_{1}. Now, we look at the turning point, and use a result by Monien [44, Lemma 1]. Let g𝑔g be a linear ordering of a graph G𝐺G containing the turning point as subgraph.\n|g​(va)−g​(vg)|≤1𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔1|g(v_{a})-g(v_{g})|\\leq 1, and one of the following two cases holds. All vertices in the turning point except vasubscript𝑣𝑎v_{a} and vgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g} have an image under g𝑔g that is\nlarger than max⁡{g​(va),g​(vg)}𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔\\max\\{g(v_{a}),g(v_{g})\\}; all vertices in G𝐺G that do not belong to the turning point have an image that is smaller than min⁡{g​(va),g​(vg)}𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔\\min\\{g(v_{a}),g(v_{g})\\}. All vertices in the turning point except vasubscript𝑣𝑎v_{a} and vgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g} have an image under g𝑔g that is\nsmaller than min⁡{g​(va),g​(vg)}𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔\\min\\{g(v_{a}),g(v_{g})\\}; all vertices in G𝐺G that do not belong to the turning point have an image that is larger than max⁡{g​(va),g​(vg)}𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔\\max\\{g(v_{a}),g(v_{g})\\}. I.e., we have that vasubscript𝑣𝑎v_{a} and vgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g} are next to each other; all other vertices of the\nturning point are at one side of this pair, and all vertices not in the turning point at the other side.\nWithout loss of generality, suppose g​(p0)<g​(va)𝑔subscript𝑝0𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎g(p_{0})<g(v_{a}). Thus, from left to right we have:\nk𝑘k hairs of p0subscript𝑝0p_{0}; p0subscript𝑝0p_{0}; k−1𝑘1k-1 hairs of p0subscript𝑝0p_{0}; p1subscript𝑝1p_{1}; all vertices except p1subscript𝑝1p_{1}, vertices in the left barrier, and vertices in the turning point; va=p5​M−3subscript𝑣𝑎subscript𝑝5𝑀3v_{a}=p_{5M-3} and vgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g} (in this order, or reversed); all other vertices of the turning point. g​(p0)=k+1𝑔subscript𝑝0𝑘1g(p_{0})=k+1, and {g​(va),g​(vg)}={(5​M−2)​k,(5​K−2)​k+1}𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔5𝑀2𝑘5𝐾2𝑘1\\{g(v_{a}),g(v_{g})\\}=\\{(5M-2)k,(5K-2)k+1\\}. p0subscript𝑝0p_{0} is placed after k𝑘k hairs, so must have image k+1𝑘1k+1.\nThe total number of vertices not in the turning point equals (5​M−2)​k−15𝑀2𝑘1(5M-2)k-1, see the construction\nof the filler path. The pair {g​(va),g​(vg)}𝑔subscript𝑣𝑎𝑔subscript𝑣𝑔\\{g(v_{a}),g(v_{g})\\} comes after all vertices not in the turning point,\nand before all other vertices from the turning point, so must go to (5​M−2)​k5𝑀2𝑘(5M-2)k and (5​M−2)​k+15𝑀2𝑘1(5M-2)k+1.\n∎ For all i𝑖i, 0≤i<5​M−30𝑖5𝑀30\\leq i<5M-3,\neither g​(pi+1)=g​(pi)+k𝑔subscript𝑝𝑖1𝑔subscript𝑝𝑖𝑘g(p_{i+1})=g(p_{i})+k or g​(pi+1)=g​(pi)+k−1𝑔subscript𝑝𝑖1𝑔subscript𝑝𝑖𝑘1g(p_{i+1})=g(p_{i})+k-1. The path from p0subscript𝑝0p_{0} to va=p5​M−3subscript𝑣𝑎subscript𝑝5𝑀3v_{a}=p_{5M-3} has M−3𝑀3M-3 edges. For each pair pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}, pi+1subscript𝑝𝑖1p_{i+1}, the difference\nof the images is at most k𝑘k (by the bandwidth condition), but the total of the differences over all pairs on the path must\nbe at least (M−3)⋅k−1⋅𝑀3𝑘1(M-3)\\cdot k-1.\n∎ Now, call the positions between g​(p5​i−5)𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖5g(p_{5i-5}) AND g​(p5​i−2)𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖2g(p_{5i-2}) the i𝑖ith enlarged gap, for 1≤i≤M−11𝑖𝑀11\\leq i\\leq M-1; and between g​(5​M−5)𝑔5𝑀5g(5M-5) and g​(p5​M−3)𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑀3g(p_{5M-3}) the M𝑀Mth enlarged gap. Each vertex of the form y6​j−5subscript𝑦6𝑗5y_{6j-5} is mapped to an enlarged gap. Suppose not. As g​(y6​j−5)>g​(p1)𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑗5𝑔subscript𝑝1g(y_{6j-5})>g(p_{1}) and g​(y6​j−5)<g5​M−3𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑗5subscript𝑔5𝑀3g(y_{6j-5})<g_{5M-3}, by construction of the left barrier\nand turning point, we have that there is an i𝑖i with g​(y6​j−5)∈[g​(p5​i−2),g​(p5​i)]𝑔subscript𝑦6𝑗5𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖2𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖g(y_{6j-5})\\in[g(p_{5i-2}),g(p_{5i})].\nNow, [g​(p5​i−3),g​(p5​i+1)]𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖3𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖1[g(p_{5i-3}),g(p_{5i+1})] contains 4​k−4​b4𝑘4𝑏4k-4b hairs attached to vertices p5​i−2subscript𝑝5𝑖2p_{5i-2} and p5​isubscript𝑝5𝑖p_{5i}\nand 9​b⋅w​(j)≥9​b⋅9𝑏𝑤𝑗9𝑏9b\\cdot w(j)\\geq 9b hairs attached to y6​j−5subscript𝑦6𝑗5y_{6j-5}. The interval has size at most 4​k4𝑘4k, but has\n4​k+b4𝑘𝑏4k+b hairs mapped to it; contradiction.\n∎ Now, let f:{1,…,N}→{1,…,M}:𝑓→1…𝑁1…𝑀f:\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rightarrow\\{1,\\ldots,M\\}, such that f​(j)=i𝑓𝑗𝑖f(j)=i, if y6​j−5subscript𝑦6𝑗5y_{6j-5}\nis mapped to the i𝑖ith enlarged gap. By Claim 28.3, f𝑓f is well defined. f𝑓f is an emulation. Note that there is a path with six edges from a vertex y6​j−5subscript𝑦6𝑗5y_{6j-5} to y6​(j+1)−5subscript𝑦6𝑗15y_{6(j+1)-5}. As the distance\nbetween vertices pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} in the linear ordering is either k𝑘k or k−1𝑘1k-1, each edge in this path can\njump over at most one vertex of the form pαsubscript𝑝𝛼p_{\\alpha}. To go from the i𝑖ith enlarged gap to the i+2𝑖2i+2nd enlarged gap,\nwe must jump at least seven vertices of the form pαsubscript𝑝𝛼p_{\\alpha}, so y6​j−5subscript𝑦6𝑗5y_{6j-5} and y6​(j+1)−5subscript𝑦6𝑗15y_{6(j+1)-5}\nare mapped to the same or neighboring enlarged gaps, thus |f​(j)−f​(j+1)|≤1𝑓𝑗𝑓𝑗11|f(j)-f(j+1)|\\leq 1.\n∎ f𝑓f is uniform. We show that for each i𝑖i, ∑j:f​(j)=iw​(j)≤csubscript:𝑗𝑓𝑗𝑖𝑤𝑗𝑐\\sum_{j:f(j)=i}w(j)\\leq c. As f𝑓f is uniform, we have\nthat for each i𝑖i: ∑j:f​(j)=iw​(j)=csubscript:𝑗𝑓𝑗𝑖𝑤𝑗𝑐\\sum_{j:f(j)=i}w(j)=c. We only give the proof for 1<i<M1𝑖𝑀1<i<M; the cases i=1𝑖1i=1 and i=M𝑖𝑀i=M are similar (using that no vertices\ncan be mapped to values used by the left blockade and turning point) and omitted. Consider an i𝑖i, 1<i<M1𝑖𝑀1<i<M.\nFor each j𝑗j with f​(i)=j𝑓𝑖𝑗f(i)=j, all 9​b⋅w​(j)⋅9𝑏𝑤𝑗9b\\cdot w(j) hairs of y6​j−5subscript𝑦6𝑗5y_{6j-5} are mapped to the interval\n[g​(p5​i−6),g​(p5​i−1)]𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖6𝑔subscript𝑝5𝑖1[g(p_{5i-6}),g(p_{5i-1})]. This interval has size at most 5​k5𝑘5k, contains 4​k−4​b4𝑘4𝑏4k-4b hairs of\npαsubscript𝑝𝛼p_{\\alpha}-vertices, thus can contain at most 8​k+4​b8𝑘4𝑏8k+4b hairs of vertices yβsubscript𝑦𝛽y_{\\beta}. All hairs of\nvertices y6​j−5subscript𝑦6𝑗5y_{6j-5} with f​(j)=i𝑓𝑗𝑖f(j)=i must be mapped to this interval. As the number of these hairs\nequals 9​b9𝑏9b times the sum of the weights of these vertices, we have ∑j:f​(j)=iw​(j)≤csubscript:𝑗𝑓𝑗𝑖𝑤𝑗𝑐\\sum_{j:f(j)=i}w(j)\\leq c.\n∎ Finally, we observe that f​(1)=M𝑓1𝑀f(1)=M: y1subscript𝑦1y_{1} is incident to vgsubscript𝑣𝑔v_{g}, and thus y1subscript𝑦1y_{1} must be placed in\nthe M𝑀Mth enlarged gap. Now, with this last observation, Claims 28.3, 28.4 and 28.5 together show Lemma 27.\n∎ An illustration of the construction of a linear ordering, given a uniform emulation is given in Figure 8. As the construction of the caterpillar G𝐺G can be done in polynomial time and\nlogarithmic space, given M𝑀M, N𝑁N and w𝑤w,\nTheorem 25 now follows.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: to XPXP\\mathrm{XP}.
