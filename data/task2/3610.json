      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Multi-Tenant Deep Learning Inference on GPU\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDL Application and Computing Trends Deep Learning (DL) models have achieved superior performance in cognitive tasks like vision, speech and language domain, and have been adopted in medical analysis, machine translation, product recommendation, etc. The momentum of DL-based intelligence has appealed millions of users and created a wide-spectrum of cloud & edge applications like VR/AR games, intelligent robots and vehicles, large-scale recommendation systems, and even metaverse applications [ref]12, many of which are featured with multi-modality, multi-tasking and substantial task complexity, as shown in Figure 1 (a). The emergence of such massive DL applications motivates the adoption of DL accelerators,\nespecially GPUs, in both cloud and edge.\nAccording to the report , GPUs accounted for 85% of the $2.98B cloud data center accelerator market in 2018.\nThe edge hardware market, with the emerging smart manufacturing, surveillance applications, is also projected to grow from $920M in 2021 to $2,080M by 2026 and the edge GPUs are also taking a steady growth to more than 50% market share with Nvidia Jetson, TX2, Xavier, Orin, etc. Within such trends, the capacity of recent generations of GPUs demonstrates exponential growing speed.111\nDetailed scaling statistics of GPU capacities could be found in .\nFrom K80, P40, and P100 to recent T40, V100, A100 architectures, GPUs maintain a trend of doubling performance.\nThe last generation of V100  offers 120 Tera floating point operations per second (TFLOPS) and 900 GB/s memory bandwidth, and the numbers further increase to 312 TFLOPS and 1.6TB/s memory bandwidth for the newer A100 [ref]6. A100 reports the ResNet50  inference speed of 36,436 images/second, showing the computing capacity that overwhelms the limited needs from conventional single DL model execution schemes.\nTherefore, with such scaling trends in both application complexity and GPU capacity, single model execution cannot fulfill the needs of application scenarios nor fully utilizing the GPUs.\n Multi-Tenant DL Inference, as shown in Figure 1 (b), is one promising solution to the aforementioned scenarios with multi-modality and multi-tasking needs by running mixed DL model workloads simultaneously on one powerful GPU to improve the utilization, throughput, and power efficiency, etc. There are recently many emerging works that tackle the multi-tenant DL inference optimization on GPUs. These works usually take single optimization point of view drawing from traditional single-model optimization experiences, e.g., either from the DL model scheduling perspective   , or the GPU resource management perspective   . However, achieving the ult-most efficiency for multi-tenant DL computing is more challenging as it needs to thoroughly consider the differences between single vs. multi-tenant DL inference, and requires multi-layer DL optimization or full-stack co-optimization.\nAs so, there is a great need for a systematical review of opportunities and challenges on multi-tenant DL inference optimization. Our survey is the first work that thoroughly analyzes the multi-tenant GPU scheduling problem, summarizes the major differences in single- vs. multi-tenant computing optimization, and reveals the emerging opportunities and potential benefits of multi-tenant DL inference on GPUs. To ease the understanding, our work also draws some experience from pevious DL computing stacks, and compares single vs multi-tenant DL inference on GPU from a hierarchical perspective. Single vs Multi-Tenant: A Hierarchical Comparison. Traditional single-tenant DL compilers (Figure 1 (c)) already include multi-layer optimization: algorithm-level compression  9 , graph-level rewriting   , runtime scheduling   and kernel tuning [ref]3   , etc. However, optimizations targeting at single-tenant are usually ill-fitted for multi-tenant inference with following examples. From the top graph level, multi-tenant DL inference workloads represented in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) come with significantly higher volume of multi-model operators than single model. This incurs many non-mergeable operators and exposes much larger scheduling space.\nAnother example in the lower kernel level is TVM [ref]3. As one of the most competitive kernel auto-tuning framework, TVM comes with a built-in assumption of single-tenant execution setting, the tuning configuration of which aims to saturate all SMs and memory bandwidth of the GPU.\nSuch assumption and the single-tenant targeted tuning however becomes unsuitable for multi-kernel concurrent execution with partial resource available for each kernel. According to , the maximum throughput gap comparing single-tenant vs. multi-tenant tuned configurations for the same computing kernel could reach 5×5\\times difference. Further down to the GPU hardware, multi-tenant DL inference requires many scheduling support to address problems like inter-tenant interference, such as dedicated GPU hardware primitives for resource partitioning, isolation and allocation, etc.\nWith the current trends towards multi-tenant applications, GPU vendors like Nvidia have recently released many new features including Multi-Stream 2, Multi-Process Service (MPS) 5, Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) 4 and virtual GPUs (vCS) 6 to support both runtime scheduling and resource management, which exposes new research opportunities for multi-tenant DL scheduling and optimization. With such differences considered, this work will adopt such a view of optimization stack to thoroughly analyze the multi-tenant challenges and introduce emerging works. By reviewing the emerging challenges, opportunities, and research works on multi-tenant DL computing on the GPU, we hope this survey could motivate more design and innovations in this promising new domain.\nThe remaining paper is organized as follows:\nSection II introduces the novel challenges and opportunities in multi-tenant GPU computing stack and a high-level overview of current vendor GPU support.\nSection III summarizes recent research works for multi-tenant computing in detail.\nWe then give our vision and insights in Section IV.\nSection V concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: millions of users and created a wide-spectrum of cloud & edge applications like VR/AR games, intelligent robots and vehicles, large-scale recommendation systems, and even metaverse applications [ref]12, many of which are featured with multi-modality, multi-tasking and substantial task complexity, as shown in Figure 1 (a).
