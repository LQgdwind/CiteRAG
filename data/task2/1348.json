      "content": "Paper Title: Discovering Airline-Specific Business Intelligence from Online Passenger Reviews: An Unsupervised Text Analytics Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany studies have shown the importance of user-generated content (UGC), such as online reviews and tweets, for improving customer satisfaction , service quality  , brand reputation , and loyalty . One of the frequently used approaches for processing unstructured textual data is topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning technique capable of scanning a set of documents to identify and extract the hidden semantics that occurs in it [ref]8. Different variants of topic models are employed to detect dominant topics (or aspects) discussed in customer reviews, tweets, and other textual data from versatile domains [ref]8. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is one of the first algorithms for topic modeling, which generates a high-dimensional co-occurrence matrix (or document-term matrix) based on the corpus, and then employs singular value decomposition to decompose them into topics . Nevertheless, LSA is not a generative model and uses many ad-hoc parameters. To overcome these limitations, probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) was proposed . Subsequently, other unsupervised topic modeling algorithms, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) , were proposed to extract topics using different statistical approaches. Another NLP technique to understand customer perception is sentiment analysis (SA) or opinion mining, which aims to identify and extract subjective information in texts such as opinions, attitudes, and emotions . The SA methods used to determine the sentiment of a sentence/text can be broadly classified into three types – lexicon-based (uses set of rules and a dictionary of words tagged to their corresponding sentiment polarity), machine learning-based (uses supervised algorithms to learn patterns from sentiment-tagged sentences) and hybrid approach (adopts a combination of lexical features and machine learning algorithms) . Topic models have been used to identify the key dimensions of service quality discussed in OCR across several industries . Additionally, sentiment analyzers have been employed to detect emotions and opinions associated with the reviews . Nevertheless, only few studies have employed these techniques to understand drivers of passenger satisfaction in the airline industry . Korfiatis et al.  mined multiple airlines’ online reviews and extracted 20 aspects of service quality using the structural topic model. Besides, they found good customer service to have the greatest positive impact on the customer rating, while delays and cancellations led to stronger negative impacts. Likewise, Sezgen et al.  scraped 5,120 online reviews and extracted key factors affecting passenger satisfaction and dissatisfaction using LSA. Their analysis revealed ten and twelve factors associated with positive and negative reviews, respectively. Specifically, friendliness of staff and ticket prices were found to be critical drivers of satisfaction, while legroom and flight disruptions were the main reasons for dissatisfaction. Recently, Lucini et al.  identified topics affecting passenger satisfaction using the LDA model and predicted a customer’s recommendation using the aspects as features. Few works on airline review analysis have adopted a different approach to detect both topics and the associated sentiments. Instead of using topic models, Siering et al. 2 used domain-specific words to detect service aspects discussed by the passengers, and lexicon-based approach to determine the sentiment polarity. Further, they leveraged the aspect-level sentiments and machine learning algorithms to predict a customer’s recommendation (yes or no) for an airline. Ma et al. 3 extracted prevalent topics and sentiments from customer tweets following an overbooking crisis encountered by an airline. Their analysis indicated the overall customer perception to be negative towards the incident, and vary over time depending on the crisis management approach adopted by the airline. Besides understanding the customer’s perspectives, OCR is also used to gather business intelligence (BI), which involves the identification of both company-specific and competitive information to aid and improve the decision-making process 4. Traditionally, BI is majorly engendered from structured and semi-structured data, but with the increase in availability of web data and the development of tools to mine them, unstructured data can be effectively analyzed to gain intelligence [ref]8 . This has been the case with the airlines’ industry as well. Xu et al. 5 mined online reviews of airlines with service failures to identify causes and therefore implement a recovery strategy to improve the airline’s reputation, finance, and customer retention 5. Similarly, Hong et al. 6 analyzed online reviews to identify the marketing performance of individual airlines. Instead of relying on OCR, Hu et al. 7 utilized tweets pertaining to global airline companies to help them understand their brand perceptions, which is crucial to strategic decision-making. While most of these research works focused on analyzing UGC to help individual companies identify their strengths and weaknesses, very few studies also focused on mining the competitor’s UGC to assess potential opportunities and threats (e.g., 8 ).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: unstructured textual data is topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning technique capable of scanning a set of documents to identify and extract the hidden semantics that occurs in it [ref]8.
