      "content": "Paper Title: Ultraproducts in abstract categorical logic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe need to abstract the notion of logic emerged as a response to the profusion of logic in mathematics and computer science. In the 1930s, A. Tarski and his Polish school proposed a generalization of the inference relation ⊢proves\\vdash .\nThis generalization was only of syntactic nature, leaving aside any consideration for the semantics. The absence of an abstract notion of semantics prevented the generalization of any result from model theory. Among the constructions of abstract logic with a generalized notion of semantics, we can cite J. Barwise’s approach  and the theory of institutions . Although being the first work generalizing semantics, Barwise’s construction only dealt with extensions of first-order logic (FOL). Some model theory results could be established within this framework, the most famous being Lindstrom’s theorem , which characterizes FOL in terms of fundamental theoretic properties (compactness and Loweineim-Skolem theorem). Institutions provided a much deeper generalization, addressing software specification and semantics issues. The extension provided by institutions is manifold: institutions include a notion of signature category; sentences are members of a set (syntax free, as in Tarskian logics) and models are objects of a category (semantics free); institutions preserve the renaming property extended to any signature morphism. This property is called the satisfaction condition. The theory of institutions provided a framework for generalizing many results across computer science [ref]5     and model theory 0 1 2 3. In contrast to Barwise’s approach, institutions eschew any presumption regarding the internal structure, neither for the sentences nor for the models (although it remains feasible to define propositional connectives and FOL quantifiers internally 1). However, generalizing standard results often requires the closure of formulas under some or all propositional connectives and FOL quantifiers. For instance, Robinson’s consistency 3 and Craig’s interpolation 4 in institutions suppose the closure of sentences under negations, finite conjunctions, and universal quantification. Similarly, the formalization of abductive reasoning of  within institutions assumes sentences closed under propositional connectives. In 5, we proposed to define abstractly the notion of logic by supposing that, as in institutions, no commitment is made to the internal structure of models except that they have a carrier taken in a category with some properties (called prop-category in the paper – see Definition 2.1 below), unlike in institions, formulas are inductively defined from propositional connectives, an abstraction of atomic formulas (called basic formulas in the paper), and an abstract notion of quantifiers. As in categorical logic, we defined in 5 semantics by interpreting formulas from context as subobjects of an object of a given category (Cartesian111Also called cartesian monoidal categories., regular, coherent, Grothendieck toposes, elementary toposes – see 6).\nTherefore, the semantic framework of 5 abstracts both contexts and subobjects in the spirit of Lawvere’s hyperdoctrines 7 8. Subsequently, our abstract logic follows the principles of categorical logic: an internal logic has been defined as an extension of propositional logic (PL) over this semantic framework. In this abstract logic, as is customary in categorical logic, we proposed an entailment system formulated as a sequent calculus for which we proved a completeness result. Here, we propose to pursue the generalization of model theory results. More precisely, we propose to generalize one of the most important and powerful classical model theory methods, namely the ultraproducts method 9. Hence, we propose to study conditions for the development of the ultraproducts method as independently as possible of quantifiers. Ultraproducts are quotients of directed products of a family of structures, typically used in abstract algebra and logic, especially in model theory. The authors in 0 provide various applications of ultraproducts to model theory, algebra, and nonstandard analysis. In particular, the chapter by J. Keisler 1 surveys the classical results on ultraproducts of first-order structures. J. Keisler explains that the idea goes back to the construction of nonstandard models of arithmetic by T. Skolem 2, then studied for fields by E. Hewitt 3 before a generalization to first-order structures by J. Łoś 4. S. Galbor also surveys applications where methods based on ultrafilters play significant roles 5: in model theory for the compactness theorem, theorems about axiomatizability, and characterizations of elementary equivalence, in algebra to construct new fields such as the hyperreal numbers, or in nonstandard analysis for the theories of infinitesimal numbers. The ultraproducts method has already been abstractly investigated within the framework of FOL and its restrictions 6 1 7. We will show that some of these results can be considered as an instance of our main result.\nIn the context of categorical logic, a more general result than Łoś’s theorem (in the sense that it implies the classical version in SetSet\\mathrm{Set}) has been demonstrated by replacing the notion of first-order theory with that of pretopos and by defining models as functors from a pretopos to Set 8. Classical Łoś’s theorem is then derived by replacing pretopos with the syntactic category of the suitable first-order theory.\nIn 8, M. Makkai also showed that any small pretopos 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} can be recovered from the category of models M​o​d​(𝒞)𝑀𝑜𝑑𝒞Mod(\\mathcal{C}) together with some additional structure given by the ultraproduct construction (ultracategories). Note that no assumption is made on the category of models in our abstract categorical logic (except, of course, small products on which filtered products are defined). This lack of structure associated with the interpretation of formulas is the source of the main difficulty in proving Łoś’s result. Indeed, the standard notion of filtered products is built componentwise on models and only provides finite intersections. Consequently, more information is required to prove the result in the case of basic formulas (also called atomic formulas). Intuitively, the base case of the induction proof of Łoś’s result can only be obtained by assuming some conditions. Hence, we will provide necessary conditions – namely a sup-generation condition and a finiteness condition – that guarantee the result for basic formulas. These conditions echo those given by R. Diaconescu for institutions 1. The main contributions of this paper are a generalization of the ultraproduct method and a generalization of Łoś’s theorem, the fundamental result on ultraproducts, both independently of quantifiers. Additionally, the relevance of all introduced definitions and results is demonstrated on several different logics throughout the paper. In the preliminary section, besides briefly reviewing some terminology, concepts, and notations about filters and filtered colimits, we recall the categorical definitions of filtered products and present the notion of prop-categories, which generalizes the standard notion of subobjects in category theory. Section 3 reviews the abstract categorical logic defined in 5 via the notions of semantical systems, quantifiers, and internal logic. Section 4 extends the fundamental theorem of ultraproducts as independently as possible of a given quantifier. Note that Section 3 is substantially similar to Sections 2, 3, and 4 of 5. However, we add additional properties to the various notions, which we then leverage to obtain Łoś’s theorem in Section 4, which is the main result presented in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: property extended to any signature morphism.
