      "content": "Paper Title: Influencing Long-Term Behavior in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe demonstrate FURTHER’s efficacy on a diverse suite of multiagent benchmark domains.\nWe refer to Appendix G for experimental details and hyperparameters.\nThe code is available at https://bit.ly/3fXArAo, and video highlights are available at https://bit.ly/37IWeb9.\nThe mean and 95% confidence interval computed for 20 seeds are shown in each figure. We compare FURTHER with the following baselines (see Section G.2 for details): LILI [ref]8: An approach that considers the learning dynamics of other agents but suffers from myopic evaluation bias by optimizing the discounted return objective (see Equation 25). MASAC : An approach that extends SAC [ref]27 to a multiagent learning setting by having centralized critics [ref]12. This baseline assumes other agents will have stationary policies in the future and thus neglects their learning (see Equation 26). We note that these selected baselines are closely related to FURTHER, optimizing different objectives with respect to 𝓤𝒊superscript𝓤𝒊\\bm{\\mathcal{U}^{\\shortminus i}}. In particular, LILI and MASAC optimize the discounted return objective with and without modeling 𝓤𝒊superscript𝓤𝒊\\bm{\\mathcal{U}^{\\shortminus i}}, respectively. As such, our baseline choices enable us to separately analyze the effect of FURTHER’s novel average reward objective. For completeness, we also consider additional baselines of an opponent modeling method (DRON) and an incentive MARL method (MOA). These results are shown in Appendix H. Question 1. How do methods perform when playing against a q𝑞q-learning agent? We consider playing the iterated Bach or Stravinsky game (IBS; see Figure 4(a)).\nThis general-sum game involves conflicting elements with two pure strategy Nash equilibria, where convergence to (B,B) and (S,S) equilibrium are more preferable from agent i𝑖i’s and j𝑗j’s perspective, respectively.\nSuppose agent i𝑖i plays against a naive learner j𝑗j, such as q𝑞q-learner , whose initial q𝑞q-values are set to prefer action (S).\nIn this experimental setting, it is ideal for agent i𝑖i to change j𝑗j’s influence behavior to select (B) such that they converge to i𝑖i’s optimal pure strategy Nash equilibrium of (B,B). The average reward performance when an agent i𝑖i, trained with either FURTHER or the baseline methods, interacts with the q𝑞q-learner j𝑗j is shown in Figure 5(a).\nThere are two notable observations.\nFirst, the FURTHER agent i𝑖i consistently converges to its optimal equilibrium of (B,B), while the LILI agent often converges to the sub-optimal equilibrium of (S,S).\nThe FURTHER agent i𝑖i learns to select (B) while j𝑗j selects (S), receives the worst rewards of zero, and waits until j𝑗j’s q𝑞q-value for (S) is updated to be lower than the q𝑞q-value for (B).\nWith the limiting view, i𝑖i learns that the waiting process is only temporary, and receiving the eventual rewards of 2 by converging to (B,B) is optimal.\nBy contrast, LILI suffers from myopic evaluation and shows decreased performance upon convergence because the agent prefers simply converging to the sub-optimal equilibrium rather than waiting indefinitely.\nFigure 6(a) also shows that LILI achieves sub-optimal performance for any value of γ𝛾\\gamma and shows unstable learning as γ→1→𝛾1\\gamma\\!\\rightarrow\\!1.\nSecond, FURTHER and LILI outperform the other approach of MASAC, showing the benefit of considering the active influence on future policies of other agents. Which equilibrium do methods converge to in a self-play setting? We experiment with a self-play setting in which both agents learn with the same algorithm in an iterated cooperative (IC) game with identical payoffs (see Figure 4(b)).\nThis game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria of (U,U) and (D,D), in which the (D,D) equilibrium Pareto dominates the other.\nFigure 5(b) shows the average reward performance as the training iteration increases.\nFirst we find that LILI performs better than MASAC by considering the learning of agents. However, similar to the IBS results, we observe that FURTHER consistently converges to the best equilibrium of (D,D) while the baseline methods can converge to the sub-optimal equilibrium of (U,U) due to the myopic view. How does FURTHER’s limiting optimization perform directly against baselines? We consider FURTHER agent i𝑖i directly competing against either LILI or MASAC opponent j𝑗j in the iterated matching pennies (IMP) game (see Figure 4(c)).\nTo show that FURTHER has a long-term perspective and thus can collect more rewards than the opposing method over time, we evaluate using a metric of relative accumulated reward summed up to the current timestep: ∑trti−rtjsubscript𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑖𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑗𝑡\\textstyle\\sum\\limits\\nolimits_{t}r^{i}_{t}\\!-\\!r^{j}_{t}.\nFigure 5(c) shows that the relative accumulated reward for FURTHER is positive for both settings, meaning that FURTHER receives higher rewards than LILI and MASAC over time.\nThis result suggests that FURTHER is more effective than LILI by employing the limiting view via the average reward formulation.\nThis result also conveys that it is beneficial to consider the underlying learning dynamics rather than ignoring them because FURTHER can more easily exploit the MASAC opponent and achieve higher accumulated rewards than when competing against the LILI opponent. How does FURTHER scale to a more complex environment? To answer this question, we use the MuJoCo RoboSumo domain (; see Figure 4(d)), where two ant robots compete with each other with the objective of pushing the opponent out of the ring.\nThe reward function consists of a sparse reward of 555 for winning against the opponent and shaped rewards of moving towards the opponent and pushing the opponent further from the center of the ring.\nThis environment has complex interactions because an agent must learn how to control its joints with continuous action space to move around the ring while learning to push the opponent.\nSimilar to the setup in Question 3, FURTHER agent i𝑖i directly competes against either LILI or MASAC opponent j𝑗j.\nWe note that each agent has only partial observations about its opponent. As such, an agent infers its opponent’s hidden policies and learning dynamics based on partial observations.\nWe show the RoboSumo results in Figure 6(b).\nConsistent with our results in the iterated matrix games, we observe that FURTHER gains more rewards than the baselines over time and wins against MASAC more often than against LILI.\nThe averaged winning rate across the entire interaction shows that FURTHER wins against LILI and MASAC with 60.6% and 63.9%, respectively.\nTherefore, FURTHER provides a scalable framework that can learn policies in an environment with complex interactions and continuous action space. How does FURTHER scale to a large number of agents? Finally, we show the scalability of our method regarding the number of agents using the battle domain (; see Figure 4(e)).\nIn this large-scale mixed cooperative-competitive setting, a red team of 25 agents and a blue team of 25 agents interact in a gridworld, where each agent collaborates with its teammates to eliminate the opponents.\nSpecifically, we compare when red and blue agents learn with the mean-field version of FURTHER (i.e., FURTHER-MF) and LILI (i.e., LILI-MF), respectively, where they predict the mean actions of neighboring agents.\nWe note that all 50 agents learn in a decentralized manner without sharing parameters with one another.\nIt is evident that FURTHER-MF outperforms LILI-MF, which shows the effectiveness of having the limiting perspective.\nThis result also conveys that FURTHER can easily incorporate other techniques in multiagent learning and show improved performance in large-scale settings.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: at https://bit.ly/37IWeb9.\nThe mean and 95% confidence interval computed for 20 seeds are shown in each figure. We compare FURTHER with the following baselines (see Section G.2 for details): LILI [ref]8: An approach that considers the learning dynamics of other agents but suffers from myopic evaluation bias by optimizing the discounted return objective (see Equation 25).
