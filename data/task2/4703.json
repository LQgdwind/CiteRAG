      "content": "Paper Title: Real-Time Guarantees in Routerless Networks-on-Chip\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWormhole switching has been widely used in NoCs because of its balance between performance and buffering overheads in the router. Unlike switching protocols such as store-and-forward (SAF) and virtual cut-through (VCT), wormhole does not require buffers to have capacity to store a full packet. Each packet is forwarded as a sequence of fixed size data units (flits), the first of them (the header) carries information about routing and packet size. As the header advances along the specified route, the remaining flits follow in a pipelined way. If the output link requested by a header flit is supposed to be routed via a link already in use, it is blocked until the link becomes available. In this situation, the second flit will then be blocked by the first one, and so on, until all flits stall. They will then remain buffered in one or more routers along the packet route (depending on the buffering capabilities of each router) until the header is released, so the pipelined transmission can continue. The smaller the buffers on each router, the larger the number of routers that will have to store a given packet in a blockage scenario. If there is not enough buffer space distributed over routers in the packet route, the backpressure will propagate back to the packet sender, preventing it from injecting further flits into the network. Since a packet can be stored by several routers and occupy multiple links at a time, the potential congestion over the network is increased. This makes it harder to predict the time it takes for a given packet to cross the network, because many of the links along its route may be blocked by other packets. This is not the case in store-and-forward (SAF) switching, where each packet uses only one link at a time, or in virtual cut-through (VCT), where packets are only stored in the router where they experience blocking . Wormhole switching has been widely preferred over SAF or VCT in on-chip interconnects because having smaller buffers allowed for smaller overheads in silicon area and energy dissipation. Several arbitration and flow control mechanisms were proposed to improve time predictability in on-chip networks, using resource sharing policies such as time-division multiplexing (TDM)  and prioritised virtual channels (VCs) . TDM tries to avoid latency interference between packets by reserving link bandwidth to each packet flow. Priority-arbitrated virtual channels allow packets to interfere with each other but aims to quantify the interference upper bounds for each packet flow. Priority-based mechanisms are seen as superior, since they are work conserving (do not reserve resources) and more flexible (do not require exact knowledge of packet sizes or injection times), but not always preferred because of higher overheads in area and energy dissipation. A wider review of real-time network-on-chip architectures is beyond the scope of this paper, and a good survey can be found in  . Our focus in this paper is actually on the analytical models that evaluate how well a given architecture can provide guarantees to real-time application communication traffic. That aspect is not covered in detail by  , so we provide a brief review and additional references over the next paragraph, with a focus on models for priority-based NoCs. Most of the real-time analytical models for priority-based wormhole NoCs have been based on analysis developed in the mid 1990s for general purpose wormhole networks    . NoC analysis models proposed by Shi and Burns  and Kashif and Patel  customised those general models for the specifics of the on-chip communication mechanisms and were widely used until the discovery of the multi-point progressive blocking (MPB) problem by Xiong et al. . MPB exposed a flaw in the assumptions of the original analysis approaches from the 1990s which made all subsequent analytical models unsafe. The problem manifests itself in indirect interference scenarios happening downstream from the path of a given packet, but affecting that packet in complex ways due to backpressure effects caused by the limited buffering per router (which is a key part of wormhole switching). As MPB was underestimated in all those analytical models, they can lead to optimistic predictions of schedulability. Since the discovery of the MPB problem, it has been safely modelled by several approaches     (i.e. no known optimistic counter-examples). Despite the consistent increase in tightness from one approach to the next, all of them are still significantly more conservative than previous analyses that did not model MPB. In  , authors used network calculus in an attempt to improve the tightness against  , which is based on response-time analysis as its predecessors, but they could not show any dominance of one model over the other. This provided more evidence that the MPB problem is not an artifact of a specific type of analysis, but instead is an inherent issue that comes with wormhole networks and backpressure (albeit a rare one - it took more than a decade for it to be uncovered). Accordingly, some of the latest works in the area of real-time NoCs are attempts to avoid or control backpressure as a way to prevent MPB, but they either rely on global wires which may prevent an efficient and reliable implementation in silicon  [ref]27   or require complex memory management in every NoC core  .\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: of real-time NoCs are attempts to avoid or control backpressure as a way to prevent MPB, but they either rely on global wires which may prevent an efficient and reliable implementation in silicon  [ref]27   or require complex memory management in every NoC core  .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
