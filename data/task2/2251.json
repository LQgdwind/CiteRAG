      "content": "Paper Title: SITTA: Single Image Texture Translation for Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTexture Translation. Deep learning based image synthesis manipulates images through the design of various generative neural networks. Fueled by the explorations in generative models such as GAN  and VAE , researchers have explored ideas such as neural style transfer and image translation. A neural algorithm of artistic style (ArtStyle)  can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. CycleGAN  investigates the use of conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. SinGAN  demonstrates success in single image retargeting. Few-Shot Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation (FUNIT)  focuses on previously unseen target classes that are specified at test time only by a few example images. TuiGAN  aims to learn versatile image-to-image translation with two unpaired images designed in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore,    propose elegant methods for better preserving their structural information and statistical properties. However, these methods focus more on a subjective manner instead of considering all factors including decent outputs, time efficiency, improved recognition results, as well as flexibility with various input resolutions for data augmentation. Data Augmentation.\nData augmentation plays a critical role in various image recognition tasks . On the one hand, basic image manipulation methods have been widely used as effective pre-processing tools  7  6 [ref]22  , with examples including flipping, rotation, jittering, grayscale, and Gaussian blur. Several works 3  explore effective combined choices of basic image manipulations. LOOC 9 searches for an optimal augmentation strategy among a large pool of candidates based on specific datasets or tasks. Mixup 2 interpolates two training inputs in feature and label space simultaneously. CutMix 1 uses a copy-paste strategy and mixes the labels in proportion to the number of pixels contributed by each input image to the final composition. MoEx [ref]22 exchange the moments of the learned features of one training image by those of another, and also interpolate the target labels. On the other hand, many researchers have begun to explore the impact of semantic data augmentation for real-world image recognition tasks 3 7 6 . Geirhos, et al  find that CNNs like ResNet-50 favor texture rather than shape, and appropriate use of augmented ImageNet via style transfer could alleviate this bias and improve the model performance.\nIn addition, 6 9 5 3 aim to learn robust shape-based features for domain generalization. RL-CycleGAN 4 introduces a consistency loss for simulation-to-real-world transfer for reinforcement learning. However, few of them explicitly augment data with natural outputs that could be used to solve real problems. In this paper, we propose SITTA that generates new data semantically via domain-specific texture translation. We provide a simplified illustration of the data augmentation landscape in Figure 3.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: augmentation plays a critical role in various image recognition tasks .
