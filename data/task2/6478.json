The most important traditional method is Poisson surface Reconstruction  and ball-pivoting reconstruction [ref]27. The former method classifies the query point according to the Poisson indicator function. The latter construct the continuous surface by making up a ball rolling on the points. Those two methods can reconstruct pretty good surface, however the methods need per-point normal as input. Deep methods can be divided into point-based and voxel-based. Voxel-based methods first convert the point cloud into voxels and then apply volume convolution to get the feature of every voxel, just like o-net[ref]3 and O-CNN[ref]28. Point-based methods can be divided into local methods and global methods. As the name implies, when giving a query point, global methods classify it according to the whole shape information, local methods classify the query point according to the neighbor points of it. Representative global methods are DeepSDF, BSP-Net and Predictive Context Priors. The routine of those methods are extracting the feature code of the whole shape and then recovering the surface from the code. Representative local methods are SSR-Net, DeepMLS, POCO, Dual Octree and Dynamic Code. Those local methods typically use the help of octree. SSR-Net firstly extracts point feature, then maps the neighbor-hood points feature to octants, finally classifies the octants. DeepMLS tries to predict the normal and radius of every point, then classify the query points according to moving least-squares equation. Further more, except for local methods and global methods, there are some methods try to combine global and local information. The most representative method is Points2Surf. It tries to regress the absolute SDF value according to local information and classify the sign according to global information. Another type of deep point cloud reconstruction method tries to encode the 3D shapes with a neural network directly, the input of the network is coordinate position, the output is SDF(signed distance function) or UDF(unsigned distance function). In test period, these methods need training as well. Representative methods are Neural Pull and On-surface Prior.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Point cloud reconstruction has been a long-standing task in graphics and vision.
