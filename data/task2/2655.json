      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Score-Guided Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnomaly detection aims to identify the samples that considerably deviate from the expectation of a complex system. There are plentiful applications of anomaly detection across various domains [ref]1  , for example, disease detection , network intrusion detection , and financial fraud detection , etc. Existing anomaly detection methods can be grouped into three categories according to the label availability in the training datasets: supervised learning methods, semi-supervised learning methods, and unsupervised learning methods . Supervised and semi-supervised learning methods rely on labeled data, which rarely exist in some practical applications. Accordingly, unsupervised anomaly detection methods have received very much attention in both academic and industrial communities. In general, unsupervised methods assume that most of the data are normal samples and expect to fit the pattern of normal samples to distinguish anomalies. A mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection methodology is based on representation learning and the typical pipeline is presented in Figure 1.\nA representation learner is first trained to map the original data, e.g., tabular, image, or document data, into the desired hypothesis space. Then a discriminator mostly uses various pre-defined metrics to identify the abnormal samples. Based on the definition of the discriminator, we can further classify the unsupervised anomaly detection methods into three categories: distribution-based methods, distance-based methods, and reconstruction-based methods . The distribution-based methods identify anomalies by assuming the normal data follow a certain distribution; the distance-based methods attempt to enhance the distance between the abnormal and normal data in a latent space; the reconstruction-based methods identify anomalies by the similarity between original data and reconstructed data. The final identification of anomaly always solely relies on the pre-defined distance calculated between the original samples or their representations in these existing methods, as illustrated in Figure 1. Most existing unsupervised methods (including some of semi-supervised methods) face the following challenges:\n(1) When handling training datasets comprising both normal and abnormal samples, one typical strategy is to fit all data to a normal pattern and identify samples with a weak fit as anomalies   [ref]11   . An alternative strategy is to filter suspected anomalies and fit the remaining samples during the training process [ref]15  . However, these strategies may not effectively deal with the anomaly-contained situation, where we can utilize the information of suspected anomalies to enhance the model’s detection capability.\n(2) The manually selected metric to compute the anomaly scores will impact the performance and can hardly be ”one-model-fits-all” [ref]15 [ref]11 .\n(3) Data distribution can be divided into three fields: obvious-normal field, transition field, and obvious-abnormal field, as shown in Figure 2. The samples in obvious-normal or obvious-abnormal fields can be clearly distinguished as normal or abnormal data. However, the mixture of normal and abnormal data in the transition field hampers the identification of the abnormal samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a scoring network to promote the performance of anomaly identification via learning and enhancing the disparity between normal and abnormal data. As shown in Figure 1, the scoring network can be incorporated into an existing deep unsupervised representation learning-based anomaly detection method and directly connected with the representation learner, which maps the original data into a hypothesis space.\nThe scoring network utilizes the original pre-defined metric as a self-supervised signal to distinguish obvious-normal and obvious-abnormal samples and leverages these samples to guide the training of the representation learner to extract valuable information, which is more helpful for discrimination.\nSpecifically, we introduce a score-guided regularization in the scoring network to gradually intensify the divergence between obvious-normal and obvious-abnormal samples during model training. We assign smaller scores to the obvious-normal data and larger scores to the obvious-abnormal data. Paying attention to the distinguishable samples accelerates the model’s convergence and enhances the capability of both the representation learner and the scoring network.\nThis strategy leads to an incremental increase in score disparity between normal and abnormal data and facilitates the discrimination of non-obvious data in the transition field throughout the model training process.\nMoreover, the anomaly scores are calculated by the discrimination metric learned by the scoring network rather than the pre-defined one, enhancing the transferability of the original method.\nWithout additional assumptions, this scoring network can be flexibly embedded into most existing anomaly detection models. We further propose a novel instantiation, embedding the scoring network into an autoencoder framework, named score-guided autoencoder (SG-AE). The autoencoder reconstructs data instances and learns their representations in a latent space. Then, the scoring network assigns scores to these representations and attempts to maximize the disparity between the normal and abnormal samples. A sample with a higher anomaly score is more likely to be an anomaly.\nTo explain how the scoring network works, we conduct simulation experiments to observe the changes in the score differences in the transition field. Also, we compare the performances of SG-AE with classic and state-of-the-art methods on seven tabular datasets. We also present the distributions of anomaly scores of normal and abnormal data and utilize t-SNE to reveal the anomaly detection performance in a 2D space. Moreover, we extend the scoring network to three state-of-the-art models and explore the performance improvement of these score-guided models (SG-Models). We also examine the potential of using the scoring network on two document datasets and one image dataset. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose a scoring network with a score-guided regularization, which can directly learn the anomaly scores and be easily integrated into most unsupervised representation learning-based models without imposing more assumptions. The scoring network utilizes the obvious data, distinguished by the self-supervised signal, to strengthen the representation learner and expand the learned scores disparity between normal and abnormal samples in the transition field, thus enhancing the anomaly detection ability. We integrate the scoring network into an autoencoder structure and introduce a simple but effective instantiation, SG-AE. SG-AE breaks the limitation of the autoencoder on normal data input and achieves competitive performance on several datasets.\nWe also incorporate the scoring network into four state-of-the-art models to examine the adaptability to different methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the scoring network.\nThe SG-AE outperforms the classic and state-of-the-art methods on tabular datasets and the other SG-Models show performance improvements with the help of a scoring network. Moreover, our scoring network is robust to the anomaly rate by learning the disparity between normal and abnormal data, which is also demonstrated by the experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Anomaly detection aims to identify the samples that considerably deviate from the expectation of a complex system.
