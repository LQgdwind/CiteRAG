      "content": "Paper Title: Story Visualization by Online Text Augmentation with Context Memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use two popular benchmark datasets for evaluating the task of story visualization.\nFollowing 3, we use Pororo-SV dataset for story visualization task without data overlap.\nFollowing prior work , we use Flintstones-SV which was originally exploited in the text-to-video synthesis task . For the evaluation metrics, we use Fre´´e\\acute{\\text{e}}chet Inception Distance (FID) (used in [ref]39 ) for visual quality of the generated images, character classification score (Char. F1, Frm. Acc.) [ref]17 for character consistency, and global semantic matching (B-2/3, R-Prec.) 3  between generated image sequence and story paragraph..\nWe elaborate on the details of the datasets and implementation in the supplementary material for the sake of space. We compare our method to a number of prior arts including state-of-the-art story visualization methods such as StoryGAN [ref]17, CPCSV [ref]39, DuCo-StoryGAN 3, VLC-StoryGAN  and VP-CSV  for both quantitative and qualitative analysis in the story visualization setting.\nMoreover, we compare 4 in the story continuation setting. To train our model, we first tokenize the text and image inputs.\nParticularly, the image inputs are encoded by the encoder of the VQ-VAE  into image tokens and decoded by the decoder of the VQ-VAE for generating image sequence.\nOnce the inputs are tokenized, we append two special embedding tokens to the text and image tokens. These tokens signify the beginning of each modality, denoted as ‘SOS’ (start of sentence) and ‘SOI’ (start of image).\nSubsequently, we add two embeddings: (1) a positional embedding to indicate absolute position of each token and (2) a segment embedding to distinguish source and target modality, e.g., for text-to-image generation task, the source corresponds to the text while the target corresponds to the image.\nThrough the utilization of segment embeddings to distinguish between source and target, we enable the model to generate target data from source data within a unified architecture, as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nHere, we set the token length for each modality as Tt​e​x​t=80subscript𝑇𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡80T_{text}=80 and Ti​m​a​g​e=256(i.e.,16×16)T_{image}=256\\ (\\emph{i.e}.\\hbox{},16\\times 16), the hidden dimension size to 512, the number of transformer layer to 6, and the number of attention heads to 16, thereafter the number of trainable parameters approximately 93.7-M as shown in Tab. 1.\nParticularly, we generate an image per each sentence without any sampling process.\nWe train the CMOTA using AdamW 1 optimizer with β1=0.9subscript𝛽10.9\\beta_{1}=0.9, β2=0.95subscript𝛽20.95\\beta_{2}=0.95, ϵ=1​e−8italic-ϵ1𝑒8\\epsilon=1e-8, weight decay multiplier with 1​e−21𝑒21e-2 and learning rate with 4.5​e−64.5𝑒64.5e-6 multiplied by batch size.\nMoreover, we set the hyper-parameters for loss balancing in Eq. 3 as λ1=1.0subscript𝜆11.0\\lambda_{1}=1.0 and λ2=0.5subscript𝜆20.5\\lambda_{2}=0.5 and the number of memory state, TMsubscript𝑇𝑀T_{M} as 1.\nFinally, to generate a high-resolution image, we modified the VQ-VAE with the additional trainable parameters (i.e., 7.17.17.1-M shown in Tab. 1).\nThis modification allows for the generation of high-resolution images, increasing the image resolution from 64×64646464\\times 64 to 128×128128128128\\times 128.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: work , we use Flintstones-SV which was originally exploited in the text-to-video synthesis task . For the evaluation metrics, we use Fre´´e\\acute{\\text{e}}chet Inception Distance (FID) (used in [ref]39 ) for visual quality of the generated images, character classification score (Char. F1, Frm.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
