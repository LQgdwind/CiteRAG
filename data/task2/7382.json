Embedding Hardware Approximations in Discrete Genetic-based Training for Printed MLPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrinted electronics (PE) offer a promising direction for integrating computing and intelligence across domains like smart bandages, disposable items, packaged goods, and smart packaging.\nThese applications, including in-situ monitoring and the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods market, have specific fabrication cost, conformity, and time-to-market needs that traditional silicon-based electronics struggle to meet . PE  enables these applications through additive manufacturing processes, producing conformal, low-cost hardware on demand.\nHowever, PE cannot match silicon VLSI systems in density, area, or speed due to larger feature sizes from imprecise printing.\nPE circuits operate at frequencies ranging from a few Hzhertz\\mathrm{Hz} to a few kHzkilohertz\\mathrm{kHz} , with micrometer-sized features .\nThe large feature size and the capacitance in PE technology raise area and power consumption, deterring conventional digital architectures, like Machine Learning (ML) classifiers  which are the primary printed applications [ref]5. As an attempt to address the above limitations, the authors in  leverage the customization potential offered by low-fabrication and Non-Recurring Engineering costs associated with printed circuits through bespoke circuit designs.\nThe term “bespoke” refers to fully-customized circuits tailored to specific ML model and dataset.\nWhile  successfully reduced area and power for simple ML algorithms, the hardware overheads remain prohibitive for more complex algorithms like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).\nTable I presents the hardware cost of several printed MLP circuits that follow the bespoke design of .\nAs shown, all MLPs feature excessive power consumption and cannot be powered by any available printed battery  [ref]6 while their area requirement is above 12​cm212centimeter212${\\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$, thus being unsuitable for the most printed applications [ref]5. Targeting printed MLPs, [ref]6 [ref]7 [ref]5  employed Approximate Computing (AxC) exploiting the high error resilience of ML applications .\nLeveraging that in bespoke ML circuits the model’s coefficients are hardwired and thus determine the circuit’s area, [ref]6 and [ref]5 replace the MLP’s coefficients with more area-efficient values reducing the multipliers’ area.\nAdditionally, to reduce the cost of additions, [ref]6 applied gate-level pruning while [ref]5 used truncation in accumulations.\nArmeniakos et al. [ref]7, extend [ref]6 by applying voltage over-scaling.\nIn all the above works, multipliers are still required and thus the obtained gains are limited.\nIn contrast, 0 designed stochastic printed MLPs but resulted in poor accuracy. Prior works focus on employing AxC post-training, often compromising the balance between area and accuracy, thereby yielding sub-optimal results.\nIn this work, we address this limitation by incorporating hardware approximation during MLP training.\nGradient-based learning (backpropagation) relies on the loss function differentiability.\nUnfortunately, hardware approximations often involve discrete variables and decisions, which do not permit computing the gradients 1.\nAdditionally, to achieve hardware-aware training, both accuracy and area overhead must be addressed as objectives, framing the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem.\nTraditional gradient-based learning methods are not directly applicable to multi-objective optimization and often necessitate to be transformed to a single-objective optimization problem 2.\nTherefore, we employ evolutionary methods like a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which, due to their capability to work with discrete variables, enable us to fully leverage hardware AxC techniques during our training.\nAxC circuits’ inherent attributes and evolutionary circuit design principles are expected to synergize positively 3. We propose a GA-based approach for training hardware and approximation-aware bespoke printed MLPs.\nWhile evolutionary approaches can be time-consuming for training large neural networks, for the small MLPs typically used in printed electronics  [ref]5, GA-based training offers a promising alternative.\nIt allows highly optimized bespoke MLP circuits by incorporating discrete hardware-aware approximations during training, enabling simultaneous optimization of accuracy and hardware costs within a reasonable time frame.\nFor approximations, we adopt the state-of-the-art power-of-two (pow2) weight quantization, to eliminate multiplications, and a finer-grained unstructured pruning, implemented through Full-Adders (FAs) removal, to a approximate additions.\n To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a framework111https://github.com/floAfentaki/Approximation-Techniques-Targeting-Printed-MLPs is proposed for hardware-efficient printed MLP circuits.\nOur experiments across various MLPs show that our framework reduces both area and power by over 5×5\\times compared to the exact baseline and outperforms the current state-of-the-art approximate works.\nNotably, it enables printed-energy-harvester operation for the majority of the examined MLPs. 1MLP topology. 2MLP parameters. 3Accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: the capacitance in PE technology raise area and power consumption, deterring conventional digital architectures, like Machine Learning (ML) classifiers  which are the primary printed applications [ref]5.
