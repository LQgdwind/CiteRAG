      "content": "Paper Title: Length-Controllable Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven an image 𝑰𝑰\\bm{I}, an image captioning model aims to describe 𝑰𝑰\\bm{I} by a textual sentence 𝑺={si}i=1L𝑺superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖𝑖1𝐿\\bm{S}=\\{s_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{L}, where sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} is a token in 𝑺𝑺\\bm{S} and L𝐿L is the length of 𝑺𝑺\\bm{S}. Most existing image captioning approaches operate in an autoregressive style, which factors the distribution of 𝑺𝑺\\bm{S} into a chain of conditional probabilities with a left-to-right causal structure:\np​(𝑺|𝑰)=∏i=1Lp​(si|sj<i,𝑰)𝑝conditional𝑺𝑰subscriptsuperscriptproduct𝐿𝑖1𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑠𝑗𝑖𝑰p(\\bm{S}|\\bm{I})=\\prod^{L}_{i=1}p(s_{i}|s_{j<i},\\bm{I}).\nAs a result, 𝑺𝑺\\bm{S} must be generated sequentially, i.e., sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} cannot be generated until all preceding tokens sj<isubscript𝑠𝑗𝑖s_{j<i} are available. Assume the target image caption to be 𝑺∗={si∗}i=1L∗superscript𝑺superscriptsubscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑖𝑖1superscript𝐿\\bm{S}^{*}=\\{s^{*}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{L^{*}}. The training of AIC models typically follows the “Teacher Forcing” [ref]5 scheme, which aims to maximize the likelihood of the ground-truth token si∗subscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑖s^{*}_{i} given all preceding ground-truth tokens sj<i∗subscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑗𝑖s^{*}_{j<i} through back-propagation: During inference, AIC models take a special [BOS] token as input to predict the first token s1subscript𝑠1s_{1}, then s1subscript𝑠1s_{1} is fed into the model to obtain the next token s2subscript𝑠2s_{2}. Continuing like this until the special [EOS] token is predicted. There have been many successful extensions to AIC approaches over the years. In [ref]48, the authors proposed to integrate soft and hard attention mechanisms into the decoder, which facilitates the model to learn to focus on some specific image regions when generating the token at each decoding step. Later on, [ref]35 developed a self-critical sequence training (SCST) strategy which directly optimizes the CIDEr  score of the predicted image captions through policy gradient  to amend the “exposure bias” problem in sequence modeling. Furthermore, instead of measuring attention over a pre-defined uniform grid of image regions as in [ref]48, Anderson et al.  devised a bottom-up mechanism to enable the measurement of attention at object-level, which achieved the best results at that time and outperformed the second-best result by a large margin. Apart from this, some other works tried to improve the image caption quality by leveraging additional information, such as semantic attributes  and visual relations   .\nMore recently, after witnessing the effectiveness of Deep Transformers  in capturing long-range dependencies in sequence modeling, many Transformer-based AIC models 0 6  have been developed to further advance the image captioning performance.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: to be 𝑺∗={si∗}i=1L∗superscript𝑺superscriptsubscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑖𝑖1superscript𝐿\\bm{S}^{*}=\\{s^{*}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{L^{*}}. The training of AIC models typically follows the “Teacher Forcing” [ref]5 scheme, which aims to maximize the likelihood of the ground-truth token si∗subscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑖s^{*}_{i} given all preceding ground-truth tokens sj<i∗subscriptsuperscript𝑠𝑗𝑖s^{*}_{j<i}\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
