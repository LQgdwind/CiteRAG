      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty-CAM: Visual Explanation using Uncertainty based Class Activation Maps\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo interpret and explain the deep learning models, many approaches have been proposed. One of the approaches uses probabilistic techniques to obtain uncertainty estimates,  [ref]2. Other approaches aim at obtaining visual explanations through methods such as Grad-CAM [ref]3 or by attending to specific regions using hard/soft attention.\nWith the recent probabilistic deep learning techniques by Gal and Ghahramani , it became feasible to obtain uncertainty estimates in a computationally efficient manner. This was further extended to data uncertainty and model uncertainty based estimates . Through this work, we focus on using gradients uncertainty losses to improve attention maps while also enhancing the explainability leveraging the Bayesian nature of our approach. The uncertainties that we use are aleatoric and predictive[ref]5. For the estimated uncertainties, we calculate gradients using the approach similar to gradient-based class activation maps [ref]3. This provides “certainty maps” which helps in attending to certain regions of the attention maps. Doing this, we report an improvement in attention maps. This is illustrated in the Figure 1. Our method combines techniques from both the explanation [ref]3 and uncertainty  estimation techniques to obtain improved results. We have provided an extensive evaluation. We show that the results obtained for uncertainty estimates show a strong correlation with misclassification, i.e., when the classifier is wrong, the model is usually uncertain. Further, the attention maps provide state of the art correlation with human-annotated attention maps. We also show that on various VQA datasets, our model provides results comparable to the state of the art while significantly improving the performance of baseline methods on which we incorporated our approach. Our method may be seen as a generic way to obtain Bayesian uncertainty estimates, visual explanation, and as a result, improved accuracy for Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Our contributions, lie in, a) unifying approaches for understanding deep learning methods using uncertainty estimate and explanation b) obtaining visual attention maps that correlate best with human annotated attention regions and c) showing that the improved attention maps result in consistent improvement in results. This is particularly suited for vision and language-based tasks where we are interested in understanding visual grounding, i.e., for instance, if the answer for a question is ‘dog’ (Corresponding question: ‘Who is on the boat?’), it is important to understand whether the model is certain and whether it is focusing on the correct regions containing a dog. This important requirement is met by the proposed approach.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: To interpret and explain the deep learning models, many approaches have been proposed.
