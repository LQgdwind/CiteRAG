      "content": "Paper Title: Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNext we compare our model with the state-of-the-art methods for graph classification. Apart from four backbone models (GCN, GIN, GraphSAGE and GAT), we also compare our model with 12 state-of-the-art methods for graph classification,\nincluding DGCNN , ECC [ref]13, ChebyGIN [ref]8, SAGPool , Graphormer [ref]9, ESAN  (termed ‘DSS-GNN’ in the paper) based on the overall best policy ‘EGO+’, GSN , Graph U-Nets , DGM , UGformer , SLIM  and ADSF-RWR . ADSF-RWR is initially designed for node classification and we adapt it for graph classification by applying sum pooling over all node embeddings to obtain the graph representation. We re-train and re-evaluate all methods under the same experimental setting, using the same data split and evaluation metrics, to have a fair comparison. Note that we compare with ChebyGIN in both unsupervised (denoted as ChebyGIN-unsup) and supervised training settings for learning node saliencies to have a comprehensive comparison. In this set of experiments, we only report the performance of our model by selecting the better one between two fusion mechanisms based on the validation set. Table 2 presents the experimental results of different methods on seven datasets. We make the following observations. First, our method achieves substantial performance gains compared to the corresponding base models used for backbone on all datasets except IMDB-BINARY, which validates the effectiveness and adaptability of our method across different types of backbones. The performance improvement of our method on IMDB-BINARY is minor presumably due to the ceiling effect, considering the fact that the performance of multiple models on this dataset is close to each other. Second, our method based on one of four backbones achieves the best performance on all seven datasets except TRIANGLES, which manifests the robustness of our method. In contrast, other methods, such as GSN, Graphormer and ECC, show unstable performance across different datasets. DSS-GNN performs substantially better than other methods on TRIANGLES, presumably because DSS-GNN can recognize the triangle structure as distinguishable subgraphs. To validate it, we visualize two randomly selected subgraphs learned by DSS-GNN in Figure 3, which shows that DSS-GNN can indeed generate subgraphs that preserve the triangles on the samples from TRIANGLES dataset. However, its generated subgraphs on the MUTAG sample fail to preserve intact fused rings whose number is closely correlated to the recognition of mutagenic aromatic , which accounts for its relatively inferior performance to our model on MUTAG. The third observation we make is that our method consistently performs well when built upon different backbones and the performance differences between them are minor. Interestingly, the performance differences among four base models are substantially reduced when they are integrated into our method. Comparison with the implicit modeling of global saliency by attention mechanism. SAGPool and ChebyGIN use attention mechanism to model global saliency implicitly by learning a parameterized attention function ℱattsubscriptℱatt\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{att}} taking the node features 𝐇𝐇\\mathbf{H} as input: 𝐬att=ℱatt​(𝐇).subscript𝐬attsubscriptℱatt𝐇\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{att}}=\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{att}}(\\mathbf{H}). In contrast, our method models the global saliency explicitly by measuring the compatibility between the compact graph representation 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M} and node features 𝐇𝐇\\mathbf{H}: 𝐬our=ℱS​(𝐌,𝐇)subscript𝐬oursubscriptℱS𝐌𝐇\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{our}}=\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{S}}(\\mathbf{M},\\mathbf{H}), as shown in Equation 2 and 5. The iterative interdependent refining mechanism enables our model to learn more effective node features and graph representation, which in turn lead to more accurate global saliency. The large performance superiority of our model over SAGPool and ChebyGIN in Table 2 in the paper demonstrates the advantage of our model. Besides, the qualitative comparison in Figure 4 and Figure 5 also reveal such advantage of our model over SAGPool and ChebyGIN. Comparison with ‘ChebyGIN’ in the supervised setting for learning global node saliency. Our model, as well as other methods involved in comparison, is optimized for graph classification only using graph category labels but with no annotations of the global saliency. In this sense, the global saliency is learned in an unsupervised setting. To further investigate the performance of the our model in the supervised setting, we conduct experiments on TRIANGLES dataset by leveraging both the annotations of the global saliency and graph categories for supervision. We compare our method and the supervised version of ChebyGIN, which is presented in Table 3. The results show that all four instantiations of our method with different backbones consistently outperform ChebyGIN in the supervised setting, which reveals the effectiveness of our method in such setting. Besides, comparing the performance between unsupervised and supervised settings, both our method and ChebyGIN achieve substantial improvements. Such results indicate that the supervision on the global saliency yields more effective learning of global saliency and thereby more precise graph classification, which also implies the essential benefit of learning global node saliencies to the task of graph classification.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: for graph classification.
