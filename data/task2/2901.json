      "content": "Paper Title: Anti-Backdoor Learning: Training Clean Models on Poisoned Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe apply 6 classic backdoor attacks including BadNets , Trojan [ref]23, Blend 1, Dynamic 8, SIG , and CL , and 3 feature-space attacks including FC , DFST , and LBA  to poison 10% of CIFAR-10 training data. We train a WideResNet-16-1 model  on the corresponding poisoned dataset using the standard training method by solving equationÂ (1) for each attack. Each model is trained following the standard settings (see Section 4 and Appendix A.2). We plot the average training loss (i.e., cross-entropy) on clean versus backdoored training examples in Figure 2. Clearly, for all 9 attacks, the training loss on backdoor examples drops much faster than that on clean examples in the first few epochs. Both pixel- and feature-space attacks exhibit this faster-learning pattern consistently, although some feature-space attacks (FC and LBA) can slow down the process to some extent. For all attacks except SIG, FC and LBA, the training loss reaches almost zero after only two epochs of training. Moreover, according to the attack success rate, the stronger the attack is, the faster the training loss on backdoor examples drops. More results on GTSRB and an ImageNet subset can be found in Appendix B.2. The above observation indicates that the backdoor task is much easier than the clean task. This is not too surprising. In a typical clean dataset, not all examples are easy examples. Thus, it requires a certain number of training epochs to minimize the loss on those examples, even for small datasets like CIFAR-10. On the contrary, a backdoor attack adds an explicit correlation between the trigger pattern and the target class to simplify and accelerate the injection of the backdoor trigger. We argue that this is a fundamental requirement and also a major weakness of backdoor attacks. For a backdoor attack to work successfully, the trigger(s) should be easily learnable by the model, or else the attack would lose its effectiveness or require a much higher injection rate, which goes against its key objectives.\nTherefore, the stronger the attack is, the faster the training loss on backdoor examples drops to zero; e.g., compare FC with other attacks in Figure 2. We also show in Figure 7 in Appendix B.1 that the training loss of the backdoor task drops more rapidly as we increase the poisoning rate. Based on the above observation, one may wonder if backdoor examples can be easily removed by filtering out the low-loss examples at an early stage (e.g., the 5th epoch). However, we find that this strategy is ineffective for two reasons. First, the training loss in Figure 2 is the average training loss which means some backdoor examples can still have high training loss. Additionally, several powerful attacks such as Trojan and Dynamic can still succeed even with very few (50 or 100) backdoor examples. Second, if the training progresses long enough (e.g., beyond epoch 20), many clean examples will also have a low training loss, which makes the filtering significantly inaccurate.\nTherefore, we need a strategy to amplify the difference in training loss between clean and backdoor examples. Moreover, we need to unlearn the backdoor since the backdoor examples can only be identified when they are learned into the model (i.e., low training loss).\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: We apply 6 classic backdoor attacks including BadNets , Trojan [ref]23, Blend 1, Dynamic 8, SIG , and CL , and 3 feature-space attacks including FC , DFST , and LBA  to poison 10% of CIFAR-10 training data.
