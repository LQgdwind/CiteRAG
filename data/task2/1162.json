Body heat and movement provide a significant source of energy for wearables . The Kinetic Energy Harvesting (KEH) for IoT captures kinetic energy from wearables while exercising different daily activities such as walking, running, and reading . The advent of wireless charging makes the harvested energy from IoT devices more flexible and convenient to be easily shared. Energy sharing helps create self-sustained systems. Different techniques have been developed for the wireless charging in IoT and sensor networks . The most common techniques are magnetic inductive coupling, magnetic resonant coupling, and microwave radiation. These techniques are used in wireless sensor networks by deploying charger robots in the network to charge the low battery sensors . A new paradigm of uncoupled wireless charging based on radio waves has emerged [ref]32. The Energous Wattup applies radio waves to enable wireless energy sharing for IoT devices.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Recently, research has been conducted to integrate harvesting energy into designing IoT objects (i.e., wearables) [ref]30.
