      "content": "Paper Title: A Simplicity Bubble Problem in Formal-Theoretic Learning Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe success of statistical machine learning is undeniable, but the expectation of what it can achieve requires an investigation into its fundamental limitations. One problem often encountered in computational analyses of large datasets is that data mining algorithms are prone to finding statistically significant correlations that are in fact spurious (i.e., correlations that would have occurred in completely randomly generated data anyway) . Data scientists attempt to mitigate this consequence by empirically defining features to extract, but generally, blind or naive applications of data mining algorithms to sufficiently large datasets increase the chance of these algorithms finding spurious regularities.\nThis gives rise to a “paradox” that underlies the Big Data paradigm [ref]2: although computational analysis benefits from larger datasets that are accurate and fine grained, the larger the dataset the more likely it is that spurious correlations will be discovered.\nIn other words, “too much information tends to behave like very little information” . In machine learning, a central problem is to avoid underfitting and overfitting: that is, when the value of the loss/cost/error function obtained from the training set is considered to be high; or when the error on the test set is considered to be relatively higher than the training error, respectively. Underfitting can be solved by a number of simple methods such as increasing the model capacity or complexity. However, solving overfitting demands much more sophisticated methods that succumb to Parsimony, Occam’s razor, or a bias toward simplicity. This consequence is considered by some as a fundamental principle or heuristic in methods that try to solve the problem of overfitting  .\nIndeed, recent methods and results that consider this consequence as fundamental have shown predictive capability for both traditional learning methods in differential spaces (by loss functions, optimisation, and regularisation that directly stem from the bias toward low algorithmic complexity), but also in non-differential spaces that generally perform poorly using (or, in some cases, cannot in principle be tackled by) traditional methods .\nDue to the inherent bias toward simplicity in the universal probability distribution of computably generated objects , models and parameters that yield a perfect fit with a minimum training error for every data point in the training set tend to have greater algorithmic complexity.\nThus, models and parameters with low algorithmic probability would naturally be penalised in the parameter and hyperparameter optimisation stage of the learning process, and such penalisation would in turn avoid overfitting. In this article we investigate fundamental limitations and conditions in a context that combines both the “too much information tends to behave like very little information” phenomenon and the bias toward simplicity.\nIn particular, given an arbitrarily chosen machine learning algorithm, we study worst-case scenarios in which overfitting is expected to always occur once the datasets get sufficiently large, even if the datasets are generated following the universal distribution.\nThis reveals a fundamental limitation in the Big Data paradigm that not only corroborates the results in  and , but also demonstrates the necessity of new algorithmic information-based conditions to avoid finding “spurious optimal models” when mining very large datasets. The problem of learning algorithms’ solutions getting stuck in local optima is a well-known problem to be faced both in practice and in theory.\nIn this regard, our results not only demonstrate conditions under which such a problem is guaranteed to occur, but also that such a limitation is always expected to occur when applying current learning methods, should they only rely on statistics to deal with large enough datasets of arbitrarily high complexity.\nTo overcome this, one necessarily needs to guarantee that additional properties are met; and to develop new learning algorithms that stem from constraining the scope of the algorithmic information content in the datasets to be investigated (see Section 6). Our primary results are two proofs (Theorem 5.6 which follows from Theorem 5.5) showing that, if a locally optimal model found by an arbitrarily chosen machine learning algorithm using a sufficiently large dataset has an algorithmic complexity arbitrarily smaller than that of the available data, the algorithmic probability of the deceiving dataset still dominates the algorithmic probability of any other randomly generated dataset of size greater than or equal to the size of the deceiving dataset.\nOn the one hand, this enables the deceiving dataset to limit the learning algorithm’s capabilities of accurately finding the globally optimal model.\nOn the other hand, the locally optimal model can be found with arbitrary precision by the learning algorithm.\nAs formalized in Section 4, a deceiving dataset is one for which the learning algorithm (in addition to any formal theory and performance measure one may choose to embed into this algorithm) generates an optimal model that completely satisfies the assumed performance criteria to be considered a global one, but that in fact is a locally optimal model. Formally,\nwe demonstrate in Theorem 5.6 that, for every learning algorithm PP\\mathrm{P}, there are sufficiently large datasets Dt​o​t​a​l=Da∪Dn​e​wsubscriptD𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙subscriptD𝑎subscriptD𝑛𝑒𝑤\\mathrm{D}_{total}=\\mathrm{D}_{a}\\cup\\mathrm{D}_{new} whose algorithmic probability of the respective DasubscriptD𝑎\\mathrm{D}_{a} being an unpredictable deceiver (which satisfies Theorem 5.5 with |Da|≥ksubscriptD𝑎𝑘\\left|\\mathrm{D}_{a}\\right|\\geq k) is higher than (except for a multiplicative constant that depends on PP\\mathrm{P}) the algorithmic probability of any other particular dataset of size ≥kabsent𝑘\\geq k.\nPP\\mathrm{P} is the arbitrary learning algorithm deceived by the available dataset DasubscriptD𝑎\\mathrm{D}_{a}.\nThe available dataset DasubscriptD𝑎\\mathrm{D}_{a} (from which PP\\mathrm{P} calculates an optimal model M(P,Da)subscriptMPsubscriptD𝑎\\mathrm{M}_{\\left(\\mathrm{P},\\mathrm{D}_{a}\\right)}) is sufficiently large so that there is k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} such that\n|Da|≥k=B​B​(𝐊​(Dt​o​t​a​l′)−𝐎​(𝐊​(P)))subscriptD𝑎𝑘𝐵𝐵𝐊subscriptsuperscriptD′𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐎𝐊P\\left|\\mathrm{D}_{a}\\right|\\geq k=BB\\left(\\mathbf{K}\\left(\\mathrm{D}^{\\prime}_{total}\\right)-\\mathbf{O}\\left(\\mathbf{K}\\left(\\mathrm{P}\\right)\\right)\\right), where Dt​o​t​a​l′subscriptsuperscriptD′𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙\\mathrm{D}^{\\prime}_{total} is any dataset that satisfies Theorem 5.5,\nB​B​(⋅)𝐵𝐵⋅BB\\left(\\cdot\\right) is a Busy Beaver function,\nand\n𝐊​(⋅)𝐊⋅\\mathbf{K}\\left(\\cdot\\right) is the (prefix) algorithmic complexity. The theorems are proven by showing that for any given learning algorithm, one can always construct a sufficiently large dataset (which includes the training set, test set, validation set, etc.), such that the prediction error (i.e., the overall generalisation error taking into account fresh data) cannot be minimised beyond the training error from already available data.\nThe key step to achieving this limitation is to ensure that data is generated in such a way that the joint algorithmic complexity of the learning algorithm combined with the available dataset, and any locally optimal model is smaller than the algorithmic complexity of the globally optimal model by a large enough constant. This particular way in which large enough datasets can deceive learning algorithms into accurately finding local optima while still being over-fitted has to do with a phenomenon that appears from a complexity-centered interplay between data and algorithms.\nAs available data becomes sufficiently large, its underlying generating process (or mechanism) likely becomes more complex than the learning algorithm.\nIn this scenario, the data generating process may “trap” the learning algorithm into a “simplicity bubble” in which any solution found from the available data alone is necessarily not complex enough to match the complexity of the actual data generating process.\nOnly by adding a larger amount of (unpredictable) fresh data, can the learning algorithm hypothetically be capable of “bursting” this bubble.\nWe call this phenomenon the simplicity bubble effect. Section 2 sets the background for our forthcoming results and explains the specific issues in the literature that motivate this article.\nA brief overview of the main concepts and remarking features of machine learning is presented in Section 2.1. In Section 2.2,\nwe discuss fundamental problems related to machine learning and large datasets.\nThen in Section 2.3, we present previous methods and results for machine learning based on algorithmic information theory.\nSection 3 introduces a novel formalisation of machine learning in computability theory, and Section 4 formalises the concept of unpredictable deceivers in this context.\nOur main results are demonstrated in Section 5.\nFinally, in Section 6, we conclude with a discussion of additional assumptions to avoid the learning-deceiving phenomenon of the simplicity bubble effect.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: of data mining algorithms to sufficiently large datasets increase the chance of these algorithms finding spurious regularities.\nThis gives rise to a “paradox” that underlies the Big Data paradigm [ref]2: although computational analysis benefits from larger datasets that are accurate and fine grained, the larger the dataset the more likely it is that spurious correlations will be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
