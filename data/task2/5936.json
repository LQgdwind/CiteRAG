      "content": "Paper Title: ImageCaptioner2: Image Captioner for Image Captioning Bias Amplification Assessment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost deep learning (DL) benchmarks and challenges 0  [ref]8   are designed to differentiate and rank different architectures based on accuracy, neglecting other aspects such as fairness.\nNevertheless, measuring the bias and understanding its sources have attracted significant attention recently due to the social impact of the DL models         .\nFor instance, image captioners may learn shortcuts based on correlation, which inevitably suffers from unreliable associations between protected attributes, e.g., gender, and visual or textual clues in the captioning dataset  . Recent efforts focus on estimating model bias, driven by the fact that more than balanced data is needed to create unbiased models .\nBias    is characterized by the modelâ€™s representation of different subgroups when generating the supergroup, such as assessing whether it equally depicts men and women in images of people.\nThe primary cause of bias stems from spurious correlations captured during training.\nwe are interested in the spurious correlation found within ordinary daily scenes, which typically do not evoke bias concerns.\nAccordingly, BA , DBA [ref]43, and LIC  measure the model bias w.r.t the bias in the training dataset. In other words, they emphasize the bias introduced by the model regardless of the bias in the ground-truth dataset.\nTherefore, detecting and measuring the bias is the first step toward a reliable and accurate image captioner. BA  and DBA [ref]43, calculate the co-occurrence frequency of protected bias attribute and detected objects in the picture or some specific words in the caption as a bias score.\nAn apparent limitation of these evaluations is that only limited visual or language contexts are used for computing the statistics.\nConsequently, several learnable bias measurements have been proposed recently 2  .\nThe basic assumption of this line of work is that if the bias attribute category, e.g., gender, can be inferred through context even if the attribute feature does not exist, then it indicates that the model is biased.\nFor instance, the recent work, LIC , estimates the bias in image captioning models using trainable language classifiers, e.g., BERT. Consequently, measuring the bias in image captioning is notably challenging due to the multimodal nature of the task, where the generated text could be biased to the input image and the language model.\nEven though significant progress has been achieved in quantifying the bias and its amplification in image captioning models, it remains to be investigated how to properly measure the bias amplified by the image captioning model over the dataset from both the vision and language modalities. The existing bias metrics formulate the metric as quantifying bias in text generation models, where the image stream is omitted while measuring the bias.\nDiscarding the visiolinguistic nature of the task in the metric may result in misleading conclusions.\nAddressing these limitations, we propose a novel bias metric termed ImageCaptioner2, which incorporates the visiolinguistic nature of the image captioning task by utilizing an image captioner instead of a language classifier. In addition to filling the multi-modalities gap in the existing bias metrics, ImageCaptioner2 better matches the underlying pre-training model, by proposing a prompt-based image captioner, i.e., the training objective is text generation.\nIn contrast, the existing bias metric, e.g., LIC, utilizes a language classifier trained for a different objective, i.e., classification objective; this leads to a potential under-utilization of the pre-trained model we assess.\nIn other words, our proposed metric provides textual prompts that bring the evaluation task closer to the pre-training task. Experimentally, we evaluate our metric through comprehensive experiments across 11 different image captioning techniques on three different datasets, i.e., MS-COCO caption dataset, ArtEmis V1 , and ArtEmis V2 , and on three different protected attributes, i.e., gender, race, and emotions.\nIn addition, we introduce consistency measures to judge which learnable metric is more consistent against classifiers variations: 1) Introducing conflict-score to count the number of mismatches between different classifiers. 2) Introducing Ranking Consistency, which utilizes Pearson correlation.\nIn comparison to LIC, we show that based on the consistency measures, our method is more consistent than LIC, where the correlation ratio is 97% and 92%, respectively.\nConsequently, we verify the effectiveness of our ImageCaptioner2 metric by proposing AnonymousBench, depicted in Figure 2, which is a novel human evaluation paradigm for bias metrics.\nOur metric shows significant superiority over the recent bias metric; LIC, in terms of human alignment, where the correlation scores are 80% and 54% for our metric and LIC, respectively. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We develop a novel bias metric called ImageCaptioner2, depicted in Figure 1. To the best of our knowledge, ImageCaptioner2 is the first metric that is formulated based on the visiolinguistic nature of the image captioning while quantifying the bias. We propose a prompt-based image captioner that better matches the underlying pre-training model we assess. Propose AnonymousBench to verify the effectiveness of our ImageCaptioner2 metric, depicted in Figure 2. We propose a new scoring function that matches the objective of measuring the bias. We apply our ImageCaptioner2 metric across 11 different image captioning techniques on three different datasets, i.e., MS-COCO caption dataset, Artemis V1, and Artemis V2, and on three different attributes, i.e., gender, race, and emotions.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Most deep learning (DL) benchmarks and challenges 0  [ref]8   are designed to differentiate and rank different architectures based on accuracy, neglecting other aspects such as fairness.\nNevertheless, measuring the bias and understanding its sources\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
