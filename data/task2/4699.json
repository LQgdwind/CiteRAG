      "content": "Paper Title: Momentum Adversarial Distillation: Handling Large Distribution Shifts in Data-Free Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the development of deep learning, more pretrained deep neural\nnetworks have been released to the public  0   .\nHowever, their superior performances often come with big sizes, causing\ndifficulties in deployment of these pretrained networks on resource-constrained\ndevices. This leads to the demand for transferring knowledge from\na cumbersome pretrained source network (called “teacher”) to a\ncompact target network (called “student”) with a minimal loss\nof performance. This task is regarded as Knowledge Distillation (KD)\n. The original idea of KD is to make use of class probabilities predicted\nby the teacher which encapsulate the hidden correlation among classes\nas training signals for the student. Note that such “dark” knowledge\n is generally not available if the student\nis trained directly on raw data with one-hot labels. Later, various\nKD methods have been proposed to improve the quality of knowledge\ntransfer. For example, AT  matches the\nspatial attention maps at intermediate layers of the student and the\nteacher. SPD  encourages the similarity\nbetween the student’s and teacher’s feature correlation matrices.\nPKT  transfers the conditional probability\nbetween two samples computed via kernel density estimation on the\nfeature space. RKD  exploits relational\nknowledge for distillation. VID  maximizes\na variational lower bound of the mutual information (MI) between the\nstudent’s and teacher’s representations. CRD \nuses contrastive learning as a proxy for maximizing MI. The common drawback of these methods is the reliance on samples from\nthe teacher training set. However, in practice, accessing the original\ntraining data is usually infeasible due to many reasons such as data\nprivacy (e.g., healthcare data containing personal information) or\ndata regarded as intellectual property of the vendors. Addressing\nthis critical issue, Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) methods\nhave been introduced  3       [ref]46.\nA common DFKD approach is to use a generator network to synthesize\ntraining data and jointly train the generator and the student in an\nadversarial manner 3  [ref]46.\nUnder this adversarial learning scheme, the student attempts to make\npredictions as close as possible to the teacher’s on synthetic data\ngenerated by the generator, while the generator tries to create samples\nthat maximize the mismatch between the student’s and the teacher’s\npredictions. This adversarial game enables a rapid exploration of\nsynthetic distributions useful for knowledge transfer between the\nteacher and the student. At the same time, it could also lead to large\nshifts in the synthetic distributions, causing the student to forget\nuseful knowledge acquired at the previous steps and suffer from performance\ndrops . In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called Momentum\nAdversarial Distillation (MAD) to mitigate the large distribution\nshift problem in adversarial DFKD. MAD maintains an exponential\nmoving average (EMA) copy of the generator which is responsible for\nstoring information about past updates of the generator. By using\nsynthetic samples from the EMA generator as additional training data\nfor the student besides those from the generator, MAD can ensure\nthat the student can recall the old knowledge, hence, is less prone\nto forgetting. Moreover, to reduce the negative effect caused by spurious\nsolutions of an unconditional generator when learning on large datasets\nsuch as ImageNet, we propose to use a class-conditional generator\nthat takes the sum of a noise vector and a class embedding vector\nas input, and train this generator with a new objective that suppresses\nthe presence of spurious solutions. This technique requires only a\nsmall change in the generator’s architecture but enables MAD\n(and possibly other adversarial DFKD methods) to learn surprisingly\nwell on large datasets. Through extensive experiments on three small\nand three large image datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method\nis far better than related baselines  \nin dealing with the large distribution shift problem. In some cases,\nMAD even outperforms current state-of-the-art methods  4.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: personal information) or\ndata regarded as intellectual property of the vendors.
