      "content": "Paper Title: Deep or Simple Models for Semantic Tagging? It Depends on your Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA lot of applications for processing text rely on tagging words, phrases or sentences with semantically informative tags.\nSentiment analysis   , for example, annotates sentences or phrases with a sentiment tag that indicates whether the sentence has a positive or negative sentiment. These sentiment tags are exploited by downstream applications to determine appropriate actions. Another example is entity tagging, which determines if a span in the text refers to a real-world object.\nGenerally speaking, the task of annotating text with semantic tags can be referred to as the semantic tagging problem.\nMore precisely, semantic tagger takes a piece of text and a predefined tag as inputs, and outputs whether this text conveys the semantics of the tag. In this paper, we focus on short text, which can be a sentence, a paragraph, or a passage. We also refer short text loosely as sentence.\n There are two types of methods for semantic tagging: rule programming and supervised learning. Rule programming-based methods require an expert to specify rules for semantic tagging. This is often error-prone and requires significant programming effort.\nIn contrast, supervised learning models do not require much programming effort. However, training these models requires labeled data but can typically produce models with good semantic tagging results.\n Our focus in this paper is on supervised learning models.\nDeep learning models (or deep models in short) have become popular methods for semantic tagging today. One reason why deep models are popular for semantic tagging is that they are often more capable of learning complicated functions than other kinds of models. Another reason is that the superiority of deep models has been reported by many publications. For example, deep models achieve good prediction quality that is close to the human prediction on GLUE SST-2 sentiment classification task  [ref]15. Some recent studies   [ref]52     [ref]20   made comparisons between deep models and simple models (i.e., machine models that do not leverage deep learning) to understand whether deep models are always superior to simple models.\nThey conducted comparisons on various tagging tasks such as suggestion mining  or humor detection . Their results reveal marginal or sometimes no improvements of deep models over simple models.\nIt is therefore natural to ask whether\ndeep models are better than simple models when developing solutions for semantic tagging. Semantic tagging forms the core of many tasks including sentiment classification, suggestion mining, and humor detection. Existing studies, however, compare deep and simple models only on individual tasks. Furthermore, they do not provide insights on how dataset characteristics affect the performances of different models. Consequently, it is hard to generalize their model selection criteria to new tasks or new datasets for the same task. Hence, given a new dataset, it is still unclear whether selecting a deep model will bring the best tagging performance. In this paper, we embark on a systematic study to understand the performance tradeoffs of deep models vs. simple models for semantic tagging. Towards this goal, we selected 3 representative deep models: CNN, LSTM, and BERT and 2 representative simple models: LR and SVM. CNN  and LSTM  are well-known methods that have been widely used in both the academic and industry communities and more recently, BERT .\nTo make a meaningful comparison and systematic study, we collected 21 real datasets that are frequently used in semantic tagging. These datasets exhibit several prominent data characteristics, including (1) a variable number of labels (thousands to millions); (2) a wide range of tag-conveying label ratio (1.6% to 71.4%, ratio <25%absentpercent25<25\\% considered as imbalance in this paper); (3) different label cleanliness (clean and dirty labels). We evaluate the quality of semantic tagging on five selected models on 21 datasets and we obtain a rather surprising finding.\nWe find that deep models and simple models are complementary to each other on the task of semantic tagging. Specifically, deep models perform significantly better on smaller datasets, while simple models can be trained more efficiently on larger datasets and achieve similar semantic tagging quality. Therefore, one should select deep models or simple models for semantic tagging based on the actual dataset characteristics and requirements on efficiency.  Based on our findings, we develop a comprehensive heat map to guide practitioners on selecting the appropriate model for the desired semantic tagging performance for their datasets. This heat map shows the characteristics of the datasets and their quality score of semantic tagging with different tagging models. By using this heat map, practitioners can estimate the semantic tagging quality gain while adopting different deep or simple models. At the same time, they can also try to improve the dataset characteristics to improve the quality of semantic tagging. \n Contributions. We systematically evaluate deep models and simple models for the task of semantic tagging.\nOur key contributions are as follows. (1) We surveyed a number of applications to motivate our study. We selected three representative deep models and two simple models that are widely used to develop these applications. We collected 21 datasets of varying characteristics for a comprehensive study. (2) We conducted extensive evaluations to obtain performance of semantic tagging of the five selected models on all the datasets. We found deep models do not necessarily perform better than simple models on large datasets. (3) We evaluated the effects of dataset characteristics on the quality of semantic tagging. We found the training size, label ratio, and label cleanliness impact the quality of semantic tagging. (4) We generated a comprehensive heat map that can guide practitioners to decide whether they should adopt deep models or simple models and anticipate the performance of semantic tagging for their datasets. To facilitate future research, we will release our collection of datasets, models, and implementations at https://github.com/rit-git/tagging. \n Outline. We survey a number applications in Section 2. We discuss the designs of selected deep models and simple models in Section 3. We introduce the collected datasets and their characteristics in Section 4. We perform experimental evaluations and comparisons in Section 5. We analyze the effect of dataset characteristics and present key findings in Section 6. We conclude our study in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: of deep models has been reported by many publications.
