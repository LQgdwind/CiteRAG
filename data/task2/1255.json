      "content": "Paper Title: From Goals, Waypoints & Paths To Long Term Human Trajectory Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSequence prediction is a fundamental problem in several engineering disciplines such as signal processing, pattern recognition, control engineering and in virtually any domain concerned with temporal measurements. From the seminal work of A. A. Markov  on predicting the next syllable in the poem Eugene Onegin with Markov chains, to modern day autoregressive descendants like GPT-3 [ref]6, next element prediction in a sequence has a long standing history. Time series forecasting is a key instantiation of the sequence prediction problem in the setting where the sequence is formed by elements sampled in time. Several classic techniques such as Autoregressive Moving Average Models (ARMA)  have been incorporated in deep learning architectures [ref]41  in modern day state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods 7. However, humans are not inanimate Newtonian entities, slave to predetermined physical laws & forces. Predicting the future motion of a billiard ball smoothly rolling on a pool table under friction and physical constraints is a problem of different nature from forecasting human motion and positions. Humans are goal conditioned agents that, unlike the ball, exert their will through actions to achieve a desired outcome . Anticipating human motion is of fundamental importance to dynamic agents such as other humans, autonomous robots  and self-driving vehicles 9. Human motion is inherently goal directed and is put in place by the agent to bring about a desired effect. Nevertheless, even conditioned on the agent’s past motion and overarching long term goals, is the future trajectory deterministic? Consider yourself standing at a crossing on a busy street, waiting for the pedestrian light to turn green. While you have every intention of crossing the street, the exact future trajectory remains stochastic as you might swerve to avoid other pedestrians, speed up your pace if the light is about to turn red, or pause abruptly if an unruly cyclist dashes by. Hence, even conditioned on the past observed motion and scene semantics, future human motion is inherently stochastic  owing to both epistemic uncertainty caused by latent decision variables like long term goals and aleatoric variability  stemming from random decision variables such as environmental factors. This dichotomy is even sharper in long term forecasting, since due to the increased uncertainty in future, the aleatoric randomness influences the trajectory much more strongly in long rather than short temporal horizons. This motivates a factorized multimodal approach for human dynamics modeling where both factors of stochasticity are modeled hierarchically rather than lumped jointly. We hypothesize that the long term latent goals of the agent represent the epistemic uncertainty with motion prediction. This is motivated by the observation that while the agent has a goal in mind while planning and executing their trajectory, this is unknown to the prediction system. In physical terms, this is akin to the question of where the agent wants to go. Similarly, the aleatoric uncertainty is expressed in the stochasticity of the path leading to the goal, which encompasses factors like agent’s handedness, environment variables such as other agents, partial scene information available to the agent and most importantly, the unconscious randomness in human decisions . In physical terms, this is akin to the question of how the agent reaches the goal. Hence, we propose to model the epistemic uncertainty first and then the aleatoric stochasticity conditioned on the obtained estimate. Concretely, with the RGB scene and the past motion history we first estimate an explicit probability distribution over the agent’s final positions at the end of the trajectory, \\iethe agent’s long term goals. This represents the epistemic uncertainty in the prediction system. We also estimate distributions over a few chosen future waypoint positions which along with the sampled goal points are used to obtain explicit probability maps over all the remaining trajectory positions. This represents the aleatoric uncertainty in the prediction system. Together the samples from the epistemic goal and the aleatoric waypoint & trajectory distribution form the predicted future trajectory. In summary, our contribution is threefold. First, we propose a novel long term prediction setting that extends upto a minute in the future which is about an order of magnitude longer than previous literature. We also benchmark performance of previous state-of-the-art short horizon prediction models on this setting along with simple baselines. Second, we propose Y-net, a scene-compliant long term trajectory prediction network that explicitly models both the goal and path multimodalities by making effective use of the scene semantics. Third, we show that the factorized multimodality modeling enables Y-net to improve the state-of-the-art both on the proposed long term settings and the well-studied short term prediction settings. We benchmark Y-net’s performance on the Stanford Drone 1 and the ETH 0/UCY benchmark in the short term setting, where it outperforms previous approaches by significant margins of 26.9%percent26.926.9\\% & 5.6%percent5.65.6\\% respectively, on ADE and by 34.0%percent34.034.0\\% and 51.9%percent51.951.9\\% respectively, on FDE metric. Further, we also study Y-net’s performance in the proposed long term prediction setting on the Stanford Drone & the Intersection Drone Dataset  where it substantially improves the performance of state-of-the-art short term methods by over 50.6%percent50.650.6\\% and 35.0%percent35.035.0\\% respectively, on ADE and 77.1%percent77.177.1\\% and 55.9%percent55.955.9\\% respectively, on FDE metric.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: with temporal measurements.
