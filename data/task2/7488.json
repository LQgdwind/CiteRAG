      "content": "Paper Title: PIP-Net: Pedestrian Intention Prediction in the Wild\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, there has been a shift from still image analysis to the incorporation of temporal information into the prediction models. Rather than relying on individual images, most contemporary methods utilise sequences of input images for decision-making by their prediction models. This adaptation recognises the significance of temporal data in enhancing the prediction task, resulting in what is known as spatio-temporal modelling. Spatio-temporal modelling can be achieved through a two-step process. Initially, visual (spatial) features per frame can be extracted using 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  or graph convolution networks (GCNs) . Subsequently, these extracted features are then fed into RNNs, such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) [ref]15 or the gated recurrent unit (GRU) models [ref]22 [ref]23 .\nFor instance, in  , 2D convolutions are employed to extract visual features from image sequences, while RNNs encode the temporal relationships among these features. These sequentially encoded visual features are then inputted into a fully-connected layer to generate the ultimate intention prediction. An alternative approach to extracting sequential visual features involves the utilisation of 3D CNNs (Conv3D) . This technique directly captures spatio-temporal features by substituting the 2D kernels within the convolution and pooling layers of a 2D CNN with their 3D equivalents. For instance, in works such as  and , a framework based on a 3D CNN, specifically a 3D DenseNet, is employed to directly extract sequential visual features from sequences of pedestrian images. The ultimate prediction is then made using a fully-connected layer.\nTransformer architecture has also been utilised in another study  to tokenise the temporal input features and subsequently judge the pedestriansâ€™ intention.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: using 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  or graph convolution networks (GCNs) .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
