      "content": "Paper Title: Predicting the Geolocation of Tweets Using BERT-Based Models Trained on Customized Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many research projects focusing on information retrieval from plain text to estimate geolocation by the application of neural networks. In terms of the previously mentioned geolocation problems that are commonly associated with Twitter data, this section covers works related to the tweet location and the user’s home location prediction tasks. Some solutions are purely text-based and some have a hybrid approach employing the user’s network of friends and mentions in addition to NLP. Generally, there are three categories of home location granularity: administrative regions, geographical grids, and geographical coordinates. As for the tweet location, point-of-interests (POIs) or coordinates are broadly adopted as representations of tweet locations, instead of administrative regions or grids. The most straightforward approach is to analyze the natural languages present in social media posts. There are multiple projects processing documents or the summary of user profile tweets to predict the author geolocation    [ref]15 . These works apply geographical grids to divide the Earth’s surface into different sizes regions such that highly populated areas are split into smaller pieces while more sparse population areas end up as large grid cells. Early efforts ,  were mainly focused on mining indicative information from users’ posting content relying on location indicative words (LIWs) that can link users to their home locations, based on various NLP techniques (e.g., topic models and statistic models) . For example, Rahimi extracts bag-of-words features from user posts 8; Wing and Baldridge estimate the word distributions for different regions . Other word-centric works    4  also focus on filtering LIWs from the text and using the gazetteers including not only city/country names but also dialect terms to resolve the geographical indexes. While such methodologies suppose the predefined set of LIWs and their geographical coordinates, Rahimi in the work  proposes a based on neural network approach to encoding such words and phrases to the continuous two-dimensional space. In the oldest of relevant works, Eisenstein presents similar unsupervised models which are topic-based  [ref]10. Another way to predict geolocation for social media posts is based on the user network that is covered in many previous works      2. Consequently, some works suggest a hybrid approach using both content and network to solve the user home geolocation prediction task     . Other researchers also define a metadata feature in addition to network and textual input for their models   . The usage of context input (such as geo-tags and other meta-data associated with tweets/users) is faintly explored in the previous works due to the deficient data records obtained from publicly available sources of Twitter geotagged datasets. In terms of single-tweet geolocation prediction, some authors came up with probabilistic models solving the classification task on the country/city levels  . Moreover, Yuan in the work  also covered the temporal aspect and users’ mobility to estimate each tweet’s location source. Importantly, Priedhorsky’s methodology was aligned with the present work as it utilized Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for geolocation prediction instead of simple coordinates prediction . Another subsequent study, which employed a hybrid approach, also estimated geolocation through GMMs rather than coordinates . This study used the text and network features jointly as predictors for the final estimation. The performance metrics used in both works were adopted to evaluate the proposed probabilistic models as described in Section 5.2. Most of the previously mentioned works use various approaches based on neural networks for NLP, but none of them applied BERT for the estimation of geolocation. The relatively new BERT model (released in 2018 ) is aimed at classification tasks and some works have already used it for country/city names predictions. For instance, Villegas in the work 6 predicts place type or point of interest (POI) using lowercase English BERT. Furthermore, Li in the work 0 focused on city-scale prediction for the Twitter datasets of Melbourne, and Singapore. The model presented by Li took the text and metadata input and gave the result in a form of probabilities for the set of POI classes. In the study conducted by Simanjuntak 5, the task of predicting Twitter users’ home location was explored using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and BERT models. The dataset used in the experiment comprised text content and user metadata context of tweets in the Indonesian language. However, the input limit of 512 tokens imposed by BERT models posed a challenge in accurately classifying a user’s home location, as concatenating all of the user’s tweets into a single text would result in an input exceeding the limit. As a result, users’ location prediction was performed on a per-tweet basis, and it was observed that the majority vote approach frequently (42%) led to misclassification of the user’s home location. In another work, Scherrer uses BERT models for both regression and classification tasks on limited text datasets of BosnianCroatian-Montenegrin-Serbian and Deutch languages 3. Evaluation of their regression model on the bound to German-speaking Switzerland dataset shows 21.20 and 30.60 km median and mean distance errors. The authors state that using a smaller tokenization vocabulary and converting the geolocation task to a classification task, in general, yielded worse results. They also conclude that hyperparameter tuning did not yield any consistent improvements, and simply selecting the optimal epoch number on development data showed to be the best approach to the problem of geolocation prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: is to analyze the natural languages present in social media posts.
