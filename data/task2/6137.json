The framework of a model-based RRL (MB-RRL), which is also known as robust MDP (R-MDP), was first introduced in [ref]6 , which can be solved via dynamic programming by exploiting the knowledge of a R-MDP (e.g., a N-MDP and a predefined uncertainty set). This framework has been extensively explored in      , developing computationally efficient algorithms. However, these works are limited to the planning problem. MB-RRL algorithms with theoretical guarantees have been proposed in  , but they are limited to tabular settings or linear function approximations. Although MB-RRL has been investigated using deep neural networks (DNNs), these methods do not provide any theoretical performance guarantee    . These model-based approaches have typical disadvantages as in model-based RLs  . One of the major drawbacks of MB-RRL is to result in model-bias and error, which can degrade the accuracy performance and reliability of a learned agent. Also, MB-RRL is challenging to implement since it requires a large memory to store an estimated model knowledge (e.g., a R-MDP). Moreover, MB-RRL can be limited to the availability of data samples, which can affect the accuracy and validity of the model. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, a model-free RRL (MF-RRL) has been recently presented in [ref]31   [ref]15. In [ref]15 , MF-RRL was investigated, where the uncertainty set is developed using confidence region consisting of some constraints on probability distributions. Due to the high-complexity to handle this uncertainty set, MF-RRL algorithm was developed using a proxy uncertainty set with relaxed conditions. However, there is no analytical guarantee for the exactness of such approximation. Very recently in [ref]31 , MF-RRL algorithm was developed by introducing the uncertainty set based on Huber‚Äôs RùëÖR-contamination set . Unlike [ref]15 , this uncertainty set does not require any condition on probability distributions, which makes it possible to develop MF-RRL algorithm without any relaxation. However, these uncertainty sets have the two major drawbacks (see Section¬†I-B for details), which makes it hard to be practical.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: In this section, we briefly review the existing RRL approaches.
