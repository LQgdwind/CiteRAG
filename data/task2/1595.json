      "content": "Paper Title: Bounded Memory Active Learning through Enriched Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe start with an informal overview of our contributions: namely the introduction of lossless sample compression, its implications for efficient, bounded memory RPU-learning, and three fundamental examples of classes which, while infeasible or even impossible in standard models, have small lossless compression schemes with respect to natural enriched queries. Before launching into such results, however, we give a brief introduction to enriched queries, followed by some intuition and background on our novel form of compression. Given a set X𝑋X and a binary classifier h:X→{0,1}:ℎ→𝑋01h:X\\to\\{0,1\\}, standard models of learning generally aim to approximate hℎh solely through the use of labeled samples from X𝑋X. Since labels often cannot provide enough information to learn efficiently, we allow the learner to ask some specified set of additional questions, denoted by a “query set” Q𝑄Q (see Section 2.3 for formal description). As an example, one well-studied notion of an enriched query is a “comparison”     [ref]26  [ref]9. In such cases, along with asking for labels, the learner may additionally ask an expert to compare two pieces of data (e.g. asking a doctor “which of these patients do you think is sicker?”). Given a sample S⊆X𝑆𝑋S\\subseteq X, we let Qh​(S)subscript𝑄ℎ𝑆Q_{h}(S) then denote the responses to all possible queries in Q𝑄Q on S𝑆S under hypothesis hℎh. For the basic example of labels and comparisons, this would consist of |S|𝑆|S| labels and all (|S|2)binomial𝑆2{|S|\\choose 2} pairwise comparisons. With this notion in hand, we can discuss our extension of sample compression to the enriched query regime. Standard sample compression schemes posit the existence of a compression algorithm A𝐴A and decompression scheme D𝐷D such that for any sample S𝑆S, A​(S)𝐴𝑆A(S) is small, and D​(A​(S))𝐷𝐴𝑆D(A(S)) outputs a hypothesis that correctly labels all elements of S𝑆S. Lossless sample compression strengthens this idea in two ways. First, the hypothesis output by D𝐷D must be zero-error (but, like our learners, is allowed to abstain). Second, the output hypothesis must label not just S𝑆S, but every point whose label can be inferred222The label of x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X is inferred by a subset S⊆X𝑆𝑋S\\subseteq X if all concepts h∈Hℎ𝐻h\\in H consistent with queries on S𝑆S share the same label for x𝑥x. See Section 2.4 for details. from Qh​(S)subscript𝑄ℎ𝑆Q_{h}(S). Let X𝑋X be a set and H𝐻H a family of binary classifiers on X𝑋X. We say (X,H)𝑋𝐻(X,H) has a lossless compression scheme (LCS) W𝑊W of size k𝑘k with respect to a set of enriched queries Q𝑄Q if for all classifiers h∈Hℎ𝐻h\\in H and subsets S⊂X𝑆𝑋S\\subset X, there exists a subset W=W​(Qh​(S))⊆S𝑊𝑊subscript𝑄ℎ𝑆𝑆W=W(Q_{h}(S))\\subseteq S such that |W|≤k𝑊𝑘|W|\\leq k, and any point in X𝑋X whose label is inferred by Qh​(S)subscript𝑄ℎ𝑆Q_{h}(S) is also inferred by queries on Qh​(W)subscript𝑄ℎ𝑊Q_{h}(W). Given the existence of a lossless compression scheme for some class (X,H)𝑋𝐻(X,H), we prove in Section 3 that (a slight variant of) the following simple algorithm learns (X,H)𝑋𝐻(X,H) query-optimally, in bounded memory, and with no errors.333As mentioned previously, the learner is allowed to say “I don’t know” on a small fraction of the space. See Section 2.1 for formal definition.\n\n Size of LCS k𝑘k Query cap T1=O​(log⁡(1ε​δ))subscript𝑇1𝑂1𝜀𝛿T_{1}=O\\left(\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon\\delta}\\right)\\right) Sample cap T2=O~​(k​log2⁡(1/δ)ε)subscript𝑇2~𝑂𝑘superscript21𝛿𝜀T_{2}=\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{k\\log^{2}(1/\\delta)}{\\varepsilon}\\right) Sample a subset Si⊆Xisubscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝑋𝑖S_{i}\\subseteq X_{i} of size 6​k6𝑘6k (via rejection sampling on 𝒪Xsubscript𝒪𝑋\\mathcal{O}_{X}). For each point drawn from X𝑋X in this process, increment j𝑗j. If j𝑗j reaches T2subscript𝑇2T_{2}, abort and return labels inferred by queries on Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} Make all queries on Si∪Cisubscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝐶𝑖S_{i}\\cup C_{i}, and compute Ci+1=W​(Qh​(Si∪Ci))subscript𝐶𝑖1𝑊subscript𝑄ℎsubscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝐶𝑖C_{i+1}=W(Q_{h}(S_{i}\\cup C_{i})) Remove all points in and queries on (Si∪Ci)∖Ci+1subscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝐶𝑖subscript𝐶𝑖1(S_{i}\\cup C_{i})\\setminus C_{i+1} from memory and increment i𝑖i. Set Xi⊆Xsubscript𝑋𝑖𝑋X_{i}\\subseteq X to be the set of points uninferred by queries on Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} It is worth noting that in Algorithm 1, the set of remaining uninferred points Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} need not be kept in memory. Membership in Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} can be checked in an online fashion in step 1. We prove in Section 3 that Algorithm 1 is a query and computationally efficient, bounded memory RPU-learner. Algorithm 1 actively RPU-learns (X,H)𝑋𝐻(X,H) in only queries, time, and memory, where we have suppressed dependence on k𝑘k (the size of the LCS), and TX,H,Wsubscript𝑇𝑋𝐻𝑊T_{X,H,W} is a parameter dependent only on the class and compression scheme W𝑊W. In all examples we study TX,H,Wsubscript𝑇𝑋𝐻𝑊T_{X,H,W} is small and dependence on k𝑘k is at worst quadratic. It is further worth noting that O​(log⁡(1/ε))𝑂1𝜀O(\\log(1/\\varepsilon)) query complexity is information-theoretically optimal for most non-trivial concept classes. As long as the class has poly​(1/ε)poly1𝜀\\text{poly}(1/\\varepsilon) concepts which are Ω​(ε)Ω𝜀\\Omega(\\varepsilon) separated, any active learner must make Ω​(log⁡(1/ε))Ω1𝜀\\Omega(\\log(1/\\varepsilon)) queries to distinguish between them . We give three fundamental examples of classes which are either impossible or highly infeasible to RPU-learn with standard label queries, but have small, efficiently computable lossless compression schemes with respect to natural enriched queries: axis-aligned rectangles, decision trees, and halfspaces in two dimensions. As a result, these classes are all efficiently RPU-learnable with bounded memory. We briefly introduce each class, our proposed enriched queries, and discuss the implications on their learnability. We start our discussion with the simplest of the three, axis-aligned rectangles in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, which correspond to indicator functions for products of intervals over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}: where ai≤bisubscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖a_{i}\\leq b_{i}. While axis-aligned rectangles are impossible to RPU-learn in a finite number of label queries , we will show that the class has a small lossless compression scheme with respect to a natural query we call the “odd-one-out” oracle 𝒪oddsubscript𝒪odd\\mathcal{O}_{\\text{odd}}. Notice that axis-aligned rectangles essentially define a certain “acceptable” range for every feature—a point is labeled 111 iff it lies in this range for all coordinates. Informally, given a point x∈ℝd𝑥superscriptℝ𝑑x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} lying outside the rectangle, an “odd-one-out” query simply asks the user “why do you dislike x𝑥x?”. Concretely, one might imagine a chef is trying to cook a dish for a particularly picky patron. After each failed attempt, the chef may ask the patron what went wrong—perhaps the patron thinks the meat was overcooked! More formally, the “odd-one-out” query asks for a violated coordinate (i.e. a feature lying outside the acceptable range), and whether the coordinate was too large (in our example, overcooked) or too small (undercooked). We prove that axis-aligned rectangles in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} have an efficiently computable lossless compression scheme of size O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d), and thus are efficiently RPU-learnable in bounded memory with near-optimal query complexity. The class of axis-aligned rectangles in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} is RPU-learnable in only queries, O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d) memory, and time O~​(d2​log2⁡(1/δ)ε)~𝑂superscript𝑑2superscript21𝛿𝜀\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d^{2}\\log^{2}(1/\\delta)}{\\varepsilon}\\right) when the learner has access to 𝒪oddsubscript𝒪odd\\mathcal{O}_{\\text{odd}}. While rectangles provide an excellent theoretical example of a class for which basic enriched queries break standard barriers in active and bounded memory learning, they are often too simple to be of much practical use. To this end, we next consider a broad generalization of the class of axis-aligned rectangles called decision trees. A decision tree over ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} is a binary tree where each node in the tree corresponds to an inequality: measuring the i𝑖i-th feature (coordinate) of any x∈ℝd𝑥superscriptℝ𝑑x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}. Each leaf in the tree is assigned a label, and the label of any x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X is uniquely determined by the leaf resulting from following the decision tree from root to leaf, always taking the path determined by the inequality at each node. Informally, a decision tree may then be thought of as a partition of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} into clusters (axis-aligned rectangle) given by the leaves. Our proposed enriched query for decision trees, the “same-leaf” oracle 𝒪leafsubscript𝒪leaf\\mathcal{O}_{\\text{leaf}}, builds off this intuition. Given a decision tree T𝑇T and two points x,x′∈ℝd𝑥superscript𝑥′superscriptℝ𝑑x,x^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}, 𝒪leaf​(T,x,x′)subscript𝒪leaf𝑇𝑥superscript𝑥′\\mathcal{O}_{\\text{leaf}}(T,x,x^{\\prime}) determines whether x𝑥x and x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} lie in the same leaf of the decision tree. Thinking of each leaf as a cluster, this query may be seen as a variant of the “same-cluster” query paradigm studied in many recent works [ref]4    6 3 . For our scenario, think of asking a user whether two movies they like are of the same genre. We prove that the class of decision trees of size s𝑠s (at most s𝑠s leaves) has a small, efficiently computable lossless compression scheme and are therefore efficiently learnable in bounded memory. The class of size s𝑠s decision trees over ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} is RPU-learnable in only queries, O​(d​s)𝑂𝑑𝑠O(ds) memory, and time O~​(d2s2log(1/δ)2ε)\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d^{2}s^{2}\\log(1/\\delta)^{2}}{\\varepsilon}\\right) when the learner has access to 𝒪leafsubscript𝒪leaf\\mathcal{O}_{\\text{leaf}}. It is worth noting that while the class of decision trees of arbitrary size is not learnable (even in the PAC-setting ), we can bootstrap Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.4 to build an algorithm that learns decision trees attribute-efficiently. That is to say an algorithm whose expected time, number of queries, and memory scales with the size of the unknown decision tree. There exists an algorithm for RPU-learning decision trees over ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} which in expectation: Makes O​(d​s2​log⁡(sε​δ))𝑂𝑑superscript𝑠2𝑠𝜀𝛿O\\left(ds^{2}\\log\\left(\\frac{s}{\\varepsilon\\delta}\\right)\\right) queries Runs in time poly​(s,d,ε−1,log⁡(δ−1))poly𝑠𝑑superscript𝜀1superscript𝛿1\\text{poly}(s,d,\\varepsilon^{-1},\\log(\\delta^{-1})) Uses O​(d​s)𝑂𝑑𝑠O(ds) memory, where s𝑠s is the size of the underlying decision tree. Despite being vastly more expressive than axis-aligned rectangles, decision trees in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} are still simplistic in the sense that they remain axis-aligned. For our final example, we study a fundamental class without any such restriction: (non-homogeneous) halfspaces in two dimensions. Recall that a halfspace in two dimensions is given by the sign of h=⟨v,⋅⟩+bℎ𝑣⋅𝑏h=\\langle v,\\cdot\\rangle+b for some v∈ℝ2𝑣superscriptℝ2v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} and b∈ℝ𝑏ℝb\\in\\mathbb{R}. Following a number of prior works     [ref]26  [ref]9, we study the learnability of halfspaces with comparison queries. Informally, given two points of the same sign, a comparison query simply asks which is further away from the separating hyperplane h=0ℎ0h=0. This type of query is natural in scenarios like halfspaces where the class has an underlying ranking. One might ask a doctor, for instance, “which patient is sicker?”. We prove that halfspaces in two dimensions have an efficiently computable lossless compression scheme of size O​(1)𝑂1O(1) with respect to comparison queries, and thus that they are efficiently RPU-learnable in bounded memory. The class of halfspaces over ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} is actively RPU-learnable in only queries, O​(1)𝑂1O(1) memory, and time O​(log2⁡(1/(δ​ε))ε)𝑂superscript21𝛿𝜀𝜀O\\left(\\frac{\\log^{2}(1/(\\delta\\varepsilon))}{\\varepsilon}\\right). It should be noted that KLMZ  remark in their work that halfspaces in two dimensions should be learnable in bounded memory, but give no indication of how this might be done. This concludes the informal statement of our results, and we end the section with a roadmap of the remainder of our work which formalizes and proves the above. In Section 2, we discuss preliminaries, including our learning model and enriched queries, and related work. In Section 3, we formally introduce lossless sample compression and prove it is is a sufficient condition for bounded memory active RPU-learnability. In Section 4, we provide three fundamental classifier families with efficiently computable lossless compression schemes with respect to basic enriched queries: axis-aligned rectangles, decision trees, and halfspaces in two dimensions. We conclude in Section 5 with a few comments on further directions.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: some specified set of additional questions, denoted by a “query set” Q𝑄Q (see Section 2.3 for formal description).
