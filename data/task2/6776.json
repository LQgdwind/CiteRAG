      "content": "Paper Title: Camouflaged Image Synthesis Is All You Need to Boost Camouflaged Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe quality and quantity of data are crucial factors that heavily affect the performance of deep learning models. In situations where obtaining data or labels is challenging, learning from synthetic data has been a straightforward solution. Synthetic data has been widely used in segmentation, autonomous driving, medical images, domain adaptation, 3D reconstruction, and automatic label generation.\n The GTA Dataset [ref]34 is a synthetic dataset from games that has been extensively used in autonomous driving and other computer vision tasks. Qi et al.  utilized synthetic data to learn the relationship between humans and environments. Li et al. [ref]24 employed synthetic datasets to perform learning in robotics. Acharya et al.  used synthetic data as multi-view inputs to learn the geometry of multi-view stereo. Sankaranarayanan et al.  addressed domain shift for semantic segmentation by learning from synthetic data. Wang et al. [ref]41 addressed the scarcity of data problem in crowd counting tasks by pretraining a model to generate synthetic datasets. Synthetic data has also been applied in medical image processing. Frid-Adar et al. 2 used GANs for synthetic data augmentation to improve liver lesion classification performance. Recent works, such as DatasetGAN , employ StyleGAN  to synthesize realistic images and use the latent code to generate the corresponding semantic segmentation. Other works  use unsupervised domain adaptation to generate dataset labels, while Mishra et al.  use pre-trained models on synthetic data for downstream tasks. Despite the extensive research on synthetic data in various computer vision fields, there has been no work focused on generating synthetic data for camouflage. The unique challenges of synthesizing camouflage images, including the scarcity of camouflage data and the difficulty of detecting camouflaged objects, understanding the relationship between foreground and background, and generating realistic camouflage images, make this task particularly challenging. Therefore, developing a method to generate synthetic camouflage datasets is an urgent and essential research direction for advancing camouflaged object detection.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: solution.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
