      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Residual Classifier for Class Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep models are prone to forgetting previously learned knowledge when sequentially fine-tuned on different tasks.\nSevere performance degradation on the old tasks can be observed.\nIt is also known as catastrophic forgetting  .\nClass incremental learning (CIL) methods   aim to handle this issue and equip deep models with the capacity to continuously learn new categories without forgetting the old ones.\nThe rehearsal strategy 7   [ref]42  has been widely used to achieve this goal. Specifically, a limited amount of exemplars from previous tasks are stored in a memory buffer and replayed when learning new tasks. Due to the relatively small size of the memory buffer, the training samples of a new class are far more than the old ones.\nTherefore, adopting the rehearsal strategy can introduce the data imbalance problem to CIL.\nTwo kinds of long-tailed recognition techniques, the adjusted losses   and the data re-sampling , are exploited by many CIL methods  [ref]42   to learn the classifier with less bias.\nThese methods alleviate the data imbalance within each increment task independently. However, the data imbalance in CIL is dynamic and becomes more extreme as the task increment proceeds, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nA novel dynamic residual classifier (DRC) is proposed in this work to handle this challenging scenario.\nInspired by the recent advance residual classifier (RC) [ref]7, a lightweight branch layer is inserted before the classifier to encode the task-specific knowledge.\nThis new architecture enables the residual fusion of classifier outputs to alleviate the data imbalance effectively.\nHowever, directly applying RC for CIL leads to the model-growing problem, i.e., the growing overhead from the additional branch layers assigned to the new tasks.\nThe proposed DRC handles this dynamic increment issue via the simple yet effective branch layer merging.\n DRC is directly applicable to different CIL pipelines by simply replacing the fully connected (fc) classifiers.\nThree typical CIL pipelines, i.e., the Model Direct Transfer (MDT) 7 , the Model Expansion and Compression (MEC) [ref]42  and the Model Adaptation and Fusion (MAF)  , as shown in Fig. 2, are chosen to be combined with DRC.\nThey can consistently benefit from such combinations, with clear improvements observed.\nThe details and comparisons on such combinations are given in Sec. 3.3.\nMore importantly, DRC is most compatible with MAF among the three pipelines. The resulting MAFDRC method achieves state-of-the-art performance under both conventional CIL and long-tailed CIL (LT-CIL) settings.\nExtensive analyzes are conducted to provide insights into each part.\nThe main contributions\nare three-fold:\n We show the data imbalance issue in CIL rehearsal is dynamic across tasks rather than static within each task. The proposed dynamic residual classifier (DRC) aims to handle this challenging scenario from the perspective of classifier architecture, which is complementary to existing efforts in CIL; The branch layer architecture and residual fusion mechanism from a recent long-tailed classifier (RC) [ref]7 are adopted by DRC to alleviate the negative impact of data imbalance on CIL for the first time.\nMore importantly, the model-growing problem of the vanilla RC under the CIL setting is handled with the simple yet effective branch layer merging in DRC; The proposed DRC is generalizable.\nOn the one hand, incorporating DRC brings clear improvements to different CIL pipelines.\nOn the other hand, the effectiveness of DRC is demonstrated in both the CIL and the LT-CIL settings.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: incremental learning (CIL) methods   aim to handle this issue and equip deep models with the capacity to continuously learn new categories without forgetting the old ones.\nThe rehearsal strategy 7   [ref]42  has been widely used to achieve this goal.
