      "content": "Paper Title: TVR: A Large-Scale Dataset for Video-Subtitle Moment Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnormous numbers of multimodal videos (with audio and/or text) are being uploaded to the web every day. To enable users to search through these videos and find relevant moments, an efficient and accurate method for retrieval of video data is crucial.\nRecent works¬†[ref]14 [ref]9 introduced the task of Single Video Moment Retrieval (SVMR), whose goal is to retrieve a moment from a single video via a natural language query.\nEscorcia et al.¬†[ref]8 extended SVMR to Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR), where a system is required to retrieve the most relevant moments from a large video corpus instead of from a single video.\nHowever, these works rely on a single modality (visual) as the context source for retrieval, as existing moment retrieval datasets¬†[ref]14  [ref]9  are based on videos.\nIn practice, videos are often associated with other modalities such as audio or text, e.g., subtitles for movie/TV-shows or audience discourse accompanying live stream videos.\nThese associated modalities could be equally important sources for retrieving user-relevant moments. Fig.¬†1 shows a query example in the VCMR task, in which both videos and subtitles are vital to the retrieval process. Hence, to study multimodal moment retrieval with both video and text contexts, we propose a new dataset - TV show Retrieval (TVR).\nInspired by recent works¬†   that built multimodal datasets based on Movie/Cartoon/TV shows,\nwe select TV shows as our data resource as they typically involve rich social interactions between actors, involving both activities and dialogues.\nDuring data collection, we present annotators with videos and associated subtitles to encourage them to write multimodal queries.\nA tight temporal timestamp is labeled for each video-query pair.\nWe do not use predefined fixed segments (as in¬†[ref]14) but choose to freely annotate the timestamps for more accurate localization.\nMoreover, query types are collected for each query to indicate whether it is more related to the video, the subtitle, or both, allowing deeper analyses of systems.\nTo ensure data quality, we set up strict qualification and post-annotation quality verification tests.\nIn total, we have collected 108,965 high-quality queries on 21,793 videos from 6 TV shows, producing the largest dataset of this kind.\nCompared to existing datasets¬†[ref]14  [ref]9 , we show TVR has greater linguistic diversity (Fig.¬†3) and involves more actions and people in its queries (Table¬†2). With the TVR dataset, we extend the moment retrieval task to a more realistic multimodal setup where both video and subtitle text need to be considered (i.e., ‚ÄòVideo-Subtitle Moment Retrieval‚Äô). In this paper, we focus on the corpus-level task VCMR\n, as SVMR can be viewed as a simplified version of VCMR in which the ground-truth video is given beforehand.\nPrior works¬†[ref]14 [ref]9    [ref]8 explore the moment retrieval task as a ranking problem over a predefined set of moment proposals. These proposals are usually generated using handcrafted heuristics¬†[ref]14  or sliding windows¬†[ref]9   [ref]8 and are usually not temporally precise, leading to suboptimal performance.\nFurthermore, these methods may not be easily scaled to long videos: the number of proposals often increase quadratically with video length, making computational costs infeasible.\nRecent methods¬†  adapt start-end span predictors¬†  from the reading comprehension task to moment retrieval, by early fusion of video and language (query) features, then applying neural networks on the fused features to predict start-end probabilities.\nIt has been shown¬† that using span predictors outperforms several proposal-based methods.\nAdditionally, start-end predictors allow a hassle-free extension to long videos, with only linearly increased computational cost.\nWhile¬† has shown promising results in SVMR, it is not scalable to VCMR as it uses expensive early fusion operation.\nConsider retrieving NùëÅN queries in a corpus of MùëÄM videos, the approach in¬† requires running several layers of LSTM¬† on M‚ãÖN‚ãÖùëÄùëÅM\\mbox{$\\cdot$}N early fused representations to generate the probabilities, which is computationally expensive for large values of MùëÄM and NùëÅN. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-modal Moment Localization (XML), a late fusion approach for VCMR. In XML, videos (or subtitles) and queries are encoded independently, thus only M‚Äã+‚ÄãNùëÄ+ùëÅM\\mbox{+}N neural network operations are needed.\nFurthermore, videos can be pre-encoded and stored. At test time, one only needs to encode new user queries, which greatly reduces user waiting time. Late fusion then integrates video and query representations with highly optimized matrix multiplication to generate 1D query-clip similarity scores over the temporal dimension of the videos. To produce moment predictions from these similarity scores, a naive approach is to rank the aforementioned sliding window proposals with confidence scores computed as the average of the similarity scores inside each proposal region.\nAlternatively, one can use TAG¬† to progressively group top-scored clips.\nHowever, these methods rely on handcrafted rules and are not end-to-end trainable.\nInspired by image edge detectors¬†8 in image processing, we propose Convolutional Start-End detector (ConvSE) that learns to detect start (up) and end (down) edges in the similarity signals with two trainable 1D convolution filters.\nUsing the same backbone net, we show ConvSE has better performance than both approaches.\nWith late fusion and ConvSE, we further show XML outperforms previous methods¬†[ref]14 [ref]8 , and does this with better computational efficiency. To summarize, our contributions are three-fold:\n(iùëñi) We introduce TVR dataset, a large-scale multimodal moment retrieval dataset with 109K high-quality queries of great linguistic diversity.\n(i‚Äãiùëñùëñii) We propose XML, an efficient approach that uses a late fusion design for the VCMR task. The core of XML is our novel ConvSE module which learns to detect start-end edges in 1D similarity signals with 2 convolution filters. Comprehensive experiments and analyses show XML surpasses all presented baselines by a large margin and runs with better efficiency.\n(i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii) We have also collected additional descriptions for each annotated moment in TVR to form a new multimodal captioning dataset with 262K captions, named TV show Caption (TVC).\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: being uploaded to the web every day. To enable users to search through these videos and find relevant moments, an efficient and accurate method for retrieval of video data is crucial.\nRecent works¬†[ref]14 [ref]9 introduced the task of Single Video Moment Retrieval (SVMR), whose goal is to retrieve a moment from a single video via a natural language query.\nEscorcia et al.¬†[ref]8 extended SVMR\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
