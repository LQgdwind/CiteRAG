      "content": "Paper Title: Eccentricity queries and beyond using Hub Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe refer to   for basic notions and terminology in Graph Theory.\nReal-world networks can be conveniently represented as a weighted graph G=(V,E,w)𝐺𝑉𝐸𝑤G=(V,E,w), with typical interpretations of the weight function w:E→ℝ>0:𝑤→𝐸subscriptℝabsent0w:E\\to\\mathbb{R}_{>0} being the latency of a link, the length of a road between two locations, etc. If ∀e∈E,we=1formulae-sequencefor-all𝑒𝐸subscript𝑤𝑒1\\forall e\\in E,w_{e}=1, then we can drop the weight function, calling the graph unweighted and writing G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E). Unless stated otherwise, all graphs considered in this note are finite, weighted, directed and strongly connected111The strongly connected assumption could be easily dropped, but it makes the presentation simpler by avoiding the pathological case of infinite distances.. For every ordered pair of vertices (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v), the distance d​i​s​tG​(u,v)𝑑𝑖𝑠subscript𝑡𝐺𝑢𝑣dist_{G}(u,v) is defined as the smallest weight of a path from u𝑢u to v𝑣v. We omit the subscript if the graph G𝐺G is clear from the context. We note that distance computation is an important primitive in many scenarios, ranging from Satellite Navigation devices to forwarding network packets. However, in some practical or theoretical applications, the “right” notion of distance is a twist of the one presented above. Let us give a few examples (taken from ). Source distance: d​i​s​t​(u,v)𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑣dist(u,v). This is the standard distance. Max distance: max⁡{d​i​s​t​(u,v),d​i​s​t​(v,u)}𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑣𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑣𝑢\\max\\{dist(u,v),dist(v,u)\\}. It turns the distances in a directed graph into a metric (i.e., it is symmetric and it satisfies the triangular inequality). Min distance: min⁡{d​i​s​t​(u,v),d​i​s​t​(v,u)}𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑣𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑣𝑢\\min\\{dist(u,v),dist(v,u)\\}. As a concrete application of the latter, Abboud et al.  cited the problem of optimally locating a hospital (minimizing the time for either the patient coming to the hospital, or an ambulance drive being sent at the patient’s home). Roundtrip distance: d​i​s​t​(u,v)+d​i​s​t​(v,u)𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑣𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑣𝑢dist(u,v)+dist(v,u). It also turns the distances in a directed graph into a metric. Many distance computation techniques for undirected graphs can be generalized to roundrip distances, such as e.g., the existence of low-stretch sparse spanners . A distance oracle is a data structure for computing distances. Next, we present a well-known family of distance oracles, of which we explore in this work the algorithmic properties. Hub labeling. A 222-hopset or, as we call it here, a hub labeling, assigns to every vertex v𝑣v an ordered pair (L+​(v),L−​(v))superscript𝐿𝑣superscript𝐿𝑣(L^{+}(v),L^{-}(v)) of vertex-subsets along with the distances d​i​s​t​(v,x)𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑣𝑥dist(v,x), for x∈L+​(v)𝑥superscript𝐿𝑣x\\in L^{+}(v), and d​i​s​t​(x,v)𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑥𝑣dist(x,v), for x∈L−​(v)𝑥superscript𝐿𝑣x\\in L^{-}(v). This labeling must ensure that, for any ordered pair of vertices (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v), we have d​i​s​t​(u,v)=min⁡{d​i​s​t​(u,x)+d​i​s​t​(x,v)∣x∈L+​(u)∩L−​(v)}𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑣𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑥conditional𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑥𝑣𝑥superscript𝐿𝑢superscript𝐿𝑣dist(u,v)=\\min\\{dist(u,x)+dist(x,v)\\mid x\\in L^{+}(u)\\cap L^{-}(v)\\}. In particular, we can compute d​i​s​t​(u,v)𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑣dist(u,v) – and more generally, the source, max-, min- and roundtrip distances from u𝑢u to v𝑣v – in O​(|L+​(u)|+|L−​(v)|)𝑂superscript𝐿𝑢superscript𝐿𝑣{O}(|L^{+}(u)|+|L^{-}(v)|) time. It has been observed in  that most distance labeling constructions are based on hub label schemes, thereby further motivating our study of the latter as a first step toward a more general analysis of the algorithmic properties of distance oracles. The maximum label size is defined as max⁡{|L+​(v)|∣v∈V}∪{|L−​(v)|∣v∈V}conditionalsuperscript𝐿𝑣𝑣𝑉conditionalsuperscript𝐿𝑣𝑣𝑉\\max\\{|L^{+}(v)|\\mid v\\in V\\}\\cup\\{|L^{-}(v)|\\mid v\\in V\\}, and it is the main complexity measure for hub labelings222The bit size is larger by at least a logarithmic factor, because we need to encode the vertices’ IDs and the distances values for all the vertices inside the labels.. Every graph admits a hub labeling of maximum label size Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n), and this is essentially optimal . However, it has been experimentally verified that many real-world graphs, and especially road networks, admit hub labelings with small maximum label size . From a more theoretical point of view, every n𝑛n-node planar graph admits a hub labeling with maximum label size O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log{n}) . Bounded-treewidth graphs and graphs of bounded highway dimension – a parameter conjectured to be small for road networks – admit hub labelings with (poly)logarithmic maximum label size  . Graphs of bounded tree-depth even have hub labelings with constant maximum label size, that can be computed in quasi linear time . Eccentricity and Distance-sum computations. Since many hub labeling schemes are readily implemented [ref]6   2 4, our approach consists in assuming a graph to be given with a hub labeling, and to study whether this additional information helps in solving faster certain distance problems. Specifically, let D​(⋅,⋅)𝐷⋅⋅D(\\cdot,\\cdot) represent any distance function on directed graphs (source, min-, max- or roundtrip). The eccentricity of a vertex u𝑢u, denoted by eD​(u)superscript𝑒𝐷𝑢e^{D}(u), is the maximum distance from u𝑢u to any other vertex, i.e., eD​(u)=maxv⁡D​(u,v)superscript𝑒𝐷𝑢subscript𝑣𝐷𝑢𝑣e^{D}(u)=\\max_{v}D(u,v). The diameter and the radius of a graph – w.r.t. D𝐷D – are, respectively, the maximum and minimum eccentricities amongst its vertices. The distance-sum of a vertex u𝑢u, that we denote by sD​(u)superscript𝑠𝐷𝑢s^{D}(u), is the sum of all the distances from u𝑢u to any other vertex, i.e., sD​(u)=∑vD​(u,v)superscript𝑠𝐷𝑢subscript𝑣𝐷𝑢𝑣s^{D}(u)=\\sum_{v}D(u,v). A median is a vertex minimizing its distance-sum, while the Wiener index is equal to ∑usD​(u)subscript𝑢superscript𝑠𝐷𝑢\\sum_{u}s^{D}(u). We stress that both computing the radius and the median set of a graph are fundamental facility location problems: with applications to optimal placement of schools, hospitals and other important facilities on a network. The problems of computing the diameter and the Wiener index found applications in network design and chemistry 3, respectively. In Sec. 3, we consider other topological indices from chemical graph theory.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: have hub labelings with constant maximum label size, that can be computed in quasi linear time .
