      "content": "Paper Title: Minorities in networks and algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSocial interactions are time-dependent, dynamic, and they change as the social system evolves. These time dependencies can impact communities in networks [ref]54, diffusion of information or norms, and causality direction . Non-Markovian properties of temporal networks constitute an essential dimension of complexity in time-varying complex systems, and they can lead to different types of diffusion outcomes . For example, organizational burstiness (coordinated burst in social interactions such as a coffee break at a conference) may speed up the complex contagion by activating many social interactions in a short duration of time  . When certain disadvantaged groups arrive in a social system with delay or at a slower rate, due to historical discrimination or societal inequalities (e.g., women in universities , or African-Americans in the blue-collar workforce ), the diffusion speed and hierarchy climbing for such groups is slower compared to more established groups. This late-arrival mechanism affects the age of the ego-network of minorities, the cumulative advantages, and their network position. By understanding this dynamic, we recently showed that the gender disparity in citation patterns of female-led papers and male-led papers is related mainly to the first-mover advantage of men and not a direct act of discrimination against women . Nevertheless, it is worth noting that such effects may create implicit biases and discrimination similar to what sociologists found as racism without racists effects  in which structural racism can exist without anyone being racist. Apart from the dynamics of networks, one can also consider dynamical processes that unfold on networks. Here, we discuss two types of dynamical processes: (1) diffusion of norms, (2) disease spreading, and how these dynamics affect minorities. Social scientists argue that diffusion of norms and culture falls under the category of complex contagion while disease spreading processes are often simple contagion. Complex contagion describes situations in which multiple social links of an individual must adopt a new norm or behaviour to convince this individual to adopt it. The rationale behind these processes is that humans, as social animals, follow conformity and social imitation when faced with limited access to information. Mark Granovetter first proposed a model of contagion to explain the emergence of norms and social uprising . The core principle is that individuals have a threshold or stubbornness to adopt a new behaviour. An individual will adopt a new behaviour when a certain fraction of people (within this individual’s observation horizon) also adopt the behaviour. In large societies, it is safe to assume that our observation horizon is somewhat limited to our direct contacts111Here, we ignore online social media exposure.. Borrowing this idea, in one of the early works in contemporary network science, Watts showed that being embedded in a large-scale social network, even if the network is completely random, leads to situations where contagion can occur . This finding points to the fact that even without any intelligent decision-making process or social engineering, social contagion can occur depending on how we are wired to others [ref]63. However, given the fact that groups mix differently (i.e., mixing biases), as we discussed in the earlier section, how would those biases in mixing affect the formation of norms and culture? In what societies can minorities propagate their norms, and in what societies do they need to adopt the majority’s norms?\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: Social interactions are time-dependent, dynamic, and they change as the social system evolves.
