Augmented data with GENELIEX¬†are more diverse than the one augmented with Kobayashi  and Wei and Zou . The F1-score with dataset augmentation performed by GENELIEX¬†outperforms the aforementioned methods on Amazon in medium and large dataset and on Yelp for the medium dataset. It equals state of the art performances on Yelp for the large dataset. As expected, for all three algorithms, the benefits of data augmentation decrease as the original training dataset size increases.\nInterestingly, we observe a strong correlation between more diverse sequences in the extreme regions and higher F1 score: the more diverse the augmented dataset, the higher the F1 score. More diverse sequences are thus more likely to lead to better improvement on downstream tasks (e.g. classification). Perceptive Measures.\nTo evaluate C1, C2, three turkers were asked to annotate the cohesion and the sentiment of 100100100 generated sequences for each algorithm and for the raw data. F1 scores of this evaluation are reported in Table 3.\nGrammar evaluation confirms the findings of  showing that random swaps and deletions do not always maintain the cohesion of the sequence. In contrast, GENELIEX¬†and Kobayashi , using vectorial representations, produce more coherent sequences. Concerning sentiment label preservation, on Yelp, GENELIEX¬†achieves the highest score which confirms the observed improvement reported in Table¬†2. On Amazon, turker annotations with data from GENELIEX¬†obtain a lower F1-score than from Kobayashi . This does not correlate with results in Table¬†2 and may be explained by a lower Krippendorff Alpha222measure of inter-rater reliability in [ref]0 [ref]0 : 00 is perfect disagreement and 111 is perfect agreement. on Amazon (Œ±=0.20ùõº0.20\\alpha=0.20) than on Yelp (Œ±=0.57ùõº0.57\\alpha=0.57).\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: from GENELIEX¬†obtain a lower F1-score than from Kobayashi . This does not correlate with results in Table¬†2 and may be explained by a lower Krippendorff Alpha222measure of inter-rater reliability in [ref]0 [ref]0 : 00 is perfect disagreement and 111 is perfect agreement. on Amazon (Œ±=0.20ùõº0.20\\alpha=0.20) than on Yelp (Œ±=0.57ùõº0.57\\alpha=0.57).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
