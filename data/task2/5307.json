      "content": "Paper Title: A Comprehensive Gold Standard and Benchmark for Comics Text Detection and Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComics are a multimodal structure and medium that use writing and images in a spectrum, from purely images to purely writing, to convey a story or an idea. Comics are at the intersection of education 0, sociocultural studies [ref]4, linguistics and cognitive sciences  . Understanding comics can help advance progress in these fields. Additionally, methods developed for processing and understanding comics can be applied to other forms of ”Visual Language,” including but not limited to cave paintings, mangas, graphic novels, and comics . The unique structure of comics can be analyzed at the low-level and high-level. At the low-level, natural language processing techniques can extract text from dialogues, narratives, and onomatopoeias. Computer vision methods can detect and segment motion lines, characters, and the location of objects and components   [ref]17 . At the high-level, the relationships between characters, storytelling, narrative understanding, inter-panel and intra-panel events must be studied. While the high-level features of natural images and scenes are widely studied , the same cannot be said for comics. This is due to the great variety of comics across time, location, and different styles and the lack of annotated data (see Table 1 for an overview of datasets). The limited availability of datasets in this domain can also be attributed to copyright and access rights challenges. The amount of annotated data creates a bottleneck for studies on comics using deep learning methods. Although there have been works on panel and speech bubble detection and segmentation, such as in   [ref]17 , and onomatopoeia detection and recognition, such as in , the only extensive dataset with OCR-extracted comics texts is called COMICS 1. However, when the text quality of the COMICS dataset is measured over a sample, it can be seen as unreliable (see Subsection 3.1 and Table 12). There is a limited amount of study on the OCR of dialogue and narrative texts in comics to produce high-quality text data. In [ref]17, such a pipeline was presented, but the data and models could not be shared due to copyright issues. This study presents a pipeline for OCR of comics, allowing us to extract text from speech bubbles in panels. This pipeline can also be used for general OCR purposes. We use the COMICS dataset 1 to curate a reliable and comprehensive dataset of American golden age comics. These comics are uniform, allowing our work to be directly applied to previous studies in the literature. We inspect the reported and unreported problems in the COMICS dataset and develop separate solutions for text detection and recognition using the MMOCR toolbox 6. To improve the performance of text detection and recognition, we follow a loop of annotating panels and speech bubbles, training models and evaluating them using ground-truth data. Once we have achieved stable performance with the trained models, we select the best end-to-end text detection and recognition model pair to process the COMICS dataset and extract OCR texts. Finally, we apply post-processing techniques to correct systematic errors in the OCR data and create the COMICS TEXT+ dataset. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We release a substantially improved version of the COMICS dataset OCR results, called COMICS Text+, which significantly outperforms its predecessor in terms of text quality, with a word accuracy improvement from 0.13 to 0.40. It is the best quality and most comprehensive publicly available dataset, with over two million transcriptions of textboxes. We release text detection and text recognition datasets created from Golden Age comics called respectively, COMICS Text+: Detection and COMICS Text+: Recognition along with ground truth data to validate end-to-end OCR pipelines. COMICS Text+: Detection contains more than 20,000 annotations from 1112 images. Whereas, COMICS Text+: Recognition contains more than 17,000 annotations from 1006 images. We train and evaluate the performance of 14 text detection and 10 text recognition models on COMICS Text+ datasets and analyze the effects of training size on performance. Our results show that text detection models are the bottleneck for OCR studies of comics, (see Figure 6) but their performance improves significantly after 200 textbox annotations. We present fine-tuned text detection and recognition models, based on FCENet  and MASTER 5, respectively, that have been trained on the COMICS Text+: Detection & Recognition datasets. There are no other publicly available models and datasets of this specific type, so we hope this work will serve as a baseline for future studies and lower the barrier to entry for those interested in this domain. We share an annotation tool forked from LabelMe . Since LabelMe does not allow the use of models to get predictions, we improved it by enabling it to use text detection and text recognition models to aid and speed up the annotation process. Our tool converts annotations into text detection, and recognition datasets used to create COMICS Text+: Detection & Recognition datasets. By providing this tool, we hope to make it easier for other researchers to create high-quality datasets for training and evaluating OCR models and can help to advance the state of the art in this field. The comics processing backbone for cloze-style tasks proposed in the COMICS dataset is reproduced, and the reproduced model is trained using both COMICS and COMICS TEXT+ datasets. The test results of the two models are compared, and it is shown that the model trained with COMICS TEXT+ outperforms the other model and achieves state-of-the-art results on most cloze-style tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: and medium that use writing and images in a spectrum, from purely images to purely writing, to convey a story or an idea.
