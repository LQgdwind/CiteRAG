      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding the Performance of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in Drug Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs detailed in Section 2.1, many knowledge graph specific embedding models have been introduced, with the primary differentiator between them being how they score the plausibility of a given triple. Here we briefly detail the models utilised in this study, but interested readers are referred to larger reviews for context and comparisons with other approaches [ref]20  . The models we have selected are popular approaches from the literature, cover a range of different methodologies and have begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery [ref]28 . DistMult. A simplification of the earlier RESCAL model, DistMult uses a vector for each relation type (represented as a diagonal square matrix to greatly reduce the number of required parameters) but is limited to learning only symmetric relations . The score function used by DistMult to evaluate each triple is thus as follows: ComplEx. To help overcome the ability to only learn symmetric relations, an extension of DistMult called ComplEx has been introduced . The entity and relation embeddings for the ComplEx model are not real valued, unlike many other approaches, instead they are complex valued such that 𝐡,𝐫,𝐭∈ℂk𝐡𝐫𝐭superscriptℂ𝑘\\mathbf{h},\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{t}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{k}. The score function for ComplEx then becomes: where ⊙direct-product\\odot is the Hadamard product and R​e​()𝑅𝑒Re() is real value only from the complex number. TransE. One of the first models to use translational distance to learn embeddings such that relations are used to translate in latent space is TransE . In TransE, the relation embedding is added to the head entity such that the result lies close to the tail embedding, where the score function can be thought of as: where F𝐹F is typically either the l1 or l2 norm. One well known limitation of TransE is that is cannot correctly account for one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many relations being present in a knowledge graph . TransH. To help address the issues of TransE, another translational distance based model entitled TransH has been introduced . TransH allows for entity embeddings to be given a different context depending upon the relation used in certain triple. This is achieved by modelling each relation r𝑟r as a hyperplane, with the head and tail entity embeddings first being transformed using a normal vector of the hyperplane 𝐰r∈ℝksubscript𝐰𝑟superscriptℝ𝑘\\mathbf{w}_{r}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{k} as follows: The score function is similar to the one used with TransE: where 𝐝rsubscript𝐝𝑟\\mathbf{d}_{r} is a vector that lies in relations r𝑟r hyperplane. RotatE. Combining ideas from different existing models, RotatE uses complex valued embeddings for entities and relations and works such that relations rotate head to tail entities . Given complex embeddings for head, relation and tail 𝐡,𝐫,𝐭∈ℂk𝐡𝐫𝐭superscriptℂ𝑘\\mathbf{h},\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{t}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{k} (RotatE limits the complex elements of the relation embeddings to have a modulus of one: |𝐫|=1𝐫1|\\mathbf{r}|=1) the score function then becomes: with ⊙direct-product\\odot again being the Hadamard product. This allows RotatE to deal with symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition relation types .\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: the plausibility of a given triple.
