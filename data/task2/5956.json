      "content": "Paper Title: AGI for Agriculture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnlike human intelligence which can infer new knowledge based on limited or zero experiences, most machine learning approaches, such as the traditional supervised learning techniques, often require thousands of labeled examples in order to learn simple patterns. To bridge this gap between human intelligence and AGI, few-shot learning (FSL)   has been proposed. In particular, FSL approaches focus on “meta-learning”, that is, learning a model that can generalize to novel tasks specified at inference-time 9. In other words, FSL aims to emulate the remarkable generalization ability of human intelligence, by quickly adapting to new tasks that contain insufficient samples. This is very helpful for scenarios where data collection and labeling is difficult and expensive, such as agricultural applications. Depending on the sample availability, FSL can be divided into three categories: Few-Shot (two to five samples per class), One-Shot (a single sample per class), and Zero-Shot (classifying unseen classes without any training samples). FSL has shown promising results in various domains and applications, including computer vision    5 and natural language processing  . Based on how to leverage the prior knowledge, existing FSL works can be categorized into three folds: 1) Data Augmentation. Some methods try to directly augment the training dataset by generating new samples from existing ones, transforming samples from a weakly labeled or unlabeled dataset, or transforming samples from a similar dataset. These augmentation processes are usually guided by hand-crafted rules, such as translation , flipping , reflection , and rotation 5 operation for image data, or learning a set of transformations or models to conduct data augmentation   . 2) Hypothesis constraint. To approximate the ground-truth distribution, models may need to determine a hypothesis space that minimizes the distance between the optimal prediction and the ground-truth distribution. As a larger hypothesis space requires more data samples to explore, some FSL methods try to constrain the searching space of the hypothesis via jointly learning multiple related tasks with shared model parameters    or restricting the form of distribution from prior knowledge   4. 3) Prior knowledge. When the training dataset is not large enough, FSL methods may leverage the prior knowledge to intervene in the searching strategy of the parameters, either by providing a good initialization of the parameters    or directly learning an optimizer to output search steps, such as changing the search direction or step size  7. Although few-shot learning approaches have received a significant amount of attention over the past decade   0 [ref]182  , they have rarely rivaled the popularity of their fully-supervised brethren. Additionally, most such approaches have limited generalizability, applying only to a single type of task, such as image classification 9, object detection 0 [ref]182, or multi-object tracking . An approach designed for, say, object classification cannot trivially be transferred to object detection, even though the two problems are related. One of the more surprising attributes of LLMs is that they exhibit a natural aptitude for few-shot learning . Given the rapid progress of LLMs towards ever-more-general problem solving, it is not unreasonable to assume that we are entering a future where the current, data-hungry supervised learning paradigm is obsolete. Currently, a significant challenge for agricultural deep learning is a lack of annotated data, leading to a variety of attempts to reduce the need for it    3 4 5  0 5. Suitable data for a particular crop may not exist at all, may not be annotated properly, or may not be publicly available. Advanced, multi-modal LLMs have the potential to solve these problems once and for all, but significant questions remain. Next-generation LLMs are only just beginning to integrate visual inputs . For its part, OpenAI is fairly tight-lipped about what exactly GPT-4 is capable of in this domain, and we likely won’t know for sure until it is tested rigorously and independently. One clear risk is that LLMs trained on internet-scale data will fail to generalize well to the agricultural vision domain because agricultural images tend to be very different from the majority of pictures on the internet. In this situation, we would be forced to rely on the model’s innate few-shot learning capabilities, which may or may not be up to the task. Additionally, there are many tasks of interest to the agricultural robotics community that require taking more obscure modalities (eg. point clouds or hyperspectral cubes) as inputs, and/or have outputs that cannot be expressed as text. Models such as GPT-4 would likely need to be extended at the architectural level in order to support such use cases. Given the fact that state-of-the-art LLMs are mostly proprietary, shrouded in secrecy, and impossible to train without millions of dollars invested in compute capacity, the research community might be waiting quite a while for these features. If we take the optimistic view that near-future LLMs will be capable of at least some agricultural vision tasks, what would that enable? Already, thanks to the proliferation of tools like YOLOv5 , simple computer vision tasks such as object detection can be accomplished by non-experts with little specialized training. Clearly, a reliable few-shot approach to agricultural computer vision would only make things easier by freeing us from the tyranny of data annotation, one of the last major pain points of computer vision workflows. Projects that would previously be difficult or slow due to the need to collect and annotate data could be deployed significantly faster. In addition, because of their language processing capabilities, vision-capable LLMs would be ideal for managing image-associated metadata, perhaps gaining the ability to derive textual metadata automatically based on an image input. Overall, LLMs stand to substantially accelerate the cycle of innovation within agricultural computer vision, and will (hopefully) usher these technologies into widespread use amongst farmers.\n\nReference markers found: [182]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]182: to output search steps, such as changing the search direction or step size  7.
