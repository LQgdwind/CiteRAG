      "content": "Paper Title: A multi-stage semi-supervised improved deep embedded clustering method for bearing fault diagnosis under the situation of insufficient labeled samples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe method proposed can be directly used to solve the problem of unsupervised fault diagnosis. The clustering results of samples can be obtained through the stage 2. In this study, two experimental tasks, UnsupC1 and UnsupM1, are conducted in the CWRU and MFPT datasets to verify the fault diagnosis performance of the proposed and several advanced methods in unsupervised fault diagnosis. In the task UnsupC1, the number of unsupervised samples for each failure type is nu‚Äãn=300subscriptùëõùë¢ùëõ300n_{un}=300 and these samples are under a load of 2 hp. Besides, in the UnsupM1, the total number of the unsupervised samples is 10,808. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, some of the latest clustering algorithms are selected for comparison: k-means The k-means algorithm is a traditional shallow clustering algorithm. In this method, the original frequency-domain signal is directly clustered. AE + k-means This method combines the deep network and a traditional clustering algorithm. For fairness of comparison, the AE shares the same architecture and parameters with the proposed SCCAE. tSNE + k-means This is an unsupervised learning method that combines manifold learning and clustering. This method does not require parameter settings and directly clusters the original frequency-domain signals. AE + tSNE + k-means An auto-encoder+manifold learning+shallow clustering method combines a deep network, manifold learning and traditional clustering. For a fair comparison, the auto-encoder is the same as the skip-connection convolutional auto-encoder in the proposed method. DEC [ref]45 The DEC is a typical deep clustering method. Following the settings in the reference [ref]45, the model is set as a fully-connected multilayer perceptron(MLP) with dimensions of 512-500-500-2000-10. GAN  This method is based on deep convolutional GANs. Fault features are extracted using the GAN and then clustered by k-means. The network structure and parameters are similar to those in the reference . Local Manifold Learning of an Autoencoded Embedding (E2LMC) [ref]47 E2LMC is reported in the reference [ref]47. The network and parameters are set by following the suggestion of the reference [ref]47. Deep clustering-based method (DCM)  This network has been proposed to combine deep learning and clustering. The network structure and parameters are similar to those in the reference .\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: a deep network, manifold learning and traditional clustering.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
