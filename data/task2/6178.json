      "content": "Paper Title: Supermodular Rank: Set Function Decomposition and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe study the optimization of set functions – functions that are defined over families of subsets. The optimization of set functions is encountered in image segmentation (), clustering (),\nfeature selection (),\nand data subset selection ().\nBrute force optimization is often not viable since the individual function evaluations may be expensive and the search space has exponential size.\nTherefore, one commonly relies on optimization heuristics that work for functions with particular structure.\nA classic function structure is supermodularity, which for a function on a lattice111I.e., a poset where any two elements x,y𝑥𝑦x,y have a greatest lower bound x∧y𝑥𝑦x\\wedge y and a least upper bound x∨y𝑥𝑦x\\vee y. requires that f​(x)+f​(y)≤f​(x∧y)+f​(x∨y)𝑓𝑥𝑓𝑦𝑓𝑥𝑦𝑓𝑥𝑦f(x)+f(y)\\leq f(x\\wedge y)+f(x\\vee y). Supermodularity can be regarded as a discrete analogue of convexity.\nA function is submodular if its negative is supermodular. Submodularity is interpreted as a “diminishing returns” property.\nSub- and supermodularity can be used to obtain guarantees for greedy optimization of functions on a lattice,\nin a similar way as convexity and concavity are used\nin iterative local optimization of functions on a vector space.\nWell-known examples are the results of  for greedy maximization of a monotone submodular set function subject to cardinality constraints and those of  for arbitrary matroid constraints.\nRefinements have been obtained using gradations such as total curvature (  ). As many set functions of interest are not sub- or supermodular,\nrelaxations have been considered,\nsuch as the submodularity ratio (),\ngeneralized curvature (  [ref]9 ),\nweak submodularity ( ),\nϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-submodularity (),\nsubmodularity over subsets (),\nor bounds by submodular functions ().\nWe will discuss some of these works in more detail in Section 4. We propose a new approach to grade the space of functions on a lattice. We define the supermodular rank of a function\nto be the smallest number of terms in a decomposition into a sum of functions that are π𝜋\\pi-supermodular, where π𝜋\\pi is a partial order on the domain.\nThe partial order π𝜋\\pi differs between summands. We define the submodular rank analogously.\nWe consider multivariate functions\nwith partial orders that are products of arbitrary linear orders. We focus on set functions that are real-valued on 2[n]≅{0,1}nsuperscript2delimited-[]𝑛superscript01𝑛2^{[n]}\\cong\\{0,1\\}^{n}, with partial order defined by an order on the values {0,1}01\\{0,1\\} of each input coordinate.\nWe refine submodular rank to elementary partial orders, restricted to vary from a reference order by a transpositions in one input coordinate.\nWe optimize set functions via submodular decompositions.\nThe key insight for our optimization algorithms is that a function with elementary submodular rank r𝑟r can be split into 2rsuperscript2𝑟2^{r} submodular pieces.\nThe gradation of non-submodular pieces, via the elementary submodular rank,\nlets us obtain improved optimization guarantees. The supermodular functions are defined by linear inequalities, hence they comprise a polyhedral cone, which is called the supermodular cone.\nThese inequalities are called imset inequalities in the study of conditional independence structures and graphical models (1). They impose non-negative dependence of conditional probabilities.\nThe supermodular cone has been a subject of intensive study ( 0), especially the characterization of its extreme rays ( ), which in general remains an open problem.\nSupermodular inequalities appear in semi-algebraic description of probabilistic graphical models with latent variables, such as mixtures of product distributions ().  suggested that restricted Boltzmann machines could be described using Minkowski sums of supermodular cones (see Appendix I).\nWe obtain the inequalities defining Minkowski sums of supermodular cones, which could be of interest in the description of latent variable graphical models.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: such as total curvature (  ). As many set functions of interest are not sub- or supermodular,\nrelaxations have been considered,\nsuch as the submodularity ratio (),\ngeneralized curvature (  [ref]9 ),\nweak submodularity ( ),\nϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-submodularity (),\nsubmodularity over subsets (),\nor bounds by submodular functions ().\nWe will discuss some of these works in more detail in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
