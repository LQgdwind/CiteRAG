      "content": "Paper Title: RL-PGO: Reinforcement Learning-based Planar Pose-Graph Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConventional Pose-Graph Optimization Approaches. Popular MAP iterative solvers such as g2​osuperscriptg2o\\mathrm{g}^{2}\\mathrm{o} , Ceres , and GTSAM  can be explicitly utilized to tackle problems that can be represented as a graph using nonlinear optimization methods. Line search methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent and Gauss-Newton (GN) are typically used to perform nonlinear optimization. Given an initial guess, second order methods repeatedly linearize a nonlinear least-squares objective function and then solve the unique least-squares equations until convergence . Depending on the quality of this initial guess, there is no assurance for convergence to global optimal solutions . As the non-convexities of the problem increase, iterative methods such as Powell’s dogleg, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), and Gauss-Newton, are subject higher computational efforts required due to recurring matrix computations involved in the linearization step. This in turn, led to an increased interest in regards to direct and indirect linear solvers as well as factorization techniques to be introduced. Direct and indirect sparse linear solver methods include the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG), SuiteSparseQR , and CHOLMOD [ref]16. For larger scaled problems, bundle adjustment methods were introduced to perform at a much more accelerated rate. This is done by performing computations synchronously parallel, distributing the workload, and making use of the recent developments in hardware, i.e, IPUs. An example of this was implemented in [ref]17 and . Bootstrapping or initialization strategies were also shown to improve convergence of iterative methods. Multi Ancestor Spatial Approximation Tree for 2D and 3D pose-graph optimization  demonstrate a computationally efficient and light-weight initialization method, which when followed by a gradient-based solver, achieves good results on classical 2D and 3D pose-graph optimization datasets. In recent years, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique has been involved in exciting developments in the area of SLAM, and has also shown great significance on a variety of applications. In general, it can be applied to many non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) such as the pose SLAM and Landmark SLAM problem instances. SE-Sync  is a certifiably correct algorithm for performing synchronization over the special Euclidean group. Leveraging duality to devise an algorithm was also shown to enable global verification of a given estimate . The sparse bounded degree sum-of-squares (Sparse-BSOS) optimization method , formulate SLAM problems as polynomial optimization programs and demonstrate the ability to achieve global minimum solutions without initialization. A deep learning approach for pose-graph global optimality classification was also recently proposed in . Learning-Based Optimization Approaches. There has been a recent surge of interest on incorporating deep neural networks into state estimation and SLAM pipelines.\nOthers have approached alternative solutions which are learned variations of the traditional approaches. LS-Net [ref]23 introduced the first approach to a learned optimizer for minimizing photometric residuals. Several learning-based methods involve reparametrization to allow for gradient back propagation and end-to-end learning. An example of this was illustrated in  and , which involved a reparametrization of the damping mechanism to enable differentiability in Levenberg-Marquardt solvers. Recent line of works, present an end-to-end approach for learning estimators modeled as factor-graph smoothers for state estimation applications. A surrogate loss was proposed in  for end-to-end training of smoothing-based estimators, and was evaluated on Visual Tracking, and Visual Odometry tasks. Graph Neural Networks. There has also been a plethora of works involving Graph Neural Networks for multiple rotation averaging (MRA). NeuRoRA  were the first to apply a graph neural network to regress the rotations in a view graph. The model consisted of a cleaning network which was responsible for mitigating outlier measurements, followed by an additional network used for fine tuning and regressing the absolute rotations given the measurements. Using a single Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) with edge attention,  further improved the robustness, training time, and execution speed of the previous deep learning model and eliminated the requirement for an additional network. Recently, PoGO-Net  introduce a novel joint loss MRA formulation which was shown to outperform state-of-the-art and operate in real-time. Reinforcement Learning.\nAll the aforementioned learning techniques either require ground truth labels or apply techniques to enable differentiability for end-to-end training.\nReinforcement learning revolves around the concept of learning from interaction 0. It is different from the supervised and unsupervised machine learning paradigms in that it does not have an external supervisor to pair situations with labeled actions and does not try to propose a valid structure hidden in unlabelled situations. Instead, RL mainly focuses on maximizing a reward signal through interactions between the agent and an environment. It is essentially based on associating transitional experiences to actions in such a manner that would maximize a reward signal, and is used in several applications, e.g. healthcare 1, robotics 2, finance 3, and many more 4.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: linear solvers as well as factorization techniques to be introduced.
