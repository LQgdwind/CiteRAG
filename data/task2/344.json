      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe aim of this section is to investigate the performance and versatility of the proposed curriculum reinforcement learning algorithm (SPDL). To accomplish this, we evaluate SPDL in three different environments with different DRL algorithms to test the proposition that the learning scheme benefits the performance of various RL algorithms. We evaluate the performance using TRPO , PPO [ref]17 and SAC . For all DRL algorithms, we use the implementations provided in the Stable Baselines library . 111Code for running the experiments can be found at https://github.com/psclklnk/spdl The first two environments aim at investigating the benefit of SPDL when the purpose of the generated curriculum is solely to facilitate the learning of a hard target task, which the agent is not able to solve without a curriculum. For this purpose, we create two environments that are conceptually similar to the point mass experiment considered by SPRL . The first one is a copy of the original experiment, but with an additional parameter to the context space, as we will detail in the corresponding section. The second environment extends the original experiment by replacing the point mass with a torque-controlled quadruped ‘ant’. This increases the complexity of the underlying control problem, requiring the capacity of deep neural network function approximators used in DRL algorithms. The final environment is a robotic ball-catching environment. This environment constitutes a shift in curriculum paradigm as well as reward function. Instead of guiding learning towards a specific target task, this third environment requires to learn a ball-catching policy over a wide range of initial states (ball position and velocity). The reward function is sparse compared to the dense ones employed in the first two environments. To judge the performance of SPDL, we compare the obtained results to state-of-the-art CRL algorithms ALP-GMM [ref]27, which is based on the concept of Intrinsic Motivation, GoalGAN , which relies on the notion of a success indicator to define a curriculum, and SPRL , the episodic counterpart of our algorithm. Furthermore, we compare to curricula consisting of tasks uniformly sampled from the context space (referred to as ‘Random’ in the plots) and learning without a curriculum (referred to as ‘Default’). Additional details on the experiments as well as qualitative evaluations of them can be found in Appendix B.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: different environments with different DRL algorithms to test the proposition that the learning scheme benefits the performance of various RL algorithms.
