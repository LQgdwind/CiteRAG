Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

DOI:000000/11111.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper joins an existing literature examining the role that compute may play in the governance of AI.\nEarly work by Hwang  highlighted the potential of computing power to shape the social impact of ML.\nConcurrent work by Sastry et al.  identifies attributes of compute that make it a uniquely useful lever for governance, and provides an overview of policy options.\nClosely-related work by Baker  draws lessons from nuclear arms control for the compute-based verification of international agreements on large-scale ML. Rather than focusing on specific policies, the work proposes a technical platform for verifying many possible regulations and agreements on ML development.\nAlready, the EU AI Act has proposed establishing risk-based regulations on AI products , while US senators have proposed an “Algorithmic Accountability Act” to oversee algorithms used in critical decisions , and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has established an “algorithm registry” for overseeing recommender systems 3.\nInternationally, many previous works have discussed the general feasibility and desirability of AI arms control 7 [ref]12 , with  highlighting the importance of verification measures to the success of potential AI arms control regimes.\nPast work has also explored the benefits of international coordination on non-military AI regulation [ref]13. The proposed solution involves proving that a rule-violating ML training run was not done, in part by proving which other training runs were done.\nThe analysis of the latter problem is heavily inspired by the literature on Proof-of-Learning [ref]24  (discussed further in Section 5).\nOther works has have used tools from cryptography to train NN models securely across multiple parties , and to securely prove the correctness of NN inference .\nHowever, these approaches suffer large efficiency penalties and cannot yet be scaled to cutting-edge model training, rendering them nonviable as a method for verifying rules on large-scale training runs.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: (CAC) has established an “algorithm registry” for overseeing recommender systems 3.\nInternationally, many previous works have discussed the general feasibility and desirability of AI arms control 7 [ref]12 , with  highlighting the importance of verification measures to the success of potential AI arms control regimes.\nPast work has also explored the benefits of international coordination on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
