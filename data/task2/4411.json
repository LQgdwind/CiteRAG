      "content": "Paper Title: Scene Recognition with Objectness, Attribute and Category Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe use of complementary information such as attributes has been proposed in several computer vision tasks including pedestrian recognition [ref]30 , action recognition  , image recognition  , and scene recognition  [ref]37. In pedestrian recognition, Lin et al.[ref]30 proposed a multi-task network which learns an identity embedding and at the same time predicts pedestrian attributes. Tay et al. also proposed an Attribute Attention Network (AANet) that integrates person attributes and attribute attention maps into a unified framework.\nThe effectiveness of attributes has also been studied in action recognition. In particular, Rueda et al. introduced a search for attributes that represents signal segments for recognizing human activities while Yao et al. combined attributes and parts. Here, the attributes are represented as verbs describing human actions, and parts are composed of objects related to the actions. Recently, Roy et al. used local spatio-temporal features to capture the action attributes in a Guassian mixture model. In image recognition, basic attributes such as texture, shape and color have been extensively investigated in early works  . In particular, Ferrari et al. showed for the first time that attributes can be learned for object recognition through weakly supervised learning and trained a set of classifiers to predict the existence of human-labeled attributes in the data. Both Lampert et al. and Xian et al. proposed transfer learning and zero-shot learning approaches respectively on the Animals with Attributes datasets (AwA and AwA2)  . The two datasets contain 505050 classes and 858585 attributes with no image overlap. In scene recognition, there exists only few works about attributes. For instance, Oliva et al. proposed a small-scale scene dataset with 888 attributes describing the spatial structure of a scene (e.g., naturalness, openness, roughness etc.) and Wang et al. created an outdoor scene dataset with 474747 attributes. In addition, Patterson et al.[ref]37 introduced a subset of the SUN dataset  containing 14,3401434014,340 images annotated with 102102102 attributes and used the attributes as mid-level semantic information for scene recognition. Recently, Zeng et al. proposed to aggregate more complementary visual features of the scene using features from the Attribute-ImageNet  and the Places [ref]2 datasets. In contrast to existing methods using attributes in general     , and scene attributes in particular  [ref]37, we do not manually annotate the attributes and we do not directly learn a weight for each attribute to control the attributeâ€™s impact, but we leverage object detected score information contained in the attributes. By so doing, the model could use more of its parameters for learning to compensate in failure cases.\nMoreover, we go beyond the simple use of objects in scene recognition and propose to utilize existing object-centric datasets to bridge the gap between object recognition and scene recognition.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: The use of complementary information such as attributes has been proposed in several computer vision tasks including pedestrian recognition [ref]30 , action recognition  , image recognition  , and scene recognition  [ref]37.
