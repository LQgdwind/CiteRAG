      "content": "Paper Title: Interpretability of Machine Learning Methods Applied to Neuroimaging\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModular transparency has often been used in brain imaging analysis. A possible practice consists in first generating a target probability map of a black-box model, before feeding this map to a classifier to generate a final prediction, as done in [ref]46 [ref]43. Qiu et al.¬†[ref]46 used a convolutional network to generate an attribution map from patches of the brain, highlighting brain regions associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease diagnosis (see Figure¬†23). Lee et al.¬†[ref]43 first parcellated gray matter density maps into 93 regions. For each of these regions, several deep neural networks were trained on randomly selected voxels and their outputs were averaged to obtain a mean regional disease probability. Then, by concatenating these regional probabilities, they generated a region-wise disease probability map of the brain, which was further used to perform Alzheimer‚Äôs disease detection. The approach of Ba et al.¬†[ref]24 was also applied to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease detection¬† (preprint). Though that work is still a preprint, the idea is interesting as it aims at reproducing the way a radiologist looks at an MR image. The main difference with [ref]24 is the initialization, as the context network does not take as input the whole image but clinical data of the participant. Then the framework browses the image in the same way as in the original paper: a patch is processed by a recurrent neural network and from its internal state the glimpse network learns which patch should be looked at next. After a fixed number of iterations, the internal state of the recurrent neural network is processed by a classification network that gives the final outcome. The whole system is interpretable as the trajectory of the locations (illustrated in Figure¬†24) processed by the framework allows understanding which regions are more important for the diagnosis. However this framework may have a high dependency to clinical data: as the initialization depends on scores used to diagnose Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, the classification network may learn to classify based on the initialization only and most of the trajectory may be negligible to assess the correct label. Another framework, the DaniNet, proposed by Ravi et al.¬†, is composed of multiple networks, each with a defined function, as illustrated in Figure¬†25. The conditional deep autoencoder (in orange) learns to reduce the size of the slice xùë•x to a latent variable ZùëçZ (encoder part), and then to reconstruct the original image based on ZùëçZ and two additional variables: the diagnosis and age (generator part). Its performance is evaluated thanks to the reconstruction loss Lr‚Äãe‚ÄãcsuperscriptùêøùëüùëíùëêL^{rec}. Discriminator networks (in yellow) either force the encoder to take temporal progression into account (Dzsubscriptùê∑ùëßD_{z}) or try to determine if the output of the generator are real or generated images (Dbsubscriptùê∑ùëèD_{b}). Biological constraints (in grey) force the previous generated image of the same participant to be less atrophied than the next one (voxel loss) and learn to find the diagnosis thanks to regions of the generated images (regional loss). Profile weight functions (in blue) aim at funding appropriate weights for each loss to compute the total loss. The assembly of all these components allows learning a longitudinal model that characterizes the progression of the atrophy of each region of the brain. This atrophy evolution can then be visualized thanks to a neurodegeneration simulation generated by the trained model by sampling missing intermediate values.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: imaging analysis.
