      "content": "Paper Title: Bandit-Driven Batch Selection for Robust Learning under Label Noise\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCL\n and its variants like Self-Paced Learning (SPL)\n and Hard-Example Mining (HEM)\n [ref]19 provide frameworks for adaptive\ninstance, batch, or task selection based on difficulty or importance. Despite the efficacy of these\nstrategies in enhancing stability and convergence, a universal solution remains\nelusive, prompting exploration into varied strategies, new importance metrics,\nand advanced re-weighting and sampling techniques. Re-weighting the model’s loss by instance, akin to importance-sampling techniques, has been investigated by  [ref]19 .\nThese studies have indicated that re-weighting can stabilize gradient estimates and reduce bias in the original objective function. However, both Loshchilov and Hutter [ref]19 and Chang et al.  have argued that the impact of this strategy on performance is limited, and that comparable or superior results can be achieved by sampling from a weight-induced distribution. Matiisen et al. [ref]20 compared the sample selection strategies, ε𝜀\\varepsilon-greedy, Boltzmann, and Thompson sampling, and concluded that the optimal strategy hinges heavily on the sample weight metric. A novel metric not tied to difficulty was introduced by Chang et al. , emphasizing samples with high prediction uncertainty, and inspired by active learning.\nThe authors demonstrated that, by avoiding overly easy or hard instances, their strategy surpassed SPL or HEM on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR with and without label noise. Song et al. [ref]27 introduced Recency Bias to boost SGD’s convergence by combining principles of [ref]19 and . The technique centers on prediction uncertainty, measured by predicted label entropy, as its adaptive sample selection metric. It uses a Boltzmann distribution with energy based on prediction uncertainty and a pressure parameter. Leveraging a sliding window, it emphasizes recent scores, mitigating overfitting and slow convergence. Importantly, Active Bias, Recency Bias, and our approach add minimal computational load to model training. Automated curriculum learning (ACL) distinguishes itself among CL approaches\nby the degree of control over the learning process. In ACL, the selection\nof tasks is determined dynamically using an algorithm, typically\nan RL or a bandit method. Graves et al.  and Matiisen et al. [ref]20\nhave proposed utilizing a non-stationary bandit (Exp3). They demonstrated\nthat when an agent lacks prior knowledge of its tasks, ACL can significantly\nboost training efficiency relative to uniform sampling. Moreover, a bandit algorithm can discover\ncomplex orderings and opportunities for efficient knowledge transfer in an unsorted curriculum.\nAlthough prior literature has focused primarily on task-based ACL, the same principles can be utilized in instance and batch selection. This paper\naims to build upon the mentioned foundational CL techniques by introducing efficient batch\nselection methods, particularly in the context of learning with noisy labels.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: CL\n and its variants like Self-Paced Learning (SPL)\n and Hard-Example Mining (HEM)\n [ref]19 provide frameworks for adaptive\ninstance, batch, or task selection based on difficulty or importance.
