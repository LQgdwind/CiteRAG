To tackle this problem, agents have to fully comprehend the temporal structure of videos. Jang et al. [ref]39 encode appearance feature and motion feature with ResNet  and C3D  respectively, then design a spatial and temporal attention mechanism to select different regions during multi-step reasoning. Later, with the success of Dynamic Memory Network  in ImageQA, some work [ref]13  applies memory-based network to VideoQA tasks. Xu et al. [ref]13 propose an Attention Memory Unit (AMU), which gradually refines its attention over the appearance and motion features by using question as guidance. Considering that motion and appearance features are correlated in the reasoning process, Gao et al.  propose a motion-appearance co-memory network and use a temporal convolutional and deconvolutional neural network to generate multi-level contextual facts. However, their methods do not consider the relations between different objects. Relation information is obviously an important clue in the reasoning process. Le et al. [ref]15 propose a Conditional Relation Network (CRN) to model the relations between visual objects, and stack CRNs to perform multi-step relational reasoning. However, the limitation of relation network-based methods is that they can only process a limited number of objects at a time. Therefore, graph neural network comes into researchers’ sight. Huang et al.  point out that previous work neglects the interactions among objects in each frame and design a location-aware graph convolutional network to learn a relation-enhanced visual feature encoder. Jiang et al.  propose an undirected heterogeneous graph with each video snippet and question word as node to integrate correlations of both inter- and intra-modality in an uniform module. In these graph-based methods, all the objects, even those irrelevant to the question, are engaged into graph construction without discrimination, which could bring lots of uninformative noises into relational reasoning.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: VideoQA is more challenging as videos contain much more complex patterns than a single image.
