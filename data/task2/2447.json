      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n: Removing the most important features identified by an attribution method and recording its effect on the performance of the network may provide an objective approach to evaluate various attribution methods [ref]27. A good attribution method will identify the most important pixels, which when removed should maximally degrade the network performance. The metric is referred to as the Most Relevant First (MoRF). As the network input size is fixed, the removed pixels are replaced with either the average value (calculated over the input dataset), zero (i.e., black pixel), or random values . It is obvious that replacing pixels with an average value or black pixels can introduce high-frequency edges, which may degrade network performance - unrelated to the removal of important pixels [ref]28. We may choose to remove the least important pixels first - thus partially decoupling the effects of artifacts introduced by high-frequency edges from those caused by removing important pixels. The metric is referred to as the Least Relevant First (LeRF) [ref]28. A recent study by Tomsett et al. evaluated the reliability of both MoRF and LeRF using four different statistical tests from the psychometric literature . These tests included inter-rater reliability, inter-method reliability, internal consistency reliability, and test-retest reliability, where each image corresponded to a different rater and methods included different attribution map generation techniques. Both MoRF and LeRF showed: (1) high variance across all tested images, (2) sensitivity to whether the removed pixels were replaced with the mean of the dataset or random values, (3) low inter-rater reliability, i.e., the rankings of different methods were highly inconsistent, and (4) low correlation with each other. The results were reported for the classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The absence of ground truth explainability and the limited testing (using one dataset only) makes it hard to generalize these results to other metrics. However, the study raised important questions about the validity of different metrics that are extensively used in the explainability literature.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: the most important features identified by an attribution method and recording its effect on the performance of the network may provide an objective approach to evaluate various attribution methods [ref]27. A good attribution method will identify the most important pixels, which when removed should maximally degrade the network performance. The metric is referred to as the Most Relevant First\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
