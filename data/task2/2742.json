      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithmic Information Design in Multi-Player Games: Possibility and Limits in Singleton Congestion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe adopt the perspective of an informationally advantaged social planner (the sender) looking to design signaling scheme to minimize the social cost in SCGs. Our main results are a complete characterization about the algorithmics of the sender’s optimization problem. Specifically, when there are constant number of resources, we show that both the optimal public and private signaling can be computed in polynomial time.\nNotably, in hindsight, the case of small number of resources does not at all imply that the information design problem may be easy. As mentioned previously, even in the case with binary receiver actions and no agent externalities, the space is already rifle with hardness results for both public and private signaling as shown by Babichenko and Barman [ref]6, Dughmi and Xu . We will elaborate\nnext why agent externality makes optimal signaling even harder. Indeed, recent work by Yang et al.  studies similar resource competition problems in singleton congestion games like us. However, their polynomial-time algorithms for public and private information are devised under very restrictive assumptions that there are only two resources and moreover, one of the resources has to be a trivial one with constant utility 00. Our results strictly generalize the algorithms by Yang et al. . When there are many resources, our results are negative; we show that even in symmetric SCGs, (1) it is NP-hard to design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for optimal public signaling in a very strong sense which we detail next; (2) the separation oracle for the dual problem of the optimal private signaling scheme is NP-hard even in symmetric SCGs with affine cost functions. An intriguing conjecture. An open problem left from our results is the complexity of the original problem of optimal private signaling. When there is only a single state of nature, this problem degenerates to computing the optimal correlated equilibrium of a singleton congestion game, which surprisingly is still an open question to date as well. This open question is particularly intriguing for the special case of symmetric SCGs with affine cost functions, because both the socially-optimal coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) and the socially-optimal Nash equilibrium of an SCG were shown to admit a polynomial time algorithm by Castiglioni et al.  and Ieong et al. , respectively. However, our negative result for the separation oracle of the corresponding optimal correlated equilibrium seems to suggest the conjecture of the hardness of optimal CE. If this conjecture was true, such situation of intractable CE yet tractable NE and CCE is a very rare phenomenon — to the best of our knowledge, there is no class of games with such complexity property that are known so far. Next we elaborate on the key challenges in proving the above results and our techniques to address them. The first intrinsic challenge is the issue of equilibrium selection during the design of the optimal public signaling scheme. The SCG is known to admit multiple Nash equilibria. Then a key question is, given any public signal which induces an expected SCG games among agents, which NE we should posit the agents to play. Previous studies of public signaling all bypassed this issue by either assuming no agent externality or considering the situation with a unique Nash equilibrium (e.g., zero-sum games  and non-atomic routing [ref]12). Consequently their techniques cannot be easily adapted to many other situations in which equilibria are not unique or do not admit an obvious selection rule. In this paper, we for the first time directly tackle this issues and develop algorithmics based on the nature of the results, as follows: On one hand, for positive result of efficient algorithms, it is necessary to adopt certain equilibrium selection rule since it is challenging (if not impossible) to design an efficient algorithm that works under arbitrary equilibrium selection (SCG may have exponentially many equilibria ). Therefore, our algorithm follows the convention of the information design literature    and adopts the optimistic equilibrium, i.e., the socially-optimal NE. On the other hand, in order to prove convincing negative result of computational hardness, equilibrium selection issue becomes much trickier to handle. Even we proved the hardness of optimal signaling under certain equilibrium selection, it does not imply the hardness under a slightly altered equilibrium selection rule. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel notion of equilibrium-oblivious inapproximability. Intuitively, we say that optimal public signaling is equilibrium-obliviously α𝛼\\alpha-inapproximable if there is no α𝛼\\alpha-approximate algorithm regardless of which NE one adopts in any signaling scheme. Such an inapproximability result completely rules out any possibility of designing a good public signaling scheme, irrespective of the equilibrium selection. We believe this novel concept of equilibrium-oblivious intractability may be of independent interest for future works to bypass the equilibrium-selection issues in hardness proofs, and our result illustrates the possibility of achieving this goal. The second key challenge is the issue of exponential dependence of the private signaling scheme on the number of agents. Notably, this is also the central challenge in the computation of an optimal correlated equilibrium, which is well-known to be notoriously challenging and is NP-hard in many classes of succinct games such as general congestion games, facility location games and scheduling games . However, optimal private signaling is arguably even more difficult since it contains the optimal correlated equilibrium as a strict special case, when\nthere is only a single state of nature.\nLike previous works by Mansour et al. , Dughmi and Xu , Celli et al. , we adopt the solution concept of Bayes correlated equilibrium due to Bergemann and Morris , which characterizes signaling as obedient action recommendation for each receiver. Due to the exponential blowup in the total number of possible action profiles, this gives rise to a linear optimization problem with exponentially many variables. The agent externality makes it crucial to characterize each agent’s posterior beliefs about other agents since an agent’s utility here depends on other agents’ beliefs as well as their actions. Notably, this complication is absent in previous private signaling setting with no inter-agent externality  [ref]6 , which makes the design problem there significantly easier. To overcome this challenge, we employ the idea of “reduced form” from mechanism design    to characterize each agent’s marginal belief about other agents’ actions. We characterize the feasibility constraints of the reduced forms. En route, we also develop an efficient algorithm to sample the optimal private signaling scheme on the fly, which strictly generalizes a classic sampling technique by Tillé  in the statistics literature, and may be of independent interest. To our knowledge, this is the first time that reduced form is used for information design with many interacting receivers. In the main body, we illustrates the similarities and differences between the reduced form for information design and that for auction design. We hope this discussion could spur more applications of reduced form to information design.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: even in the case with binary receiver actions and no agent externalities, the space is already rifle with hardness results for both public and private signaling as shown by Babichenko and Barman [ref]6, Dughmi and Xu .
