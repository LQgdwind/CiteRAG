      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-Based Cross Attention for Bayesian Context Update in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion models (DMs) have made significant advances in controllable multi-modal generation tasks [ref]37, including text-to-image synthesis. The recent success of text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion [ref]31, Imagen [ref]33, etc., is mainly attributed to the combination of high-fidelity DMs with high-performance large language models (LMs). Although text-to-image DMs have shown revolutionary progress, recent studies have shown that the current state-of-the-art models often suffer from semantic misalignment problems, where the generated images do not accurately represent the intended semantic contents of the text prompts. For example,  discovered the catastrophic neglect problem, where one or more of the concepts of the prompt are neglected in generated images. Moreover, for a multi-modal inpainting task with text and mask guidance, 1 found that the text-to-image DMs may often fail to fill in the masked region precisely following the text prompt. Therefore, this work focuses on obtaining a harmonized pair of latent image representations and text embeddings, i.e., context vectors, to generate semantically aligned images. In order to mitigate the misalignment, instead of leveraging fixed context vectors, we aim to establish an adaptive context by modeling the posterior of the context, i.e. p​(context∣representations)𝑝conditionalcontextrepresentationsp(\\text{context}\\mid\\text{representations}). Note that this is a significant departure from the previous methods which only model p​(representations∣context)𝑝conditionalrepresentationscontextp(\\text{representations}\\mid\\text{context}) with frozen context vectors encoded by the pretrained textual encoder. Specifically, we introduce a novel energy-based Bayesian framework, namely energy-based cross-attention (EBCA), which approximates maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimates of context vectors given observed latent representations. Specifically, to model p​(context∣representations)𝑝conditionalcontextrepresentationsp(\\text{context}\\mid\\text{representations}), we first consider analogous p​(Kl|Qt,l)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐾𝑙subscript𝑄𝑡𝑙p(K_{l}|Q_{t,l}) in the latent space of the intermediate cross-attention layer of a denoising auto-encoder, i.e., cross-attention space. Here, Klsubscript𝐾𝑙K_{l} and Qt,lsubscript𝑄𝑡𝑙Q_{t,l} correspond to the key and query in l𝑙l-th layer at time t𝑡t that encode\nthe context from the text and the image representation, respectively.\nInspired by the energy-based perspective of attention mechanism , we then formulate energy functions E​(Kl;Qt,l)𝐸subscript𝐾𝑙subscript𝑄𝑡𝑙E(K_{l};Q_{t,l}) in each cross-attention space to model the posterior. Finally, we create a correspondence between the context and representation by minimizing these parameterized energy functions.\nMore specifically, by obtaining the gradient of the log posterior of context vectors, a nested hierarchy of energy functions can be implicitly minimized by cascading the updated contexts to the subsequent cross-attention layer (Figure 2) . Moreover, our energy-based perspective of cross-attention also allows zero-shot compositional generation due to the inherent compositionality of Energy-Based Models (EBMs). This involves the convenient integration of multiple distributions, each defined by the energy function of a specific text embedding.\nIn practical terms, this amalgamation can be executed as a straightforward linear combination of cross-attention outputs that correspond to all selected editing prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EBM framework in various text-to-image generative scenarios, including multi-concept generation, text-guided inpainting, and compositional generation. The proposed method is training-free, easy to implement, and can potentially be integrated into most of the existing text-to-image DMs.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Diffusion models (DMs) have made significant advances in controllable multi-modal generation tasks [ref]37, including text-to-image synthesis.
