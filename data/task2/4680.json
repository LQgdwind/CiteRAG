Bilevel Optimization Made Easy: A Simple First-Order Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section provides a brief background on traditional BO methods. Please see Bard [ref]2, Dempe and Zemkoho , Dempe  for overviews, and\nLiu et al. [ref]32 for a survey on recent ML applications. Hypergradient Descent\nAssume that the minimum of g​(v,⋅)𝑔𝑣⋅g(v,\\cdot) is unique for all v𝑣v\nso that we can write θ∗​(v)=arg​minθ⁡g​(v,θ)superscript𝜃𝑣subscriptargmin𝜃𝑔𝑣𝜃\\theta^{*}(v)=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{\\theta}g(v,\\theta) as a function of v𝑣v;\nthis is known as the low-level singleton (LLS) assumption.\nThe most straightforward approach to solving (1) is to conduct gradient descent on f​(v,θ∗​(v))𝑓𝑣superscript𝜃𝑣f(v,\\theta^{*}(v)) as a function of v𝑣v.\nNote that The difficulty is to compute ∇vθ∗​(v)subscript∇𝑣superscript𝜃𝑣{\\color[rgb]{0.59,0,0.66}\\nabla_{v}\\theta^{*}(v)}. From implicit function theorem, it satisfies a linear equation: If ∇2,2gsubscript∇22𝑔\\nabla_{2,2}g is invertible, we can solve for ∇vθ∗​(v)subscript∇𝑣superscript𝜃𝑣{\\color[rgb]{0.59,0,0.66}\\nabla_{v}\\theta^{*}(v)} and\nobtain a gradient update rule on v𝑣v: where k𝑘k denotes iteration, ∇1fk=∇1f​(vk,θ∗​(vk))subscript∇1subscript𝑓𝑘subscript∇1𝑓subscript𝑣𝑘superscript𝜃subscript𝑣𝑘\\nabla_{1}f_{k}=\\nabla_{1}f(v_{k},\\theta^{*}(v_{k}))\nand similarly for the other terms.\nThis approach is sometimes known as\nthe hypergradient descent. However, hypergradient descent is computationally expensive: Besides requiring evaluation of the inner optimum θ∗​(vk)superscript𝜃subscript𝑣𝑘\\theta^{*}(v_{k}),\nthe main computational bottleneck is to solve the linear equation in (2).\nMethods have been developed that approximate (2) using conjugate gradient   , Neumann series  , and related variants .\nAnother popular approximation approach is to replace ∇vθ∗​(v)subscript∇𝑣superscript𝜃𝑣\\nabla_{v}\\theta^{*}(v) with ∇vθ(T)​(v)subscript∇𝑣superscript𝜃𝑇𝑣\\nabla_{v}\\theta^{(T)}(v), where θ(T)​(v)superscript𝜃𝑇𝑣\\theta^{(T)}(v) denotes the T𝑇T-th iteration of gradient descent or other optimization steps on g​(v,θ)𝑔𝑣𝜃g(v,\\theta) w.r.t. θ𝜃\\theta starting from certain initialization.\nThe gradient ∇vθ(T)​(v)subscript∇𝑣superscript𝜃𝑇𝑣\\nabla_{v}\\theta^{(T)}(v) can be calculated with\nauto-differentiation (AD) with either\nforward mode 1, backward mode  1    or their variants . While these approaches claim to be first-order, they require many Hessian-vector or Jacobian-vector products at each iteration and are slow for large problems. Other examples of approximation methods include a\nneural surrogate method which approximates θ∗​(v)superscript𝜃𝑣\\theta^{*}(v) and its gradient ∇vθ∗​(v)subscript∇𝑣superscript𝜃𝑣\\nabla_{v}\\theta^{*}(v) with neural networks  and\nNewton-Gaussian approximation of the Hessian matrix with covariance of gradient 5.\nBoth approaches\nintroduce non-vanishing approximation error that is difficult to control.\nThe neural surrogate method also suffers from high training cost for the neural network. Stationary-Seeking Methods.\nAn alternative method is to replace the argmin constraint in (1)\nwith the stationarity condition ∇θg​(v,θ)=0,subscript∇𝜃𝑔𝑣𝜃0\\nabla_{\\theta}g(v,\\theta)=0, yielding a constrained optimization: Algorithms for nonlinear equality constrained optimization can then be applied .\nThe constraint in (3) guarantees only that θ𝜃\\theta is a stationary point of g​(v,⋅)𝑔𝑣⋅g(v,\\cdot), so it\nis equivalent to (1)\nonly when g𝑔g is convex w.r.t. θ𝜃\\theta.\nOtherwise, the solution of (3) can be a maximum or saddle point of g𝑔g. This\nmakes it problematic for deep learning, where non-convex functions are pervasive.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: This section provides a brief background on traditional BO methods.
