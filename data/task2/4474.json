Classification-based methods derive OOD scores based on the output of DNNs, as shown in Fig. 1(a).\nMaximum Softmax Probability (MSP) [ref]16 simply uses the maximum softmax probability as the indicator of In-D data.\nODIN[ref]27 is applies a temperature scaling to the softmax value for OOD detection.\nFollow-up works include methods based on the output of DNNs    , the gradient of DNNs  and data generation or augmentation .\nAlthough simple to implement, most of them alter the training process of the original classifier, thereby reducing the classification accuracy for In-D samples. Density-based methods usually apply some probabilistic models for the distribution of In-D samples and regard test data in low-density regions as OOD   , as shown in Fig. 1(c).\nSome methods in this category also resort to generative models 6 to learn the distribution of data.\nHowever, recent research found that the learned density model may assign high likelihood value to some OODs, since the obtained likelihood could be dominated by low-level features such as location and variance instead of the high-level semantics, which is related to the specific network architecture and data used for learning 1 . Distance-based methods consider that OODs should be relatively far away from In-Ds. They either calculate the centroids of In-D classes in the feature space   (Fig. 1(b)) or reconstruct the input itself (Section. 2.2, Fig. 1(i)) for OOD detection.\nHowever, for high-level semantic features, their assumption for distance disparity may not hold, and high reconstruction quality cannot ensure In-Ds.\nIn this paper, we use conditional synthesis on masked images to highlight the semantics difference in the image space.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: In general, OOD detection methods can be categorized into: classification-based, density-based and distance-based methods [ref]46.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
