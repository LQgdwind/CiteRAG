      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Neural-Operator Backstepping Control of a Benchmark Hyperbolic PDE\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn a series of breakthrough innovations in the mathematics of machine learning , [ref]17, , universal operator approximation theorems have been developed which demonstrate that neural networks can effectively approximate mappings across function spaces. Naturally, the control community then capitalized on these results to approximate the kernel operator in PDE Backstepping. The first study in this direction was conducted for a 1D transport PDE in , and then later extended to both a reaction-diffusion PDE and observers in . In both works, the stability of the PDE under the approximated kernel is rigorously proved by employing the universal operator approximation theorem . Following , , there have been a series of extensions where ,  developed similar results for hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs with delays. Paper  then tackles the first application of NO approximations controlling the Aw-Rascale-Zhang(ARZ) PDE consisting of a set of second-order coupled hyperbolic PDEs describing traffic flows. Furthermore,  then considers NOs for a more general form of 2×2222\\times 2 hyperbolic PDEs with applications to oil drilling and shallow water wave modeling. Lastly,  employs neural operators for gain-scheduling of hyperbolic PDEs with nonlinear recirculation — the first of such work where the kernel is recomputed at every timestep thus enabling real-time control of nonlinear PDEs.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: In a series of breakthrough innovations in the mathematics of machine learning , [ref]17, , universal operator approximation theorems have been developed which demonstrate that neural networks can effectively approximate mappings across function spaces.
