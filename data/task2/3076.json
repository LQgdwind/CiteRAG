GNN is firstly introduced in , which proposes a spectral-based method extending convolution networks to graphs. Then, a series of subsequent spectral-based convolution GNNs has been introduced [ref]19 , which adopts filters in light of graph signal processing [ref]21. Notably, bridging the gap between spectral-based and spatial-based GNN methods, GCN [ref]1 simplifies graph convolutions by approximating spectral-based graph convolutions with stacked first-order Chebyshev polynomial filters. After that, spatial-based approaches grow promptly because of their advantages of efficiency and general applicability, e.g., GAT  incorporates the attention mechanism  to consider the difference of importance among node neighbors rather than simply averaging neighbors information. SGC  reduces the excess complexity of GCN via removing non-linearity and collapsing weight matrices between graph convolution layers. Except for SGC, many studies are aiming to improve GNN from different perspectives such as scalability extension  , and receptive field enlargement    . Existing GNN approaches have been successfully applied in various domains, e.g., bankruptcy prediction , knowledge graph   and traffic prediction . Though there are many off-the-shelf GNNs available, many of them rely extensively on labeling information, which are unable to deal with unlabeled graphs. However, unlabeled graphs are pervasive in the real world. To tackle this problem, we proposed G-Zoom, which utilizes an adjusted-zooming-based contrastive learning scheme to generate effective node embeddings without the guidance of node labels. In G-Zoom, we select GCN as the kernel of our GNN encoder component. Except for GCN, the encoder component of G-Zoom can be underpinned by any aforementioned GNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: data.
