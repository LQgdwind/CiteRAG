      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Vision-based Robotics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe objective of this work is to benchmark a few deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, namely, soft actor critic (SAC)\n, proximal policy optimization (PPO)\n[ref]43, interpolated policy gradients (IPG)\n5 and hindsight experience replay (HER)\n on two vision-based robotics problem.\nThe data intensive nature of reinforcement learning necessitates use\nof simulated environments for training models. Two PyBullet\n[ref]37 environments namely KukaDiverseObjectEnv and\nRacecarZEDGymEnv are used for implementing different RL\nalgorithms. In the first environment, a Kuka robotic arm is used to\ngrasp different kinds of objects from a bin. The environment gives a\nreward of 1 when one of the objects is picked up beyond a pre-defined\nheight. The maximum reward for a given episode is 1 for the kuka\nenvironment. The second environment consists of a robotic car in a\nstadium and it is expected to reach a given target ball location by\ngenerating linear and angular velocities. The agent receives a\nfloating point reward for each step in the episode. The input\nobservation for both environments is available in the form of RGB\nimages and the system accepts continuous floating point values as\nactions. A snapshot of the environment rendering and corresponding\nvariables are shown in Figure 1. These two\nenvironments are selected as they are freely available and fall within\nthe scope of vision-based robotics which is the focus of this work.\nOur algorithms work equally well with other environments such as\nFetchReach from Mujoco . However, the results\nhave not been included in this study because of two reasons - first,\nthey are proprietary and require purchasing license for long-term use\nand secondly, image observations are not available for this\nenvironment.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: The objective of this work is to benchmark a few deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, namely, soft actor critic (SAC)\n, proximal policy optimization (PPO)\n[ref]43, interpolated policy gradients (IPG)\n5 and hindsight experience replay (HER)\n on two vision-based robotics problem.\nThe data intensive nature of reinforcement learning necessitates use\nof\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
