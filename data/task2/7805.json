      "content": "Paper Title: Finite-valued Streaming String Transducers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe prove that the characterization of ”finite valuedness”\nin terms of absence of ”simply divergent” ”W-patterns”\n(Theorem 9) is effective,\nand yields a PSpace decision procedure.\nWe also prove that the ”equivalence problem” for ”deterministic” ”SSTs”,\nknown to be in PSpace, is polynomially reducible to the\n”finite valuedness” problem. Despite recent efforts by the community\nto better understand the complexity of the ”equivalence problem”,\nit is unknown whether the PSpace upper bound for ”equivalence”\n(and hence for ”finite valuedness”) can be improved, as no non-trivial\nlower bound is known.\nOn the other hand, ”equivalence” (as well as ”finite valuedness”)\nturns out to be in PTime when the number of variables is\nfixed [ref]5. The effectiveness procedure uses the following complexity result on the\ncomposition of deterministic ”SSTs”, which is of independent interest.\nIt is known\nthat deterministic ”SSTs” are closed under\ncomposition because of their equivalence to\nMSO transductions . A precise complexity\nanalysis of this closure property can be found\nin , but it is triply\nexponential. We show how to do composition with a single exponential,\nusing results from . Let T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} and T2subscript𝑇2T_{2} be two ”deterministic” ”SSTs” realizing the functions\nf1:Σ1∗→Σ2∗:subscript𝑓1→superscriptsubscriptΣ1superscriptsubscriptΣ2f_{1}:\\Sigma_{1}^{*}\\rightarrow\\Sigma_{2}^{*} and f2:Σ2∗→Σ3∗:subscript𝑓2→superscriptsubscriptΣ2superscriptsubscriptΣ3f_{2}:\\Sigma_{2}^{*}\\rightarrow\\Sigma_{3}^{*}.\nLet nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} (resp. misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i}) be the number of states (resp. variables)\nof Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}, and M=n1+n2+m1+m2𝑀subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2subscript𝑚1subscript𝑚2M=n_{1}+n_{2}+m_{1}+m_{2} One can construct in time exponential in M𝑀M and\npolynomial in |Σ1|+|Σ2|+|Σ3|subscriptΣ1subscriptΣ2subscriptΣ3|\\Sigma_{1}|+|\\Sigma_{2}|+|\\Sigma_{3}|\na ”deterministic” ”SST” realizing f1∘f2subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2f_{1}\\circ f_{2},\nwith exponentially many states and polynomially many\nvariables in M𝑀M. Each Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} can be converted in\npolynomial time into an ”equivalent”\ntwo-way transducer that is ””reversible””,\nnamely, both deterministic and co-deterministic\n.\nAgain by ,\nreversible two-way transducers can be composed\nin polynomial time, yielding a reversible two-way transducer S𝑆S\nrealizing f1∘f2subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2f_{1}\\circ f_{2}, and having polynomially many states\nin M𝑀M. Finally, it suffices to convert S𝑆S back to a ”deterministic” ”SST”,\nwhich can be done in time exponential in the number of states of S𝑆S and polynomial\nin the size of the alphabets. This yields a ”deterministic” ”SST” with\nexponentially many states and polynomially many variables in M𝑀M\n(see e.g.  ).\n∎ * We start with an overview of the proof.\nBy Theorem 9, it suffices to decide\nwhether a given ”SST” T𝑇T admits a ”simply divergent”\n”W-pattern”. Let us fix some tuple x¯=(x1,…,x5)∈{1,2}5¯𝑥subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥5superscript125\\overline{x}=(x_{1},\\dots,x_{5})\\in\\{1,2\\}^{5}. We construct an ”SST”\nTx¯subscript𝑇¯𝑥T_{\\overline{x}} which is not ”single-valued” iff T𝑇T\nhas a ”W-pattern” which is ”simply divergent” for x¯¯𝑥\\overline{x}.\nSince checking ”single-valuedness” of ”SST” is\ndecidable [ref]5,\nwe can decide ”finite valuedness” of T𝑇T\nby solving ”single-valuedness” problems\nfor all ”SST” Tx¯subscript𝑇¯𝑥T_{\\overline{x}}, for all tuples\nx¯∈{1,2}5¯𝑥superscript125\\overline{x}\\in\\{1,2\\}^{5}.\nIntuitively, we exhibit an encoding of\n”W-patterns” P𝑃P as words uPsubscript𝑢𝑃u_{P},\nand show that such words form a regular language.\nThe encoding uPsubscript𝑢𝑃u_{P} informally consists of the\n”runs” that form the ”W-pattern” P𝑃P, and\nsome of these ”runs”\nare overlapped to ensure that they are on the same ”input”.\nAccordingly, the ”SST” Tx¯subscript𝑇¯𝑥T_{\\overline{x}} will take as\n”input” such an encoding uPsubscript𝑢𝑃u_{P} and produce as ”outputs” the\ntwo words\n\"​out⁡(\"​runP⁡(s)​@​W−r​u​n​\")​@​o​u​t​p​u​t​\"\"out\"subscriptrun𝑃𝑠@𝑊𝑟𝑢𝑛\"@𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡\"\"\\operatorname{out}(\"\\operatorname{run}\\nolimits_{P}({s})@W-run\")@output\" and \"​out⁡(\"​runP⁡(s′)​@​W−r​u​n​\")​@​o​u​t​p​u​t​\"\"out\"subscriptrun𝑃superscript𝑠′@𝑊𝑟𝑢𝑛\"@𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡\"\"\\operatorname{out}(\"\\operatorname{run}\\nolimits_{P}({s^{\\prime}})@W-run\")@output\",\nwhere s=(x1,x2,x3,x4¯,x5)𝑠subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3¯subscript𝑥4subscript𝑥5s=(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\\underline{x_{4}},x_{5}) and\ns′=(x1,x2¯,x3,x4,x5)superscript𝑠′subscript𝑥1¯subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3subscript𝑥4subscript𝑥5s^{\\prime}=(x_{1},\\underline{x_{2}},x_{3},x_{4},x_{5}).\nTo achieve this, Tx¯subscript𝑇¯𝑥T_{\\overline{x}} can consume the ”input” uPsubscript𝑢𝑃u_{P}\nwhile iterating the encoded ”runs” as prescribed by s𝑠s or s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime}\nand simulating the transitions to construct the appropriate outputs.\nFinally, an analysis of the size of Tx¯subscript𝑇¯𝑥T_{\\overline{x}} and of the\nalgorithm from [ref]5\nfor checking ”single-valuedness” gives the PSpace upper bound.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: valuedness”) can be improved, as no non-trivial\nlower bound is known.\nOn the other hand, ”equivalence” (as well as ”finite valuedness”)\nturns out to be in PTime when the number of variables is\nfixed [ref]5. The effectiveness procedure uses the following complexity result on the\ncomposition of deterministic ”SSTs”, which is of independent interest.\nIt is known\nthat deterministic ”SSTs” are closed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
