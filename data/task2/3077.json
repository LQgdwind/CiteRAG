      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Graph Self-Supervised Learning with Contrastive Adjusted Zooming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDGI [ref]12 Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) adapts the idea of Mutual Information (MI) maximization from image processing [ref]39 to graphs. Specifically, DGI implements a patch-summary maximization strategy (i.e., maximizing MI between node- and graph-level representation). GMI  Graph Mutual Information (GMI) focuses on maximizing MI between input graphs and high-level hidden representations based on node features and topological structure. MVGRL [ref]37 Multi-view Graph Representation Learning (MVGRL) utilizes graph augmentation techniques to generate multiple views and maximize the mutual information of the output node-level and readout subgraph-level representations between different views. GRACE  Graph Contrastive Representation Learning (GRACE) also applies graph augmentation for creating two augmented views. Unlike the aforementioned self-supervised GRL baselines, it defines an InfoNCE contrastiveness loss, which contrasts embeddings at the node level from two different augmented views. SubG-Con  Sub-graph Contrast (SubG-Con) defines a self-supervised graph contrastive learning strategy, which extracts regional structure information from the correlation between central nodes and their sampled subgraphs (i.e., a subgraph built by central nodes and its close neighbors.). The experiment result is shown in Table III. Here we adopt classification accuracy as the evaluation metrics. Every data entry in the table is the averaged result and associated standard deviation over ten individual runs. According to this table, we have made the following observations: On all datasets, our proposed approach G-Zoom has surpassed all baselines and achieved the best performance. Notably, G-Zoom exceeds the best result of its self-supervised GRL counterparts by more than 1% on Cora and around 1% on CiteSeer and Coauthor CS. This is mainly because G-Zoom successfully extracts useful clues from different perspectives through contrastive learning via the proposed adjusted zooming scheme, by which G-Zoom can inspect graphs comprehensively and learn effective embeddings.\n G-Zoom successfully handles a large-scale dataset (i.e., ogbn-arxiv), and achieves the best performance on the large-scale dataset. At the same time, almost all self-supervised GRL baselines except for SubG-Con, failed to handle it within the limited GPU memory budget. This is because G-Zoom adopts a tailored sub-sampling strategy and a scalable graph diffusion approach with power iteration. Thus, it has the potential to handle large graph datasets. Though SubG-Con successfully processes ogbn-arxiv, their performance is not satisfying compared with the result of G-Zoom. This is probably because SubG-Con only contrasts central nodes to their close neighbors, which overlooks the rich global information embodied in a large graph. In contrast, our approach has a more comprehensive contrastive learning scheme. Without the guidance of labels, G-Zoom is competitive even compared with supervised GNN approaches including GCN, GAT, SGC, and CG3. Our method outperforms all these supervised counterparts on all datasets by large margins, which shows the superiority of G-Zoom in graph representation learning.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: DGI [ref]12 Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) adapts the idea of Mutual Information (MI) maximization from image processing [ref]39 to graphs.
