      "content": "Paper Title: AdaBest: Minimizing Client Drift in Federated Learning via Adaptive Bias Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Federated Learning (FL), multiple sites with data often known as clients collaborate to train a model by communicating parameters through a central hub called server.\nAt each round, the server broadcasts a set of model parameters to a number of clients.\nSelected clients separately optimize towards their local objective.\nThe locally trained parameters are sent back to the server, where they are aggregated to form a new set of parameters for the next round.\nA well-known aggregation is to simply average the parameters received from the participating clients in each round.\nThis method is known as\nFedAvg  or LocalSGD [ref]27. In order to reduce the communication costs as well as privacy concerns (for example possible leakage of data from gradients 4), multiple local optimization steps are often preferable and sometimes inevitable .\nUnfortunately, multiple local updates subject the parameters to client drift . While SGD is an unbiased gradient descent estimator,\nLocalSGD is biased due to the existence of client drift.\nAs a result, LocalSGD converges to a neighborhood around the optimal solution with a distance proportionate to the magnitude of the bias .\nThe amount of this bias itself depends on the heterogeneity among the clients’ data distribution, causing LocalSGD to perform poorly on non-iid benchmarks 3. One effective way of reducing client drift is by adapting Reduced Variance SGD (RV-SGD) methods     to LocalSGD.\nThe general strategy is to regularize the local updates with an estimate of gradients of inaccessible training samples (i.e., data of other clients).\nIn other words, the optimization direction of a client is modified using the estimated optimization direction of other clients.\nThese complementary gradients could be found for each client i𝑖i by subtracting an estimate of the local gradients from an estimate of the oracle’s111Oracle dataset refers to the hypothetical dataset formed by stacking all clients’ data.\nOracle gradients are the full-batch gradients of the Oracle dataset. full gradients.\nIn this paper, we refer to these two estimates with 𝒉isubscript𝒉𝑖{\\bm{h}}_{i} and 𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}}, respectively.\nTherefore, a reduced variance local gradient for client i𝑖i would be in general form of ∇Li+(𝒉−𝒉i)∇subscript𝐿𝑖𝒉subscript𝒉𝑖\\nabla L_{i}+({\\bm{h}}-{\\bm{h}}_{i}) where ∇Li∇subscript𝐿𝑖\\nabla L_{i} corresponds to the true gradients of the local objective for client i𝑖i. The majority of existing research work on adapting RV-SGD to distributed learning do not meet the requirement to be applied to FL.\nSome proposed algorithms require full participation of clients   ; thus, are not scalable to cross-device FL222In contrast to cross-silo FL, cross-device FL is referred to a large-scale (in terms of number of clients) setting in which clients are devices such as smart-phones..\nAnother group of algorithms require communicating the true gradients   and, as a result, completely undermine the FL privacy concerns such as attacks to retrieve data from true gradients 4. SCAFFOLD  is an algorithm that supports partial participation of clients and does not require the true gradients at the server.\nWhile SCAFFOLD shows superiority in performance and convergence rate compared to its baselines, it consumes twice as much bandwidth.\nTo construct the complementary gradients, it computes and communicates 𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}} as an extra set of parameters to each client along with the model parameters.\nFedDyn [ref]2 proposed to apply 𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}} in a single step prior to applying any local update, and practically found better performance and convergence speed compared to SCAFFOLD.\nSince applying 𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}} uses the same operation in all participating clients, [ref]2 moved it to the server instead of applying on each client.\nThis led to large savings of local computation, and more importantly to use the same amount of communication bandwidth as vanilla LocalSGD (i.e., FedAvg), which is half of what SCAFFOLD uses. FedDyn make several assumptions that are often not satisfied in large-scale FL.\nThese assumptions include having prior knowledge about the total number of clients, a high rate of re-sampling clients, and drawing clients uniformly from a stationary set.\nEven with these assumptions, we show that 𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}} in FedDyn is pruned to explosion, especially in large-scale setting.\nThis hurts the performance and holds the optimization back from converging to a stationary point. \n\n\n\ntest log loss\n\n\n \n\n\n\n‖θt‖normsuperscript𝜃𝑡\\|{\\theta}^{t}\\|\n\n\n \n\n\n\ntest accuracy\n\n\n This paper proposes AdaBest, a Reduced Variance LocalSGD (RV-LSGD) solution to minimize the client drift in FL. Compared to the baselines, we define a simpler yet more elegant method of incorporating previous observations into estimates of complementary gradients. Our solution alleviates the instability of the norm of 𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}} in FedDyn (see Figure 1 for empirical evaluation) while consuming the same order of storage and communication bandwidth, and even reducing the compute cost (see supplementary material for quantitative comparison).\nUnlike previous works, our algorithm provides a mechanism for adapting to changes in the distribution of client sampling and does not require prior knowledge of the entire set of clients.\nThese characteristics of AdaBest, combined with its stability, provide a practical solution for large-scale cross-device FL. Our main contributions are as follows: We show that the existing RV-LSGD approaches for cross-device FL fail to efficiently converge to a stationary point. In particular, the norm of the parameters in FedDyn is pruned to explosion (see section 3.4 for discussion). We formulate a novel arithmetic approach for implicit accumulation of previous observations into the estimates of oracle full gradients (𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}}). Using the new formulation, we present AdaBest, a novel algorithm that can be thought as a generalization of both FedAvg and FedDyn. We introduce a new factor β𝛽\\beta that stabilizes our algorithm through controlling the norm of 𝒉𝒉{\\bm{h}}. As a result, the optimization algorithm converges to a stationary point (see Sections 3.4 for detailed discussion). Unlike baselines, AdaBest does not assume that the set of training clients are stationary nor it requires a prior knowledge about its cardinality. We conduct various experiments under different settings of number of clients, balance among partitions, and heterogeneity.\nOur results indicate superior performance of AdaBest in nearly all benchmarks\nin addition to significant improvements in stability and convergence rate.\nIn benchmarks with a large number of clients, our method outperforms the baselines by a wide margin.\nThe results show nearly a two-fold improvement in test accuracy over the second-best candidate in some cases.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: set of parameters for the next round.\nA well-known aggregation is to simply average the parameters received from the participating clients in each round.\nThis method is known as\nFedAvg  or LocalSGD [ref]27.
