      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Health Mentioning Classification of Tweets using Contrastive Adversarial Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHealth mentioning classification (HMC) deals with the classification of a given piece of a text as health mention or not. This helps in the early detection and tracking of a pandemic that enables health departments and authorities in managing the resources and controlling the situation. The input text is gathered from the social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc. The collection process involves crawling the aforementioned platforms based on keywords containing disease names. The keyword-based data collection does not consider the context of the text and hence contains irrelevant data. For example a tweet “I made such a great bowl of soup I think I cured my own depression” contains a disease of “depression” but this is used figuratively. Another tweet “Hearing people cough makes me angry. I cannot explain it” contains “cough” in it but this does not show that a person is having a cough. Non-health and a figurative mention of disease words in these cases pose challenges to the HMC. So, the question arises how to address these challenges? One way is to consider surrounding words of the disease words that will give the context of the text. Another way is to leverage the emojis in the text as figurative mentioning text may contain smileys whereas the actual disease mentioning text may contain emojis of sad faces, etc. Transformed methods [ref]1 are good at capturing the contextual meanings of the words and have shown success in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. BERT  is a transformer model pre-trained on a large unlabelled text corpus for language understanding, and can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as text classification. It considers the words on the left and right sides of a given word while learning a representation for it. In this way, it achieves the contextual representation of a given word. BERT randomly masks 15% of the tokens in the corpus and then tries to predict masked tokens during the training process. RoBERTa  is an improvement over the BERT using dynamic masking of words instead of static 15% masking of the words. Further, it is trained on 1000% more data than BERT. Existing health mentioning classification tasks use both non-contextual, and contextual representations for the given text    [ref]9. However, contextual representations have improved the performance of the classifier over non-contextual representations. Some methods use emojis present in the tweet text for the classification task.  extracts the sentiment information from the given tweet and passes it as an additional feature with textual features.[ref]9 converts emojis into text using Python library and then utilizes this emoji text as a part of tweet text. Adversarial training (AT) [ref]10 works as a regularizer and improves the robustness of the model against adversarial examples. The key idea is to add a gradient-based perturbation to the input examples, and then train the model on both clean and perturbed examples. In contrast to images, this technique is not directly applicable to text data. applies perturbations to word embeddings for the task of text classification.  utilizes a contrastive loss for learning features in computer vision (CV). The idea is, the input image is perturbed by adding some augmentation, and during training contrastive loss pushes both clean and augmented examples together while it pushes other examples away from these examples. Contrastive loss helps model learning noise invariant image feature representation. proposes contrastive adversarial for text classification that improves the performance over the baseline methods. In this work, we propose contrastive adversarial training on the task of HMC, additionally using contrastive loss during the fine-tuning of models. Specifically, we add perturbation to the embedding matrix of BERT and RoBERTa using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)[ref]10. Then we train both the clean and perturbed training examples simultaneously. Our method outperforms both BERTLarge and RoBERTaLarge baseline methods as well as achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on HMC task. Generally, deep learning models are black regarded as black boxes, i.e., it is not clear what information in the input influences the models to make their decisions. European Union adopted new regulations to implement a “right to explanation” which means a user can ask for the explanation of a decision made by the algorithm. Explainable AI focuses on explaining the decisions made by algorithms. In this paper, we leverage explainable AI capabilities to visualize the words that contribute to the model decision. The main contributions of this paper are: We show that using contrastive adversarial training as a regularizer improves the performance of the model. We significantly improve HMC performance over SOTA. We provide the analysis of improvement in the performance by leveraging the power of explainable AI. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section II, we discuss the related work, whereas in section III we present our method for HMC. In section IV, we give experimentation detail. In section V, we present results and analysis of the experiments. In section VI, we provide the conclusion of the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: way is to leverage the emojis in the text as figurative mentioning text may contain smileys whereas the actual disease mentioning text may contain emojis of sad faces, etc. Transformed methods [ref]1 are good at capturing the contextual meanings of the words and have shown success in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
