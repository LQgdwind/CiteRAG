However, body parts occlusion is a critical issue for these types of 2D-to-3D methods, [ref]14 proposed to use multi-scale heatmaps together with an occlusion augmentation module to further resolve the occlusion problem.\nThe graphical structure of human pose is also leveraged by novel graph convolutional network methods.\nIn , the authors further inject the graph structure into a GAN-based human pose estimation model to capture the relationship of body joints. Pose Graph\nConvolutional Network (PGCN)  is introduced to exploit structural relationships between body key points to further improve the localization performance for pose estimation.\nA similar idea is examined from a different perspective in , joint interdependency is leveraged to estimate 3D joint position from RGB images by incorporating structural relationships of the human body, and a progressively designed propagating LSTM framework is used to tackle the pose estimation stage by stage.\nIn  , weakly-supervised methods are proposed to leverage both synthetic data and weakly-labeled real-world data, where the depth-aid regularizer provides weak supervision for 3D pose estimation without any costly 3D annotation required.\nFurther improvements are investigated by introducing the temporal dimension at the input.\nA sequence of 2D keypoints are used to provide smoother spatial constraints where  leverages recurrent models and  built a 1D convolution model with optional temporal dilation.\nA grounded spatial-temporal learning framework was proposed in  to leverage both the temporal context in the video sequence and the spatial information in the graph-based skeleton. In the light of exploring spatial-temporal learning,  use the entire video as the context for predicting the bone direction along with a consistent bone length across the entire video.  proposed a multi-step refinement and estimation framework that refines the 2D input keypoint sequence and then concurrently considering the structure of 2D inputs and 3D outputs.\nInterestingly, another family of methods    train deep models to directly model the human shape represented by SMPL  and perform reverse inference from the shape to the corresponding pose.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: 3D human pose estimation research is affected by deep learning significantly in recent years where conventional methods [ref]12  are overtaken by deep learning methods.\nAs the 2D human pose estimation results are progressively improved, researchers have also started to use detected 2D keypoints as an intermediate for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
