Recently, under the influence of the advances in video-sharing platforms, research on video forensics has been conducted, with the following various targets: double compression, frame-rate conversion, and inter-frame forgery.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, double compression is a weighty indicator of video forgery .\nDue to the storage issue, uncompressed videos are generally single-compressed before distribution, and when videos have been tampered with by an editing tool on the malicious distributor side, a second compression occurs during the storage process.\nAs the video forgery process commonly involves double compression, detecting recompression traces helps verify the integrity of a video . Focusing on this issue, many researchers aimed to detect double compression in video and chose MPEG-4 part 2 (hereinafter referred to as MPEG-4) as the target codec, a typical lossy compression standard developed by the MPEG group and widely adopted in surveillance systems, shooting devices, and editing tools.\nMPEG-4 is largely composed of intra and predictive coding, which are used to reduce spatial and temporal redundancy, respectively [ref]4.\nIn particular, intra coding is applied to the intra-coded frame (I-frame) located in the first of each group of pictures (GOP), where quantization is performed on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain of each divided 8×8888\\times 8 block.\nWhen considering double compression, if the first and second quantization tables have differences, the distribution of the corresponding DCT coefficients differs from that of the single-compressed media . In the past, approaches with handcrafted features (e.g., Markov statistics-based features ) were dominant to distinguish the minute statistical variations on the decoded I-frame.\nAfter the superior performance of the data-driven approach using a convolutional neural network (CNN) was demonstrated, network architecture, allocating preprocessing layer  or unpooled layers  in the initial layers to capture low-level signals, was proposed.\nRecently, approaches using both the CNN and handcrafted features (e.g., DCT histogram  and vectorized quantization matrix ) demonstrated excellent performance in detecting double compression in JPEG files.\nSince intra coding is based on a JPEG-like scheme, it is crucial to investigate the efficacy of these features in terms of detecting double MPEG-4 compression. Motivated by the mentioned issue, neural network-based video forensics (referred to as DHNet) using discriminant features is presented.\nTo explore and learn distinguishable footprints caused by block-DCT-based double quantization, we devise multiple DCT histograms and auxiliary features suitable for capturing subtle statistical characteristics of the DCT coefficients.\nExtensive experiments with large datasets demonstrated that our method outperformed comparable methods.\nThe main contributions are as follows: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ multiple DCT histograms, which are designed to focus on the statistical properties of the DCT coefficients of multiresolution blocks as features for detecting double MPEG-4 compression. By analyzing the differences between MPEG-4 and JPEG in terms of quantization table acquisition, we propose auxiliary features with the base quantization table and quantizer scale, which contribute to the performance improvement of DHNet. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\nIn “Background” section, we review the intra coding of MPEG-4, cases of double MPEG-4 compression, and the previous works related to this work.\nThen, “Proposed Method” section introduces the proposed forensic approach utilizing distinctive features, followed by the performance analysis in “Experiments” section.\nFinally, the article is concluded in “Conclusion” section.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: in surveillance systems, shooting devices, and editing tools.\nMPEG-4 is largely composed of intra and predictive coding, which are used to reduce spatial and temporal redundancy, respectively [ref]4.\nIn particular, intra coding is applied to the intra-coded frame (I-frame) located in the first of each group of pictures (GOP), where quantization is performed on the discrete cosine\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
