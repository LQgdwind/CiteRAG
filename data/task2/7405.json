      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Graphs Meet Multi-Modal Learning: A Comprehensive Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n1) Paradigms for MMKG Construction:\nWe outline two principal paradigms for MMKG construction following Zhu et al. : (i) Annotating Images with Symbols from a KG and (ii) Grounding KG Symbols to Images. The first paradigm prioritizes the extraction of visual entities/concepts, relations, and events, which are crucial for the dynamic creation of KGs like scene and event graphs .\nThis approach, however, encounters challenges in representing infrequent (i.e., long-tail) multi-modal knowledge, primarily due to the recurrent depiction of common real-world entities across diverse contexts. The use of supervised methods further compounds these challenges, as they are inherently constrained by the finite scope of pre-existing labels. Moreover, this system demands substantial pre-processing, including the formulation of specific rules, the creation of predetermined entity lists, and the application of pre-trained detectors and classifiers, all of which pose significant scalability challenges  [ref]42.\nFurther exploration of these issues and their implications for MMKG construction is detailed in § V-B. Besides, the typical construction paradigm for most of the current MMKG is grounding KG symbols to images, which involves: entity grounding (i.e., associating entities with corresponding images from online sources ), concept grounding (i.e., selecting diverse, representative images for visual concepts and abstracting common visual features), and relation grounding (i.e., choosing images that semantically mirror the relation of the input triples). This paradigm currently poses the principal challenge in large-scale MMKG construction. cccccc\n\\CodeBefore1\n\n\\Body\nPub. Time MMKGs Types Scale (#nodes / #images) Data Sources Sup.

Visual Genome (2016)  provides dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships.\nHowever, it primarily aids scene understanding tasks like image description and question answering.\nImageGraph (2017) , rooted in Freebase , and IMGpedia (2017) [ref]53, linking Wikimedia Commons666http://commons.wikimedia.org visual data with DBpedia metadata, represent further expansions into MMKGs. ImageGraph, assembled through a web crawler parsing image search results and applying heuristic data cleaning rules (e.g., deduplication and ranking), focuses on reasoning over visual concepts, enabling relation prediction and multi-relational image retrieval. As an N-MMKG, IMGpedia, with its emphasis on visual descriptors and similarity relations, supports visual-semantic queries but is limited by its scope of commonsense and encyclopedic knowledge. In 2019, Liu et al.  first formally introduced the term “MMKG”, launching three A-MMKG datasets for Link Prediction and Entity Matching research, constructed using a web crawler as the image collector based on Freebase15K (FB15K) , averaging 55.8 images per entity.\nMeanwhile, DBpedia15k (DBP15K) and Yago15k (YG15K) were developed by aligning entities from DBpedia and Yago with FB15K, enriching these KGs with numeric literals, image information, and sameAs predicates for cross-KG Entity Linking. GAIA (2020)  is an MMKG extraction system that supports complex graph queries and multimedia information retrieval. It integrates Text Knowledge Extraction and Visual Knowledge Extraction processes on identical document sets, generating modality-specific KGs which are then merged into a coherent MMKG. Concurrently, VisualSem  emerges as an A-MMKG, sourcing entities and images from BabelNet  with meticulous filtering to ensure data quality and diversity. Entities in VisualSem are linked to Wikipedia, WordNet synsets , and, when available, high-resolution images from ImageNet .\nAs a N-MMKG, Richpedia \ncollects images and descriptions from Wikipedia , using hyperlinks and text for manual relationship identification among image entities, supplemented by a web crawler for broader image entity collection. Recent focus in the MMKG community has shifted from construction to application, emphasizing areas such as MMKG Representation Learning (§ V-A), Acquisition (§ V-B), Fusion (§ V-C), Inference (§ V-D), and MMKG-driven Applications (§ V-E).\nWhile MMKG acquisition extends construction efforts, it mainly addresses multi-modal extraction challenges , highlighting the scarcity of large-scale MMKG resources and the demand for task-specific datasets to address MMKG’s limitations and support novel downstream tasks. Specifically,\nBaumgartner et al.  employ multi-modal detectors and a semantic web-informed scheme for semantic relation extraction between movie characters and locations to support Deep Video Understanding.\nPeng et al.  explore image quality control in MMKG construction through an Image Refining Framework that uses clustering for de-duplication and noise reduction, taps into Wikidata for entity descriptions, and relies on a pre-trained model to gauge image-text similarity. It discards images that do not meet a specific relevance threshold.\nIn MMKG construction, accurately aligning concepts with their corresponding images is crucial  .\nThe challenge arises from distinguishing between visualizable concepts (VCs), like “dog”, which have clear visual representations, and non-visualizable concepts (NVCs), such as “mind” or “texture”, which lack direct visual counterparts. This distinction complicates their inclusion in MMKGs.\nJiang et al.  introduce a visual concept classifier that identifies VCs and NVCs, utilizing ImageNet instances to exemplify the former. However, this binary classification serves merely as a preliminary phase. The deeper challenge in MMKG construction lies in selecting representative images for entities, potentially involving clustering methods like K-means or spectral clustering .\nBuilding upon this, Zhang et al.  introduce AspectMMKG,\nenriching MMKGs by associating entities with aspect-specific images, derived from Wikipedia, and refining image selection with a trained model.\nBesides, Wu et al.  present MMpedia, a scalable, high-quality MMKG constructed via a novel pipeline that leverages DBpedia  to filter non-visualizable entities and refine entity-related images using textual and type information. Gong et al.  introduce UKnow (2023), a unified knowledge protocol that classifies N-MMKG triples into five unit types: in-image, in-text, cross-image, cross-text, and image-text. They establish an efficient pipeline for adapting existing datasets to UKnow’s format, facilitating the automated generation of new datasets from existing image-text pairs.\nFurther, Zha et al.  propose a framework to construct a multi-modal conceptual MMKG, named M2ConceptBase. Initially, they extract candidate concepts from textual descriptions in image-text pairs and refine them using rule-based filters. These concepts are then aligned with corresponding images and detailed descriptions through context-aware multi-modal symbol grounding. For concepts not fully grounded, GPT-3.5-Turbo generates supplementary descriptions.\nNote that the nodes in M2ConceptBase and AspectMMKG are not linked or mapped to existing public KGs. Instead, their focus is on decomposing entity concepts and associating them with fine-grained images. As a result, most nodes within these MMKGs remain isolated, rendering the graphs more akin to multi-modal extensions of text-rich KGs, as discussed in § III-A.\nSong et al.  unveil a scene-driven MMKG construction method that starts with natural language scene descriptions and employs a prompt-based scene-oriented schema generation. This approach, combined with traditional knowledge engineering and LLMs, streamlines the creation and refinement of the ManipMob-MMKG, a specialized MMKG tailored for indoor robotic tasks such as manipulation and mobility. Exploring MMKGs’ utility in downstream tasks, Xu et al.  introduce two MMKG Link Prediction datasets: MKG-W and MKG-Y. Derived from OpenEA benchmarks , these datasets integrate structured data from Wikipedia and YAGO with expert-validated entity images sourced from the web. Wang et al.  further investigate the role of different modalities in Link Prediction through TIVA-KG, an MMKG covering text, image, video, and audio modalities. Built upon the foundation of ConceptNet , TIVA-KG also supports triplet grounding (i.e., associating a common sense triplet with tangible representations like images), enabling the mapping of symbolic knowledge within its multi-modal framework.\nSimilarly, Lee et al.  propose VTKGs, where both the entities and triplets are attached with images, with accompanying textual descriptions for each entity and relation.\nFocusing on Multi-modal Entity Alignment tasks, Li et al. [ref]63 introduce Multi-OpenEA, extending the OpenEA benchmarks with 16 MMKGs and Google-sourced images. To study the effect of missing visual modality on MMKG representation and alignment, Chen et al.  randomly removed images from the DBP15K  and Multi-OpenEA datasets [ref]63, releasing the MMEA-UMVM datasets.\nAdditionally, Zhang et al.  define a new task on multi-modal analogical reasoning over KGs, which requires the ability to reason using multiple modalities and background knowledge. They also develop a dataset, MARS, and a corresponding MMKG, MarKG, for benchmarking purposes. 3) N-MMKG Ontology:\nConsidering that the A-MMKG ontology largely mirrors standard KGs, with the primary distinction being the inclusion of visual attributes, we mainly discuss several representative N-MMKG ontologies in this part.\nThis emphasis is due to the complex design considerations involved in integrating image entities into N-MMKGs. URI prefixes play a pivotal role in ontologies, serving as unique identifiers for classes and properties. Standard prefixes (e.g., rdf, rdfs, owl) ensure cross-domain consistency, while custom ones (e.g., imo for IMGpedia and rpo for Richpedia) bring in domain-specific nuances. This setting not only optimizes data representation and interoperability in KGs but also aligns with broader RDF standards, laying the foundation for MMKGs which facilitates efficient querying and intricate manipulation of diverse multimedia data. IMGpedia Ontology [ref]53 (Fig. 4(a)) extends terms from the DBpedia Ontology777schema.org and the Open Graph Protocol to represent multi-modal data in RDF.\nSpecifically, the imo:Image denotes an abstract resource representing an image, which captures its dimensions (imo:height, imo:width), URL (imo:fileURL), and an owl:sameAs link to its corresponding resource in DBpedia Commons. imo:Descriptor defines visual descriptors linked via imo:describes, with types including imo:HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradient), imo:CLD (Color Layout Descriptor), and imo:GHD (Gradation Histogram Descriptor). imo:ImageRelation encapsulates similarity links between images, detailing the descriptor type used and the Manhattan distance between image descriptors, with an additional imo:similar relation for k-nearest neighbor (k𝑘k-nn) images. Richpedia ontology  (Fig. 4(b)) aligns closely with the IMGpedia Ontology. Here, rpo:KGEntity denotes textual KG entities, while rpo:Image stands for a Richpedia image entity characterized by a URL and dimensions (e.g., rpo:Height and rpo:Width, both expressed in the xsd:float datatype for numerical values).\nSubclasses of rpo:Descriptor, like rpo:GHD, capture visual traits of images. Semantic relations like rpo:sameAs and rpo:imageOf link these entities, with rpo:ImageSimilarity quantifying image likeness between rpo:sourceImage and rpo:targetImage through pixel-level comparisons. Following Richpedia , Peng et al.  explore a new MMKG ontology (Fig. 4(c)) to tackle the issue of entities with multiple visual representations (i.e., aspects), a phenomenon emphasized by AspectMMKG  and M2ConceptBase . The key of this paradigm is to introduce the Mirror Entity and Picture Unit as foundational concepts. rpo:MirrorEntity denotes a particular concept, with rpo:NamedEntity pointing to a related KG entity. Its visual counterpart, the rpo:ImageEntity, is sourced from the rpo:PictureUnit, which might aggregate multiple such image entities under the same aspect. Besides, various rpo:PictureUnit maintain a degree of similarity through rpo:similarity.An rpo:align linkage is established when rpo:NamedEntity and rpo:ImageEntity both reference a common rpo:MirrorEntity. Further, the rpo:pictureOf relation binds rpo:PictureUnit to rpo:NamedEntity, with the rpo:TextEntity serving as a bridge, encapsulating shared descriptions.\nIn essence, this ontology enriches the prior MMKG by offering a hierarchical structure, effectively clustering and associating images from diverse aspects. Fig. 4 visualizes the evolutionary trajectory of MMKG ontologies, highlighting the unique challenges N-MMKGs face: (i) An individual entity may have multiple visual representations (i.e., varied aspects). (ii) Efficiently extracting information from visual modalities across entities is crucial. (iii) The development of distinct multi-modal representation methods can extend beyond entity-level to include relation and triple-level representations, as explored in works like  . Discussions on future directions continue in § VI-A.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: the formulation of specific rules, the creation of predetermined entity lists, and the application of pre-trained detectors and classifiers, all of which pose significant scalability challenges  [ref]42.\nFurther exploration of these issues and their implications for MMKG construction is detailed in § V-B. Besides, the typical construction paradigm for most of the current MMKG is grounding KG\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
