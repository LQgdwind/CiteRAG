      "content": "Paper Title: Intelligent Computing: The Latest Advances, Challenges and Future\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge reasoning has always been a crucial component of cognitive intelligence. Traditional reasoning, which includes deductive and inductive reasoning, is derived from classical mathematical theory. Deductive reasoning starts from general premises and leads to specific statements or individual conclusions . Inductive reasoning is from the individual to the general. It derives generality principles and rules from concrete examples . Knowledge reasoning builds the knowledge base using the graph data model or topology to integrate data, as shown in Figure 9. It stores the semantic entities with free form (objects, events, situations, or abstract concepts) and their relation description. The research contains seven aspects: knowledge acquisition, representation, storage, modeling, integration, understanding, and management. As an effective way to express knowledge, a knowledge graph connects entities through rich semantic relations and constructs a systematic and semi-structured knowledge base. Knowledge graphs have been widely used in vertical application fields such as medical care, e-commerce, finance, public security, transportation, and intelligent question-answering. Typical knowledge graphs include YAGO , DBpedia , Freebase , Wikidata , etc. These knowledge graphs extract, organize and manage knowledge from many data resources and then store and represent knowledge as triples. They help understand the semantics of search and provide accurate search answers. Knowledge reasoning based on knowledge graphs mainly focuses on relations, that is, inferring unknown facts or relations based on existing ones in the graph or identifying and correcting errors in existing entities, relations, and graph structures based on prior knowledge and experience. It includes reasoning based on rules, distributed representation, graphs, and neural networks. Reasoning based on logical rules mainly uses first-order predicate logic, description logic, and probability logic to deduce new entity relations. Typical methods include ProPPR [ref]115, TensorLog , SRL , among others. Graph-structure-based reasoning represented by path ranking algorithm  combines semi-structured topological features of knowledge graphs with statistical criteria. This kind of method considers the path relation between entities, introduces statistical rules into the algorithm, and produces a strong inference effect. Neural-network-based reasoning uses deep learning models to infer knowledge. Neural tensor network (NTN)  constructs word vector average representation of entities. R-GCN [ref]120 captures the information of adjacent entities by convolution networks. IRN uses RNN as the control unit to simulate the process of multi-step reasoning and introduces an attention mechanism. DeepPath  initially introduces the reinforcement learning framework into the knowledge reasoning model. Reasoning based on distributed representation learning learns fact tuples in the knowledge graph by representation model and obtains low dimensional vector representation of the knowledge graph. The inferential prediction is then converted into a simple vector operation based on the representation model. Its core is to map the knowledge graph to continuous vector space and deduce implicitly through calculating the distributed representation of each element. Most representation learning approaches, including TransE  and RESCAL , build various learning models based on different spatial assumptions and use a single-step relationship, or a single triad, as their input and learning objective.\n\nReference markers found: [115]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]115: and neural networks.
