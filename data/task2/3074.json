      "content": "Paper Title: ACR-Pose: Adversarial Canonical Representation Reconstruction Network for Category Level 6D Object Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the performance of ACR-Pose with some recent state-of-the-art methods including NOCS [ref]43, CASS , SPD [ref]38, DualPoseNet [ref]23 and FS-Net , to verify the effectiveness of our method. All of them are strong baselines. For comparison, we compute the IoU50, IoU75, 5∘2cm, 5∘5cm, 10∘2cm and 10∘5cm metrics and report the mean Average Precision (mAP) to measure the performance. Results on NOCS-CAMERA: Table 1 shows the result of our method and the results of all competitors on the val set of NOCS-CAMERA. It is obvious that our method outperforms all the strong baselines for a large margin. For example, SPD [ref]38 shares the same backbone and the same Shape Prior Deformation step as our work, however, it is outperformed by our ACR-Pose by 16.3%, 15.1%, 9.3% and 6.3% in terms of the 5∘2cm, 5∘5cm, 10∘2cm and 10∘5cm, respectively, which is a significant improvement. The comparison between SPD [ref]38 and our method demonstrates that the improvement really comes from our adversarial reconstruction scheme, which also benefits from the two proposed modules in the Reconstructor. They have increased our model’s 6D object pose estimation performance by increasing the reconstruction quality and reality of the NOCS representations through adversarial training. Our method also outperforms the second-best method DualPoseNet [ref]23 by 5.7%, 3.4%, 4.6%, 3.1% at the above four metrics respectively, which is also a great improvement. This further proves the effectiveness our method. Results on NOCS-REAL: We also compare ACR-Pose with other methods on the NOCS-REAL test set. Results are shown in Table 2. Our method is defeated by FS-Net  at the IoU50 metric and defeated by DualPoseNet [ref]23 at the 10∘5cm metric. However, these two metrics are relatively loose metrics. Besides, the training setting of FS-Net  is strongly different from all the other baselines. For example, it uses the YOLO v3  object detector to detect and crop image patches and depth regions, while all the other baselines use the Mask-RCNN detector. When it comes to other strict metrics, our method outperforms other baselines for a large margin. The excellent performance of our method on the NOCS-REAL dataset at more strict metrics demonstrate that ACR-Pose is powered with strong generalization ability and owns the potential of being deployed into real-world industry products. We contribute the superiority of our model into PIM, RRM and the adversarial reconstruction scheme. We also illustrate the average precision (AP) vs. different thresholds on 3D IoU, rotation error, and translation error of our method on Fig. 5. We compare our method with the mean result of . Both versions of our method achieve excellent performance. And our method performs well for all categories. Qualitative results: To better exhibit the performance of ACR-Pose, we visualize some prediction results on Fig. 4. It can be seen that our model can predict accurate 6D object pose because the visualized bounding boxes have high overlap with the ground-truth and they can frame the target objects tightly. Our method achieves excellent performance in both synthetic and real scenarios. Fig. 6 also illustrates some failure cases. When there exists truncation or occlusion, our model sometimes fails. And some objects may be missed by the detector. We will explore how to solve these limitations in our future work. More visualization results can be found in the SuppMat.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: We compare the performance of ACR-Pose with some recent state-of-the-art methods including NOCS [ref]43, CASS , SPD [ref]38, DualPoseNet [ref]23 and FS-Net , to verify the effectiveness of our method.
