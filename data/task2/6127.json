      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge distillation aims to regularize the downstream model by enforcing it to mimic the output of pre-trained models. Note that, the output typically refers to the final response or intermediate features. In the meantime, knowledge distillation is also an important model compression technique. In this section, we do not involve other model compression techniques such as network pruning¬†[ref]246  , since they are not typically motivated to transfer knowledge from teacher network to student network. The fundamental idea of knowledge distillation is to transfer the learned knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher model into a small student model by learning the network output or intermediate features of the teacher.\nTypically, knowledge is distilled from the teacher model to the student model using a soft target distribution for each case. The probability qisubscriptùëûùëñq_{i} of each case can be formulated as: where zùëßz is the output logit of the teacher networks and TùëáT is the temperature of the distillation process. To our best knowledge, the work of  first introduces knowledge distillation to extract knowledge from a pre-existing model. They trained a compressed model with the pseudo data produced by an ensemble of shallow networks while no significant loss occurs in performance. This idea has been expanded to compress the deep and wide networks into shallower ones in . Hinton et al.  introduced the teacher-student knowledge distillation framework, where the student network is penalized based on the softened class distribution output of the teacher network. One of the characteristics of deep neural networks is to obtain increasingly expressive power by learning hierarchical feature representations, as pointed out in¬†. Based on this theory, both the final response and the intermediate feature maps of the teacher network can be employed as the target for training the student model. To substantially exploit the information of intermediate layers, Fitnets¬† introduces intermediate-level hints of the teacher to facilitate training the student. It enforces the intermediate feature alignment between the teacher and student networks via the teacher‚Äôs intermediate feature maps as hints. Subsequently, a rich line of work is devoted to aligning the features indirectly¬†[ref]193     [ref]191  . Concretely, Kim et al.¬†[ref]193 developed a factor transfer method that employs paraphrased intermediate features of the teacher as a factor, rendering the knowledge of the teacher network more understandable for the student network. Inspired by neural architecture search¬†(NAS)¬†, Guan et al.¬† developed a two-stage distillation approach that adopts the differentiable search strategy to simultaneously improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of knowledge distillation. Xu et al.¬† developed a feature-normalized distillation method by introducing a sample-specific correction factor for the replacement of the temperature, with the goal of suppressing the impact of noise resulting from the one-hot label. Passalis et al.¬†[ref]191 modeled the information flow of the teacher‚Äôs multiple intermediate layers and then train a student model to match this information flow. To realize knowledge transfer for vision transformers, Touvron et al.¬† introduced a token-based distillation strategy termed DeiT, which enforces the student transformer to directly reproduce the label estimated by the pre-trained teacher network using a distillation token. Hao et al.¬† introduced a manifold distillation approach for vision transformers by substantially utilizing patch-level information. There are also some extensions to further explore knowledge transfer patterns. Park et al.¬† proposed a relational knowledge distillation scheme for mutual relations transfer of outputs instead of individual outputs. As a generalization of vanilla knowledge distillation, they introduced distance-wise and angle-wise distillation losses to sufficiently extract the structural relations in data examples. Liu et al.¬† proposed an architecture-aware knowledge distillation approach termed AKD, with the goal of finding the optimal student networks for distilling a given teacher network. Chen et al.¬† studied the semantics of intermediate layers and employ an attention mechanism to automatically assign the soft layer association between teacher and student networks, which can reduce the impact of over-regularization\nduring the training process. Zhou et al.¬† proposed a holistic knowledge distillation with graph neural networks, where the holistic knowledge contains individual knowledge and relational knowledge¬† . To integrate two knowledge and refine their correlations, graph neural networks are adopted to learn holistic knowledge to provide supervision for the student network by aggregating feature representation from correlated data examples. Chen et al.¬† proposed a residual distillation framework termed Review to effectively learn informative features from multi-level information in the teacher network. Review utilizes multiple layers in the teacher to guide the training for one layer in the student with great performance gains. Zhao et al.¬† modeled the traditional knowledge distillation loss into target class knowledge distillation and non-target class knowledge distillation, then dived into their effects. Based on the observations, they found that the traditional knowledge distillation loss is a highly entangled formulation. To address this issue, they introduced a decoupled method to facilitate the effectiveness and flexibility of knowledge distillation. For application, most of the above methods focus on image classification. Furthermore, knowledge distillation also demonstrates promising results in more vision tasks, such as object detection¬†   , image segmentation¬†   , person re-identification¬† , super-resolution¬† , depth estimation¬† , and crowd counting¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [246]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]246: features.
