      "content": "Paper Title: CPU Frequency Scheduling of Real-Time Applications on Embedded Devices with Temporal Encoding-based Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern small-device computing mainly relies on low-power CPUs.\nDynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) technology, which tunes the CPU’s voltage (V) and frequency (f) on-demand, is a popular way to address such needs.\nIt is a classical problem in the real-time system community to schedule the CPU performance as energy-efficient as possible while satisfying the computational performance need. Many research works have been performed in this area. Power management algorithms can be classified into two categories: model-based and model-free. Their differences are shown in Fig. 1. Model-based algorithms need a specification of the system with prior knowledge of the tasks  [ref]7          , including the attributes of the tasks such as worst-case execution time (WCET) [ref]7  , deadline [ref]7        , task period    , possible priorities  , or the relations of the tasks specified as a DAG task graph with the communication cost and precedence order of the tasks  [ref]7       . The mathematical model of the tasks, together with the machine architecture features, are used to find an optimal strategy for power management. On the other hand, a model-free DVFS algorithm does not require the input of task-specific information. They either make decisions on frequency scaling based on some predefined assumptions (e.g. CPUFreq governors in Linux assume the future utilization is the same as the current CPU load measured by the performance counter), or collect feedback from the system during operation to adapt to the characteristics of the environment            . The Model-based approach is limited to systems with a known explicit model. The detailed timing behavior of the tasks running on a specific target machine needs precise knowledge of the tasks and the architecture of the target machine, which could affect the timing behavior of the tasks. The system model (tasks + device) is normally hard to obtain. Therefore, such methods are only adopted for hard real-time systems that are safety-critical when a careful analysis of the system and tasks is necessary.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: can be classified into two categories: model-based and model-free.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
