      "content": "Paper Title: TSEN: Transformer and Snowball Graph Convolution Learning for Brain Functional Network Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA growing number of deep learning methods, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have been developed for learning on brain functional network data and predicting brain disorders   . Graph classification is one of the most prominent learning tasks of GNNs, which typically learns a graph-level representation for graph classification in an end-to-end fashion. To learn an effective representation, GNNs were expected to capture the global patterns as well as the local patterns and their interaction [ref]4. There have been various attempts to enhance the expressive power of GNNs, for example, enlarging the receptive field [ref]5, using effective graph pooling operations  , and relieving the over-smoothing caused by increased network depth  . Brain functional networks are usually constructed from neuroimaging data such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), where the nodes are defined by Regions of Interest (ROIs) based on a brain atlas, and the edges are defined by pairwise correlations between the fMRI signal series of ROIs. Compared with data from other fields, brain functional networks are usually complex and noisy, and the data size is usually limited 0. Given brain functional network data, it is difficult to develop efficient graph-level learning approaches to produce compact vector representations which can be optimized for classification task. Recently, Transformer 1 has been shown excel performance in nature language processing (NLP), such as Bert 2 and GPT 3, and this architecture was also introduced for graph structure data 4. Transformer alleviates the limitations related to the sparse message passing mechanism from GNNs, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing 5. And Transformer has been shown to be good at capturing the long-range dependency and global information in graph 6. Some studies tried to properly incorporate structural information of graphs into GNN models via Transformer, such as using graph structure encoding in Graphormer 7, and subgraph representation in structure-aware transformer (SAT) 8. However, it is still a challenge to develop targeted Transformer architecture for whole-graph representation learning\nin classifying brain functional networks. In this paper, we proposed a Transformer and snowball encoding networks (TSEN) for brain functional network classification, which introduced Transformer architecture with snowball connection into GNNs for learning whole-graph representations from given brain networks. TSEN learns multi-scale information of nodes with snowball encoding, and read-out the node information with global attention to obtain graph level representation for classification. A snowball encoding function was proposed to capture short-range and long-range information by combining graph convolution with dense connection structure and graph Transformer. The proposed method was evaluated by two large-scale brain functional network datasets from autism spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder, respectively. The results showed that our proposed method achieved the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art typical GNN models and the graph-transformer based GNN models. Furthermore, we validated the effectiveness of TSEN with ablation experiments, and further analyzed the representation capacity of TSEN and the influence of input graphs on the model. The main contributions are summarized as follows. We proposed a novel graph Transformer architecture with snowball connection for graph neural networks, which enhanced the power to capture multi-scale information and global patterns of brain functional networks. And the proposed model efficiently learned positional and structural information from node features and edge features in the brain functional networks, where node feature was defined by the node’s corresponding row in the brain network adjacency matrix 4 9 and edges were binarized by thresholding on elements of the adjacency matrix. We introduced snowball graph convolution as position embedding in Transformer structure, which was a simple yet effective method to capture structure information naturally with Transformer structure from brain functional networks. We performed extensive ablation studies that evaluated contribution of graph convolution, snowball, feed-forward network, and self-attention components on the benchmarking datasets. And we performed extensive analysis that demonstrated the powerful representation of the proposed model with visualization and similarity comparison. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the notation. Section 4 presents the proposed TSEN. Section 5 reports the experiments and results. Section 6 reports the analysis of TSEN model. Finally, Section 7 concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: for graph classification in an end-to-end fashion.
