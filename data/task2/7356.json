      "content": "Paper Title: Vertical Symbolic Regression via Deep Policy Gradient\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExciting progress has been made to accelerate scientific discovery using Artificial Intelligence (AI)   .\nSymbolic regression, as an important benchmark task\nin AI-driven scientific discovery,\ndistills physics models in the form of symbolic equations from experiment data . Notable progress in symbolic regression includes search-based methods , genetic programming  , Monte Carlo tree search [ref]7 [ref]8 , and deep reinforcement learning 0 1. Vertical Symbolic Regression (VSR) 2 3 recently has been proposed to expedite the discovery\nof symbolic equations with many independent variables.\nUnlike previous approaches, VSR\nreduces the search spaces following a vertical\ndiscovery route – it extends from reduced-form\nequations involving a subset of independent\nvariables to full-fledged ones, adding one\nindependent variable into the equation at a time.\nFigure 1 provides an example. To discover Joule’s law Q∝I2​R​Tproportional-to𝑄superscript𝐼2𝑅𝑇Q\\propto I^{2}RT, where Q𝑄Q is heat, I𝐼I is current, R𝑅R is resistance, and T𝑇T is time 4, one first holds I𝐼I and R𝑅R as constants and finds Q∝Tproportional-to𝑄𝑇Q\\propto T.\nIn the second round, I𝐼I is introduced into the equation with targeted experiments that study the effect of I𝐼I on Q𝑄Q. Such rounds repeat until all factors are considered.\nCompared with the horizontal routes, which directly model all the independent variables simultaneously, vertical discovery can be significantly cheaper\nbecause the search spaces of the first few steps\nare exponentially smaller than the full hypothesis space. Meanwhile, deep learning, especially deep policy gradient 0 1, has boosted the performance of symbolic regression approaches to a new level.\nNevertheless, VSR was implemented using genetic programming.\nAlthough we hypothesize deep neural nets should boost VSR, it is not straightforward to integrate VSR with deep policy gradient-based approaches.\nThe first idea is to employ deep neural nets to predict the symbolic equation tree in each vertical expansion step.\nHowever, this will result in (1) difficulty passing gradients from trees to deep neural nets and (2) complications concatenating deep networks for predictions in each vertical expansion step. We provide a detailed analysis of the difficulty in Appendix A. In this work, we propose Vertical Symbolic Regression using Deep Policy Gradient (Vsr-Dpg).\nWe demonstrate that Vsr-Dpg can\nrecover ground-truth equations involving 505050 variables, which is beyond both deep reinforcement learning-based approaches and previous VSR variants (best up to 666 variables).\nOur Vsr-Dpg solves the above difficulty based on the following key idea: each symbolic expression can be treated as\nrepeated applications of grammar rules.\nHence, discovering the best symbolic equations in the space of all candidate expressions is viewed as the sequential decision-making of predicting the optimal sequence of grammar rules. In Figure 1(right), the expansion from Q=C1​T𝑄subscript𝐶1𝑇Q=C_{1}T to Q=C2​I2​T𝑄subscript𝐶2superscript𝐼2𝑇Q=C_{2}I^{2}T is viewed as replacing constant C1subscript𝐶1C_{1} with a sub-expression C2​I2subscript𝐶2superscript𝐼2C_{2}I^{2}. We define a context-free grammar on symbolic expression expansion, denoting the rules that certain constants can be replaced with other variables, constants, or sub-expressions. All candidate expressions that are compatible with C1​Tsubscript𝐶1𝑇C_{1}T can be generated by repetitively applying the defined grammar rules in different order. Vsr-Dpg employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to sample many sub-expressions (including C2​I2subscript𝐶2superscript𝐼2C_{2}I^{2}) by sequentially sampling rules from the RNN. A vertical discovery path is built on top of this sequential decision-making process of reduced-form symbolic expressions.\nThe RNN needs to be trained to produce expansions that lead to high fitness scores on the dataset. In this regard, we train the RNN to maximize a policy gradient objective, similar to that proposed in Petersen et al..\nOur biggest difference compared\nwith  Petersen et al. is that the RNN in our Vsr-Dpg predicts the next rules in the vertical discovery space, while their model predicts the pre-order traversal of the expression tree in the full hypothesis space. In experiments, we consider several challenging datasets of algebraic equations with multiple input variables and also of real-world differential equations in material science and biology. (1) In Table 1, our Vsr-Dpg attains the smallest median NMSE values in 7 out of 8 datasets, against a line of current popular baselines including the original VSR-GP. The main reason is deep networks offer many more parameters than the GP algorithm, which can better adapt to different datasets and sample higher-quality expressions from the deep networks. (2) Further analysis on the best-discovered equation (in Table 3) shows that Vsr-Dpg uncovers up to 50% of the exact governing equations with 555 input variables, where the baselines only attain 0%.\n(3)\nIn table 2, our Vsr-Dpg is able to find high-quality expressions on expressions with more than 50 variables, which is never the case in all the baselines. The major reason is the use of the control variable experiment. (4) On discovery of ordinary differential equations in Table 4, our Vsr-Dpg also improves over current baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: physics models in the form of symbolic equations from experiment data .
