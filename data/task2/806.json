      "content": "Paper Title: Image Reconstruction of Static and Dynamic Scenes through Anisoplanatic Turbulence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now evaluate the effectiveness of the overall proposed algorithm by comparing it with several existing methods: Sobolev gradient flow (SG) by Lou et al. , near-diffraction-limit (NDL) by Zhu and Milanfar  with deblurring using Shan et al. , and wavelet fusion method (CLEAR) by Anantrasirichai et al. [ref]17. The codes are provided by the original authors and the internal parameters are tuned according to the best of our knowledge. Synthetic dataset. We synthetically generate turbulent sequences for 10 ‚Äústandard‚Äù images (e.g., Lena, House, Cameraman, etc), where each sequence consists of 100 frames. The turbulence levels are set as D/r0=ùê∑subscriptùëü0absentD/r_{0}= 1.4, 2.8 and 4.0 respectively. The results are reported in Figure¬†16, where each PSNR value corresponds to an average over the 10 testing sequences. A visual comparison of the House sequence is shown in Figure¬†17. While all the algorithms yield similar results under a low turbulence level, our approach offers superior performance as the turbulence level increases. Real sequences. We compare the proposed method with existing methods on two sets of real turbulence sequences: Hot-air turbulence shown in Figure¬†18, and a real long-range turbulence shown in Figure¬†19. We include both comparisons to demonstrate the universality of the proposed method. As we can see in both figures, the proposed method has more superior performance than the competing methods, both in terms of sharpness and visual consistency. Moving object sequences. We finally compare methods for sequences containing moving objects. In particular, we compare our method with a very recent approach by Anantrasirichai et al. , which is a generalization of the wavelet fusion previously presented in [ref]17 to moving sequences. The dataset we used consists of two synthetic video sequences and a real video sequence from the NATO RTO SET/RTG-40 dataset . The results shown in Figure¬†20 suggest that static methods such as CLEAR [ref]17 does not handle motion as it creates ghosting artifacts. If the object is moving quickly, e.g., the last row of Figure¬†20, the method will completely wash out the object. Segmentation-based method such as  rely heavily on the quality of the masks, which are generally of sub-optimal quality. The proposed method demonstrates the most reliable reconstruction among the three, as is evident from the figure. Additional reconstruction results of the proposed method are shown in Figure¬†21.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: methods: Sobolev gradient flow (SG) by Lou et al. , near-diffraction-limit (NDL) by Zhu and Milanfar  with deblurring using Shan et al. , and wavelet fusion method (CLEAR) by Anantrasirichai et al.
