      "content": "Paper Title: Projected distances for multi-parameter persistence modules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe interplay between sheaves on a real vector space and persistence theory necessitates the use of a topology on a vector space introduced by Kashiwara and Schapira , called the γ𝛾\\gamma-topology. In this section, we first recall the basic definitions associated to the γ𝛾\\gamma-topology. There is a notion of interleaving distance between sheaves on the γ𝛾\\gamma-topology, which the authors proved to coincide under some properness hypothesis with the convolution distance [3, Corollary 5.9]. Here, we strengthen this result by removing the properness assumption. We then recall some results specific to the dimension one case, where γ𝛾\\gamma-sheaves have a graded-barcode [ref]1. We end the section with the notion of fibered barcode which was introduced in  for persistence modules, that we translate in our γ𝛾\\gamma-sheaf setting. Let 𝕍𝕍\\mathbb{V} be a finite dimensional real vector space. We write a:x↦−x:𝑎maps-to𝑥𝑥a\\colon x\\mapsto-x for the antipodal map. If A𝐴A is a subset of 𝕍𝕍\\mathbb{V}, we write Aasuperscript𝐴𝑎A^{a} for the image of A𝐴A by the antipodal map.\nA subset γ𝛾\\gamma of the vector space 𝕍𝕍\\mathbb{V} is a cone if 0∈γ0𝛾0\\in\\gamma, ℝ>0⋅γ⊂γ⋅subscriptℝabsent0𝛾𝛾\\mathbb{R}_{>0}\\cdot\\gamma\\subset\\gamma. A convex cone γ𝛾\\gamma is proper if γa∩γ={0}superscript𝛾𝑎𝛾0\\gamma^{a}\\cap\\gamma=\\{0\\}. The polar cone γ∘superscript𝛾\\gamma^{\\circ} of a cone γ⊂𝕍𝛾𝕍\\gamma\\subset\\mathbb{V} is the cone of 𝕍∗superscript𝕍∗\\mathbb{V}^{\\ast} From now on, we assume that γ𝛾\\gamma is a We say that a subset A𝐴A of 𝕍𝕍\\mathbb{V} is γ𝛾\\gamma-invariant if A=A+γ𝐴𝐴𝛾A=A+\\gamma. The set of γ𝛾\\gamma-invariant open subset of 𝕍𝕍\\mathbb{V} is a topology on 𝕍𝕍\\mathbb{V} called the γ𝛾\\gamma-topology. We will generically designate topology of this type by cone topology. We denote by 𝕍γsubscript𝕍𝛾\\mathbb{V}_{\\gamma} the vector space 𝕍𝕍\\mathbb{V} endowed with the γ𝛾\\gamma-topology. We write ϕγ:𝕍→𝕍γ:subscriptitalic-ϕ𝛾→𝕍subscript𝕍𝛾\\phi_{\\gamma}\\colon\\mathbb{V}\\to\\mathbb{V}_{\\gamma} for the continuous map whose underlying function is the identity. We set, following , We call an object of 𝖣γ∘,ab​(𝐤𝕍)subscriptsuperscript𝖣bsuperscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤𝕍\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}_{\\gamma^{\\circ,a}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}) a γ𝛾\\gamma-sheaf. This terminology is motivated by the following result. Let γ𝛾\\gamma be a proper closed convex cone in 𝕍𝕍\\mathbb{V}. The functor R​ϕγ∗:𝖣γ∘,ab​(𝐤𝕍)→𝖣b​(𝐤𝕍γ):Rsubscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝛾→subscriptsuperscript𝖣bsuperscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤𝕍superscript𝖣bsubscript𝐤subscript𝕍𝛾\\mathrm{R}{\\phi_{\\gamma}}_{*}\\colon\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}_{\\gamma^{\\circ,a}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}})\\to\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}_{\\gamma}}) is an equivalence of triangulated categories with quasi-inverse ϕγ−1superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝛾1\\phi_{\\gamma}^{-1}. The canonical map 𝐤γa→𝐤{0}→subscript𝐤superscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤0{\\mathbf{k}}_{\\gamma^{a}}\\to{\\mathbf{k}}_{\\{0\\}} induces a morphism Let F∈𝖣b​(𝐤𝕍)𝐹superscript𝖣bsubscript𝐤𝕍F\\in\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}). Then F∈𝖣γ∘,ab​(𝐤𝕍)𝐹subscriptsuperscript𝖣bsuperscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤𝕍F\\in\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}_{\\gamma^{\\circ,a}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}) if and only if the morphism (3.3) is an isomorphism. The following lemma is closely related. The endofunctors 𝐤γa​⋆np(⋅)subscript𝐤superscript𝛾𝑎superscript⋆np⋅{\\mathbf{k}}_{\\gamma^{a}}\\mathop{\\star}\\limits^{\\rm np}\\limits(\\cdot) of 𝖣b​(𝐤𝕍)superscript𝖣bsubscript𝐤𝕍\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}) factors through 𝖣γ∘,ab​(𝐤𝕍)subscriptsuperscript𝖣bsuperscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤𝕍\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}_{\\gamma^{\\circ,a}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}) and defines a projector 𝖣b​(𝐤𝕍)→𝖣γ∘,ab​(𝐤𝕍)→superscript𝖣bsubscript𝐤𝕍subscriptsuperscript𝖣bsuperscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤𝕍\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}})\\to\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}_{\\gamma^{\\circ,a}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}). This functor is called the “gammaification” functor.\n Let v∈𝕍𝑣𝕍v\\in\\mathbb{V}. Recall that For v,w∈𝕍𝑣𝑤𝕍v,w\\in\\mathbb{V} such that w+γ⊂v+γ𝑤𝛾𝑣𝛾w+\\gamma\\subset v+\\gamma, we can use proposition 3.2 to construct a morphism of functors from 𝖣γ∘,ab​(𝐤𝕍)subscriptsuperscript𝖣bsuperscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤𝕍\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}_{\\gamma^{\\circ,a}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}) to 𝖣γ∘,ab​(𝐤𝕍)subscriptsuperscript𝖣bsuperscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤𝕍\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}_{\\gamma^{\\circ,a}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}) We refer the reader to [3, §4.1.2] for details. Let F𝐹F, G∈𝖣γ∘,ab​(𝐤𝕍)𝐺subscriptsuperscript𝖣bsuperscript𝛾𝑎subscript𝐤𝕍G\\in\\mathsf{D}^{\\mathrm{b}}_{\\gamma^{\\circ,a}}({\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbb{V}}), and v∈γa𝑣superscript𝛾𝑎v\\in\\gamma^{a}. We say that F𝐹F and G𝐺G are v𝑣v-interleaved if there exists f:τv∗​F→G:𝑓→subscriptsubscript𝜏𝑣𝐹𝐺f:{\\tau_{v}}_{*}F\\to G and g:τv∗​G→F:𝑔→subscriptsubscript𝜏𝑣𝐺𝐹g:{\\tau_{v}}_{*}G\\to F such that the following diagram commutes. The interleaving distance between F𝐹F and G𝐺G with respect to v∈γa𝑣superscript𝛾𝑎v\\in\\gamma^{a} is The interleaving distance was introduced in .
