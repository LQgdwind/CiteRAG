      "content": "Paper Title: IIFL: Implicit Interactive Fleet Learning from Heterogeneous Human Supervisors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImitation learning (IL), the paradigm of learning from human demonstrations and feedback, has been applied to diverse tasks such as autonomous driving  [ref]2 [ref]3, robot-assisted surgery  , and deformable object manipulation   . The most common IL algorithm is behavior cloning (BC) [ref]2, where the robot policy is derived via supervised machine learning on an offline set of human task demonstrations. Since BC can suffer from distribution shift between the states visited by the human and those visited by the robot, interactive IL (IIL) algorithms including DAgger  and variants 0 1 2 iteratively improve the robot policy with corrective human interventions during robot task execution. These algorithms are typically designed for the single-robot, single-human setting; interactive fleet learning (IFL) 3 extends IIL to multiple robots and multiple human supervisors. However, learning from multiple humans can be unreliable as the data is often multimodal. Training data is multimodal when the same state is paired with multiple\n(correct) action labels: {(s,ai),(s,aj),‚Ä¶},ai‚â†ajùë†subscriptùëéùëñùë†subscriptùëéùëó‚Ä¶subscriptùëéùëñsubscriptùëéùëó\\{(s,a_{i}),(s,a_{j}),\\dots\\},a_{i}\\neq a_{j}. Almost all robot tasks such as grasping, navigation, motion planning, and manipulation can be performed in multiple equally correct ways; as a result, almost all demonstration data has some degree of multimodality. Multimodality is especially severe when learning from different human supervisors with varying preferences and proficiency, as they demonstrate the same task in different ways 4. Multimodality can also occur in the demonstrations of one individual human who may make mistakes, become more proficient at the task over time, or execute a different valid action when subsequently encountering the same state 4 5. Florence et¬†al. 6 propose Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), an IL algorithm that trains an energy-based model (EBM) 7 to represent state-action mappings implicitly rather than explicitly. While this makes model training and inference more computationally expensive (Section¬†6), implicit models can represent multiple actions for each state. This property allows them to handle both single-human multimodality and multi-human heterogeneity, as they are indistinguishable from a data-centric perspective. However, IBC suffers from the same distribution shift as (Explicit) BC. In this paper we combine implicit models with interactive fleet learning to facilitate interactive learning from multiple humans. See Figure¬†1 for intuition. As existing IFL algorithms rely on estimates of epistemic uncertainty like the output variance among an ensemble of networks, which are incompatible with implicit models (Section¬†4.3), we propose a new technique for estimating the epistemic uncertainty in EBMs using Jeffreys divergence 8. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) Implicit Interactive Fleet Learning (IIFL), the first IIL algorithm to use implicit policies, (2) a novel metric for estimating uncertainty in energy-based models, (3) simulation experiments with a fleet of 100 robots and 10 heterogeneous algorithmic supervisors, (4) physical experiments with a fleet of 4 robots and 2 heterogeneous human supervisors.
