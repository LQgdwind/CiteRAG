      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Approximation Factor for Adaptive Influence Maximization via Simple Greedy Strategies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we focus on the myopic model and analyze the approximation factor of the non-adaptive greedy algorithm without passing through the adaptivity gap. We show that the algorithm achieves at least a fraction of 12‚Äã(1‚àí1e)‚âà0.3161211ùëí0.316\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\approx 0.316 of the adaptive optimum (Theorem 2). By definition, this implies that the adaptivity gap is at most 2‚Äãee‚àí1‚âà3.1642ùëíùëí13.164\\frac{2e}{e-1}\\approx 3.164 (Remark Remark). For both approximation ratio and adaptivity gap we obtain a substantial improvement with respect to the upper bounds obtained in , which are 14‚Äã(1‚àí1e)‚âà0.1581411ùëí0.158\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\approx 0.158 and 444, respectively. Non-adaptive policies are strictly weaker than adaptive ones, since the latter can implement the former by simply ignoring any kind of feedback. On the other hand, adaptive policies are difficult to implement as they require to probe suitable seeds and to observe the corresponding feedback, which can be expensive and error-prone. Moreover, they may consist of exponentially-large decision trees that are hard to compute and store. In contrast, non-adaptive policies are easy to design and implement and are independent from the feedback. In particular, the non-adaptive greedy algorithm has been extensively studied and successfully applied in the field of influence maximization. For the non-adaptive setting, several efficient implementation of the greedy algorithm have been devised that allows us to use it in large real-world networks¬†[ref]13    [ref]41 . Our results show that the simple non-adaptive greedy algorithm performs well, even in the adaptive setting where we compare it with the adaptive optimum. To show our bounds, we introduce a new approach that relate the non-adaptive greedy policy to an optimal adaptive solution. The new approach is not based on multilinear extensions and poisson processes (like, e.g.¬†   ) neither on random walks on the optimal decision trees (like, e.g.¬†[ref]5 3 4 ), which are the main tools used so far to relate adaptive and non-adaptive policies, and to bound adaptivity gaps. Previous techniques derive adaptive approximation factors by combining non-adaptive approximation ratios with a bound on the adaptivity gap which is obtained by showing the existence of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù non-adaptive policy. However such a policy is hard to compute as it is usually constructed by using an optimal adaptive policy. Our approach, instead, directly analyzes a non-adaptive policy and therefore provides the exact policy that gives the desired adaptivity gap and adaptive approximation factor. We believe that our approach is of independent interest and may be used to bound approximation factors and adaptivity gaps of different adaptive optimization problems. Our new approach consists in defining a simple randomized non-adaptive policy whose performance is not higher than that guaranteed by the greedy algorithm, and to relate such randomized non-adaptive policy with the optimal adaptive policy. In order to recover good properties of the objective function (like, e.g. submodularity) that usually guarantee good approximations when adopting greedy strategies, we introduce an artificial diffusion process in which each seed has two chances to influence its neighbours. A similar process was introduced by Peng and Chen¬†, who consider a diffusion model in which the seeds appear in multiple copies of the influence graphs, so that, roughly speaking, each node has several chances to influence the neighbours, and the main machinery they consider to relate optimal adaptive strategies with optimal non-adaptive ones is that in¬†[ref]5.\nOur direct and more refined analysis of the non-adaptive greedy algorithm improves at the same time both the approximation ratio and the adaptivity gap. To illustrate our approach, in Section¬†2 we first apply our machinery to the simpler setting of adaptive monotone submodular maximization under cardinality constraint. As observed by Asadpour and Nazerzadeh¬†, a constant factor approximation of the non-adaptive greedy policy applied to such setting can be obtained by combining the approximation ratio over the non-adaptive optimum and the adaptivity gap (which is equal to (1‚àí1e)11ùëí\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)¬†); this leads to an approximation guarantee of (1‚àí1e)2‚âà0.399superscript11ùëí20.399\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)^{2}\\approx 0.399. We¬†give a more refined analysis of the non-adaptive greedy policy and we show that its approximation ratio is at least 12‚Äã(1‚àí1e2)‚âà0.4321211superscriptùëí20.432\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e^{2}}\\right)\\approx 0.432. Asadpour and Nazerzadeh  also showed that a so-called continuous greedy policy   achieves an approximation ratio of 1‚àí1e‚àíœµ11ùëíitalic-œµ1-\\frac{1}{e}-\\epsilon (in polynomial time w.r.t.¬†1œµ1italic-œµ\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}). Since the continuous greedy policy is a non-adaptive policy, this bound is strictly better than ours. However, the non-adaptive greedy policy is simpler and deterministic, while the continuous greedy policy is randomized and more complex. Finally, in Section 5, we analyze the adaptive version of the greedy algorithm applied to the adaptive influence maximization problem; by resorting again to an artificial diffusion process, we show that such adaptive algorithm guarantees an approximation ratio of 1‚àí1e‚âà0.39311ùëí0.3931-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{e}}~{}\\approx~{}0.393; thus, we further improve the upper bound shown for the non-adaptive greedy algorithm, and we also give a more refined analysis of the adaptive greedy algorithm than that of Peng and Chen , who showed a 14‚Äã(1‚àí1e)‚âà0.1581411ùëí0.158\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\approx 0.158 approximation factor.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: in the field of influence maximization.
