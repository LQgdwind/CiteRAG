      "content": "Paper Title: RSBNet: One-Shot Neural Architecture Search for A Backbone Network in Remote Sensing Image Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the spatial resolution, remote sensing image recognition task can be divided into three parallel classification branches at different levels: pixel-level (i.e., land-cover classification), object-level (object detection), and scene-level (scene classification). Although these sub-tasks have different goals, they share some high-level semantic information. More recently, various studies have shown the impressive performance of deep learning models in RSI recognition. Below we introduce many representative deep learning based methods in RSI recognition from three aspects. In terms of scene classification task, it aims to capture the global feature of the RSIs. Early RSI scene classification approaches based on deep learning prefer to fully train a new DNN model with random initial weights. For example, Zhang et al. developed a gradient boosting random convolutional network (GBRCN) to extract discriminative high-level semantic information from small-scale data. Liu et al. constructed a triplet network based on weakly supervised training. However, the performance of DNN models heavily depends on the mount of training data, which make it impracticable of training a robust DNN model on limited RSI data. To solve the overfitting problem, some works directly take the activations from the fully-connected layers of pretrained CNNs as the image representations and achieve promising performance . The others employ the DNN models as local feature extractor and incorporate unsupervised methods for feature coding to obtain scene representation. Some methods introduce the idea of feature fusion to generate more discriminative feature representation. Zhao et al.[ref]29 proposed to combine the multispectral information and the structural feature of scene images to boost the performance. Recently, the performance improvement through deep learning based methods for RSI scene classification has gradually reached a bottleneck due to the heavy dependence on the pretrained weights and limited public data scale. Different from scene classification tasks, land-cover classification is a fine-grained recognition task, which focus on both global contextual semantic information and local detailed features. The emergence of fully convolutional network (FCN)[ref]30 without any fully connected layers promotes the development of encoder-decoder CNN architectures for end-to-end dense predictions, and provides semantic segmentation tasks a standard paradigm for all the subsequent advanced methods, such as U-Net [ref]31, SegNet and DeepLab series . Similarly, FCN-based methods have also been widely applied to RSI land-cover classification. For instance, Kuo et al. proposed an aggregation feature decoder incorporate with DeepLabV3 model to progressively extract and fuse different-level features from the encoder. Peng et al.  constructed a multiscale and multimodal FCN model to combine both the spatial semantic feature and the information of digital surface models, and investigate early and late fusion strategies through densely connected layers. Li et al. developed an adaptive fusion module to combine the feature maps from multiple levels of the backbone network. In order to address the specific difficulties appeared in semantic segmentation task such as reduced spatial resolution caused by pooling layers, blurred edges of different objects and multi scale objects, most existing methods for land-cover classification focus on improving the feature representation abilities of the backbone to adapt specific spatial patterns of remote sensing images. For a long time, object detection plays an essential role in the field of RSI interpretation. Generally, most existing deep learning methods designed for object detection generally consist of two branches on the basis of whether generating region proposals. One is a two-stage detection framework such as Faster R-CNN , Mask R-CNN  and Cascade R-CNN , which first generate a series of candidate region proposals (called anchors) and the classification and regression for the anchors are then performed to predict the bounding box of object. The second branch solve the object detection task in one stage through incorporating the regression and classification process (e.g.,YOLO series, RetinaNet.). For instance, in the model Single-Shot multibox Detector (SSD) , the bounding boxes together with probability scores are directly predicted based on a set of default boxes with dense distribution. Inspired by the remarkable performance of deep learning based methods for object detection in natural images, various researchers propose to adapt the state-of-the-art object detectors designed for natural images to remote sensing images. Zhu et al.proposed a multi-branch conditional generative adversarial network to augment data for RSI object detection. Li et al. introduced a novel parallel down-up fusion network for salient object detection in RSIs, which aims to distinguish diversely scaled salient objects and suppress the cluttered backgrounds. Numerous successful results have demonstrated that CNN architecture serve as backbone network embedded in various object detection frameworks. However, most outstanding feature extractors are originally designed for natural images, the challenges caused by the domain discrepancies should to be addressed.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: unsupervised methods for feature coding to obtain scene representation.
