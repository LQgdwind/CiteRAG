      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe follow the same training and evaluation setup as used by Ho et al. . For completeness we repeat these settings here. The model architecture is based on the backbone of a PixelCNN++ [ref]41 architecture: a U-Net 6 based on a Wide ResNet [ref]56 with weight normalization layers  replaced by group normalization layers . The model has four feature map resolutions and two convolutional residual blocks for each resolution level. At the 16×16fragments161616\\times 16 resolution level a self-attention block is placed between the convolutional blocks . The time step t𝑡t is included in the neural net through a Transformer sinusoidal position embedding  in each residual block.\nFurthermore, we use the same hyperparameters and augmentation settings as in  without tuning them: the dropout rate is set to 0.1; we use a learning rate of 2×10−4fragments210fragments42\\times 10^{-4} with the Adam optimizer  with standard settings, a batch size of 128; for evaluation we use an exponential moving average (EMA) for the model parameters with a decay factor of 0.99990.99990.9999; and finally, we use random horizontal flips as augmentation during training. We built our implementation of D3PMs for images based on\na re-implementation of the DDPM model  in JAX  and Flax , with the same settings as those mentioned above. This re-implementation has been verified to produce similar results as those reported in .\nFor the D3PM models for which the logits of p~θ(𝒙~0|𝒙t)=Cat(𝒙~0|𝒑θ)fragments~𝑝𝜃(~𝒙0|x𝑡)Cat(~𝒙0|p𝜃)\\widetilde{p}_{\\theta}(\\widetilde{\\bm{x}}_{0}|\\bm{x}_{t})=\\mathrm{Cat}(\\widetilde{\\bm{x}}_{0}|\\bm{p}_{\\theta}) are modeled directly as the output of a neural network, we model them as logits=nnθ(normalize(𝒙intt))+𝒙one−hottfragmentslogitsnn𝜃(normalize(xint𝑡))xfragmentsonehot𝑡\\mathrm{logits}=\\mathrm{nn}_{\\theta}(\\mathrm{normalize}(\\bm{x}^{\\mathrm{int}}_{t}))+\\bm{x}^{\\mathrm{one-hot}}_{t}, where 𝒙inttfragmentsxint𝑡\\bm{x}^{\\mathrm{int}}_{t} and 𝒙one−hottfragmentsxfragmentsonehot𝑡\\bm{x}^{\\mathrm{one-hot}}_{t} denote integer and one-hot representations of 𝒙tfragmentsx𝑡\\bm{x}_{t} respectively. The function normalize(𝒙intt)fragmentsnormalize(xint𝑡)\\mathrm{normalize}(\\bm{x}^{\\mathrm{int}}_{t}) maps the integer values {0,…,K−1}fragments{0,…,K1}\\{0,...,K-1\\} to the interval [−1,1]fragments [-1,1]. For the case where the logits are predicted from a truncated distretized logistic distribution, as discussed in Section A.8, the neural network outputs a log scale log𝒔fragmentss\\log\\bm{s} and the mean 𝝁𝝁\\bm{\\mu} of the underlying logistic distribution: [log𝒔,𝝁′]=nnθ(normalize(𝒙intt))fragments[s,μ′]nn𝜃(normalize(xint𝑡))[\\log\\bm{s},\\bm{\\mu}^{\\prime}]=\\mathrm{nn}_{\\theta}(\\mathrm{normalize}(\\bm{x}^{\\mathrm{int}}_{t})), 𝝁=tanh(normalize(𝒙intt)+𝝁′)fragmentsμ(normalize(xint𝑡)μ′)\\bm{\\mu}=\\tanh(\\mathrm{normalize}(\\bm{x}^{\\mathrm{int}}_{t})+\\bm{\\mu}^{\\prime}).\nThe re-implementation of the continuous space DDPM model has approximately 35.7M parameters, which is the same number of parameters as that of the CIFAR-10 model that we loaded from the officially released checkpoint by the authors of .555Code and checkpoints for the DDPM models from  are available at https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion.\nOur D3PM models that output logits directly have around 36.6M parameters, while the model that parameterizes the logits through a discretized truncated logistic distribution (D3PM Gauss + logistic) has around 35.7M parameters. We trained all our models for 1.5M steps on TPUv2 accelerators with a 4×4fragments444\\times 4 topology.\nOur Inception  and FID 8 scores were computed on 50000 samples with the Inception-v3 model . We have included averages and standard deviations over models trained with 5 different seeds. For the D3PM Gauss models with discretized Gaussian transition matrices as described in Appendix A.2.3, we use the same linear schedule for the βtfragmentsβ𝑡\\beta_{t}’s as in : βtfragmentsβ𝑡\\beta_{t} is linearly increased from 1×10−4fragments110fragments41\\times 10^{-4} to 0.020.020.02. We did not explore any other noise schedules for D3PM Gauss models.\nFor the D3PM uniform model (see Section A.2.1) we experimented with a linear schedule for βtfragmentsβ𝑡\\beta_{t} (linearly increasing from 0.020.020.02 to 111) and the cosine schedule as suggested by Hoogeboom et al. . Table 4 shows that the D3PM uniform model with a cosine schedule produces much better results than the same model with a linear βtfragmentsβ𝑡\\beta_{t} schedule. For the D3PM absorbing model (see Section A.2.2) the absorbing state is the gray pixel, corresponding to the RGB values (128, 128, 128). For these models we used a schedule that corresponds to increasing the probability of being in the absorbing state linearly over time: βt=(T−t+1)−1fragmentsβ𝑡(Tt1)fragments1\\beta_{t}=(T-t+1)^{-1}. This schedule was also proposed in Sohl-Dickstein et al.  for diffusion with binary random variables, which has a uniform stationary distribution as opposed to the stationary distribution with all the mass on the absorbing state. Additional samples from the D3PM uniform model trained on LvbfragmentsLvbL_{\\mathrm{vb}}, the D3PM absorb model trained on Lλ=0.001fragmentsLfragmentsλ0.001L_{\\lambda=0.001}, and the D3PM Gauss + logistic model trained on Lλ=0.001fragmentsLfragmentsλ0.001L_{\\lambda=0.001} can be bound in Figure 7.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: We follow the same training and evaluation setup as used by Ho et al. .
