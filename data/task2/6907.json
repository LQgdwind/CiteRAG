      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Limits of Historical Information for Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs), serving as the structured representations of human knowledge, have revealed significant potential across a variety of domains, including natural language processing [ref]2 [ref]3 , recommendation systems  , and information retrieval  . A conventional KG typically refers to a static knowledge base, which utilizes a graph-structured data topology to integrate facts (also known as events), represented as triples (s,p,o)𝑠𝑝𝑜(s,p,o), where s𝑠s and o𝑜o denote the subject and object entities respectively, and p𝑝p represents the relation type, or predicate. In the real world, knowledge is constantly evolving, leading to the development of Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), where the fact has extended from a triple (s,p,o)𝑠𝑝𝑜(s,p,o) to a quadruple with a timestamp t𝑡t, i.e., (s,p,o,t)𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑡(s,p,o,t). As a result, a TKG consists of multiple snapshots, and the facts in the same snapshot co-occur. Figure 1 depicts an example of TKG consisting of a series of international political events, where some events may recur, and new events will also emerge. TKGs provide new perspectives and insights for various downstream applications, e.g., policymaking , stock prediction , and dialogue systems , thus triggering intense interests in TKG reasoning. In this work, we focus on forecasting events (facts) in the future on TKGs, also known as graph extrapolation. Our goal is to predict the missing entities of queries like (s,p,?,t)𝑠𝑝?𝑡(s,p,?,t) for a future timestamp t𝑡t that has yet to be observed in the training set. Many efforts  [ref]13 have been made toward modeling the structural and temporal characteristics of TKGs for future event prediction. Some mainstream examples [ref]13  make reference to known events in history, which can easily predict repetitive or periodic events. However, such methods share three major issues for graph extrapolation:\n\nChallenge of predicting new events. In terms of the event-based TKG Integrated Crisis Early Warning System, new events that have never occurred before account for about 40%−60%percent40percent6040\\%-60\\% . As seen from Figure 2 (a), new events continuously appear across all timestamps. It is challenging to infer these new events because they have fewer temporal interaction traces during the whole timeline. For instance, the right part of Figure 3 shows the query (the United States, Negotiate, ?, t+1) and its corresponding new events (the United States, Negotiate, Russia, t+1), where most existing methods often obtain incorrect results over such query due to their focus on the high frequent recurring events.\n\nInformation loss of repetitive events. Mainstream temporal knowledge graph models employ time-window [ref]13        to truncate historical sequences for the convenience of RNN modules. Nevertheless, it also leads to a significant loss of information when it comes to repetitive events. In Figure 2 (b) and (c), many events may recur in the short term, but their first occurrences can be traced back to over 200 timestamps ago. These models miss essential patterns and insights that a longer historical sequence could provide by only considering a limited period of time. Besides, the truncation of historical data can make it difficult for the model to detect periodicity or recurring patterns in the data. As a result, the model’s ability to accurately predict or infer future events is hindered.\n\nAbsence of bias in reasoning. During the inference process, existing methods rank the probability scores of overall candidate entities in the whole graph without any bias. We argue that bias is necessary when approaching the missing entities of different events. For repetitive or periodic events, models are expected to prioritize a few frequently occurring entities, and for new events, models should pay more attention to entities with less historical interaction. In this work, we will go beyond the limits of historical information and mine potential temporal patterns from the whole knowledge. To elaborate our design clearer, we call the past events associated with the entities in the current query (s,p,?,t)𝑠𝑝?𝑡(s,p,?,t) historical events, and others non-historical events. Their corresponding entities are called historical and non-historical entities, respectively. We will give formal definitions in Section 3.1. We intuitively consider that the events in TKG are not only related to their historical events but also indirectly related to unobserved underlying factors. The historical events we can see are only the tip of the iceberg. We propose a novel TKG reasoning model called CENET (Contrastive Event Network) for event forecasting based on contrastive learning. Given a query (s,p,?,t)𝑠𝑝?𝑡(s,p,?,t) whose real object entity is o𝑜o, CENET takes into account its historical and non-historical events and identifies significant entities via contrastive learning. Specifically, a copy mechanism-based scoring strategy is first adopted to model the dependency of historical and non-historical events, ensuring that there is no truncation operation on the entire timeline. In addition, all queries can be divided into two classes according to their real object entities: either the object entity o𝑜o is a historical entity or a non-historical entity. Therefore, CENET naturally employs supervised contrastive learning to train representations of the two classes of queries, further helping train a classifier whose output is a boolean value to identify which kind of entities should receive more attention. During the inference, CENET combines the distribution from the historical and non-historical dependency, and further considers highly correlated entities with a mask-based strategy according to the classification results. The contributions of our paper are summarized as follows: We examine the limits of historical information in existing TKG methods and propose a new model called CENET for event forecasting. CENET can predict not only repetitive and periodic events but also potential new events via joint investigation of both historical and non-historical information; To the best of our knowledge, CENET is the first model to apply contrastive learning to TKG reasoning, which trains contrastive representations of queries to identify highly correlated entities; We conduct experiments on five public benchmark graphs. The results demonstrate that CENET outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG models in the task of event forecasting. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work. Section 3 describes the details of our proposed model. The performance of CENET is verified in Section 4 with detailed analysis. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and future work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), serving as the structured representations of human knowledge, have revealed significant potential across a variety of domains, including natural language processing [ref]2 [ref]3 , recommendation systems  , and information retrieval  .
