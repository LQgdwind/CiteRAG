Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [ref]8 computing the Fréchet distance between two Gaussian distributions fitted to generated images and real images respectively. Both real and generated images are fed to a pre-trained Inception-V3[ref]35 network to extract features, aiming to compute their respective distributions. Specifically, we employ the official code of FID111the official code of FID: https://github.com/bioinf-jku/TTUR to compute this score. Inception Score (IS) \nalso shows the overall quality of the generated images by using an Inception-V3[ref]35 network pre-trained on the ImageNet-1000 classification benchmark. The score is derived exclusively from the network’s outputs on generated images. A high IS indicates that the model produces diverse and clear images. We compute IS based on the official code222the official code of IS: https://github.com/openai/improved-gan. Diversity Score (DS)\nmeasures the diversity of the generative model. We calculate LPIPS [ref]46 between two images generated from the same layout but with randomly sampled noise. We use the official code of DS333the official code of DS: https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity to compute and report this score. YOLO Score  is proposed to evaluate the alignment and fidelity of generated objects.\nIt employs a pre-trained YOLOv4  model to detect bounding boxes on the generated images and compare them with the ground truth boxes using mean Average Precision (mAP). We evaluate mAP/mAP50/mAP75 on 80 thing categories based on the official code of LAMA444the official code of LAMA: https://github.com/ZejianLi/LAMA and the official code of YOLOv4555the official code of YOLOv4: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet. This metric not only reflects the model’s spatial controllability over localization accuracy but also its semantic controllability to generate fine-grained details at specific locations. mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) evaluates the alignment of generated images with their ground truth label maps, as measured by an external pre-trained semantic segmentation network. We use DeepLabV2 the code of DeepLabV2: https://github.com/kazuto1011/deeplab-pytorch for COCO-Stuff and UperNet101777the code of UperNet101: https://github.com/CSAILVision/semantic-segmentation-pytorch  for ADE20K.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: We offer comprehensive explanations and implementations for each metric we employed.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
