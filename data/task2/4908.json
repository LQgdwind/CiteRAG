      "content": "Paper Title: FedRecover: Recovering from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning using Historical Information\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks  [ref]6    [ref]12, in which malicious clients poison the global model via sending malicious model updates to the server in Step II of FL. The malicious clients can construct their malicious model updates via poisoning their local training data and/or directly manipulating the model updates without following the prescribed FL protocol in Step II  [ref]6    [ref]12.\nBased on the attacker’s goal, poisoning attacks can be categorized into untargeted poisoning attacks   [ref]12 and targeted poisoning attacks  [ref]6 . In untargeted poisoning attacks, the poisoned global model has a large test error rate for a large proportion of test inputs indiscriminately.\nIn targeted poisoning attacks, the poisoned global model predicts an attacker-chosen target label for attacker-chosen target test inputs; and to stay stealthy, the poisoned global model’s test error rate for other test inputs is unaffected. For instance, backdoor attacks  [ref]6 are popular targeted poisoning attacks, in which the attacker-chosen test inputs are any inputs embedded with a trigger. Next, we review Trim attack (a popular untargeted poisoning attack)  and backdoor attack (a popular targeted poisoning attack) . Trim attack:  Fang et al.  formulated untargeted poisoning attacks to FL as a general framework. Roughly speaking, the framework aims to craft malicious model updates that maximize the difference between the aggregated model updates before and after attack.\nThe framework can be applied to different aggregation rules. The Trim attack is constructed based on the Trimmed-mean aggregation rule under the framework, and is also effective for other aggregation rules such as FedAvg and Median. Backdoor attack:  In the backdoor attack , the attacker poisons the malicious clients’ local training data via augmenting them with trigger-embedded duplicates. Specifically, for each input in a malicious client’s local training dataset, the attacker makes a copy of it and embeds a trigger into the copy. Then, the attacker injects the trigger-embedded copy into the malicious client’s local training dataset and relabels it as the target label.\nIn every round of FL, each malicious client computes a model update based on its poisoned local training data. To amplify the impact of the model updates, the malicious clients further scale them up by a large factor before reporting them to the server.\nWe notice that some methods   have been proposed to detect and remove backdoor in neural networks. However, they are insufficient for FL. For instance,  assumes that a clean training dataset is available, which usually does not hold for an FL server.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks  [ref]6    [ref]12, in which malicious clients poison the global model via sending malicious model updates to the server in Step II of FL.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
