      "content": "Paper Title: Phase Transitions via Complex Extensions of Markov Chains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur motivating example is the independence polynomial on a k𝑘k-uniform hypergraph.\nGiven a hypergraph H=(V,ℰ)𝐻𝑉ℰH=(V,\\mathcal{E}), we say that H𝐻H is k𝑘k-uniform if every hyperedge e∈ℰ𝑒ℰe\\in\\mathcal{E} has size |e|=k𝑒𝑘\\left|e\\right|=k.\nThe maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta is the maximum number of hyperedges incident to a vertex.\nAn independent set in H𝐻H is a subset S⊂V𝑆𝑉S\\subset V of vertices that does not contain any e∈E𝑒𝐸e\\in E, that is, every hyperedge e𝑒e must have at least one endpoint not chosen by S𝑆S. We use σ∈{0,1}n𝜎superscript01𝑛\\sigma\\in\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^{n} to indicate the set S𝑆S, meaning that σ​(v)=1𝜎𝑣1\\sigma(v)=1 iff v∈S𝑣𝑆v\\in S. Let ℐ​(H)ℐ𝐻\\mathcal{I}(H) denote the set of independent sets in H𝐻H. Then, the independence polynomial of H𝐻H is a generating polynomial in the variables 𝝀𝝀\\bm{\\lambda}: When k=2𝑘2k=2, this is the standard independence polynomial, which has been studied in many branches of mathematics, physics, and computer science.\nTo name a few, Shearer  obtained instance-optimal sufficient criterion in Lovász local lemma using the largest root of the independence polynomial; a tight runtime analysis of the celebrated Moser-Tardos algorithm for the algorithmic Lovász local lemma is characterized by the independence polynomial [ref]40; independence polynomial is also known as the hardcore model for equilibrium of lattice-gas in statistical physics [ref]64; it is also the first example where a sharp computational complexity of approximate counting and sampling is known  .\nWe will refer to the complex zeros of the independence polynomial in 𝝀𝝀\\bm{\\lambda} as Lee-Yang zeros, as 𝝀𝝀\\bm{\\lambda}’s are playing the role of external fields here.\nHenceforth, we denote the above polynomial by ZHly​(𝝀)subscriptsuperscript𝑍ly𝐻𝝀Z^{\\mathrm{ly}}_{H}(\\bm{\\lambda}). Scott and Sokal also proposed a soft-core version of independence polynomial [ref]64, with which they derived a weak dependency version of the local lemma.\nThis inspired us to study a soft-core independence polynomial parameterized by the interactions: Intuitively, for every hyperedge e𝑒e completely contained in a set S𝑆S, we assign a “penalty” βesubscript𝛽𝑒\\beta_{e} for violating the “hard-core” constraint.\nZeros in the interaction parameter are also known as Fisher zeros . Compared to Lee-Yang zeros that have been extensively studied, general results for Fisher zeros have been limited until the recent introduction of contraction method [ref]57  . However, these contraction methods crucially rely on a self-avoiding walk construction, which breaks up the uniformity of hypergraphs and is therefore ill-suited for our purpose. The point 𝝀=1𝝀1\\bm{\\lambda}=1 in ZHly​(𝝀)subscriptsuperscript𝑍ly𝐻𝝀Z^{\\mathrm{ly}}_{H}(\\bm{\\lambda}) and the point 𝜷=0𝜷0\\bm{\\beta}=0 in ZHfs​(𝜷)superscriptsubscript𝑍𝐻fs𝜷Z_{H}^{\\mathrm{fs}}(\\bm{\\beta}) are of particular interests, as they correspond to the uniform enumeration of independent sets.\nThis is a prominent\nexample of models where the known regime of zero-freeness, corresponding to an algebraic phase transition, has significantly lagged behind the known regime where\nefficient algorithms are available.\nAs one of the early examples where approximate counting and sampling algorithms were devised for a constraint satisfaction problem under a local lemma type condition,  showed that the Glauber dynamics on independent sets of k𝑘k-uniform hypergraph mixes rapidly provided the maximum degree Δ≲2k/2less-than-or-similar-toΔsuperscript2𝑘2\\Delta\\lesssim 2^{k/2}, and this is matched, up to the leading constants, by an earlier NP-hardness result for Δ≳2k/2greater-than-or-equivalent-toΔsuperscript2𝑘2\\Delta\\gtrsim 2^{k/2} in .\nSince then, several developments have followed suit, including perfect samplers   and a local sampler , all within similar regimes, albeit with poly(k)𝑘(k) factors.\nRemarkably, the latter can be derandomized to yield a deterministic approximate counting algorithm. For zero-freeness results, however, progress has lagged significantly despite numerous efforts.\nWhile there is a rich literature on models with pairwise interactions, understanding of the more physically relevant regime involving higher-order interactions remains limited,\nand techniques for locating complex zeros for higher-order interactions are less developed. Only recently, Galvin, McKinley, Perkins, Sarantis and Tetali  established the existence of a zero-free disk for λ𝜆\\lambda centered at the origin with radius ≈1e​Δabsent1eΔ\\approx\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}\\Delta} for hypergraphs of maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta.\nLater, Bencs and Buys  improved this result to match Shearer’s bound for the independence polynomial on graphs.\nFor zero-freeness in a complex neighborhood around the positive real axis,\nit implicitly follows from the lifting paradigm of   applied to the contraction method of  , that zero-freeness holds around 𝝀=1𝝀1\\bm{\\lambda}=1 for Δ≤5Δ5\\Delta\\leq 5.\nThis is also carried out more explicitly by  . Despite these advances, a significant gap remains compared to the algorithmic transition, which holds up to Δ≲2k/2less-than-or-similar-toΔsuperscript2𝑘2\\Delta\\lesssim 2^{k/2}. Essentially, existing techniques for proving zero-freeness are insufficient to exploit the uniformity of hyperedges.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: largest root of the independence polynomial; a tight runtime analysis of the celebrated Moser-Tardos algorithm for the algorithmic Lovász local lemma is characterized by the independence polynomial [ref]40; independence polynomial is also known as the hardcore model for equilibrium of lattice-gas in statistical physics [ref]64; it is also the first example where a sharp computational complexity\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
