      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Uplink Scheduling in NOMA-URLLC Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst, allowing the BS to poll multiple devices in a frame drastically increases the action space. For kùëòk devices, the decision maker needs to choose between 2ksuperscript2ùëò2^{k} actions, which is exponential in kùëòk. Few solutions have been proposed to address this problem in the literature. The most common one is proposed in . The authors‚Äô idea is to project the large discrete action space in a continuous action space and thus solve a continuous action RL problem with the traditional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm [ref]22. However, this approach assumes that the discrete action space can be embedded in a continuous space, which is not straightforward for our Multiple Access (MA) problem. An alternative is the work of [ref]23. The authors solve a high dimensional action space RL problem with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to sequentially predict the action vector, one dimension after the other. Nevertheless, not only does this algorithm assume that we know how to order the action dimensions, but the Q-value estimated for the last dimension is very noisy, especially when kùëòk is large. An extension of this paper is the Branching Dueling Q-Network (BDQ) . The authors solve a RL problem with a kùëòk-dimensional action space using a dueling architecture where there is a value network common for all dimensions and kùëòk advantage networks, one for every dimension. Yet, not only is this solution ill-suited to manage partial observability, but it also cannot account for any prior knowledge the agent might have regarding the dynamics of the environment. Second, as the BS is not aware of the whole environment and takes decisions solely based on partial observations of the environmental state, our problem can be modeled by a POMDP¬†. When observations are not Markovian, traditional RL algorithms work with history dependent policies, an approach that can be rapidly computationally intractable as the number of possible histories grows exponentially with the horizon.\nA way to alleviate this problem is to introduce belief states, a probability distribution over the states, which is also a sufficient statistic for the past history and the initial state distribution. A POMDP can be then reformulated as a MDP in which the state space is the continuous belief state space. Traditional RL methods like Q-learning or policy gradient algorithms can finally be used on the resulting belief-MDP¬†[ref]26. Three main methods are proposed in the literature to derive or estimate a belief state: 1) the belief update formula [ref]26, 2) a RNN  and 3) a generative model . However, all these methods suffer from major drawbacks. While the belief update formula requires the knowledge of the environment dynamics (transition and observation function), using a RNN or a generative model introduces a new layer of complexity since there are now two phases involved: the belief estimation and the computation of the optimal policy. Additionally, since Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are black boxes, it is impossible to add any prior knowledge that the agent might have about the environment. Moreover, the learned beliefs are difficult to interpret and error might be propagated to the policy optimization phase. An alternative to the belief state is the notion of information state  or internal state [30, Section 12.4.2]. The idea is to derive a function of the history which is a sufficient statistic for estimating the environmental state. However, learning such a sufficient representation of the history is difficult as it is often task-specific.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: idea is to project the large discrete action space in a continuous action space and thus solve a continuous action RL problem with the traditional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm [ref]22.
