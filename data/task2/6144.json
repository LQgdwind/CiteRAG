      "content": "Paper Title: GPU-initiated Fine-grained Overlap of Collective Communication with Computation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning is currently being used across wide variety of applications ranging from classification (e.g., fraud detection, medical diagnostics, facial recognition), pattern analysis (e.g., product recommendations, stock price prediction) to content generation (e.g., code generation, chatbots, image/video generation). Machine learning (ML) models are increasing in size to tackle more complex problems. Studies  have shown that the model sizes have increased by 5 orders of magnitude between 2018 to 2022. Large ML models have consequently fueled the development of distributed systems capable of meeting their capacity and compute requirements. Subsequently, parallelization techniques have been developed to efficiently map ML models on to distributed systems . The resulting communication in distributed ML models (e.g., for weight updates, activation exchanges between layers etc.) becomes a significant bottleneck [ref]43  as the system scale grows. Depending on the ML parallelism strategy (e.g., data, tensor, or model parallelism), there may be opportunities to hide or overlap communication with independent compute. For example in data parallel models, AllReduce collectives can be overlapped with an independent gradient computation  1. However, growing model sizes has increased the preference for space-efficient parallelism strategies , like tensor-parallelism and fully-sharded data parallelism . Such parallelism strategies often result in collective communication which are difficult to hide due to the absence of independent computation. ML trends are also influencing system design and architecture development. Figure 1 compares a traditional CPU-GPU multi-node system with a state-of-the-art node design optimized for HPC/ML. Other than compute and memory improvements, we notice two broad trends. Firstly, intra- and inter-node communication bandwidth and latency have been improved using proprietary interconnects  and high-bandwidth network interface cards (NICs). Secondly, given the increased preference to use GPUs for ML workloads, GPUs are becoming the primary computation engine tightly integrated with on-node CPUs and NICs. In addition more and more GPUs are directly communicating with the network using high-radix switches or direct-attached NICs . However, applications have yet to fully embrace these trends and often rely on the CPU [ref]42 1 to perform remote communication. Recent GPUDirect RDMA   technology somewhat combats this and enables data to be directly moved between GPU memory and NIC, but the communication is still triggered by the host CPU and often at kernel boundaries. Such approaches are mostly suitable for bulk-synchronous applications where communication can be overlapped with independent computation at the kernel granularity and the kernel-launch overhead is amortized using large kernels. Using GPUDirect, applications with dependent communication and computation must be tiled and pipelined at the kernel granularity to achieve overlapping. Tiling (with smaller sizes) increases the number of kernel invocations resulting in kernel-launch overhead, while kernel-level pipelining adds GPU stream management overhead. Furthermore, kernel-granular overlap may result in additional computational overhead to merge the individual partial results 3. In this paper, we aim to address the growing bottleneck of collective communication by fusing and overlapping communication and dependent computation using intra-kernel GPU-initiated networking. Our approach is easy to apply and leverages the existing workgroup-level work partitioning in GPU applications. By immediately scheduling non-blocking network transactions, data fragments are communicated as they are computed without waiting for kernel completion. We have developed a single, self-contained persistent GPU kernel  where one or more logical workgroups (WGs) upon completing their share of computations, issue non-blocking transactions to communicate their results to remote GPUs. We demonstrate our approach by creating a fused communication-computation kernel, which is unique compared to existing approaches   that exclusively fuse only computation kernels. Specifically we create an embedding + All-to-All operator as a persistent kernel which overlaps embedding operations and their dependent All-to-All collective in deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) . We further propose remote communication-aware scheduling of the logical WGs within each persistent WG, where the logical WGs outputting data for remote communication are scheduled ahead of the logical WGs outputting data for local consumption in order to maximize communication overlap. For the locally communicated data, we develop zero-copy fused kernels where the GPU threads directly store their computed results to all-to-all destination buffers. Unlike prior kernel-granular approaches, our approach overlaps dependent remote communication with computation at the finer granularity of a WG cluster. GPU-initiated communication eliminates the need for CPU resources to perform remote communication and reduces the peak bandwidth requirement because network transactions are spread across the application’s entire execution time. Within peer-to-peer connected GPUs, zero-copy fused kernels eliminate intermediate stores to local GPU memory. Furthermore, our GPU-centric approach embraces the emerging trend of tight GPU-network integration   as shown in Fig. 1b. This paper makes the following key contributions: We propose a novel approach to overlap collective communication with computation at a slice granularity using GPU-initiated communication. We propose fused computation-communication kernels that combine collective communication with computation within the same kernel, thus reducing peak bandwidth and CPU resource requirements. Further, we propose zero-copy fused kernels where the results are directly written to the peer GPU memory thereby eliminating intermediate buffering and copy operations. We further propose a remote communication-aware WG scheduling optimization where the WGs computing remote embedding slices are scheduled first thereby maximizing the opportunity to overlap remote communication. We implement the fused embedding + All-to-All operator as a persistent kernel in HIP 0, along with remote communication-aware WG scheduling, and evaluate its benefits using both GPU hardware and simulations. Our evaluations show our approach achieves 31% lower latency than the baseline’s embedding operations and All-to-All collectives. We evaluate the design trade-offs for using GPU-initiated communication and highlight the factors critical to achieve effective overlap with low overhead.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: map ML models on to distributed systems .
