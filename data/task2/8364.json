      "content": "Paper Title: Instance-Aware Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe vision community has widely adopted Transformer-based architectures [ref]38 [ref]31          to solve RES task. VLT  uses cross-attention to produce vector queries from multimodal features. Similarly, LAVT  shows that early cross-modal fusion of features improves alignment. CRIS  leverages CLIP’s robust image-text alignment capabilities to perform pixel-text contrastive learning. VATEX [ref]27 decomposes language cues into object and context understanding and leverages vision-aware text features to improve text understanding. Recently, ReMamber  integrates the power of Mamba to explicitly model image-text interaction while Mask Grounding  explicitly learns the correspondence between text and visual tokens. ReLA  introduces a region-based GRES baseline that models the relationship both among different image regions and between regions and words. DMMI  introduces two decoder branches for bidirectional information flow, where the text-to-image decoder localizes the target based on text queries, and the image-to-text decoder reconstructs erased entity phrases to enhance visual feature representations. LMQFormer  enhances segmentation with Gaussian-based fusion, dynamic query focus, and an auxiliary loss to prevent query collapse. Mask2Former  pioneered instance segmentation by leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, applying Hungarian matching   between predicted instances and ground truth based on both class and mask costs. Building on this, ReferFormer  and VATEX [ref]27 integrate instance matching in the context of referring expressions, focusing on segmenting a single object per expression. Both models utilize instance-matching mechanisms to align object query and target object described in the language input, getting precise segmentation in one-to-one scenarios.\nHowever, their reliance on binary segmentation limits their performance when handling expressions involving multiple objects or ambiguous descriptions, as they lack the capacity for multi-instance differentiation.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: The vision community has widely adopted Transformer-based architectures [ref]38 [ref]31          to solve RES task.
