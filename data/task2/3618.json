      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Video Text Spotting with Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare TransDeTR against state-of-the-art methods in terms of three tasks, i.e., video text detection, video text tracking and video text spotting. Video text detection.\nFollowing previous works¬†[ref]4, ICDAR2013 video as a popular public dataset is used for use to verify the effectiveness of TransDeTR.\nTable¬†4 presents the video text detection performance on ICDAR2013¬†(video)¬†.\nTransDeTR achieves the best result among methods without any bells and whistles.\nCompare with Free¬†[ref]4 using a powerful base detector EAST¬†[ref]56, our TransDeTR still achieves 1.4%percent1.41.4\\% F-measure improvement without hand-crafted components such as NMS.\nTherefore, we consider that the query-based temporal modeling from our TransDeTR can help the network to learn a better feature representation for video text detection.\nNote: we do not evaluate the performance on ICDAR2015 video due to the test set annotation of that is not available. Video text tracking. Since the tracking task is the core task in this work, we adopt four common datasets(i.e., ICDAR2015¬†, YVT¬†(video)¬†, ICDAR2013¬†(video)¬† and Minetto¬†) to evaluate the task.\nTable¬†5 presents performance comparison on ICDAR2015¬†(video)¬†.\nWithout convolutions and hand-crafted components such as NMS, our TransDeTR achieves a great improvement of 7.6%percent7.67.6\\% IDF1subscriptIDF1{\\rm ID_{F1}} than the current SOTA method¬†[ref]4.\nThis is reasonable, M‚Äã-‚ÄãTrackedM-Tracked{\\rm M\\mbox{-}Tracked} of TransDeTR is obvious improvement with 5.4%percent5.45.4\\%, which denotes TransDeTR can track text instance more robustly and accurately.\nFor the improvement, Fig.¬†3 presents more direct visualization with less false negatives.\nBesides, compare with the previous works(e.g., Free¬†[ref]4) using multi-stage matching and refinement, our TransDeTR is a simple end-to-end framework.\nAs for ICDAR2013 video dataset, compared with YORO¬†, our TransDeTR present better performance with 4.7%percent4.74.7\\% IDF1subscriptIDF1{\\rm ID_{F1}} and 7.4%percent7.47.4\\% MOTAMOTA{\\rm MOTA} improvements, while its inference speed is faster.\nFor Minetto and YVT datasets, our TransDeTR also shows a powerful performance with 2.4%percent2.42.4\\% and 1.7%percent1.71.7\\% MOTA improvements than the previous methods, respectively.\nThe better performance on YVT verify the robustness and generalization of our TransDeTR, while the model is trained on ICDAR2015 video and test directly on its test set.\nBesides, to further present the effectiveness of TransDeTR, we visualize the tracking and spotting results of Free¬†[ref]4(SOTA method) and TransDeTR in Figure¬†3.\nCompared with Free¬†[ref]4, our TransDeTR shows a more stable and accurate tracking trajectory by alleviating the problem of ID switching and object missing¬†(red circle).\nAnd more statistics and analysis can be found in Fig.¬†3.4 and ablation study. Video text spotting.\nVideo text spotting task, as the final aim, requires one to simultaneously track and recognize text instances accurately in a video sequence.\nTable¬†6 provides the performance comparison of the task on ICDAR2015(video)¬†.\nTransDeTR inherits the advantage from query-based tracking, achieves 11.3%percent11.311.3\\% (IDF1subscriptIDF1{\\rm ID_{F1}}) with 7.7%percent7.77.7\\%(MOTAMOTA{\\rm MOTA}) improvements than the current SOTA method, while the inference speed is faster¬†(16.716.716.7 FPS v.sformulae-sequenceùë£ùë†v.s 9.09.09.0 FPS).\nMeanwhile, TransDeTR drastically reduces the ‚ÄòMostly Lost‚Äô by alleviating up to 15.0%percent15.015.0\\% false negatives.\nBesides, comparing the SOTA method Free¬†[ref]4 with a complicated pipeline(e.g., NMS, Aggregation, Match and Score), our TransDeTR is a simple and clean framework without hand-crafted components.\nAnd more surprising is our TransDeTR is a real end-to-end trainable framework, compared previous works with multiple models and hand-crafted strategies.\nTo further present the effectiveness of the proposed method, we list more high-quality visualization results in Figure.¬†4.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: We compare TransDeTR against state-of-the-art methods in terms of three tasks, i.e., video text detection, video text tracking and video text spotting.
