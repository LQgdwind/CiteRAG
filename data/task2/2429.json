Positive/Negative Approximate Multipliers for DNN Accelerators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate our method, we conducted evaluation experiments with other state-of-the-art methods that employ approximate computing techniques, such as fixed approximation across all layers of an NN, or similar fine-grain weight-based approximation mapping. Specifically, we chose the following methods for evaluation comparison: Exact: This method uses exact 8-bit multipliers and is therefore the baseline for our experiments. ALWANN¬†[ref]6: This method utilizes approximate multipliers from the library in¬†[ref]13 and employs weight-tuning to minimize the error that the approximate multiplications incur. Note that all multipliers used in this method are fixed and do not comprise different modes of operation. Additionally, this method utilizes non-uniform approximate architectures across the network (i.e., different approximate multiplier per layer) eliminating flexibility and applicability to other networks and datasets when implemented in hardware. For this reason and for fair comparisons, we consider an homogeneous architecture for¬†[ref]6. In our evaluation, for each use case, we considered all of the Pareto-optimal approximate multipliers described in¬†[ref]13, as different NN might require different approximate multiplier from¬†[ref]13 to satisfy the accuracy loss threshold. LVRM¬†: This is a more fine-grain weight mapping approach that employs a low-variance reconfigurable multiplier and additionally applies a constant error correction term by modifying the biases of the filters. ConVar¬†: This work uses fix approximation enhanced with a run-time error correction method.  induces high approximation at multiplier level to achieve high energy gains and relies on the error correction to achieve high accuracy at convolution and consequently inference levels. Filter Balanced Sets (FBS): In this method we use the proposed positive/negative multiplier and we employ the concept of LDM on all the weights of all the layers to create two balanced summation sets per filter, instead of applying this concept on just the residue weights as we do in our methodology. By comparing with this method, we want to showcase that just creating balanced sets per layer (from step 1) leads to a biased error and suboptimal results. For fair comparison, we tried all zùëßz combinations and we selected the one that satisfies the accuracy thresholds and yields the highest energy gains. All the aforementioned methods do not require retraining as our methodology.\nIn addition, they enable us to evaluate our work against the state of the art, i.e., fixed approximation with statistical error correction¬†[ref]6 and¬†, but also against more fine-grain run-time reconfigurable approximation¬†. We additionally evaluated the methods presented in¬†   and¬†, however they are not included in our analysis for the following reasons. Both works in¬†  require the retraining of the considered NNs. On the other hand, our proposed method, ALWANN¬†[ref]6, LVRM¬†, and ConVar¬† do not require retraining eliminating also the associated time overhead. By bypassing NN retraining, the accuracy delivered by¬†  was poor and did not satisfy any of the considered accuracy thresholds. Furthermore, the work in¬† is based on 16-bit inference and also produced very poor accuracy when considering 8-bit quantization, as in our analysis. Additionally, although the work in¬† provided acceptable results for the CIFAR-10 dataset, it did not result in admissible accuracy losses for the CIFAR-100 dataset. The latter is in compliance with the authors conclusion that for simple models the retraining can be avoided when using approximate multipliers, but for complex ones the accuracy drops significantly without retraining. Consequently, we did not include the aforementioned works in our evaluation, since we aim for strict accuracy loss constraints that, almost always¬†    failed to satisfy.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: mapping.
