      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Graph Matching Network for Graph Similarity Computation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph-theory based methods. The A* algorithm  is widely used for GED computation, which returns the exact result. A* is a best-first algorithm that tries to find an optimal path in a search tree. The idea is to formulate the problem using a tree structure, in which the root node is the starting point, inner nodes represent partial solutions, and leaf nodes are complete solutions. As A* has exponential time complexity, it is only suitable for small graphs and cannot finish in a reasonable time for large graphs. Several heuristics have been proposed to improve the execution time, which sacrifice accuracy for efficiency. For example, BEAM utilizes beam search to avoid searching the full search space and introduces a heuristic rule to favor long partial edit paths over shorter ones . Some methods measure GED via linear programing . Based on bipartite graph matching, Hungarian  and VJ  replace the cost of editing a node by the cost of editing the 1-star graph centered at this node. The cost of substituting a star graph by another one is further expressed as the solution of a square linear sum assignment problem. HED  matches the nodes in two graphs using their local structures, and GED is approximated by the Hausdorff distance  between the nodes in the two graphs. To compute MCS, a branch and bound algorithm is used in MC-SPLIT [ref]21, which induces the result by finding a maximum-cardinality mapping between the graphs. Learning-based methods. The learning based methods usually use graph neural networks (such as GCN) to learn embedding and predict graph similarity using the embedding. SMPNN predicts graph similarity using a summation of the similarities between the nodes in the two graphs [ref]29. GCNMEAN and GCNMAX [ref]30 use GCN  to learn graph embedding and train a fully connected neural network to compute graph similarity from the embedding of two graphs. SIMGNN uses both graph embedding and node similarities to predict graph similarity . GMN  introduces a cross-graph attention layer to allow the nodes in the two graphs to interact with each other but still predicts graph similarity using graph embedding. GraphSIM  utilizes GCN with a different number of layers to build multiple correlation matrices among the nodes in the two graphs and use the correlation matrices to predict graph similarity. Our contributions. HGMN adopts successful techniques from existing learning based methods, e.g., applying GCN to learn node embedding and using the node correlation matrix as input for neural network. However, HGMN has two fundamental differences from existing learning-based methods. First, we use multiple stages of spectral clustering to create a multi-scale view of the similarity between graphs. The hierarchical clustering provides more information for the downstream neural network as the differences between two graphs can be captured in the correlation matrices of different scales. Second, we explicitly align the nodes in the two graphs using the earth mover distance and computes correlation matrix in the aligned order. Node alignment ensures that the correlation matrix is the same under arbitrary node permutation and thus the neural network does not need to learn to be robust to node permutation. We will show in the experiments that both designs are crucial for performance, especially on large graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: in two graphs using their local structures, and GED is approximated by the Hausdorff distance  between the nodes in the two graphs.
