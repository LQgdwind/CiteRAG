      "content": "Paper Title: A Generative Model For Raw Audio Using Transformer Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAudio synthesis has long fascinated musicians, computer scientists, and researchers and has been one of the core building blocks of computer music. FM synthesis by John Chowning  is an example of distortion-based frequency domain synthesis with which complex, time-varying spectra can be modeled. An early time-domain technique that generated a particular class of realistic audio was the Karplus Strong algorithm . An early example presaging physical modeling, it could generate transient waveforms using a filtered delay line loop for the synthesis of plucked string and percussion-like sounds. These are examples of techniques that generate waveforms given a set of parameters. The difficulty of modeling musical structure at longer time scales has been well summarized in [ref]4. In this paper, we propose a generative framework using transformers to synthesize audio waveforms. We show how the approach can outperform the classic wavenet model  that has become a fundamental building block for a variety of audio synthesis frameworks. Wavenet, based upon causal dilated convolutional filters, is an auto-regressive architecture. By conditioning on the desired metadata, it surpassed state-of-the-art Text-to-Speech synthesis in 2016. Wavenet-based sub-block architectures have been used subsequently in problems such as speech denoising , instrument conversion , and as a vocoder  to go from spectral to time-domain signals. For problems such as source separation and denoising the generative process is conditioned implicitly on a learned latent representation, where for vocoder-based application, it is conditioned explicitly on a spectral representation (typically mel-spectrum) which guides the generation process. An end-to-end architecture, proposed in   used a dilated convolution-based generator for end-to-end source separation.\nHigh-fidelity synthesis was proposed in 0 using a teacher-student framework, by utilization of the idea of distillation to guide the training of neural architecture. Using self-supervised learning, where the goal is to predict the next sample given the previous context, wavenet can also learn latent representations in problems such as speech recognition. Representation learning has been an active area of research in supervised and self-supervised setups 1 2 3. As we can see, there are a variety of applications encompassing a broad spectrum that employ wavenet-based generators for waveform synthesis. The main advantage of end-to-end learning is to mitigate the transformation from spectrogram to waveform for audio signals. Spectral inversion has been explored in a variety of ways, with the classic work 4 which converts magnitude STFT spectra to time-domain signals. The idea of synthesis/generation conditioned on the external application has been explored for a variety of domains and applications. It enables the fixed-parameter neural architectures to be more expressive in terms of controlling/guiding the output. It was shown in 5 6 7 that by conditioning wavenet-inspired architectures, audio can be converted from one domain to another. Wavenet-inspired models have also shown success in areas such as speech recognition and latent representation learning from spectral inputs 8. Longer-term contexts, captured by latent representation, can then guide a synthesis network for packet loss concealment approach as described in 9. The approach has been explored in natural language processing too, to guide generated language according to metadata such as sentiment and ratings 0. Problems such as text-to-speech synthesis, explored conditioning according to desired characteristics such as speaker ID, prosody, sentiment to guide the generated spectral representation. 1. For audio analysis, early studies have shown how initial layers of neural architecture can learn spectral representations in speech recognition 2 and frequency estimation 3. The front end adapts according to the problem of interest. In 3 the front end adapts to learn a non-linear non-constant bandwidth filter-bank that outperforms traditional Fourier representations (which are fixed for all applications). This gives the network an ability to first implicitly learn an analysis-synthesis pipeline based upon internal latent representations. There have been several variants and advancements improving on shortcomings of the wavenet architecture. Researchers in 4 proposed an architecture that could do raw waveform auto-regressive synthesis on raw waveforms using CPU only, almost in real-time. The core idea in this paper is to apply Transformer architectures. First proposed in 5, these have revolutionized modern deep learning by providing an ability for modeling long-term sequences. The basic premise is first to learn important parts of the input via the technique’s attention mechanism, followed by feed-forward architectures that can map them to a separable appropriate latent space. This can be repeated at multiple levels to learn a hierarchy of features. The idea was proposed in 1991 6. With this simplicity, it turns out these architectures can have enormous power to model a variety of modalities, such as music 7, audio 8, text 9 3, protein sequences 0, videos1 2 and vision 3 4 to name a few. The main drawback comes with the attention block which scales quadratically both in terms of computational and memory constraints. This reduces their effectiveness at scale, such as when attempting much longer sequences, for example, 5 minutes of music at the waveform level [ref]4. It is however an active area of research with possibilities that remain to be explored. Imposing sparsity 5 has been shown to improve the capability of these architectures over longer-term sequences. Other techniques have tried learning latent representation using VQ-VAEs 6. The idea of learning on latent representations of the input can be used to encapsulate various attributes of the input signal in a compact code, like pitch, timbre, and rhythm for music, as shown in 1. It enables to model audio signal at a much smaller scale which the techniques used in 5 can easily capture. By modeling the latent representations of the future with a transformer, one can guide a conditioned waveform generator on these future latent predictions. This was done by 7 to produce compelling results. It was, however, based on heavy conditioning, and was not an end-to-end approach. Similar approaches were used for problems such as speech recognition 8 9 to mimic BERT 3 pre-training for speech signals. The main reason for the good performance of these architectures are i) The ability of these architectures to model long sequences ii) self-supervised training enables the performance to scale well with data . Recent approaches of improving Transformers by combining ideas from Mixture of Expert models  using up to a trillion parameters makes the current work and the road ahead even more exciting. The contributions of the current work are as follows:\n i) We propose a state-of-the-art neural network architecture that outperforms the traditional wavenet architecture by 6-11% on a similar dataset with the task of prediction of the next sample. ii) We propose conditioned Transformer-based generative models that show that they can give a further performance boost over the unconditioned Transformer. This has the potential for a variety of setups and conditions in the future. iii) As with the classic wavenet architecture, this provides a new method for many applications that rely on neural architectures for a conditioned audio generation like TTS, instrument/voice transformation, speech denoising, source separation, music generation, spectral inversion to name a few. Section I gives a brief introduction and outlines related work in the field, Section II describes the dataset used for the current problem, followed by the methodology used in our paper. Section 4 compares the results with baseline wavenet architectures followed by the conclusion and future work in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: sounds.
