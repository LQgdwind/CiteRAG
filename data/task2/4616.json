      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamics-Adaptive Continual Reinforcement Learning via Progressive Contextualization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual learning considers how to learn a sequence of tasks while maintaining the performance on previously learned tasks.\nIt is conceptually related to incremental learning and online learning as they all assume that tasks or samples are presented in a sequential manner.\nAlthough incremental learning and continual learning are frequently used interchangeably in the literature, they are not always the same. In some studies  , incremental learning is used to describe a learning process where a sequence of incremental tasks are learned in a continual manner â€” in this case, continual learning can be referred to as incremental learning. Nevertheless, several other studies on incremental learning    concentrate on how to incrementally adjust the previously learned policy to facilitate the fast adaptation to a new task, while not considering the agent performance on old tasks.\nOnline learning aims to fit a single model to a single task over a sequence of data instances without any adaptation to new tasks or concerns for the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting .\nAnother related field is multitask learning  , which tries to train a single model on multiple tasks simultaneously, rather than learning tasks sequentially. A variety of approaches have been investigated to tackle catastrophic forgetting or interference in the CRL community. They can be classified into three major categories according to how the knowledge of previous tasks is retained and leveraged: replay-based, regularization-based, and expansion-based.\nThe core idea of replay-based approaches is to store samples of past tasks [ref]35 [ref]36 [ref]37 or generate pseudo-samples from a generative model  to maintain the knowledge about the past in the model. These previous task samples are replayed while learning a new task in the form of either being reused as model inputs for rehearsal [ref]35  or constraining the optimization of the new task [ref]37 [ref]36, yielding decent results against catastrophic forgetting. An inherent drawback is the constraint on the memory capacity as the number of tasks grows. Although the generative model can be exempted from this limitation, its own training process can also suffer from forgetting.\nRegularization-based approaches protect learned knowledge from forgetting by imposing an extra regularization term on the learning objective, penalizing large updates on important weights  or policies   for previous tasks while learning new tasks. This family of solutions is easy to implement and tends to perform well on a small set of tasks, but still faces performance trade-offs on the new and old tasks as the number of tasks increases.\nExpansion-based approaches incrementally expand new architectural resources such as the network capacity  or a policy library   in response to new information. These strategies avoid catastrophic forgetting by protecting all weights for the past tasks from being perturbed by the new information but the knowledge transfer between tasks and the scalability may be limited. For CRL in dynamic environments, in addition to appropriately adapt the above methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, the greatest challenge comes from detecting the changes of environment autonomously.\nFor instance, regret minimization algorithms can be applied to MDPs with varying transition probability and reward functions, which assume a finite number and degree of MDP changes and detect them based on sliding windows    or kernel estimators. In both cases, the algorithms consider a finite horizon and minimize the regret over this horizon, without any concerns for the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting.\nRLCD is a model-based approach that estimates the prediction quality of different models and instantiates new ones when none of the existing models performs well. An extension of RLCD replaces the quality measure by the CUSUM-based method to perform change-point detection .\nUnlike our method, however, these methods are only applicable to purely discrete settings. There are also some studies that focus on facilitating fast adaptation to new tasks in continuous dynamic environments. In  and , CUSUM-based change detection mechanisms are combined with well known RL algorithms, such as REINFORCE and SAC , to promote adaptation to new tasks.\nNagabandi et al.  used meta-learning to train a prior over dynamics models that can, when combined with recent data, be rapidly adapted to the new contexts. This method requires an explicit pre-training phase on all tasks, which is not possible under our CRL settings.\nLLIRL is a recently proposed method that employs the EM algorithm, together with a CRP prior on the context distribution, to learn an infinite mixture model to cluster the tasks incrementally over time. In this way, it can selectively retrieve previous experiences of the same clusters to facilitate the adaptation to the new task.\nSimilar to , LLIRL optimizes two separate sets of network parameters to train the behavior policy and parameterize the environment for each instantiated context, respectively, which greatly increases the training and memory cost. Furthermore, the above studies mainly focus on fast adaptation without considering catastrophic interference among in-context tasks and knowledge transfer among between-context tasks, which are critical issues to be addressed in CRL. For CRL in dynamic environments, several efforts focus on model-free methods that perform context division directly based on experienced transitions. Context QL applies an ODCP algorithm to state-reward sequences to detect environmental changes. Afterwards, it either learns a new Q table for the newly detected context, or improves the policy learned if the current context has been previously experienced. This work assumes a preknown pattern and a finite number of changes, since ODCP can only determine whether the context has changed, instead of the specific label. Meanwhile, it is only applicable to RL problems with a small and discrete state-action space due to the Q-tables in use.\nCRL-Unsup detects distributional shifts for continuous dynamic environments by tracking the difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages of rewards. When changes are detected, it consolidates the memory using EWC to prevent catastrophic forgetting. This method requires storing all policy weights learned before each EWC process is triggered and can be problematic in the case of a positive forward transfer followed by a negative backward transfer.\nRecently, IQ shows that performing context division by online clustering and training a multihead neural network with the knowledge distillation technique can alleviate the catastrophic interference caused by data distribution drift in the single-task RL. However, it requires a predetermined number of contexts, which limits its applicability in dynamic environments. Our proposed method DaCoRL falls in the combination of regularization-based and expansion-based categories. It performs policy learning using an expandable multihead neural network that has been proved in  to be helpful to generalize the knowledge and result in a more effective feature extraction and transfer in multitask learning, avoiding the burden of multiple networks training and storing. To lift the restriction of predetermined number of contexts, we introduce an incremental context detection module, which can instantiate contexts incrementally as needed. Furthermore, the knowledge distillation technique can effectively reduce the interference among both between-context and in-context tasks, making it possible to conduct effective continual learning in dynamic environments with a single policy network.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: to how the knowledge of previous tasks is retained and leveraged: replay-based, regularization-based, and expansion-based.\nThe core idea of replay-based approaches is to store samples of past tasks [ref]35 [ref]36 [ref]37 or generate pseudo-samples from a generative model  to maintain the knowledge about the past in the model.
