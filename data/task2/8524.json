      "content": "Paper Title: No-Regret Learning in Harmonic Games: Extrapolation in the Face of Conflicting Interests\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe question of “as if” rationality – that is, whether selfishly-minded, myopic agents may learn to behave “as if” they were fully rational – has been one of the cornerstones of non-cooperative game theory, and for good reason.\nEspecially in modern applications of game theory to machine learning and data science – from online ad auctions to recommender systems and multi-agent reinforcement learning – the standard postulates of rationality (knowledge of the game, capacity to compute an equilibrium, flawless execution of equilibrium strategies, common knowledge of rationality, etc.) are almost never met in practice;\nas a result, game-theoretic predictions that rely on these assumptions are likewise put into question.\nBy contrast, given the ease of implementing and deploying cheap, computationally efficient learning algorithms and policies at a large scale, it is often more logical to turn to the policy being deployed as the object of interest.\nThe aim is then to understand its long-run behavior – and, in particular, whether it ultimately leads to equilibrium. A major obstacle in this approach is the complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium, a problem which is known to be complete for PPAD – and hence intractable – by the seminal work of Daskalakis et al. .\nThis result implies that it is not plausible to expect any algorithm to converge to Nash equilibrium in all games (at least, not in a reasonable amount of time), so it dovetails naturally with the impossibility results of Hart & Mas-Colell   who showed that there are no uncoupled learning dynamics that converge to Nash equilibrium in all games.\nOn that account, it is natural to ask in which classes of games we can expect a learning algorithm to converge, in which classes we cannot, and under what conditions. Perhaps the most well-behaved class of games in terms of learning is the class of potential games  , where players have common interests – not necessarily driving them to play the same strategy, but in the sense that externalities are symmetric and aligned along a common objective (the potential of the game).\nIn this class of games, the behavior of learning dynamics – and, in particular, no-regret learning       [ref]27   – are relatively well understood, and there is a wide range of equilibrium convergence results, from continuous to discrete time, and even with bandit, payoff-based feedback   . By contrast, in the presence of conflicting interests, the situation can be quite different.\nIn two-player zero-sum games with a fully-mixed equilibrium – such as Matching Pennies – the continuous-time dynamics of no-regret, regularized learning are recurrent in the sense of Poincaré – that is, the induced trajectory of play returns arbitrarily close to where it started infinitely many times  [ref]41.\nIn discrete time, the situation becomes more complicated:\nthe vanilla version of FTRL – the most widely studied family of no-regret algorithms – is no longer recurrent, but it diverges away from equilibrium in the same class of games [ref]42 .\nOn the other hand,\nif players employ an optimistic / extra-gradient variant of FTRL, the induced trajectory of play converges to equilibrium [ref]42  and, under certain conditions, it is even possible to show that it converges at a geometric rate . At the same time, zero-sum games may also admit a potential function, so it is not possible to predict the outcome of a learning process based on where it stands along the potential / zero-sum axis.\nThe non-trivial intersection of these classes means that potential and zero-sum games are not complementary, and this, not only from a strategic, but also from a dynamic viewpoint.\nInstead, the true strategic complement of potential games is the class of harmonic games.\nThis class was first considered by Candogan et al. , who established a remarkable decomposition result:\nEvery game in normal form can be decomposed as the sum of a potential game and a harmonic game, and this decomposition is unique up to affine transformations that do not alter the equilibrium outcomes of the game.\nIn particular, the class of potential and harmonic games intersect trivially (up to strategic equivalence), and all two-player zero-sum games with an interior equilibrium are harmonic, thus lending credence to the fact that it is harmonic games, not zero-sum games, that correctly capture the notion of conflicting interests in this context.\nThis raises the following natural question: What is the behavior of no-regret algorithms and dynamics in harmonic games? Except for a very recent paper by Legacci et al.  (which we discuss below), almost nothing is known on this question.\nAccordingly, against this backdrop, our contributions can be summarized as follows: Starting with a continuous-time model of no-regret learning, we show that all FTRL dynamics are Poincaré recurrent in all harmonic games.\nThis generalizes and extends the recent result of Legacci et al.  for the replicator dynamics in uniform harmonic games (a subclass of harmonic games in which the uniform distribution is always a Nash equilibrium).111In more detail, the way that Legacci et al.  obtained their result hinges on the so-called Shahshahani metric, a choice which is essentially “mandated” by the structure of the replicator dynamics.\nSpecifically, the key property of the Shahshahani metric is that incompressibility of the replicator field is equivalent to the underlying game being uniformly harmonic;\nhowever, finding a variant of the Shahshahani metric attuned to FTRL seems to be a formidable task, and likewise for non-uniform harmonic games.\nBecause of this, the “incompressibility” approach of  does not seem applicable to our setting – at least, not in a straightforward way. In discrete-time models of learning, the standard implementation of FTRL cannot be expected to converge (since it fails to do so in Matching Pennies).\nTo correct this behavior, we consider a flexible algorithmic template, inspired by Azizian et al.  and dubbed extrapolated  (FTRL+), which augments FTRL with a forward-looking, extrapolation step (including as special cases the optimistic and extra-step variants of FTRL, cf. Section 4).\nWe then establish the following results: Under extrapolated , players are guaranteed constant individual regret (so, as a consequence, the players’ empirical frequency of play converges to coarse correlated equilibrium at a rate of 𝒪⁡(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\operatorname{\\mathcal{O}}(1/T)).222We clarify here that “constant” refers to the horizon T𝑇T of play;\nthe dependence on the number of actions may be logarithmic or worse (depending on the specific regularized learning scheme employed by the players).\nThis should be contrasted with the results of   who showed that players can achieve polylogarithmic regret in any game (finite or convex). The induced trajectory of play converges to Nash equilibrium from any initial condition. Our results aim to provide an in-depth understanding of no-regret learning in harmonic games, nesting prior work on 222-player zero-sum games – from Poincaré recurrence  [ref]41 to constant regret [ref]27 and convergence under optimistic / extra-gradient schemes [ref]42    .\nIn partiucular, at a high level, our results show that harmonic games are the canonical complement of potential games, not only from a strategic, but also from a dynamic, learning viewpoint.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: externalities are symmetric and aligned along a common objective (the potential of the game).\nIn this class of games, the behavior of learning dynamics – and, in particular, no-regret learning       [ref]27   – are relatively well understood, and there is a wide range of equilibrium convergence results, from continuous to discrete time, and even with bandit, payoff-based feedback   .
