      "content": "Paper Title: Multimodal Explainability via Latent Shift applied to COVID-19 stratification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last decade, the practice of modern medicine has started to heavily rely on the utilization of data coming from multiple sources [ref]1.\nAt the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved state-of-the-art results in various domains [ref]2, healthcare included.\nNevertheless, most of the deep neural networks applied to medical tasks consider only one data modality, neglecting information available in other sources.\nHowever, analyzing medical findings is multimodal by its very nature: a characteristic that, in turn, asks for developing AI approaches able to process data of different modalities .\nThis has fostered the rise of multimodal deep learning (MDL)  , which aims to develop learning models able to process and link information gathered from different modalities.\nMDL is a topic where researchers have investigated several methods to learn together multimodal information via early, late, and joint fusion , as it will be presented in section 2. With the goal of reaching high performance, many complex AI models developed so far have a black-box nature , neglecting trust and transparency , two features that are of particular importance in biomedicine .\nIndeed, a lack in explainability limits the application of AI models into the clinical practice.\nTo overcome this limitation, in the last years large research efforts have been directed towards explainable AI (XAI), which aims to explain how a black-box model produces its outcomes. In healthcare, the need of multimodal models and of explainability make multimodal explanations vital to develop robust and trustworthy AI models.\nThis happens because multimodal models extract more comprehensive information than the unimodal models, so that their explanations could offer more insights into the available medical data.\nThe multimodal setting of XAI explores the complementary and explanatory strengths of the different modalities, with the goal of obtaining better explanations that localize the relevant features and modalities .\nDespite this relevance, to the best of our knowledge, the biomedical literature lacks of explainable deep multimodal models.\nFor this reason we present a novel end-to-end multimodal architecture, explainable by design, that jointly learns modality reconstructions and multimodal classification using imaging and tabular modalities.\nWith this architecture we extract deep multimodal representations of the data; then, we apply a latent shift to simulate a counterfactual prediction, thus obtaining an intrinsic explanation that reveals how and why the model arrived at a particular decision. We test our approach in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic using the AIforCOVID public dataset [ref]9 for three reasons.\nFirst, the development of AI-based tools supporting COVID-19 prognosis exploiting multimodal data is still an open research issue addressed by few work in the literature [ref]9      , which will be discussed in section 2.\nSecond, while there is a lack of multimodal XAI (MXAI) approaches in general, no one has proposed multimodal explanations to gain trust and transparency in COVID-19 prognosis.\nThird, the AIforCOVID dataset is the largest publicly available repository containing chest X-ray (CXR) images and clinical data collected at the time of hospitalization, further to clinical outcomes stratifying patients into those with and without risk of a severe disease progression .\nIt is worth noting that, in general, images and clinical data are two important sources of information in medicine.\nIndeed, the former allows radiologists to focus on visual evidence for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes, whereas the latter which are usually stores as tabular data, offer to clinicians a concise and multi-dimensional assessment of patients’ health status.\nHence, having both the modalities should be important to test MDL and MXAI approaches that would support the medical decision process. The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows.\nSection 2 introduces the state-of-the art of both MDL and MXAI.\nThen, section 3 presents our novel architecture and training procedure, and it explains the MXAI method extracting multimodal explanations.\nIn section 4 we describe the dataset used to validate the methods, the pre-processing phase on the data, the implementation setup and the validation strategy adopted.\nSection 5 presents and discusses the obtained results, whilst section 6 provides concluding remarks.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In the last decade, the practice of modern medicine has started to heavily rely on the utilization of data coming from multiple sources [ref]1.\nAt the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved state-of-the-art results in various domains [ref]2, healthcare included.\nNevertheless, most of the deep neural networks applied to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
