      "content": "Paper Title: A Study of the Tasks and Models in Machine Reading Comprehension\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the substantial component of the mutual-matching layer, mutual-matching attention is aimed at fusing the contextual embeddings of the question, UQ∈ℝd×msubscript𝑈𝑄superscriptℝ𝑑𝑚U_{Q}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times m}, into those of the context, UC∈ℝd×nsubscript𝑈𝐶superscriptℝ𝑑𝑛U_{C}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times n}, where d𝑑d represents embedding dimensionality, m𝑚m represents question length, and n𝑛n represents context length. To this end, the first step is to calculate the similarity between the contextual embedding of each context word, ucisubscript𝑢subscript𝑐𝑖u_{c_{i}} (i.e. the i𝑖i-th column of UCsubscript𝑈𝐶U_{C}), and that of each question word, uqjsubscript𝑢subscript𝑞𝑗u_{q_{j}} (i.e. the j𝑗j-th column of UQsubscript𝑈𝑄U_{Q}). A similarity function for this purpose, which was originally proposed in BiDAF [ref]30 and has been adopted in many other MRC models [ref]25  [ref]33   , is as follows: where wssubscript𝑤𝑠w_{s} is a trainable weight vector, ⊙direct-product\\odot represents element-wise multiplication, and [;][;] represents vector concatenation. Besides, another similarity function, which has also been widely adopted    , is as follows: where ReLU​()ReLU\\mathrm{ReLU}() represents performing rectified linear activation, and Wssubscript𝑊𝑠W_{s} is a trainable weight matrix. By applying any similarity function described above to every (uci,uqj)subscript𝑢subscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑢subscript𝑞𝑗(u_{c_{i}},u_{q_{j}}) pair, a similarity matrix S∈ℝn×m𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛𝑚S\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m} can be obtained, where each element Si,j=s​(uci,uqj)subscript𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑠subscript𝑢subscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑢subscript𝑞𝑗S_{i,j}=s(u_{c_{i}},u_{q_{j}}). On this basis, the next step is to calculate the context-attended contextual embedding summaries of the question, U~Qsubscript~𝑈𝑄\\tilde{U}_{Q}, and the question-attended contextual embedding summaries of the context, U~Csubscript~𝑈𝐶\\tilde{U}_{C}, which can be obtained by applying the following equations separately [ref]30  [ref]33: where Softmaxr​()subscriptSoftmax𝑟\\mathrm{Softmax}_{r}() represents performing softmax normalization along the row dimension, Tiler​(x,y)subscriptTile𝑟𝑥𝑦\\mathrm{Tile}_{r}(x,y) represents tiling a vector x𝑥x for y𝑦y times along the row dimension, and Maxr​()subscriptMax𝑟\\mathrm{Max}_{r}() represents taking the maximum element of each row. Besides, U~Csubscript~𝑈𝐶\\tilde{U}_{C} can also be obtained by applying the following equation  [ref]25: where Softmaxc​()subscriptSoftmax𝑐\\mathrm{Softmax}_{c}() represents performing softmax normalization along the column dimension. With U~Qsubscript~𝑈𝑄\\tilde{U}_{Q} and U~Csubscript~𝑈𝐶\\tilde{U}_{C} obtained as described above, the final step is to fuse them with UCsubscript𝑈𝐶U_{C}, which can be achieved by concatenating the matrices UCsubscript𝑈𝐶U_{C}, U~Qsubscript~𝑈𝑄\\tilde{U}_{Q}, UC⊙U~Qdirect-productsubscript𝑈𝐶subscript~𝑈𝑄U_{C}\\odot\\tilde{U}_{Q}, and U~C⊙U~Qdirect-productsubscript~𝑈𝐶subscript~𝑈𝑄\\tilde{U}_{C}\\odot\\tilde{U}_{Q} together along the column dimension [ref]30 [ref]25 [ref]33. Alternatively, the matrix concatenation can also be performed over UCsubscript𝑈𝐶U_{C}, U~Qsubscript~𝑈𝑄\\tilde{U}_{Q}, and U~Csubscript~𝑈𝐶\\tilde{U}_{C} , or simply over UCsubscript𝑈𝐶U_{C} and U~Qsubscript~𝑈𝑄\\tilde{U}_{Q} when U~Csubscript~𝑈𝐶\\tilde{U}_{C} is not available . \nWhat is described above is just a general mutual-matching attention mechanism, which is more or less different from those for practical MRC models. For example, SLQA+  applies the following equation to obtain U~Csubscript~𝑈𝐶\\tilde{U}_{C}: and also fuses U~Csubscript~𝑈𝐶\\tilde{U}_{C} with UQsubscript𝑈𝑄U_{Q} as well as U~Qsubscript~𝑈𝑄\\tilde{U}_{Q} with UCsubscript𝑈𝐶U_{C} by applying a gated fusion method. Besides, Match-LSTM  uses an attention-wrapped RNN to process UCsubscript𝑈𝐶U_{C} based on UQsubscript𝑈𝑄U_{Q}. Specifically, given the input ucisubscript𝑢subscript𝑐𝑖u_{c_{i}} and the hidden state hi−1subscriptℎ𝑖1h_{i-1} at each time step, it first calculates zisubscript𝑧𝑖z_{i}, an attended summary of UQsubscript𝑈𝑄U_{Q}, as follows: where wzsubscript𝑤𝑧w_{z} is a trainable weight vector, Tanh​()Tanh\\mathrm{Tanh}() represents performing hyperbolic tangent activation, and WQsubscript𝑊𝑄W_{Q}, WCsubscript𝑊𝐶W_{C}, and WHsubscript𝑊𝐻W_{H} are trainable weight matrices. Then it updates the hidden state with both ucisubscript𝑢subscript𝑐𝑖u_{c_{i}} and zisubscript𝑧𝑖z_{i} as follows: Based on Match-LSTM, R-NET  modifies the attention-wrapped RNN by adding a gate to the update of the hidden state as follows: where Sigmoid​()Sigmoid\\mathrm{Sigmoid}() represents performing sigmoid activation, and WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} is a trainable weight matrix. As a result, the update of the hidden state is somewhat affected by the relevance of the current context to the question.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: and that of each question word, uqjsubscript𝑢subscript𝑞𝑗u_{q_{j}} (i.e. the j𝑗j-th column of UQsubscript𝑈𝑄U_{Q}).
