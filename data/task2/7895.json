      "content": "Paper Title: Formally Certified Approximate Model CountingThe first two authors contributed equally.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nState-of-the-art automated reasoning solvers are critical software systems used\nthroughout formal methods. However, even skilled and trusted developers of such\ntools can inadvertently introduce errors. Two approaches have evolved to\nprovide assurances that automated reasoning tools behave as intended. The first\ninvolves the use of theorem provers to formally verify the correctness of\nsolver implementations  .\nThis approach guarantees correct outputs for all inputs, but struggles to scale\nto complex systems such as SAT solvers. The second approach is based on\ncertifying algorithms , where\na solver is required to produce a certificate alongside its\noutput       .\nA certificate checker (also called proof checker)—which is\noften formally verified—then checks the correctness of this certificate,\nensuring that the system’s output adheres to the desired specifications. This\nlatter method has gained significant traction in the SAT solving community,\nwherein a SAT solver either returns a satisfying assignment that is easy to\ncheck through evaluation or a proof of unsatisfiability as a\ncertificate . However, neither of these\napproaches have been applied to probabilistic systems that rely on\nrandomized algorithms. In fact, McConnell et\nal.  argue that randomized algorithms\nresist deterministic certification. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that harnesses the power of both\ntheorem-proving and certificate-based approaches to certify probabilistic\nsystems. We present our approach on 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}, a probabilistic automated\nreasoning system which computes approximate model counts for Boolean formulas.\nModel counting is a fundamental problem in computer science that serves as a\nkey component in a wide range of applications including\ncontrol improvisation ,\nnetwork reliability  ,\nneural network verification ,\nprobabilistic reasoning    ,\nand so on. Therefore, it is crucial that the results\ncomputed by an approximate model counter, such as 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}, can be trusted. Two key questions must be tackled by our approach. First, what\ndoes it mean to trust a random run of 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}? Here, we propose a\nverification modulo randomness approach, i.e., our certification results\nare modulo a trusted random bit generator. Second, how do we handle the huge\nvolume of (incremental) CNF-XOR satisfiability solver calls which are tightly\nintegrated in 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}  0?\nHere, we design the certificate format to require only the results of solver\ncalls that are crucial for 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}’s correctness. In particular, 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC} makes\n𝒪​(ε−2⋅log⁡n⋅log⁡δ−1)𝒪⋅superscript𝜀2⋅𝑛superscript𝛿1\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\cdot\\log n\\cdot\\log\\delta^{-1}) many calls to its solver, where n𝑛n is the number of\n(projected) variables of the formula, ε𝜀\\varepsilon is the tolerance parameter, and δ𝛿\\delta is the confidence parameter (see Section 3 for definitions); our crucial insight is that to certify 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}, we only need to\ncheck the correctness of 𝒪​(log⁡δ−1)𝒪superscript𝛿1\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\delta^{-1}) UNSAT calls, which is independent of n𝑛n. We then observe that existing CNF-XOR UNSAT checkers\nfail to scale to formulas that are handled by 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}. To this end, we adapt existing\nsolving and verified proof checking pipelines to natively support proof\ncertificates for CNF-XOR unsatisfiability. With this design, our framework is\nable to independently check certificates generated by a state-of-the-art (but\nuntrusted) implementation of 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}, with all of the latter’s\noptimizations enabled. Overall, the key idea is to combine a static,\nonce-off, formal proof of the algorithm’s correctness guarantee in\nIsabelle/HOL   with\ndynamic, per-run, certification of 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}’s calls to an external\nCNF-XOR solver. In summary, our contributions are as follows: An abstract specification of 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC} and a formal proof of its probably\napproximately correct (PAC) guarantee in Isabelle/HOL (Section 4.1). A refinement of the abstract specification to a concrete certificate\nformat and checker implementation for 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢\\mathsf{ApproxMC}\n(Sections 4.2 and 4.3). Updates to various tools to realize a formally verified proof checking\npipeline with native support for CNF-XOR unsatisfiability\n(Section 4.4). Empirical evaluation of the framework on an extensive suite of\nmodel counting benchmarks to demonstrate its practical utility\n(Section 5). Our workflow for certified approximate model counting is shown\nin Fig. 1.\nIn step  1, it uses a trusted external tool to generate uniform random\nbits which are handed to an untrusted certificate generator\n𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍\\mathsf{ApproxMCCert} and to the verified certificate checker 𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖢𝗁𝖾𝖼𝗄𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖢𝗁𝖾𝖼𝗄\\mathsf{CertCheck} (extracted\nfrom Isabelle/HOL);\nthe random bits are used identically by 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍\\mathsf{ApproxMCCert} and 𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖢𝗁𝖾𝖼𝗄𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖢𝗁𝖾𝖼𝗄\\mathsf{CertCheck} to\ngenerate random XOR constraints as part of the counting algorithm.\nFor step  2, 𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖠𝗉𝗉𝗋𝗈𝗑𝖬𝖢𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍\\mathsf{ApproxMCCert} generates a partial certificate\nwhich is subsequently checked in step  3 by\n𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖢𝗁𝖾𝖼𝗄𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖢𝗁𝖾𝖼𝗄\\mathsf{CertCheck}; the certificate is partial because it does not contain\nCNF-XOR unsatisfiability proofs.\nInstead, 𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖢𝗁𝖾𝖼𝗄𝖢𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖢𝗁𝖾𝖼𝗄\\mathsf{CertCheck} calls an external CNF-XOR unsatisfiability checking\npipeline (with verified proof checking in\nCakeML  ).\nIn the final step  4, an approximate model count is returned upon\nsuccessful certification. As part of our commitment to reproducibility, all code and proofs have been made available\nwith a permissive open-source\nlicense [ref]2  4.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: an approximate model count is returned upon\nsuccessful certification.
