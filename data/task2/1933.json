      "content": "Paper Title: Towards On-Device Federated Learning: A Direct Acyclic Graph-based Blockchain Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to solve the privacy problem caused by the data island and make the best use of distributed data on various devices, Federated Learning (FL) has recently drawn much attention, which is a distributed machine learning framework, and participants in FL transfer and communicate the model parameters without revealing user privacy to use their own data to establish machine learning models  . For wireless scenarios, on-device FL is one of the most typical applications where participating nodes of FL are numerous mobile devices under a wireless network [ref]3 [ref]4. Meanwhile, with the advent of 5G era, mobile devices would have sufficient communication bandwidth which makes it possible to establish an efficient FL system on mobile devices. Although FL is widely considered to be a feasible way to enhance privacy and security in 5G wireless networks, it still faces many challenges during deployment . The main two points are as follows. Device asynchrony: Various nodes have different resources for FL in terms of computing, communication, caching, battery power, data, and training time, which would result in heterogeneity and it is a natural characteristic especially in wireless networks . As a result, due to the limited capacity and ability of node, network and system, it is hard to coordinate FL process perfectly generating the device asynchrony [ref]6. To this end, in the traditional centralized and synchronous FL system like Google FL proposed in 2017 , a single node must wait for other nodes to complete their tasks and then enter the next round together after completing its own training task. However, this manner might generate the deteriorated cost incurred by the bottleneck node obviously, in which the worst case is that if a node shuts down during training, it may let a round of FL be invalid completely  . Anomaly detection:\nDue to privacy concerns, the local data set and local operation process of a node are invisible to others, which makes FL suffer from abnormal actions of nodes easily. Especially considering massive participating nodes, the challenge of FL is to detect abnormal nodes and avoid adverse effects as much as possible. Abnormal nodes will reduce the overall efficiency of FL system as well as model accuracy by uploading abnormal parameters during the FL process, the machine learning model built by all nodes together would be very vulnerable, and thus anomaly detection in FL is necessary  0 1. To this end, some researches focus on asynchronous FL framework to solve device asynchrony, and anomaly detection strategy to mitigate the impact of abnormal nodes in FL system. Recently, considering the asynchronous system and security protection, blockchain becomes a natural design that adopted in FL 2, the reasons are twofold. (1) Nodes can announce local model immediately without any asynchrony requirement. (2) Blockchain miners can collect and validate model parameters to encourage normal action while avoiding anomaly. Although recent blockchained FL works [ref]3 3 4 have achieved some progress and advantages to address the mentioned challenges, there are still some problems remained that have not been investigated thoroughly.\nFirst, although these works basically follow the synchronous framework of Google FL, they allow nodes not to wait for others. Thus a pseudo-asynchronous FL system is established, in which the innovation is to use miners to replace the central servers. However, due to the synchrony, the mobile device acted as a miner should be associated with each other, which obeys the decentralization of blockchain while declining the performance of FL in terms of delay, convergence, accuracy and etc. Second, to maintain the blockchain operation, most works use PoW 5 which allows node acted as a miner consuming an amount of computing resource for consensus achievement. Meanwhile, in order to detect abnormal nodes, the miner should also verify the correctness of uploaded model parameters. As a result, the training/learning efficiency might not meet the expectation well caused by the blockchain cost since the overall resource is limited, especially for on-device FL under wireless network. Through the above observations, our concerned issue is whether blockchain is available to establish an efficient asynchronous on-device FL system without introducing too much extra resource consumption. Owing to the evolution of consensus mechanism, we notice that Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger technology promotes blockchain from synchronous to asynchronous bookkeeping using voting consensus mechanism without mining 6. Inspired by these, we propose an asynchronous DAG empowered FL for purpose of efficiency and immunity, referred as DAG-FL. The main contributions of this work are illustrated as follows. To the best of our knowledge, DAG-FL is the first DAG based FL framework forming an asynchronous updating to well solve problems of device asynchrony and abnormal nodes under wireless network. We formulate a theoretical model to analyze and discuss how to keep DAG-FL working stably and autonomously, which is helpful to understand the operation of DAG-FL. We conduct extensive experiments in simulation computer system and testbed deployment to evaluate the performance of DAG-FL compared with Google, Asynchronous, and Block FL systems to discuss the improvement and feasibility of the proposed DAG-FL. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we provide some basic concepts in DAG-FL. Section III proposes DAG-FL in details. Furthermore, Section IV analyzes two details of deploying DAG-FL and discusses how to make DAG-FL work properly. Then, Section V analyzes the performance of DAG-FL in the case of large-scale nodes through simulation experiments, and implements DAG-FL on a real testbed with a small number of nodes. As future work, we discuss the expansion of DAG-FL in Section VI. In Section VII, we will briefly discuss about some related works of existing FL systems from synchronous, pseudo-asynchronous, asynchronous, and blockchained aspects. Finally, Section VIII gives a summary.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: establish machine learning models  .
