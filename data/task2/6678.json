      "content": "Paper Title: Training-Based Model Refinement and Representation Disagreement for Semi-Supervised Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we compare the proposed TMR-RD approach integrated into Unbiased-Teacher-v1 [ref]15 (referred to as TMR-RD-v1) and Unbiased-Teacher-v2 [ref]16 (referred to as TMR-RD-v2) with 13 recent SSOD methods, namely\nISMT ,\nInstant-Teaching ,\nCAPL ,\nSED ,\nHumble-Teacher ,\nSoft-Teacher ,\nMA-GCP ,\nUnbiased-Teacher-v1 [ref]15 (baseline 1),\nUnbiased-Teacher-v2 [ref]16 (baseline 2),\nActive-Teacher ,\nDiverse-Learner ,\nPseudo-Polish , and\nDe-biased Teacher [ref]26.\nTable 2 and Table 3 provide the results on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, respectively.\nTo ensure fair comparisons, we compare the two versions of the proposed TMR-RD using the Faster-RCNN against SOTA methods. Additionally, we examine improvements resulting from cascade regression compared to their baselines, aimed at generating more reliable pseudo-labels. We highlight the generalization capability of our approach through extensive empirical experiments, with and without cascade regression. COCO-standard:\nFirst, we compare the proposed approach with existing SOTA methods partially trained on the COCO-standard set. As shown in Table 2, our TMR-RD-v2 considerably outperforms the Diverse-Learner , Pseudo-Polish , and De-biased Teacher [ref]26 by average margins of 2.92, 2.69, and 2.97 mAP across all labeling ratios, respectively. In particular, our TMR-RD demonstrates superior performance over the Unbiased-Teacher-v1 [ref]15 and Unbiased-Teacher-v2 [ref]16 baselines by an average of 2.07 and 2.23 mAP, respectively. Furthermore, integrating the proposed approach with cascade regression surpasses the performance of both TMR-RD-v1 and TMR-RD-v2 by average margins of 2.64 and 2.88 mAP, respectively. COCO-additional:\nWe then evaluate the performance of the proposed approach fully trained on supervised data to determine the extent of further improvement by incorporating additional unlabeled data. According to Table 2, our TMR-RD-v2 provides an mAP improvement of 2.1, 2.1, and 2.2 compared to the Unbiased-Teacher-v2 [ref]16, Diverse-Learner , and De-biased Teacher [ref]26, respectively. Moreover, the proposed TMR-RD-v1 and TMR-RD-v2 outperform their corresponding supervised models by 3 and 6.7 mAP, respectively. Further, the utilization of cascade regression demonstrates superior performance, surpassing the mAP of TMR-RD-v1 and TMR-RD-v2 by 3.4 and 3.5, respectively.\nThese comparisons highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach with accessible large amounts of labeled and unlabeled data, in addition to partially labeled datasets where labeled data is limited. Pascal VOC:\nAt last, the proposed TMR-RD demonstrates its superiority over existing SSOD methods, as shown in Table 3. For example, TMR-RD-v2 outperforms De-biased Teacher [ref]26, MA-GCP , and Pseudo-Polish  by margins of up to 2.16, 1.94, and 1.16 in the AP50 metric, respectively. Also, it surpasses Unbiased-Teacher-v1 [ref]15 and Unbiased-Teacher-v2 [ref]16 by 3.36 and 3.27 mAP, respectively. Additionally, the integration of cascade regression yields superior results, surpassing TMR-RD-v2 and TMR-RD-v1, leading to improvements of 3.25 and 3.12 mAP, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: In this section, we compare the proposed TMR-RD approach integrated into Unbiased-Teacher-v1 [ref]15 (referred to as TMR-RD-v1) and Unbiased-Teacher-v2 [ref]16 (referred to as TMR-RD-v2) with 13 recent SSOD methods, namely\nISMT ,\nInstant-Teaching ,\nCAPL ,\nSED ,\nHumble-Teacher ,\nSoft-Teacher\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
