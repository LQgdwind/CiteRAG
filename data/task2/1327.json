Traditional methods are often sampling-based or propagation-based. Sampling-based ones [ref]11     estimate foreground/background color statistics through sampling pixels in the definite foreground/background regions to solve the alpha matte in the unknown region. The propagation-based methods    2 5 , also known as affinity-based methods, estimate alpha mattes by propagating the alpha value from foreground and background pixels to the unknown area. Recently, deep learning approaches have been proved successful in many areas, including classification    , detection   , and segmentation  . It also have achieved great success in image matting.  created a matting dataset with annotated mattes composited to various background images, and trained a deep network on it. Later, 0 introduced a generative adversarial framework to improve the results. 7 proposed to combine the sampling-based method and deep learning. 9 introduced a new index-guided upsampling and unpooling operations to better keep details in the predictions.  proposed a two-encoder two-decoder architectures to simultaneous estimate foreground and alpha. 4 further boost the performance with a contextual attention module.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: requires a trimap as additional input, which divides an image into foreground, background, and unknown regions.
