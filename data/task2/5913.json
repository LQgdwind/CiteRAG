The experiments utilize 100 images from the validation set of ILSVRC’12, all of which are correctly classified by all models under consideration. The study considers three transferable attacks - DI [ref]32, TAIG [ref]9, and DWP [ref]26- each using a different approach to improve transferability (see Sect. 2.1). These attacks are selected as the best in their categories in .\nThey all share an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon parameter to control the maximum perturbation added per pixel. The effect of the parameter ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon indeed happens to be negligible in our protocol, as demonstrated in Appendix B.1. We choose ϵ=8italic-ϵ8\\epsilon=8. To measure transferability (7), we need state-of-the-art black box and white box attacks. Certain methods may exhibit a preference towards one model over the other, necessitating the use of multiple attacks. Our study employs four white box attacks (BP , DeepFool , I-FGSM , and PGD ) and three black box attacks (SurFree , RayS , and GeoDA ).\nAll black box attacks are run with 2,000 queries, which has been determined to be sufficient for achieving convergence.\nFor distortion-constrained white box attack, the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon parameter is set to 4.\nWe record the smallest perturbation distortion over the black box (white box) for each image and draw the operating characteristic (6) as appearing in green (resp. red) dashed line in Fig. 1. As for the transferable attack, for a given target model, the attacker has access to a subset of all the other models whose architecture differs from the target. This amounts to an average of 45 models out of 48.\nFor instance, in Fig. 1, CoatLitesmallsubscriptCoatLitesmall\\texttt{CoatLite}_{\\texttt{small}} being the target, we exclude all other CoatLite models from being a source. The light blue area delimits the operating characteristics of transferable attack DI [ref]32 using as the source one of the 45 remaining models.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: The experiments utilize 100 images from the validation set of ILSVRC’12, all of which are correctly classified by all models under consideration.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
