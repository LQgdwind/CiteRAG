      "content": "Paper Title: Concept Bottleneck Model with Additional Unsupervised Concepts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe lack of explainability of black-box neural networks is a serious barrier to the practical application of AI technologies. Especially when accountability is required, such as in medical and self-driving systems, black-box models may be expected to cause severe problems. To deploy more AI into the real world, neural networks are required to have greater interpretability. Various methods have been developed to improve interpretability, and these can be categorized into two approaches, including (1) post-hoc and (2) ante-hoc. The first approach visualizes the features that are important for the trained network to determine its output. Although these methods are model-agnostic, they can be unreliable because they do not always contain the desired information [ref]1. In contrast, the second approach embeds human-understandable domain knowledge into the models. By incorporating this knowledge during training, models can prevent distortions in interpretation. One interpretable model is called the concept bottleneck model (CBM) . CBM has an intermediate layer representing human-understandable concepts as the additional visible layer (we call it concept layer). CBM outputs through this layer and trains it by supervised learning. After training, each unit in the concept layer outputs a single concept necessary for solving the target task. Thanks to this concept layer, CBM has high interpretability. However, CBM involves a constraint that the number of concepts limits the dimension of the concept layer. This constraint makes it difficult for CBM to achieve high accuracy with relatively small number of concept labels. To solve this problem, we propose a novel interpretable model inspired by human judgement and decision-making. It is well known that humans do not simply make decisions based on the concepts (reasons) that we verbalize in our explanations. In other words, we use implicit knowledge (know-how) in combination with explicit knowledge [ref]3. However, the concept layer in CBM uses only explicit knowledge (supervised concepts). From this perspective, we extend this layer to enable the model to leverage explicit and implicit knowledge to perform task prediction, similar to humans. We assume that implicit knowledge corresponds to the unsupervised concepts in the sense that they are not labeled (not verbalized). Namely, in order to perform the above extension, supervised and unsupervised concepts must be learned simultaneously. In this study, we adopt the self-explaining neural network (SENN) to obtain the unsupervised concepts. SENN is composed of an encoder-decoder architecture and a parametrizer, which estimates the weights of each concept . This method has been shown to be effective on the MNIST  and CIFAR-10  datasets. However, it is known that SENN is difficult to apply to the datasets of large images . Therefore, simply integrating SENN and CBM yields a model that is difficult to apply to complex problems such as self-driving systems. To address this issue, we adopt a weight-sharing technique and a discriminator, as an alternative to the decoder. By using these techniques, not only SENN but also our integrated model can be trained on datasets with large images. We call this integrated model the concept bottleneck model with additional unsupervised concepts (CBM-AUC). Experimental results using large image datasets (CUB-200-2011 [ref]7 and BDD-OIA ) show that our model was effective. We also visualized the saliency maps of each concept and found that the concepts can be consistent with their semantic meanings. This result indicates that the statement by Margeloiu et al.  is not necessarily valid. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows: We propose the concept bottleneck model with additional unsupervised concepts (CBM-AUC) based on the CBM and SENN. We apply a discriminator and weight-sharing to perform training efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
