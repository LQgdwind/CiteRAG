      "content": "Paper Title: Topological Augmentation for Class-Imbalanced Node Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo fully validate ToBA’s performance and compatibility with existing IGL techniques and GNN backbones, we include six baseline methods with five popular GNN backbones in our experiments, and combine ToBA with them under all possible combinations.\nThe included IGL baselines can be generally divided into two categories: reweighting-based (i.e., Reweight , ReNode [ref]7) and augmentation-based (i.e., Oversampling , SMOTE [ref]6, GraphSMOTE , and GraphENS [ref]34). Reweight  assigns minority classes with higher misclassification costs (i.e., weights in the loss function) by the inverse of the class frequency in the training set. ReNode [ref]7 measures the influence conflict of training nodes, and perform instance-wise node reweighting to alleviate the topology imbalance. Oversample  augments minority classes with additional synthetic nodes by replication-base oversampling. SMOTE [ref]6 synthesizes minority nodes by 1) randomly selecting a seed node, 2) finding its k𝑘k-nearest neighbors in the feature space, and 3) performing linear interpolation between the seed and one of its k𝑘k-nearest neighbors. GraphSMOTE  extends SMOTE [ref]6 to graph-structured data by 1) performing SMOTE in the low-dimensional embedding space of GNN and 2) utilizing a learnable edge predictor to generate better topology connections for synthetic nodes. GraphENS [ref]34 directly synthesize the whole ego network (node with its 1-hop neighbors) for minority classes by similarity-based ego network combining and saliency-based node mixing to prevent neighbor memorization. We use the public implementations222https://github.com/victorchen96/renode333https://github.com/TianxiangZhao/GraphSmote444https://github.com/JoonHyung-Park/GraphENS of the baseline methods for a fair comparison.\nFor ReNode [ref]7, we use its transductive version and search hyperparameters among the lower bound of cosine annealing wm​i​n∈{0.25,0.5,0.75}subscript𝑤𝑚𝑖𝑛0.250.50.75w_{min}\\in\\{0.25,0.5,0.75\\} and upper bound of the cosine annealing wm​a​x∈{1.25,1.5,1.75}subscript𝑤𝑚𝑎𝑥1.251.51.75w_{max}\\in\\{1.25,1.5,1.75\\} following the original paper.\nWe set the teleport probability of PageRank α=0.15𝛼0.15\\alpha=0.15 as given by the default setting in the released implementation.\nAs Oversample  and SMOTE [ref]6 were not proposed to handle graph data, we adopt their enhanced versions provided by GraphSMOTE , which also duplicate the edges from the seed nodes to the synthesized nodes in order to connect them to the graph.\nFor GraphSMOTE , we use the version that predicts edges with binary values as it performs better than the variant with continuous edge predictions in many datasets.\nFor GraphENS [ref]34, we follow the settings in the paper: Beta​(2,2)Beta22\\text{Beta}(2,2) distribution is used to sample λ𝜆\\lambda, the feature masking hyperparameter k𝑘k and temperature τ𝜏\\tau are tuned among {1,5,10}1510\\{1,5,10\\} and {1,2}12\\{1,2\\}, and the number of warmup epochs is set to 5. We use Pytorch  and PyG  to implement all five GNN backbones used in this paper, i.e., GCN , GAT , GraphSAGE , PPNP , and GPRGNN .\nMost of our settings are aligned with prevailing works [ref]34 [ref]7  to obtain fair and comparable results.\nSpecifically, we implement all GNNs’ convolution layer with ReLU activation and dropout  with a dropping rate of 0.5 before the last layer.\nFor GAT, we set the number of attention heads to 4.\nFor PPNP and GPRGNN, we follow the best setting in the original paper and use 2 PPNP/GPR_prop convolution layers with 64 hidden units.\nNote that GraphENS’s official implementation requires modifying the graph convolution for resampling and thus cannot be directly combined with PPNP and GPRGNN.\nThe teleport probability = 0.1 and the number of power iteration steps K = 10.\nWe search for the best architecture for other backbones from #layers l∈{1,2,3}𝑙123l\\in\\{1,2,3\\} and hidden dimension d∈{64,128,256}𝑑64128256d\\in\\{64,128,256\\} based on the average of validation accuracy and F1 score.\nWe train each GNN for 2,000 epochs using Adam optimizer  with an initial learning rate of 0.01.\nTo achieve better convergence, we follow [ref]34 to use 5e-4 weight decay and adopt the ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler in Pytorch, which reduces the learning rate by half if the validation loss does not improve for 100 epochs.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: in our experiments, and combine ToBA with them under all possible combinations.\nThe included IGL baselines can be generally divided into two categories: reweighting-based (i.e., Reweight , ReNode [ref]7) and augmentation-based (i.e., Oversampling , SMOTE [ref]6, GraphSMOTE , and GraphENS [ref]34).
