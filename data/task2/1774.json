      "content": "Paper Title: Realistic Differentially-Private Transmission Power Flow Data Release\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the increase in research interest in power systems modeling, a number of datasets and tools have been developed to address the shortfall in available data and enable scientists and engineers to apply techniques to power network optimization problems. For example, Coffrin et al. conducted a survey of publicly available test case\ndata for use in the context of AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems .\nThey studied the test cases from the Matpower tools as well as several IEEE test\ncases, and proposed NESTA, a novel data-driven approach to improve on them. However\nthey acknowledged that the NESTA-generated synthetic test cases are still far from\ndetailed real-world data.\nThis data set ended up being the starting point for PG-lib  , a repository that also collects benchmarks for unit commitment and OPF problems with high-voltage DC components.\nThe Julia programming language has emerged as a de-facto tool in the power system\nmodeling space. Specifically, the PowerModels.jl package [ref]9 provides many\nfunctions to solve network simulation and optimization problems for transmission networks,\nunder a variety of constraints.\nIn this paper, we extend PowerModels.jl as part of a new package PowerModelsPrivacyPreserving.jl to provide power systems data release with differential privacy guarantees.\n Several approaches exist to solve the OPF problem’s constrained optimizations,\nincluding relaxation methods to transform them into convex ones. Examples of\nthese convex relaxations of the OPF constraints were based on Semi-Definite\nProgramming , Quadratic Convex relaxation  and second-order cone programming . Analysis from Coffrin [ref]15 showed relationships between these classes of relaxations, and both the Semi-definite Programming and Quadratic Convex are stronger relaxations of Second-Order Cone programming, however Semi-Definite programming and Quadratic Convex are not equivalent. These relaxations have since been combined with differential privacy perturbations to find near optimal solutions to the OPF problem  [ref]1. To maintain high fidelity when using differential privacy, a bilevel optimization approach is described in  to optimally redistribute the noise by a randomized mechanism to meet both indistinguishability and fidelity requirements for OPF customer load. When variables to be optimized are a function of the noise instead of a simple noise addition, Dvorkin et al.  exploit a privacy framework to solve constrained convex optimization problems that make these variables differentially private with strong feasibility guarantees. To avoid the complexity of post-processing to restore fidelity, the same researchers have recently introduced a privacy-preserving mechanism which parameterizes OPF variables as affine functions of the noise such that their correlations with grid loads can be weakened to better protect the privacy of load consumption from voltage and power flow measurements . Private computations have also been studied in  to release aggregated OPF statistics but in the context of direct current (DC) OPF. Bienstock and Shukla  propose a number of convex formulations of DC-OPF that trade variance in power-flow-related parameters for operational cost. Recent work demonstrates convergence for control of optimal power flow according to a differentially private projected subgradient method . As a different line of work, Karapetyan et al.  study the trade-off between privacy and fidelity in the context of micro-grid based on a privacy-preserving demand response optimization problem. Zhao et al.  investigate the charging/discharging of household batteries in the differential privacy context to address privacy concern of smart meters and Eibl et al.  study the use case of privacy preserving electric load forecasting. Liao et al.  introduce a peak-time load balancing mechanism based on distributed differential privacy. A Stackelberg game energy-trading scheme is studied in , which uses differential privacy to protect household payment data and net energy consumption while maintaining mutual benefits among the households, the community battery operators and the smart grid. Han et al.  study an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-differentially private distributed constrained optimization in the case of electric vehicle charging.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: and OPF problems with high-voltage DC components.\nThe Julia programming language has emerged as a de-facto tool in the power system\nmodeling space.
