      "content": "Paper Title: Person Perception Biases Exposed: Revisiting the First Impressions Dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPsychologists have long studied human personality, and throughout the years different theories have been proposed to categorise, explain and understand it. From the past few years, it has also become an attractive research area in visual computing  [ref]17, motivated by the fact that automatic methods for personality recognition or perception can be applied in a vast number of scenarios. Nevertheless, while real personality can be accessed through self-report questionnaires, perceived (or apparent) personality assessment is given by external observers through impression formation, and here is where person perception bias comes in. Technologies for human behaviour analysis have shown their vulnerability to human annotation biases . In particular, human bias is very strong when trying to infer personality attributes of someone during a first short encounter. This subjectivity makes the task of creating automatic personality perception systems challenging, since the biases will be reflected on the annotations and, consequently, on the resulting recognition systems. Therefore, creating methods that preserve human bias can have negative consequences if they are used in applications that deal with human outcomes. While the use of pairwise instance comparison [ref]27 [ref]6  significantly reduces perception bias produced by absolute annotations, completely eliminating it in subjective tasks is extremely difficult. This work uses the First Impressions (FI) [ref]27 dataset to expose the existence of person perception bias in data labelling of personality. The FI dataset is one of the biggest publicly available datasets on the topic. Our work is based on recent studies that demonstrate the bias produced by perceived gender, attractiveness and age  during the impression formation. In particular, we derive perception biases from pairwise annotations and associated person’s attributes111Attribute categories used in this research are imperfect for many reasons. For example, there is no gold standard for “ethnicity” categories, and it is unclear how many gender categories should be stipulated (or whether they should be treated as discrete categories at all). This work is based on an ethical and legal setting, and the methodology and findings are expected to be applied later to any re-defined and/or extended attribute category.. For example, we show that women are more frequently perceived as more Open to experience than men, that older men are more frequently perceived as more Conscientious than younger ones, and that ethnicity has stronger influence than gender if African-Americans are compared to either Asians or Caucasians, which bring to light some annotators’ bias. Fig. 1 illustrates how person perception can influence data labelling when a subjective task like personality perception is considered. Supervised learning methods developed to recognise apparent personality from images or videos [ref]17 require a label for each individual in the train data, and pairwise annotations are in general not used. For this reason, the pairwise annotations of the FI [ref]27 dataset were originally converted to continuous values using [ref]6. Our study also reveals that the mechanism used to convert pairwise annotations to continuous values may magnify the biases, making stereotyping stronger. Finally, it is important to note that previous works (e.g., [ref]17  ) using the FI dataset are based on the continuous values originated from the pairwise labels, and this is the first time the original (raw) pairwise labels are analysed.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: and throughout the years different theories have been proposed to categorise, explain and understand it.
