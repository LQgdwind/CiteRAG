Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Note that throughout the experiments, we tried to impose reproducible conditions by setting the seed; yet, the speculative execution of CUDNN often introduces undesirable sources of randomness negligible to the final performance evaluation¬†.\nFor performance evaluation of the task, the complementary accuracy (acc) (‚Ä†‚Ä†{\\dagger}) defined as (1‚àíacc)1acc(1-\\text{acc}) is used for the classification tasks, and the complementary mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) (‚Ä°‚Ä°{\\ddagger}) defined as (1‚àímIoU)1mIoU(1-\\text{mIoU}) is used for the image segmentation task. For the robustness evaluation, 4 removal attacks are considered. Gaussian noise addition: a random noise is added to the model to impact the watermark. Our hyperparameter S‚àà[ref]1 [ref]5ùëÜ15S\\in[ref]1 [ref]5 corresponds to the ratio between the standard deviation of the added noise to the standard deviation of the aimed layer while both means are equal. Fine-tuning: the training of the model is resumed for some additional epochs E‚àà[ref]1 ùê∏125E\\in[ref]1 . Magnitude pruning: a portion P‚àà[0.1,0.9]ùëÉ0.10.9P\\in[0.1,0.9] of neurons as set to zero according to their L‚Äã1ùêø1L1-norm. This attack aims to compress the model. Quantization: compress the model by reducing the number of bits B‚àà ùêµ216~{}{B\\in } of the floating representation of the parameters.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
