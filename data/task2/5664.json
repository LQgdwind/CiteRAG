      "content": "Paper Title: The Descriptive Complexity of Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe characterise the expressiveness of graph neural networks in terms\nof logic and Boolean circuit complexity. While this forces us to\ndevelop substantial technical machinery with many tedious details,\nthe final results, as stated in the introduction, are surprisingly simple and clean:\nGNNs correspond to the guarded fragment of first-order logic with\ncounting, and with random initialisation they exactly characterise\nTC0superscriptTC0\\textsf{TC}^{0}. One reason I find this surprising is that GNNs carry out real\nnumber computations, whereas the logics and circuits are discrete\nBoolean models of computation. We make some advances on the logical side that may be of independent\ninterest. This includes our treatment of rational arithmetic,\nnon-uniformity and built-in relations on unordered structures, and\nunbounded aggregation (both sum and max). The latter may also shed new light on the relation between\nfirst-order logic with counting and the recently introduced weight\naggregation logics [ref]6 that deserves further study. Our results are also interesting from a (theoretical) machine-learning-on-graphs\nperspective. Most\nimportantly, we are the first to show limitations of GNNs with random\ninitialisation. Previously, it was only known that exponentially large\nGNNs with ri can approximate all functions on graphs of order nùëõn\n, but no upper bounds were known for the more\nrealistic model with a polynomial-size restriction. Another\ninteresting consequence of our results (Theorems¬†7.6\nand 8.10) is that arbitrary\nGNNs can be simulated by GNNs using only SUM-aggregation and\nrelurelu\\operatorname{relu}-activations with only a polynomial overhead in size. This was partially known  for GNNs\ndistinguishing two graphs, but even for this weaker result the proof\nof  requires exponentially large GNNs because it is\nbased on the universal approximation theorem for feedforward neural\nnetworks . It has recently been shown that such a\nsimulation of arbitrary GNNs by GNNs with SUM-aggregation is not\npossible in a uniform setting 6. We leave it open to extend our results to higher-order GNNs\n4 and the bounded-variable fragments of FO+C. It\nmight also be possible to extend the results to larger classes of\nactivation functions, for example, those approximable by\npiecewise-polynomial functions (which are no longer Lipschitz\ncontinuous). Another question that remains open is whether the\n‚ÄúUniform Theorem‚Äù,\nTheorem¬†LABEL:theo:uniform, or Corollary¬†5.7 have a\nconverse in terms of some form of uniform families of GNNs. It is not\neven clear, however, what a suitable uniformify notion for families of\nGNNs would be. The most interesting extensions of our results would be to\nGNNs of unbounded depth. Does the correspondence between circuits and\nGNNs still hold if we drop or relax the depth restriction? And,\nthinking about uniform models, is there a descriptive complexity\ntheoretic characterisation of recurrent GNNs?\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: and\nunbounded aggregation (both sum and max). The latter may also shed new light on the relation between\nfirst-order logic with counting and the recently introduced weight\naggregation logics [ref]6 that deserves further study.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
