      "content": "Paper Title: ST-GREED: Space-Time Generalized Entropic Differences for Frame Rate Dependent Video Quality Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere we introduce a novel FR-VQA called GREED, which can be employed when the reference and the distorted videos have either the same or different frame rates. Our model is inspired by prior NSS based models which measure statistical deviations in a bandpass transform domain to quantify quality. These methods rely on two specific principles: One is the strongly decorrelating property of spatial band-pass image decompositions such as the DCT , or wavelets    the responses of which strongly tend to follow well-modeled heavy-tailed distributions. The second is subsequent divisive normalization of the bandpass coefficients, the perceptually relevant GSM natural image model and known functional processing by retino-cortical neurons, which relates to contrast masking. Divisive normalization, or equivalently, conditioning on the bandpass variance field , applied on on the bandpass coefficients of images/videos further decorrelates and strongly Gaussianizes them  . However, these statistical consistencies tend to be disrupted by distortions which is particularly useful when capturing quality variations. Although there exists a multitude of NSS inspired VQA models, these primarily use spatial NSS models or very simple temporal extensions of them. There has been much less attention directed towards designing temporal NSS models to address temporal artifacts. Current models account for temporal distortions by employing basic operations, such as frame differences     or that perform expensive motion estimation computations   . Although these methods perform well under generic conditions, they can only be used when the reference and distorted videos have the same frame rate, i.e.the same number of frames which are in temporal correspondence. Here we aim to go beyond the scope of these prior methods, by removing the frame rate limitation, while addressing the measurement of quality disruptions arising from frame rate variations as well as combined frame rate and compression effects. Consider a bank of KùêæK temporal band-pass filters denoted by bksubscriptùëèùëòb_{k} for k‚àà{1,‚Ä¶‚ÄãK}ùëò1‚Ä¶ùêæk\\in\\{1,\\ldots K\\}. The temporal band-pass response to a video V‚Äã(ùê±,t)ùëâùê±ùë°V(\\mathbf{x},t) (ùê±=(x,y)ùê±ùë•ùë¶\\mathbf{x}=(x,y) represents spatial co-ordinates and tùë°t denotes temporal dimension) is denoted by where ‚àó* and BksubscriptùêµùëòB_{k} are the convolution operation and band-pass response of the kt‚Äãhsuperscriptùëòùë°‚Ñék^{th} filter respectively. Note that these are 1D filters applied only along the temporal dimension. We also note that frame differences are a special case of (1), where the band-pass filter is the high pass component of a Haar wavelet filter. We have empirically observed that the distributions of the coefficients of BksubscriptùêµùëòB_{k} varies with frame rate. This is illustrated in Fig. 1a where the empirical distributions (histograms) of bandpass videos having different frame rates are shown following temporal filtering using a 4-level Haar wavelet filter. It may be observed that, as the frame rates increase, the distribution becomes peakier since the correlations between neighborhood frames increase with frame rate, making band-pass responses more sparse. An interesting phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 1b, where the distributions of divisively normalized bandpass coefficients under a GSM model are plotted; any differences between the histograms at are very small. This observation is rather unconventional, given that in many prior models    [ref]6 it is assumed that divisive normalization tends to capture underlying distortions because they also predict the empirical distributions of the processed image or video signals. One possible explanation behind this observation could be that successful normalization relies on spatial local neighborhood responses, which frame rate changes may not significantly alter. Note that so far, the observations that we are making are in regards to videos having different frame rates, but no compression. Certainly, the presence of compression artifacts can further impact the shape of the distributions. Although this implies that bandpass normalization may not be strongly predictive of frame rate variations, the band-pass coefficients without normalization are still well modeled as obeying a Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD). GGD models have previously been employed to model band-pass coefficients in many applications, such as image denoising , texture retrieval , blind VQA model  and so on. Our work is primarily motivated by the successful ST-RRED model  whereby entropic differences calculated under a GSM model are used to measure deviations in band-pass coefficient distributions caused by distortion. We alter this idea by designing a statistical model based on the GGD, rather than the GSM to capture frame rate variations. In the next subsection, we explain our GGD based model of band-pass coefficients in detail.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: bandpass coefficients under a GSM model are plotted; any differences between the histograms at are very small.
