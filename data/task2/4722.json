      "content": "Paper Title: DeepFusion: A Robust and Modular 3D Object Detector for Lidars, Cameras and Radars ∗All authors are with Robert Bosch GmbH, Corporate Research, 71272 Renningen, Germany, florian.drews@bosch.com\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSafe and accurate 3D object detection is a core technology in autonomous driving. All subsequent components like tracking, prediction and planning heavily depend on the detection performance . Errors in perception of other traffic participants can potentially propagate through the system, leading to severe failure of the autonomous vehicle. To prevent such errors, the perception system needs careful design, which remains a challenging research question . Multiple sensors and different modalities, mainly lidars, RGB-cameras and radars, are often used to approach this object detection challenge . Multiple sensors improve system redundancy, and different modalities increase detection robustness, as their complementary physical properties can be exploited to overcome different driving scenarios, where a single-modality fails. For example, lidars and cameras suffer from strong degradation in foggy weather conditions , whereas radars stay relatively unaffected. On the other hand, radars and monocular cameras suffer from sparse or imprecise depth estimation  [ref]6 , which can be compensated by the dense and accurate lidar point cloud. Over the last years, great progress has been made in the task of 3D object detection with modalities of lidars [ref]8  0, cameras 1 [ref]6 and radars 2 3 4 5.\nThis trend is fuelled by public large-scale multi-modal datasets like nuScenes  and Waymo Open Dataset 6. However, the research community mainly focuses on close-range 3D object detection up to 757575 meters. We emphasize the importance of far-range object detection, as early detection of other traffic participants and their actions could enable safer, faster and smoother overall system reactions, especially on highway scenarios. Therefore, the target of this paper is an object detector design that is scalable above 200200200 meters range. A major challenge of working with multiple sensors and modalities is the fusion of this multitude of redundant and complementary sensor data. At the interface between multiple sensors and the output of perception, the fusion has an important impact on the overall system performance. Most existing works focus on fusing lidar and RGB-camera sensors for 3D object detection 7 8 9 0 1 [ref]8 2 3 4.\nLess explored are camera-radar fusion 5 6 7 and lidar-camera-radar fusion 8 9, the latter are on the tasks of semantic heatmap prediction and 2D object detection respectively.\nWe argue the necessity of developing a simple and flexible lidar-camera-radar fusion network for 3D object detection, because radar sensors are complementary to lidars and cameras regarding their measuring principle, and radar technology is developing quickly with increasing market demands 0 7 1. In this work, we propose a modular network architecture to fuse lidars, cameras and radars for accurate, robust, and long-range 3D object detection. The approach employs exchangeable feature-extractors to yield well-optimized architectures for single-modal detectors. Extracted rich features of each modality are then transformed into a common bird’s-eye-view representation for convenient fusion in the shared latent space. This network design enables us to easily investigate the fusion of different combinations of modalities, with a focus on lidar-camera, lidar-camera-radar and camera-radar fusions. Our main contributions are: We propose a novel modular architecture to fuse lidar, camera and radar for 3D object detection in a simple and effective manner. In-depth investigation and discussion on different combinations of modalities. Study faraway 3D object detection of up to 225225225 meters whereas popular benchmarks like nuScenes and Waymo6 focus on rather close range of 505050 and 757575 meters respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: from strong degradation in foggy weather conditions , whereas radars stay relatively unaffected.
