      "content": "Paper Title: MisMatch: Calibrated Segmentation via Consistency on Differential Morphological Feature Perturbations with Limited Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCARVE 2014 The Classification of pulmonary arteries and veins (CARVE) dataset  has 10 fully annotated non-contrast low-dose thoracic CT scans. Each case has between 399 and 498 images, acquired at various spatial resolutions between (282 x 426) to (302 x 474). 10-fold cross-validation on the 10 labelled cases is performed. In each fold, we split cases as: 1 for labelled training data, 3 for unlabelled training data, 1 for validation and 5 for testing. We only use slices containing more than 100 foreground pixels. We prepare datasets with differing amounts of labelled slices: 5, 10, 30, 50, 100. We crop 176 √ó\\times 176 patches from four corners of each slice. Full label training uses 4 training cases. Normalisation was performed at case wise. BRATS 2018 BRATS 2018  has 210 high-grade glioma and 76 low-grade glioma MRI cases, each case containing 155 slices. We focus on binary segmentation of whole tumours in high grade cases. We randomly select 1 case for labelled training, 2 cases for validation and 40 cases for testing. We centre crop slices at 176 √ó\\times 176. For labelled training data, we extract the first 20 slices containing tumours with areas of more than 5 pixels. To see the impact of the amount of unlabelled training data, we use 3100, 4650 and 6200 slices respectively. Case-wise normalisation was performed and all modalities were concatenated. We train each model 3 times and take the average. LA 2018 Atrial Segmentation Challenge Data set [ref]34 has 100 volumes of 3D gadolimium-enhanced MR scans with corresponding left atrium segmentation masks. Each scan is isotropic with resolution at 0.625 x 0.625 x 0.625 m‚Äãm3ùëösuperscriptùëö3mm^{3}. We follow  and split 100 scans into 80 for training and 20 for testing. We also directly use the pre-processing from  to normalise the centre crop each scan. Task 01 Brain Tumour Task01 Brain Tumour from Medical Segmentation Decathlon consortium  is based on BRATS 2017 with different naming format from BRATS 2018. Each case in The Task01 Brain Tumour has 155 slices with 240 x 240 spatial dimension. We merge all of the tumour classes into one tumour class for simplicity. We do not apply centre cropping in the pre-processing here. In the training, we randomly crop volumes on the fly with size of 96 x 96 x 96. We separate the original training cases as labelled training data and testing data. We use the original testing cases as unlabelled data. For the labelled training data, we use 8 cases with index number from 1 to 8. We have 476 cases for testing and 266 cases for unlabelled training data. We apply normalisation with statistics of intensities across the whole training data set. We keep all of the MRI modalities as 4 channel input.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: 6200 slices respectively. Case-wise normalisation was performed and all modalities were concatenated. We train each model 3 times and take the average. LA 2018 Atrial Segmentation Challenge Data set [ref]34 has 100 volumes of 3D gadolimium-enhanced MR scans with corresponding left atrium segmentation masks.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
