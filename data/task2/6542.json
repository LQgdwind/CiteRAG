      "content": "Paper Title: Combating Confirmation Bias: A Unified Pseudo-Labeling Framework for Entity Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) are large-scale structured knowledge bases that represent real-world entities (or concepts) and their relationships as a collection of factual triplets. Recent years have witnessed the release of various open-source KGs (e.g., Freebase , YAGO  and Wikidata ) from general to specific domains and their proliferation to empower many artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as recommender systems 1, question answering [ref]49 and information retrieval 1. Nevertheless, it has become a well-known fact that real-world KGs suffer from incompleteness arising from their complex, semi-automatic construction process. This has led to an increasing number of research efforts on knowledge graph completion, such as TransE  and TransH , which aim to add missing facts to individual KGs.\nUnfortunately, due to its limited coverage and incompleteness, a single KG cannot fulfill the requirements for complex AI applications that build upon heterogeneous knowledge sources. This necessitates the integration of heterogeneous information from multiple individual KGs to enrich knowledge representation. Entity alignment (EA) is a crucial task towards this objective, which aims to establish the correspondence between equivalent entity pairs across different KGs that refer to the same real-world identity. Over the last decade, there has been a surge of research efforts dedicated to entity alignment across KGs. Most mainstream entity alignment models are based on knowledge graph embedding, which embeds different KGs into a common latent space so that similarities between entities can be directly measured via their embeddings for alignment purposes. To learn better KG embeddings, methods like GCN-Align  leverage graph convolutional networks (GCNs) 2 to capture structural and neighboring entity information for alignment inference. Along this line of research, recent studies    utilize a highway strategy 9 to alleviate over-smoothing during GCN propagation, or jointly learn entity and relation embeddings for improving the accuracy of entity alignment. These models, however, require an abundant amount of pre-aligned entity pairs (known as prior alignment seeds) during training, which are labor-intensive and costly to acquire in real-world KGs. To tackle the shortage of prior alignment seeds provided for training, recently proposed models, such as BootEA 3, IPTransE , MRAEA , and RNM , adopt a bootstrapping strategy that iteratively selects unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence as pseudo-labels and adds them to prior alignment seeds for either model re-training or posterior embedding distance rectification.\nThe bootstrapping strategy originates from the field of statistics and is also referred to as pseudo-labeling – a predominant learning paradigm proposed to tackle the label scarcity problem in semi-supervised learning. In general semi-supervised learning, pseudo-labeling approaches inherently suffer from confirmation bias  5. The bias stems from using incorrectly predicted labels generated on unlabeled data for subsequent training, thereby misleadingly increasing confidence in incorrect predictions and generating a biased model with degraded performance. Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding of the fundamental factors that give rise to confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment. Our analysis (see Section 2.2) advocates that the confirmation bias is exacerbated during pseudo-labeling for entity alignment. Due to the lack of sufficient prior alignment seeds at the early stages of training, the existing models are inclined to learn uninformative entity embeddings and make incorrect predictions on unaligned entity pairs. As a consequence, the pseudo-labels generated based on the model’s unreliable high-confidence predictions are error-prone. The resultant errors can be characterized into two types, as depicted in Fig. 1. Type I pseudo-labeling errors refer to conflicted misalignments, where a single entity in one KG is simultaneously aligned with multiple entities in another KG with erroneous matches. Type II pseudo-labeling errors refer to one-to-one misalignments, where an entity in one KG is incorrectly matched with an entity in another KG. These pseudo-labeling errors, if not properly mitigated, would propagate into subsequent model training, thereby jeopardizing the efficacy of pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment. However, current pseudo-labeling-based EA models have made only limited attempts to alleviate alignment conflicts using simple heuristics   or imposing constraints to enforce hard alignments 3 , while the confirmation bias has been left under-explored. To fill in the research gap, in this work, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) to systematically combat confirmation bias. The scope of our work focuses primarily on a semi-supervised learning paradigm, where we aim to eliminate Type I and Type II pseudo-labeling errors to boost the precision of entity alignment. Towards this goal, UPL-EA comprises two complementary components – within-iteration Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling and cross-iteration pseudo-label calibration. Specifically, OT-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to enable more accurate determination of entity correspondences across KGs and to mitigate the adverse impact of erroneous matches. The discrete OT models the alignment as a probabilistic matching process between the entity sets in two KGs with the minimal overall transport cost.\nThe transport cost is calculated according to the rectified distance between entity embeddings obtained through graph convolution augmented with global-level semantics.\nBased on the estimated OT solution, a simple but highly effective selection criterion is further devised to infer pseudo-labeled entity pairs that satisfy one-to-one correspondence, thus eliminating conflicted misalignments (Type I pseudo-labeling errors) at each iteration. The pseudo-label calibration operates across multiple consecutive iterations to reduce the local pseudo-label selection variability with theoretical guarantee, thereby eliminating one-to-one misalignments (Type II pseudo-labeling errors). The calibrated pseudo-labels are then used to augment prior alignment seeds to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: To our best knowledge, we are the first to investigate the confirmation bias problem for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment. We conceptually and empirically identify two types of pseudo-labeling errors that give rise to confirmation bias. Motivated by our analysis, we propose a unified pseudo-labeling framework (UPL-EA) that systematically alleviates the problem of confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment. UPL-EA is carefully designed to explicitly eliminate Type I and Type II pseudo-labeling errors, leading to significant performance gains. Extensive experiments on benchmark KG datasets demonstrate that UPL-EA is able to significantly eliminate pseudo-labeling errors and yield competitive performance with respect to limited amounts of prior alignment seeds, outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised baselines. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a problem formulation of pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment and presents an empirical analysis of confirmation bias that motivates this work. Section 3 presents the proposed framework, followed by extensive experimental evaluation reported in Section 4. Related works are discussed in Section 5, and we conclude the paper in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: Freebase , YAGO  and Wikidata ) from general to specific domains and their proliferation to empower many artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as recommender systems 1, question answering [ref]49 and information retrieval 1.
