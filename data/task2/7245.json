      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Reasoning Abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): A Comprehensive Survey on Emerging Trends in Multimodal Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith these rich evaluation datasets shown in Table 1, it is important to evaluate using proper metrics. Therefore, it is necessary to categorize and review the evaluation metrics.\nThe complexity of evaluating MLLMs arises from the multimodal nature of these tasks.\nThe metrics must capture the synergistic relationship between language and vision, as well as other possibly involved modalities.\nThis relationship demands assessments that not only estimate the accuracy of predictions but also the depth, nuance, and relevancy of multimodal associations. The existing evaluation metrics can be categorized from different aspects.\nAlthough we mainly focus on three datasets for results analysis, we categorize all the related datasets for a comprehensive summarization.\nFrom the perspective of evaluating the different capabilities of models, evaluation can be categorized into 3 types: For vision capability, traditional perception metrics are relevant, including tasks such as identifying, classifying, and locating objects within an image, as well as interpreting those objects in the context of the overall scene.\nThe common metrics used are image classification accuracy (ImageNet ), object detection mAP (COCO ), object segmentation mIoU (LVIS ), and others. For linguistic capability, commonsense understanding and coherence needed to be considered as metrics.\nIt goes beyond merely generating grammatically correct sentences; it’s about producing responses that are contextually relevant, logical, and semantically coherent, ensuring alignment with the given visual input.\nThe common metrics used are BLEU , CIDEr , ROUGE , among others. For reasoning capability, it covers spatial reasoning, knowledge reasoning (including areas like common sense, mathematics, text, code, and more), as well as hypothesis-based reasoning.\nJust as humans deduce information based on textual and visual cues, MLLMs should exhibit the ability to reason, draw inferences, and predict outcomes based on the multi-modal data they process.\nThe common metrics are QA-Accuracy , Elo score , GPT-4  evaluation, and others. From the types of evaluation questions, existing multimodal benchmarks can be divided into two distinct categories: Closed-Set Evaluation Benchmarks are circumscribed by a predetermined set of categories or outcomes.\nWhen MLLMs are assessed under this paradigm, they’re essentially provided a limited set of potential responses or classifications.\nSuch evaluations gauge the model’s aptitude to correctly categorize or respond within the given confines, making them particularly suited for tasks where boundaries are well-defined and the space of responses is finite.\nCertain visual evaluation tasks are of a closed-set nature, such as image classification and attribute classification.\nConversely, some benchmarks with open-ended questions force to reformat answers into multiple-choice format, examples of which includes MMBench [ref]82, MME  and ScienceQA .\nHowever, as studied in a recent work [ref]101, authors found that popular MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial permutation in answer sets for multiple-choice prompting. Open-Set Evaluation Benchmarks are more unbounded and exploratory.\nThey allow models to generate responses without confining them to a predefined set.\nThis evaluates the model’s capability to venture into the unknown, generating or deducing outcomes that might not be part of the training set.\nIn the vast and dynamic domain of multimodal interactions, where real-world scenarios often elude strict categorizations, open-set evaluations become crucial in assessing a model’s generalization capabilities and adaptiveness to novel inputs.\nTwo common approaches for evaluating open-set answers are human scoring such as LVLM-eHub  and Lynx [ref]89, and automatic language model scoring, like TouchStone  and VisIT-Bench . With the three datasets subject to our analysis, diverse reasoning evaluation metrics are employed, including GPT-4 evaluation (Infi-MM-Eval, MM-Vet) and QA-Accuracy (MMMU).\nAdditionally, these datasets feature different evaluation question setups: Open-Set (Infi-MM-Eval, MM-Vet) and Closed-Set (MMMU).\nTherefore, a representative subset of benchmarks are covered in our analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [82]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]82: as image classification and attribute classification.\nConversely, some benchmarks with open-ended questions force to reformat answers into multiple-choice format, examples of which includes MMBench [ref]82, MME  and ScienceQA .\nHowever, as studied in a recent work [ref]101, authors found that popular MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial permutation in answer sets for multiple-choice prompting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
