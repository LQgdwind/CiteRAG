      "content": "Paper Title: Presheaf automata\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a proof of concept we now review several geometric models for\nconcurrency [ref]8 [ref]10    and represent\nthem as presheaf automata. The fundamental notion is that of consets\n(concurrency sets) and concset maps, which is motivated by the\nconclists and conclist maps for HDA introduced in\n[ref]8 [ref]10. Fix an infinite set and call finite subsets of this set\nconcsets (to enforce smallness of the categories below). A concset map from a concset V𝑉V to a concset U𝑈U is a pair\n(f,ε)𝑓𝜀(f,\\varepsilon) where f:V→U:𝑓→𝑉𝑈f:V\\to U and ε:U→{0,∗,1}:𝜀→𝑈01\\varepsilon:U\\to\\{0,*,1\\}\nare functions such that f𝑓f is injective and\nε−1​(∗)=f​(V)superscript𝜀1𝑓𝑉\\varepsilon^{-1}(*)=f(V). The composition of consets maps\n(g,η):W→V:𝑔𝜂→𝑊𝑉(g,\\eta):W\\to V and (f,ε):V→U:𝑓𝜀→𝑉𝑈(f,\\varepsilon):V\\to U is the concset map\n(g​f,θ):W→U:𝑔𝑓𝜃→𝑊𝑈(gf,\\theta):W\\to U with A concset map (f,ε):V→U:𝑓𝜀→𝑉𝑈(f,\\varepsilon):V\\to U is a formorphism if\nε​(u)≠1𝜀𝑢1\\varepsilon(u)\\neq 1 for all u∈U𝑢𝑈u\\in U, and a backmorphism\nif ε​(u)≠0𝜀𝑢0\\varepsilon(u)\\neq 0 for all u∈U𝑢𝑈u\\in U. If (U,u0),(V,v0)𝑈subscript𝑢0𝑉subscript𝑣0(U,u_{0}),(V,v_{0}) are pointed sets, then a pointed concset map\n(f,ε):V→U:𝑓𝜀→𝑉𝑈(f,\\varepsilon):V\\to U is defined as above, but\nf𝑓f must preserve basepoints (f​(v0)=u0𝑓subscript𝑣0subscript𝑢0f(v_{0})=u_{0})\nand may map many elements to the basepoint (if f​(v)=f​(v′)=u𝑓𝑣𝑓superscript𝑣′𝑢f(v)=f(v^{\\prime})=u,\nthen v=v′𝑣superscript𝑣′v=v^{\\prime} or u=u0𝑢subscript𝑢0u=u_{0}).\nThe formula for composition (13.1) remains valid. There is a 1-1 correspondence between pointed concset maps V→U→𝑉𝑈V\\to U\nand partial concset maps V∖{v0}→U∖{u0}→𝑉subscript𝑣0𝑈subscript𝑢0V\\setminus\\{v_{0}\\}\\to U\\setminus\\{u_{0}\\},\nwhere partiality means that f𝑓f is not defined on the whole domain. Composition of concset maps (both pointed and unpointed) is\nassociative. This allows defining several d-categories. the concset category 𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭\\mathbf{CSet} with\nconcsets as objects\nand concset maps as morphisms; the conclist category 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭\\mathbf{CList}\nof concsets with a strict total order ⇢⇢\\dashrightarrow (conclists)\nand order-preserving concset maps (conclist maps); the pointed concset category 𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭∗subscript𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭\\mathbf{CSet}_{*}\nof pointed concsets and basepoint-preserving concset maps; the ΣΣ\\Sigma-labelled concset category 𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭​(Σ)𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭Σ\\mathbf{CSet}(\\Sigma)\nover the alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma,\nof ΣΣ\\Sigma-labelled concsets,\nwhich are pairs (U,λ:U→Σ):𝑈𝜆→𝑈Σ(U,\\lambda:U\\to\\Sigma),\nand label-preserving concset maps; the ΣΣ\\Sigma-labelled conclist category 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭​(Σ)𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭Σ\\mathbf{CList}(\\Sigma)\nof labelled conclists and order-and-label-preserving concset maps; the pointed conclist category 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭∗subscript𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭\\mathbf{CList}_{*}\nof pointed conclists, whose\nobjects are pointed concsets (U,u0)𝑈subscript𝑢0(U,u_{0})\nwith a total order ⇢⇢\\dashrightarrow on U∖{u0}𝑈subscript𝑢0U\\setminus\\{u_{0}\\},\nand morphisms are basepoint-preserving concset maps\n(f,ε):(V,v0)→(U,u0):𝑓𝜀→𝑉subscript𝑣0𝑈subscript𝑢0(f,\\varepsilon):(V,v_{0})\\to(U,u_{0}) such that f𝑓f restricted\nto f−1​(U∖{u0})superscript𝑓1𝑈subscript𝑢0f^{-1}(U\\setminus\\{u_{0}\\}) preserves ⇢⇢\\dashrightarrow. Presheaves and automata over these d-categories coincide\nwith existing models for concurrency: The conclist category 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭\\mathbf{CList} is equivalent to the category\n□□\\square from Definition 5.1. The\nfunctor I:□→𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭:𝐼→□𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭I:\\square\\to\\mathbf{CList} given by\nI​([n])=(1⇢⋯⇢n)𝐼delimited-[]𝑛⇢1⋯⇢𝑛I([n])=(1\\dashrightarrow\\dotsm\\dashrightarrow n),\nI​(diα)=(f,ε)𝐼subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝛼𝑖𝑓𝜀I(d^{\\alpha}_{i})=(f,\\varepsilon), where gives rise to an equivalence of categories. 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭\\mathbf{CList}-presheaves are\ntherefore equivalent to the precubical sets of [ref]8 and\n, and to the cubical sets of\n. The pointed conclist category 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭∗subscript𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭\\mathbf{CList}_{*} is equivalent to the\ncubical category □□\\square of \nand to the restricted cubical site 𝕀𝕀\\mathbb{I} of\n. The concset category 𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭\\mathbf{CSet} and the pointed concset category\n𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭∗subscript𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭\\mathbf{CSet}_{*} are equivalent to the symmetric precubical category and\nthe symmetric cubical category of\n. The ΣΣ\\Sigma-labelled conclist category 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭​(Σ)𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭Σ\\mathbf{CList}(\\Sigma)\nis equivalent to the precubical category □□\\square of\n[ref]10. 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭​(Σ)𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭Σ\\mathbf{CList}(\\Sigma)-automata are thus\nequivalent to the higher-dimensional automata studied in\n[ref]8 [ref]10 . Presheaves over the labelled concset category\n𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭​(Σ)𝐂𝐒𝐞𝐭Σ\\mathbf{CSet}(\\Sigma) are equivalent to the labelled symmetric\nprecubical sets of \nand closely connected to the cubical site 𝕁𝕁\\mathbb{J} of . We show one of the equivalences claimed in 2. The\nproofs of 3.–5. are not entirely straightforward either, and details\nare left for future work. The cubical category 𝕀𝕀\\mathbb{I}  is the d-category defined as follows: Objects are symbols [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] for n≥0𝑛0n\\geq 0. Morphisms are generated by di0,di1∈𝕀​([n−1],[n])subscriptsuperscript𝑑0𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑑1𝑖𝕀delimited-[]𝑛1delimited-[]𝑛d^{0}_{i},d^{1}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{I}([n-1],[n]) and ei∈𝕀​([n+1],[n])subscript𝑒𝑖𝕀delimited-[]𝑛1delimited-[]𝑛e_{i}\\in\\mathbb{I}([n+1],[n]) for 1≤i≤n1𝑖𝑛1\\leq i\\leq n, and relations 𝕀+superscript𝕀{\\mathbb{I}}^{+}\\! is generated by the morphisms di0subscriptsuperscript𝑑0𝑖d^{0}_{i} and eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i}. 𝕀−superscript𝕀{\\mathbb{I}}^{-}\\! is generated by the morphisms di1subscriptsuperscript𝑑1𝑖d^{1}_{i} and eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i}. We define a functor F:𝕀→𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭∗:𝐹→𝕀subscript𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭F:\\mathbb{I}\\to\\mathbf{CList}_{*} as and F(diα:[n−1]→[n])=(fiα,εiα)F(d^{\\alpha}_{i}:[n-1]\\to[n])=(f^{\\alpha}_{i},\\varepsilon^{\\alpha}_{i}), F(ei:[n+1]→[n])=(gi,ζi)F(e_{i}:[n+1]\\to[n])=(g_{i},\\zeta_{i}), where It can be shown that F𝐹F gives rise to an equivalence of d-categories. In the terminology of , the conclist\ncategory 𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐂𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭\\mathbf{CList} contains only face morphisms. By passing from\nconclists to consets we introduce symmetries. Finally, passing from\nunpointed to pointed conclists or concsets adds degeneracies to the\nrespective categories.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: As a proof of concept we now review several geometric models for\nconcurrency [ref]8 [ref]10    and represent\nthem as presheaf automata.
