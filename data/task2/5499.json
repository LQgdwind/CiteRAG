      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Sparsity in Pruned Neural Networks to Optimize Large Model Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning researchers have observed that increasing the size of a neural\nnetwork almost always leads to better generalization i.e., accuracies on test\ndata [ref]1. This has led to the development of neural\narchitectures with billions of parameters [ref]2, which are\nnaturally trained in parallel on large GPU clusters due to their extreme\ncompute and memory requirements. The progressive increase in neural network\nsizes has necessitated a corresponding increase in the number of GPUs to train\nthem. However, with increasing GPU counts, communication becomes a significant\nbottleneck in the training procedure. Thus, designing algorithms that can\nimprove the efficiency of training at scale is extremely critical. This will\nensure that we can harness the proven benefits of growing network sizes while\nbeing able to train them in a reasonable amount of time. The number of parameters in contemporary deep learning models is often in the\ntens to hundreds of billions. In their work on the lottery ticket\nhypothesis (LTH), Frankle et al. observe empirically that a large fraction of\nthe parameter set (80-90%) can be pruned (set to zero) at initialization\nwithout affecting the generalization performance on test\ndata [ref]3. Subsequently, this phenomenon has witnessed great\ninterest from the deep learning community and several follow up studies have\ntried to further refine the hypothesis, propose efficient pruning algorithms\nand/or prove it for a broader class of neural network\narchitectures      . Pruning algorithms output extremely sparse subnetworks, which in theory require\nsignificantly fewer number of floating point operations as compared to the\nunpruned networks. Several sparse matrix multiplication kernels for GPUs have\nbeen proposed that are specifically optimized for the patterns of sparsities in\nthese subnetworks   . However, in spite of the advancements, these\napproaches are significantly slower than cuBLAS, a popular library for\ndense matrix multiplications on NVIDIA GPUs (used by deep learning frameworks\nsuch as PyTorch and Tensorflow). In Figure 1, we\ndemonstrate that computing a fully connected layer with 90% sparsity using\ncuBLAS (we fill out zeros explicitly in the dense matrix) is\n6–22×\\times faster than using Sputnik , a state-of-the-art\nsparse matrix multiplication library for deep learning workloads. This suggests\nthat utilizing sparse matrix libraries to improve training performance is\ncurrently infeasible. Instead of trying to optimize computation times, in this work, we focus on\nexploiting sparsity to optimize memory utilization, and then exploit the\nsaved memory to optimize communication. We demonstrate how our optimizations\ncan greatly reduce the communication times of two widely used parallel\nalgorithms for deep learning – namely inter-layer parallelism (point-to-point\ncommunication) and data parallelism (collective communication). First, we\npropose a novel approach, which we call Sparsity-aware Memory Optimization\n(SAMO), that provides memory savings of around 66-78%, while still being\ncompute efficient. Through analytical communication models as well as\nexperiments, we demonstrate that these memory savings can be utilized to reduce\nboth the message transmission time as well as the pipeline latency (often\ncalled “bubble” time) of inter-layer parallelism. Finally, for data\nparallelism we only communicate the gradients corresponding to the non-zero\n(or unpruned) parameters, decreasing the message sizes, and thus\nalleviating the bottleneck of expensive all-reduce communication. To demonstrate the efficacy of our optimizations, we integrate our method in\nAxoNN , a highly scalable framework for parallel deep\nlearning that implements an efficient hybrid of data and inter-layer\nparallelism. On GPT-3 2.7B [ref]2, a 2.7 billion parameter model, we\ndemonstrate that SAMO reduces the memory consumption by 74% (from 80.16\nGB to 20.28 GB)! Then, for a strong scaling run of the same model on 128-512\nV100 GPUs of Summit, we successfully exploit the freed up memory to reduce the\nportion of batch spent in communication. We show that the absolute reduction in\nthe communication time accounts for 40% of AxoNN’s batch time on 512\nGPUs. This makes our method a significant 34% faster than AxoNN, 32% faster\nthan DeepSpeed-3D , and 46% faster that\nSputnik . Since Sputnik is designed for single GPU executions, we\nintegrate it in AxoNN to run it in parallel. We summarize the important contributions of this work below: We present Sparsity-aware Memory Optimization (SAMO), a novel method\nthat exploits recently proposed accuracy-preserving parameter pruning\nalgorithms in deep learning, to significantly reduce the memory consumption of\nneural network training while not sacrificing performance. Through analytical communication models and experiments, we demonstrate\nhow these memory savings can be utilized to significantly improve the\ncommunication performance of two popular algorithms for parallel deep learning,\ndata and inter-layer parallelism. We conduct strong scaling experiments using popular convolution\nneural network architectures and transformer-based language models with 1.3\nto 13 billion parameters on 16 to 2048 GPUs, and demonstrate significant\nimprovements in communication times when compared with two highly scalable\nparallel deep learning frameworks AxoNN and DeepSpeed-3D.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Deep learning researchers have observed that increasing the size of a neural\nnetwork almost always leads to better generalization i.e., accuracies on test\ndata [ref]1.
