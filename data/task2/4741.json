      "content": "Paper Title: TruEyes: Utilizing Microtasks in Mobile Apps for Crowdsourced Labeling of Machine Learning Datasets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFrom the results of the online experiments, we observe that the success rate and the time per label achieved by the TruEyes data labeling approach is comparable to the baseline set by the traditional labeling approach. Furthermore, the responses from the qualitative survey indicate that the majority of app users have a general reluctance towards current mobile ads. App users are open to new experiences like TruEyes task ads to keep themselves engaged during ad breaks. With these findings, we believe that the TruEyes approach has the potential to mobilize app users for performing crowdsourced labeling tasks. While our evaluation focused on labeling quality and system performance, for the TruEyes system to be commercially viable and competitive to other crowdsourcing platforms, the cost per label and the representativeness of the participants remain to be evaluated in future studies.\nIn the following we discuss the result of our evaluation and its implications for future research. In this paper, we explored data labeling microtasks of images with the TruEyes system, as it has become a popular crowdsourcing task due to the recent rise in machine learning applications .\nSpecifically, the labeling performance of the TruEyes system was evaluated only on image datasets. Although the image labeling tasks proved to be a great fit for initial exploration, in reality, depending upon the machine learning application, several kinds of labeling needs may arise, for e.g. text transcription, audio transcription, sentiment analysis, image categorization, video annotation etc.   , providing opportunities to explore other kinds of data labeling tasks with the TruEyes system. Apart from data labeling, the TruEyes system is also suitable for crowdsourcing tasks such as, participating in short surveys, market studies and contributing to location based projects, additionally taking advantage of the touch input and sensors present in modern day mobile devices. However, we acknowledge that not every task might be equally suited for microtasks. Certain tasks may require longer durations of undivided attention from the participants, while others may require the participants to recollect previously made available information. In these instances, the ad-hoc app users crowdsourced by TruEyes might not be reliable. The form-factor of a mobile device poses additional constraints on the type of tasks that can be executed. Therefore, further research is necessary to understand what types of crowdsourcing tasks are well suited for the TruEyes system. Quality control is the one of the major challenges with crowdsourcing . Platforms such as MTurk employ various quality assurance techniques. On a basic level, requesters have the ability to choose workers based on their reputation as well as their qualification . However, it is unreasonable to expect all workers to perform tasks diligently all the time. Some workers make use of automated bots to complete multiple tasks at the same time, while others find ways to game the system without spending much effort . At the same time, some workers may not posses the skills and expertise necessary to complete certain tasks . Therefore, it is inevitable that quality control issues will also affect the TruEyes system. Over the years, researchers have come up with different strategies to tackle this problem in crowdsourcing. One such strategy is incorporating explicitly verifiable questions as part of the task . For the TruEyes image labeling tasks, this means that every set of labeling tasks would include images for which the label is already known. Another strategy involves taking advantage of expert workers in the pool. Naturally, some users would perform better than others, eventually becoming experts in certain tasks. Frameworks such as ELICE [ref]52 make use of a few number of experts to improve the performance of a bigger pool of labeling workers. However, this requires contextual tracking of a mobile app userâ€™s performance to identify their areas of expertise. On the other hand, some researchers believe that it impossible to weed out all the adversarial workers, for which they propose error-embracing crowdsourcing models that can tolerate small amounts of error while retaining quality . One of the major benefits of crowdsourcing platforms like MTurk is the access to a large sample of human workers who are persistently available . It has allowed researchers to overcome the statistical barriers associated with small sample sizes . But the mechanics of the MTurk platform implicitly introduces the potential for sampling bias, as workers have the freedom to choose tasks based on monetary compensation, completion times, or other interests and incentives [ref]54 . The rising popularity of crowdsourcing platforms has also taken a toll on workers, with issues such as underpayment and difficulties finding appropriate crowdsourcing work . On the contrary, the TruEyes approach relies on the mobile app ecosystem as its distribution method. By integrating task ads into day-to-day apps and games, we capture responses from app users who might otherwise not participate in crowdsourcing platforms. With the right threshold of apps integrating the TruEyes task ads, we believe that the sampling bias associated with traditional crowdsourcing can be minimized. As app users are intrinsically motivated to engage with their apps, we argue that the non-monetary rewards associated with TruEyes task ads eliminate the notion of crowdsourced workers being treated as a computational resource. With more and more digital products and services being offered for free on the Internet, ads have become a vital financial component for monetization. Advertisers derive the most value out of ads when they have fine-grained visibility and contextual understanding of the viewers of their ads, which helps target the right ad for the right audience. Over the years, advertisement publishers have adopted aggressive measures to collect user data, raising privacy concerns . With the growing awareness on data privacy and introduction of regulations such as GPDR (General Data Protection Regulation), it has become increasingly cumbersome for advertisers to collect user data [ref]56. Notably, in light of growing privacy concerns, Apple recently introduced a mandatory opt-in system for enabling tracking for apps on their mobile operating system iOS with version 14 . We believe that adopting TruEyes as an alternative monetization strategy can help change usersâ€™ perception towards free products and services on the Internet. The TruEyes system facilitates an open exchange of value, where users perform crowdsourcing work in the form of microtasks in exchange for accessing free products and services.\n As technology continues to grow, the average user will have more number of interactions with digital systems, and we believe the duration of these interactions will get even shorter overtime. Our exploration with TruEyes task ads demonstrated how capturing the userâ€™s attention for a short period of 30 seconds in between app usage could provide value if the incentives are aligned. We believe that leveraging these short interactions for performing crowdsourcing or other forms of colloborative work opens new opportunities with interesting areas to further expand HCI research.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: strategy involves taking advantage of expert workers in the pool.
