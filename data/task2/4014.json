      "content": "Paper Title: ADAPT: Vision-Language Navigation with Modality-Aligned Action Prompts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-Language Navigation.\nGiven the language instruction, a VLN agent is required to follow it to reach a predefined goal position. Early methods usually employ a sequence-to-sequence model architecture [ref]8 9 . Speaker-follower [ref]8 introduces synthetic instructions to alleviate the annotation burden of instructions. EnvDrop 9 develops an environmental dropout strategy to generate augmented data by mimicking unseen environments. Recently, large-scale vision-language pretraining models      have shown significant superiority on multiple vision-language understanding tasks like Visual Commonsense Reasoning  and Visual Question Answering . Inspired by this, more and more works have introduced vision-language pretrained models into the VLN area [ref]11  . PREVALENT [ref]11 collects plenty of image-text-action triplets to pretrain the agent with self-supervised tasks such as attended masked language modeling and action prediction. VLN↻↻\\circlearrowrightBERT  adds a recurrent function to help the agent recognize time-dependent input.\nHowever, in these pretrained VLN methods, the agent learns the relationship between the action decision and multi-modal information implicitly, leading to inefficient training and limited generalization abilities.\nIn this paper, we take the first step to develop a prompt-based VLN agent, which receives explicit action prompts indicating cross-modal action knowledge for assisting the action decision during navigation.\n Prompt Engineering.\nRecent studies have shown that prompts play a vital role in improving pretrained language models in many downstream NLP tasks 8 0  6  4.\nJiang et al.  apply the text mining and paraphrasing techniques to generate the candidate prompts and choose the one with the highest accuracy. For facilitating prompt learning, Shin et al. 7 propose to generate prompts automatically through the gradient-based search. Lately, some works 0  6 propose to generate continuous prompts instead of hand-crafted text prompts. Inspired by the progress that prompt learning has made in NLP, some works attempt to introduce it into the pretrained vision-language models recently   . CoOp  models the context in prompts using continuous representations and keeps the pretrained model parameters fixed to conduct end-to-end learning.\nCPT  reformulates the visual grounding task into a fill-in-the-blank problem with color-based cross-modal prompts.\nFrozen  encodes the image as a sequence of continuous embeddings to serve as the prefix to implement multi-modal few-shot learning.\nIn the light of the prompt engineering paradigm, we introduce the modality-aligned action prompts during navigation for enabling VLN agents to learn cross-modal action knowledge explicitly. Through these action prompts, the agent can effectively learn action-level modality alignment for implementing successful navigation.\n Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP).\nCLIP 3 is a large-scale pre-trained model that relies on natural language supervision to learn visual representations. For an image-text pair, a visual encoder and a text encoder are used to encode the input representations independently. And the dot product between the two encoder’s output serves as the alignment score of the image-text pair. Through training on 400M noisy image-text pairs, CLIP has shown strong zero-shot capabilities on benchmarks such as ImageNet classification.\nRecently, some works propose to resort to the knowledge learned in CLIP to improve the generalization ability of downstream models, including object detection , image manipulation 1, and vision-language tasks 6.\nIn this paper, we employ CLIP to retrieve the image containing instruction-referred visual object/location in a specific action image sequence for building action prompts. With the powerful cross-modal alignment ability of CLIP, the instruction-referred visual object/location images can be effectively retrieved for ensuring the quality of the action prompts.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Navigation.\nGiven the language instruction, a VLN agent is required to follow it to reach a predefined goal position.
