      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Sparsity in Pruned Neural Networks to Optimize Large Model Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable I lists the set of neural networks and the\ncorresponding hyperparameters used in this study. VGG-19 [ref]39\nand WideResnet-101 0 are two convolutional neural network\n(CNN) architectures widely used in computer vision. GPT-3 [ref]2, a\nvariant of the transformer architecture , is\nextremely popular in natural language processing for causal language modeling.\nFor each model, we use the same hyperparameters (batch size, sequence length,\nlearning rate schedules, gradient clipping, l2 regularization and optimizer\nhyperparameters) as used by the authors. We use SGD (with\nmomentum ) and the AdamW  optimizer for training\nthe CNN and GPT-3 models respectively. We use MegatronLM’s highly optimized\nkernels to implement the GPT-3 models . For the\nconvolution neural networks, we use implementations provided by the torchvision\nlibrary111https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html. We profile the neural networks listed in Table I under a\nstrong scaling setup to demonstrate the efficacy of our optimizations. For\nevery model, we choose the minimum and maximum GPU counts such that the ratio\nof batch size to number of GPUs is 4 and 1 respectively. For a given model, we\nfix the batch size irrespective of the GPU count. This is because while\nincreasing the batch size leads to better performance, it also degrades the\nquality of convergence . Under a strict definition of strong\nscaling, the final answer should be the same irrespective of the number of\nGPUs. Therefore, it is important to keep the global batch size fixed. For our\napproach, we prune the networks to a sparsity of 90% using You et al.’s\n“Early Bird Ticket” algorithm . To ensure the correctness of our optimizations, we train GPT-3 XL and GPT-3\n2.7B to completion on the Wikitext-103 dataset  and the\nBookCorpus dataset  respectively. We present the validation\nperplexity curves for AxoNN and AxoNN+SAMO. Again, we use a sparsity of\n90% and the same pruning algorithm as the strong scaling runs. The\npurpose of this experiment to ensure that our proposed optimizations work\ncorrectly in an end-to-end fashion in combination with a pruning algorithm.\nSince this is a sanity check, the datasets we have used are much smaller than\nwhat are typically used to train large GPT-3 style language models. We\nhighlight prior work by Samar et al. 5, who have\nsuccessfully pruned GPT-3 style language models upto 90% on a much larger and\nchallenging dataset (Pile 6.)\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Table I lists the set of neural networks and the\ncorresponding hyperparameters used in this study.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
