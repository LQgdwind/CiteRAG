      "content": "Paper Title: MoRAG - Multi-Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText-driven human motion generation has seen unprecedented growth in recent years [ref]37 [ref]38   [ref]16. Numerous works have been proposed for this task, ranging from encoder-decoder style architectures    to the recent emerging trend of diffusion-based models  [ref]38, which generate fine-grained, realistic motion sequences. While they can generate high-quality motion sequences for simple or familiar text descriptions similar to those in the training set, they perform poorly with complex or unseen text descriptions. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention in recent years for its potential to enhance generative models by incorporating additional information through retrieval methods  . By integrating retrieval-based techniques with generative models, RAG produces outputs that are more accurate, contextually relevant, and reliable. Moreover, this additional information helps enhance the model’s generalizability across language space and also improves the stochasticity. However, the application of RAG in motion generation is underexplored. A RAG system typically comprises two key components: the retriever and the generator. The retriever identifies relevant information from a database based on the input query, while the generator uses both the input query and the retrieved information to generate the desired content. Recently proposed text-to-motion retrieval approaches3  aim to retrieve full-body motion sequences from the motion database using a contrastive training strategy between text and motion embeddings. However, these retrieval strategies do not perform well when text phrases contain spelling errors, rephrased text sequences, or substitution of synonymous words. (See Fig. 5) Action-GPT[ref]16, TMR++ prompt large-language models (LLMs) to provide detailed descriptions as input. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to generate or retrieve motion sequences for text descriptions that are not present in the database, restricting the diversity of output motion sequences and reducing generalization to out-of-domain or unseen text descriptions ( Fig. 6 (a)) Based on the RAG concept, ReMoDiffuse[ref]37, adopts a hybrid retrieval approach using motion length and CLIP6-based text-to-text similarity, which does not incorporate any motion-specific information, which can result in inaccurate retrievals (Fig. 2) and motion generation. (Fig. 6 (b)) To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a multi-part fusion-based augmented motion retrieval strategy that is capable of constructing diverse and reliable motion sequences. We train part-specific independent motion retrieval models that retrieve motion sequences with movements corresponding to each part aligned with the provided text description. The retrieved part-specific motion sequences are fused accordingly to construct full body motion sequences, allowing our method to even query unseen text descriptions. Our experiments show that incorporating the constructed motion sequences as an additional conditioning to the diffusion based motion generation model improves the alignment with the semantic information of the text description and diversity of generated sequences. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We propose MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion-based retrieval augmented human motion generation framework to enhance the performance of the diffusion based motion generation model. We adapt part-wise motion retrieval approach that utilizes generative prompts to construct motion sequences that align with the provided text description. Motion sequences constructed using our retrieval strategy exhibit superior generalization and diversity, as shown by the qualitative and quantitative analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Text-driven human motion generation has seen unprecedented growth in recent years [ref]37 [ref]38   [ref]16.
