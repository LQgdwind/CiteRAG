      "content": "Paper Title: General regularization in covariate shift adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we discuss recent results for the analysis of IWRLS in RKHS under the covariate shift assumption.\nOur main focus is on general regularization schemes, often referred to as spectral regularization (cf., [ref]31, 8, and the references therein).\nAs a result, we refine state-of-the-art risk bounds for IWRLS by combining known results.\nIn particular, we show how smoothness conditions for Radon-Nikod√Ωm differentiation allow IWRLS to achieve the same order of accuracy as regularized kernel regression, but with a smaller amount of samples as in known situations. In SectionLABEL:sec2, we describe the IWRLS algorithm and review the recent risk bound.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first risk bound for IWRLS.\nThis analysis is based on smoothness conditions on fqsubscriptùëìùëûf_{q} and it assumes access to the values of the (unknown) Radon-Nikod√Ωm derivative d‚ÄãœÅTd‚ÄãœÅSùëësubscriptùúåùëáùëësubscriptùúåùëÜ\\frac{d\\rho_{T}}{d\\rho_{S}} of œÅTsubscriptùúåùëá\\rho_{T} w.r.t.œÅSsubscriptùúåùëÜ\\rho_{S}, which appear as the sample weights in IWRLS. In SectionLABEL:sec:radon_Nikod√Ωm_differentiation, we review recent error bounds of for algorithms estimating the Radon-Nikod√Ωm derivative which refine the study.\nIn particular, we highlight general smoothness conditions, under which upper bounds on the pointwise error are smaller than upper bounds on the error in RKHS norm. In SectionLABEL:sec:embedded_regularization, we embed the regularized Radon-Nikod√Ωm differentiation considered in SectionLABEL:sec:radon_Nikod√Ωm_differentiation into the regularization schemes considered in SectionLABEL:sec2, so that no exact values of the unknown Radon-Nikod√Ωm derivative are needed.\nThe considered smoothness conditions provide novel situations under which IWRLS achieves the same order of accuracy as standard least squares regression in RKHS.\nInterestingly, the obtained order of accuracy is much higher than anticipated under the slightly weaker conditions of the state of the art. In SectionLABEL:sec:parameter_choice, we review a general method for regularization parameter choice issues in IWRLS .\nThe method is based on aggregating several regularized solutions.\nAgain, the considered smoothness conditions allow to refine known error bounds for this method.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: discuss recent results for the analysis of IWRLS in RKHS under the covariate shift assumption.\nOur main focus is on general regularization schemes, often referred to as spectral regularization (cf., [ref]31, 8, and the references therein).\nAs a result, we refine state-of-the-art risk bounds for IWRLS by combining known results.\nIn particular, we show how smoothness conditions for Radon-Nikod√Ωm\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
