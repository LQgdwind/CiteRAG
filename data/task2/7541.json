      "content": "Paper Title: Theoretically Achieving Continuous Representation of Oriented Bounding Boxes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMethods aiming to handle the discontinuous representation of OBBs fall into three categories: Loss Improvement, Angle Encoding, and New OBB representation. Loss Imporvement.\nModifying the loss is a direct way to mitigate sudden changes in loss values caused by encoding discontinuity. Approaches like RIL  and RSDet [ref]21 propose loss functions that approach zero as the model’s output converges to various representations of the ground truth OBB. PIoU  and SCRDet [ref]34 incorporate Intersection over Union (IoU) between prediction results and regression targets in their loss. GWD , KLD , and KFIoU  convert OBBs into Gaussian distributions for IoU calculation, introducing potential DA for square-like objects. While showing empirical effectiveness in reducing the impact of discontinuity, these approaches do not provide a theoretical resolution to the problem. Angle Encoding.\nSeveral methods focus on addressing the Periodicity of Angular (PoA), a primary cause of encoding discontinuity [ref]33. CSL [ref]33 discretizes the rotation angle into a heavy regression target, with subsequent improvements by DCL , GF_CSL , MGAR , and AR-CSL . While these methods enhance rotation continuity, most of them struggle with square-like objects and may introduce DI. PSC , FSTC , and ACM  encode the rotation angle into a continuous vector, yet they still exhibit discontinuity for square-like objects. New OBB Representation.\nOther approaches explore alternative representations for OBBs instead of rectangles and rotation angles. Gliding Vertex  slides the four vertices of a HBB to construct an OBB. O2D-Net  and BBAVectors  represent an OBB using its center point and vectors from the center point to midpoints of its sides. PolarDet  and CRB  leverage polar coordinates, yet the rotation discontinuity still exists. DHRec  represents OBBs with double horizontal rectangles but struggles with distinguishing symmetrical tilted thin OBBs. To the best of our knowledge, no method achieves perfect elimination of discontinuity. Previous approaches either fail in specific boundary situations or introduce DI and DA. The proposed COBB in this paper provides the first completely continuous representation of OBBs.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Encoding, and New OBB representation. Loss Imporvement.\nModifying the loss is a direct way to mitigate sudden changes in loss values caused by encoding discontinuity. Approaches like RIL  and RSDet [ref]21 propose loss functions that approach zero as the model’s output converges to various representations of the ground truth OBB.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
