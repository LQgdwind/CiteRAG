      "content": "Paper Title: Mixed-Precision Neural Networks: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhat is meant by deterministic quantization is a one-to-one mapping that exists between the \"real\" (hereon used to mean a floating, non-quantized value) and quantized values. One type of deterministic quantization is rounding. Works like ,  and  round the real value into a \"0\" or \"1\", i.e. utilizing binary representation. For example,  used the sign function as follows where q is the quantized value and r is the real value.\nMoreover, [ref]38 compiled the works done on binary neural networks, which utilize rounding techniques. In [ref]21, is a general form of the s​i​g​n𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛sign function, where the real value is quantized into multi-levels. To quantize the real value into its closest fixed point,  proposed a rounding scheme as follows. where r, i, f, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon denote the real value, number of integer bits, number of fractional bits, and the smallest number (positive) that one can represent in the fixed-point format in the equation. The real values ∉[i,f]absent𝑖𝑓\\not\\in[i,f] are normalized to either the upper bound or the lower bound of the fixed-point representation. Moreover, ’s rounding scheme converts the real value into a k-bit integer. Vector quantization is yet another deterministic quantization technique where the real parameters are grouped into clusters and then quantization is applied to each cluster. Several extensions to vector quantization have been proposed as well.    . In [ref]60 the k-means clustering is used to form the weight clusters as follows. where for the weight matrix W∈Ru​x​v𝑊superscript𝑅𝑢𝑥𝑣W\\in R^{uxv}, the scalars w​e​i​g​h​t∈R1​x​u∗v𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡superscript𝑅1𝑥𝑢𝑣weight\\in R^{1xu*v}. Each element in weight is, then after the clustering, given a cluster index and one can form a codebook with the cluster centers c​e​n​t​r​o​i​d𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑖𝑑centroid which is a 1​x​w1𝑥𝑤1xw row vector.\nThen, the centroid of each cluster is used to quantize the real weights in that cluster. In addition, deterministic quantization also comprises formulations whereby the quantization is regarded as an optimization problem whose purpose is to find good approximations of the real values like in   and .  formulated the loss function as part of an optimization problem in order to allocate a larger bitwidth for significant weights compared to non-significant weights. Their optimization formulation is as follows where n𝑛n is the total number of parameters, Nt​o​t​a​l(.)N_{total}(.) is the total number of bits in the network, Nm​i​n(.)N_{min}(.) is the minimum number of bits used to represent a weight and U.B. is utilized an upper bound on the acceptable accuracy lost.  proposed to binarize the weights that do not increase the loss through the following optimization formulation. where Np​a​r​a​m​ssubscript𝑁𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑠N_{params} and Nl​a​y​e​r​ssubscript𝑁𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑠N_{layers} are the total number of parameters in layer and the total number of layers respectively. In addition, codebook quantization, where the real value is quantized into a codebook, is listed as deterministic quantization. It is worth mentioning that the codebook can be either predefined or learned from the data. In , the predefined codebook {−1,1}11\\{-1,1\\} is used.  uses a 2-element codebook (binarized) but where the codebook values are scaled to some values. Similarly,  uses a predefined ternary codebook {−1,0,1}101\\{-1,0,1\\} while  uses a scaled ternary codebook. A powers-of-two predefined codebook {…,−2(−2),−2(−1),−1,0,+1,+2(−1),2(−2),…}…superscript22superscript21101superscript21superscript22…\\{...,-2^{(-2)},-2^{(-1)},-1,0,+1,+2^{(-1)},2^{(-2)},...\\} is used in . Examples of leaned codebooks can be found in  [ref]60 and .\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: and  round the real value into a \"0\" or \"1\", i.e. utilizing binary representation.
