      "content": "Paper Title: Spectral Adversarial Training for Robust Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) , as powerful architectures for modeling graph-structured data, have attracted enormous attention in both academia and industry in recent years. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that operate on Euclidean data, GNNs provide an effective and efficient framework, namely message passing and aggregation, allowing to generalize the CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds), and learn the relationships (edges) between a set of objects (nodes). Due to their strong representation ability, GNNs have achieved significant success in a variety of graph applications, such as social networks , knowledge graphs, recommender systems , and even life science . Nevertheless, recent efforts show that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarially designed inputs, i.e., adversarial examples [ref]6, and naturally, GNNs inherit such defects. Despite the promising advancement of GNNs, they still suffer from potential security threats in many graph-related tasks. Specifically, a well-trained GNN can be easily fooled by slight but carefully designed perturbations on the graph structure or node features, which try to mislead the model by malicious input instances. For example, attackers may modify (add or remove) a small number of connections (edges), such that the target node could be misclassified [ref]7  or the overall model performance would have a significant degradation . How to resist such adversarial behaviors has so far become a crucial open problem, which motivates researchers to develop more effective methods to enhance the robustness of GNNs. Adversarial Training (AT) has recently emerged as a general approach to improve the resistance of GNNs against adversarial attacks. As shown in Figure 1, AT simulates the adversarial attacks during the training phase and encourages the smoothness of prediction outputs. It has been proven as an effective data augmentation and regularization technique to enhance the robustness against adversarial examples 0 1 2. Current AT approaches on graph data are typically motivated by the vision research that adds imperceptible perturbations on image data [ref]6. These existing methods can be summarized into two generic categories: (i) structure-based AT. The graph topology itself is subject to attacks by adversarially injecting or removing edges or nodes, and hence the adversarial examples can likewise be constructed by such modifications. In this way, Xu et al. 3 present the first optimization-based AT, where the adversarial input graph is formed by a PGD attack 3 that greedily leverages the gradients and a projection operation to sequentially modify the nodes’ connections. (ii) feature-based AT. It is challenging to facilitate the difficulty of tackling graph data since one has to maintain their properties, e.g., discreteness111Generally, if we use an adjacency matrix to denote a simple unweighted graph, any values would be meaningless except 0 and 1.. Therefore, existing works mainly manipulate the node input features or hidden representations with continuous perturbations to avoid directly manipulating graph structures. As such, Feng et al. 4 dynamically apply graph perturbations on input node features and encourage the smoothness of prediction outputs via virtual adversarial training. Jin et al. 5 propose latent adversarial training, which constructs adversarial examples by perturbing the latent representations instead of directly perturbing the graph. Although these works attempt to enhance the robustness of GNNs by employing adversarial training on the graph domain, there still exist several problems to be addressed: (i) For structure-based AT, an immediate obstacle arises from computational overhead. Existing works on generating adversarial examples by structural attacks, e.g., [ref]7 and 6, usually require substantially more costs than standard attacks. Besides, the resulting model jointly trained with a specific attack may not easily generalize to different attacks that have never been seen before. In conclusion, directly applying AT to discrete graph data is inefficient and fraught with challenges. (ii) For feature-based AT, it treats node input features or latent representations as independent of each other, including connected instances. The perturbations are performed on the feature space separately while the relationship between instances is discarded, which would fail to capture the structural information of a graph and generalize to structural attacks. However, it has been proven that structural attack is more powerful than feature attack 7. Hence, standard adversarial training on feature space is not sufficient to resist stronger structural adversarial attacks (we provide detailed experimental evidence in Section 5.3). In light of these challenges, in this work, we propose a novel Spectral Adversarial Training (SAT) method to learn robust GNNs against adversarial attacks. SAT enjoys the advantages of structure and feature-based AT, as well as overcoming both of these obstacles based on the matrix perturbation theory. Specifically, SAT first forms a low-rank approximation of the graph structure by spectral decomposition. Since the spectrum characterizes the topological property of the graph, SAT approximates the structure perturbations in terms of the change of the spectrum to facilitate adversarial training. Then, we perform perturbations on the spectrum by treating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (eigenpairs) as node structural features. The standard AT is applied on the eigenpairs to simulate the structure-based AT in a continuous space. In this regard, SAT additionally incorporates two spectral adversarial training regularizers into the objective function during training, for the sake of enforcing the model to yield a smoothed output even when the adversarial attacks are presented. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We thoroughly investigate related works and subsequently give a unified formulation of AT on graph data. We systematically categorize existing works related to graph-based AT into structure-based and feature-based methods and shed light on the obstacles to overcome. We propose a novel approach Spectral Adversarial Training (SAT), which approximates the low-rank graph by spectral decomposition and employs adversarial training on the graph spectrum to regularize GNN models and improve their robustness against adversarial attacks. We demonstrate the robustness and generalization ability of SAT employed on a line of widely used GNNs. Comprehensive experiments on four node classification datasets validate that SAT is capable to improve the model robustness without sacrificing classification power and training efficiency. The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the related works of GNNs and adversarial defense on graph data. In Section 3, we give notations and preliminaries. In Section 4 and Section 5, we illustrate our proposed method and present the experimental results with sufficient analysis, respectively. Finally, we draw our conclusion and highlight future works in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: knowledge graphs, recommender systems , and even life science .
