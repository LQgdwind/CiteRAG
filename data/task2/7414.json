      "content": "Paper Title: Multiple Instance Learning for Cheating Detection and Localization in Online Examinations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the characteristics of multiple instance learning, each instance in the negative bag is negative, while the instances in each positive bag are unidentified. Therefore, we need to use the label generator to generate clip-level anomaly scores for the instances in the positive bags as their labels, and differentiate the anomaly scores between positive and negative instances as accurately as possible. It should be noted that a clip is usually composed of several frames, and the number of frames in a clip could be adjusted according to the experimental results. In the feature extraction stage, we deploy a classical feature encoder, i.e. C3D  pretrained on Sport-1M  or I3D pretrained on Kinetics-400 [ref]51 to extract clip-level features required by the label generator. However, if the video of indeterminate length is simply fused into 32 segment features as the input of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) 0, the prediction effect of the final model is often not ideal. In order to accommodate the variation in the duration of untrimmed video and class imbalance, we introduce a continuous sampling strategy\n[ref]43: After the feature extractor extracts features {fi}i=1Nsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑁𝑖1\\left\\{f_{i}\\right\\}^{N}_{i=1} from the original video V𝑉V=={vi}i=1Nsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖𝑁𝑖1\\{v_{i}\\}^{N}_{i=1}, we uniformly sample L𝐿L sub-bags U={fl,t}l=1,t=1L,T𝑈subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑙𝑡𝐿𝑇formulae-sequence𝑙1𝑡1U=\\left\\{f_{l,t}\\right\\}^{L,T}_{l=1,t=1} from these clips. Specifically, there are T𝑇T consecutive clips in each sub-bag, as shown in Figure 2. The T𝑇T is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned. In detail, in order to make the anomalous score of the anomalous video clips higher than the normal video clips, we adopt deep MIL ranking loss 0 to train MLP. The sampled features are entered into the label generator to predict the corresponding anomaly scores {sl,t}l=1,t=1L,Tsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝑙𝑡𝐿𝑇formulae-sequence𝑙1𝑡1\\left\\{s_{l,t}\\right\\}^{L,T}_{l=1,t=1}. By performing averaging pooling, the anomaly score Slsubscript𝑆𝑙S_{l} for each sub-bag is derived: Then, the anomaly scores of all instances in the positive bags marked as Sa={sia}i=1Nsuperscript𝑆𝑎subscriptsuperscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝑖𝑎𝑁𝑖1S^{a}=\\left\\{s_{i}^{a}\\right\\}^{N}_{i=1} are min-max normalized to form clip-level labels: where yiasubscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑎𝑖{y}^{a}_{i} between   is a clip-level label.
