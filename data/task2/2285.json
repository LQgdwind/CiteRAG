      "content": "Paper Title: Faithful Edge Federated Learning: Scalability and Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning.\nThe existing literature has studied how to make the model sharing process more privacy-preserving (e.g.,    ), more secure (e.g.,  ), more efficient (e.g., [ref]12 ), and more robust (e.g.,  ) against heterogeneity in the distributed data sources among many other works. For a more detailed survey, please refer to .\nOn the other hand, extensive studies attempting to improve the efficiency can be categorized into two directions: algorithmic and communication design. First, by designing new techniques including quantization (e.g., [ref]12) and new novel learning models (e.g., multi-task federated learning ). Second, in wireless edge networks, efforts have studied resource allocation algorithms for edge nodes (e.g., ), scheduling policies against interference (e.g.,  ), mobile user selection and resource allocation algorithms (e.g.,  )\nand new communication techniques (e.g., over-the-air computation ).\nHowever, this line of work assumes that agents (in addition to malicious attackers as in  ) are willing to participate into federated learning and obey the algorithms,\nwhereas agents in practice are strategic and require proper incentives to do so. In terms of incentive design for federated learning, which has been listed as an outstanding problem in [ref]5,\nonly a few recent studies attempted to address this issue  [ref]28        [ref]5    .\nReference  describes a payoff sharing algorithm that maximizes the system designer’s utility without considering agents’ strategic behaviors.\nYu et al. in  introduced fairness guarantees to the previous reward system.\nOther studies have been considering economic approaches to compensating agents’ communication and computation costs based on economic approaches such as contract theory (e.g.,   [ref]28), Stackelberg game  , auction theory (e.g.,  ), and reputation . However, this line of work focused on incentivizing agent participation by compensating them for their costs and eliciting their truthful cost information, but assumed that\nagents are obedient to follow federated learning algorithms without strategic manipulation. Faithful Mechanisms. Only a few studies in the literature considered faithful mechanism design (e.g.,    ).\nFaithful implementation was first introduced by Parkes et al. in : a mechanism is faithful if no one can benefit from deviating, including information revelation, computation, and message passing.\nFeigenbaum et al. proposed a faithful policy-based inter-domain routing in .\nPetcu et al. in  generalized the above results and achieve faithfulness for general distributed constrained optimization problems.\nHowever, none of the existing studies on faithful implementation guaranteed differential privacy or scalability, or performed risk bound analysis in a (statistical) learning framework.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Federated Learning.\nThe existing literature has studied how to make the model sharing process more privacy-preserving (e.g.,    ), more secure (e.g.,  ), more efficient (e.g., [ref]12 ), and more robust (e.g.,  ) against heterogeneity in the distributed data sources among many other works.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
