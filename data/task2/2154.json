      "content": "Paper Title: BoolNet: Minimizing the Energy Consumption of Binary Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, Efficient Deep Learning has become a research field that has attracted much attention.\nTechnical directions, such as,\ncompact network design     ,\nknowledge distillation  ,\nnetwork pruning    , and\nlow-bit quantization  1 0 [ref]29  are proposed for model compression and acceleration.\nThe efficient models have evolved from the earliest handcrafted designs to the current use of neural architecture search to search for the best basic block and overall network structure    .\nThe criterion of efficiency evaluation has also changed from instruction and parameter counts to more precise measurements of actual memory and operating efficiency on the target hardware  . Binary Neural Networks were first introduced by Courbariaux et al.  and their initial attempt only evaluated on small datasets such as MNIST , CIFAR10  and SVHN 6.\nThe follow-up XNOR-Net 1 proposes channel-wise scaling factors for approximating the real-valued parameters, which achieves 51.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\nHowever, there is an 18% gap compared with its 32-bit counterpart, ResNet-18.\nTherefore, recent efforts mainly focused on narrowing the accuracy gap.\nWRPN 5 shows that expanding the channel width of binary convolutions can obtain a better performance.\nIn ABC-Net  and GroupNet , instead of using a single binary convolution, they use a set of k binary convolutions (referred to as binary bases) to approximate a 32-bit convolution.\nThis sort of method achieves higher accuracy but increases the required memory and number of operations of each convolution by the factor k.\nBi-RealNet 0 proposes using real-valued (32-bit) shortcuts to maintain a 32-bit information flow, which effectively improves the accuracy.\nThis design strategy became a standard for later work e.g.,   [ref]29.\nMartinez et al. 4 propose using a real-valued attention mechanism and well-tuned training recipes to boost the accuracy further.\nThanks to the special architecture design, the recent MeliusNet  and ReActNet [ref]29 achieve MobileNet-level accuracy with similar number of theoretical operations.\nOther attempts, such as leveraging neural architecture search  6 and dynamic networks , show that those successful methods on regular real-valued networks are also effective for BNN.\nOften, with improved accuracy, 32-bit components are used more frequently as well, such as PReLU and BatchNorm after each binary convolution [ref]29, real-valued attention module 4 and scaling factors, etc.\nOn the contrary, efficiency analysis in the literature often only considers the theoretical operation number.\nHowever, the memory usage and the actual energy consumption has received very little attention so far.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: become a research field that has attracted much attention.\nTechnical directions, such as,\ncompact network design     ,\nknowledge distillation  ,\nnetwork pruning    , and\nlow-bit quantization  1 0 [ref]29  are proposed for model compression and acceleration.\nThe efficient models have evolved from the earliest handcrafted designs to the current use of neural architecture search to search for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
