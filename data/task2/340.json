      "content": "Paper Title: Robust testing of low-dimensional functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn a recent work, De, Mossel and Neeman  initiated the study of property testing of linear juntas. A function f:ℝn→[−1,1]:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛11f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow[-1,1] is said to be a linear k𝑘k-junta if there are k𝑘k unit vectors u1,…,uk∈ℝnsubscript𝑢1…subscript𝑢𝑘superscriptℝ𝑛u_{1},\\ldots,u_{k}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} and g:ℝk→[−1,1]:𝑔→superscriptℝ𝑘11g:\\mathbb{R}^{k}\\rightarrow[-1,1] such that f​(x)=g​(⟨u1,x⟩,…,⟨uk,x⟩)𝑓𝑥𝑔subscript𝑢1𝑥…subscript𝑢𝑘𝑥f(x)=g(\\langle u_{1},x\\rangle,\\ldots,\\langle u_{k},x\\rangle).\nIn other words, f𝑓f is a linear k𝑘k-junta if there is a subspace E≔span​(u1,…,uk)≔𝐸spansubscript𝑢1…subscript𝑢𝑘E\\coloneqq\\mathrm{span}(u_{1},\\ldots,u_{k}) of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} such that f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) depends only on the projection of x𝑥x on the subspace E𝐸E. The class of linear k𝑘k-juntas is the ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}-analogue of the class of k𝑘k-juntas on the Boolean cube We note that the family of linear k𝑘k-juntas includes important classes of functions that have been studied in the learning and testing literature. Notably it includes: Boolean juntas: If h:{−1,1}n→{−1,1}:ℎ→superscript11𝑛11h:\\{-1,1\\}^{n}\\to\\{-1,1\\} is a Boolean junta, then\nf​(x):ℝn→{−1,1}:𝑓𝑥→superscriptℝ𝑛11f(x):\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\{-1,1\\} defined as f​(x)=h​(𝗌𝗀𝗇​(x1),…,𝗌𝗀𝗇​(xn))𝑓𝑥ℎ𝗌𝗀𝗇subscript𝑥1…𝗌𝗀𝗇subscript𝑥𝑛f(x)=h(\\mathsf{sgn}(x_{1}),\\ldots,\\mathsf{sgn}(x_{n})) is a linear k𝑘k-junta. Functions of halfspaces: Linear k𝑘k-juntas include as a special case both halfspaces and intersections of k𝑘k-halfspaces. The testability of halfspaces was studied in    . The focus of the paper is on property testing of linear k𝑘k-juntas. Observe that to formally define a testing algorithm, we need to define a notion of distance between functions f𝑓f and g𝑔g on ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}.\nIn this work, we will use the L2​(γ)superscript𝐿2𝛾L^{2}(\\gamma) metric, where γ𝛾\\gamma is the standard Gaussian measure.\nThat is, the distance between f𝑓f and g𝑔g is (𝐄𝐱∼γ[f​(𝐱)−g​(𝐱)2])1/2superscriptsubscript𝐄similar-to𝐱𝛾delimited-[]𝑓𝐱𝑔superscript𝐱212(\\mathop{\\mathbf{E}}_{{\\bf x}\\sim\\gamma}[f({\\bf x})-g({\\bf x})^{2}])^{1/2}.\nNote that this reduces to 2​Pr𝐱∼γ⁡[f​(𝐱)≠g​(𝐱)]2subscriptPrsimilar-to𝐱𝛾𝑓𝐱𝑔𝐱2\\Pr_{{\\bf x}\\sim\\gamma}[f({\\bf x})\\neq g({\\bf x})] when f𝑓f\nand g𝑔g are Boolean functions.\nThe choice of the standard Gaussian measure is well-established in the areas of learning and\ntesting     [ref]14 7  1 5. It is particularly natural in our setup since the Gaussian measure is invariant under many linear transformations, e.g., all rotations. De, Mossel and Neeman  obtained an algorithm for testing linear-k𝑘k-juntas:\ngiven query access to f:ℝn→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛11f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{-1,1\\}, it makes 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(k⋅s/ϵ)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒⋅𝑘𝑠italic-ϵ\\mathsf{poly}(k\\cdot s/\\epsilon) queries and distinguishes between f𝑓f is a linear-k𝑘k-junta with surface area at most s𝑠s versus f𝑓f is ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-far from any linear k𝑘k-junta with surface area at most s​(1+ϵ)𝑠1italic-ϵs(1+\\epsilon). Here surface area of f𝑓f refers to the Gaussian surface area 9 of the set f−1​(1)superscript𝑓11f^{-1}(1) 9\n– see Definition 2.7 for the precise definition.\nFurther,  showed that a polynomial dependence on s𝑠s is necessary for any non-adaptive tester and consequently, an Ω​(log⁡s)Ω𝑠\\Omega(\\log s) dependence is necessary for any tester111Recall that in a non-adaptive tester, the query points are chosen independently of the target f𝑓f.. Informally,\nwithout any smoothness assumption a linear junta (even a linear 1-junta on ℝ2superscriptℝ2{\\mathbb{R}}^{2}) can look arbitrarily\nrandom to any finite number of queries.\nCrucially,  achieves a query complexity which is independent of the ambient dimension n𝑛n – thus, qualitatively matching the guarantee for junta testing on the Boolean cube.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: x}\\sim\\gamma}[f({\\bf x})\\neq g({\\bf x})] when f𝑓f\nand g𝑔g are Boolean functions.\nThe choice of the standard Gaussian measure is well-established in the areas of learning and\ntesting     [ref]14 7  1 5.
