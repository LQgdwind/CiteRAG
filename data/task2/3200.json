Following the protocol in [ref]18, we firstly pretrain the ResNet-50 with various SSL losses. We then implement further supervised downstream tasks by either finetuning on the pretrained network, or by directly using the frozen feature out of the pretrained network depending on the task. In this section, we implement the proposed UOTA algorithm by using the SwAV loss (multi-crop with 8 views 2√ó224+6√ó9622246962\\times 224+6\\times 96), the exactly architecture and augmentation pool as in [ref]5 to optimize Eq. (12). We train all relevant algorithms on 4 V100 GPUs, with a batch size 256. For other training details, please refer to supplementary task. Evaluating the linear classification task on frozen features.\nWe further train linear classifier on frozen features out of each pretrained ResNet-50 network to evaluate the classification accuracy on test data. As Table 6 displays, our proposed UOTA algorithm (associated with the SwAV approach) has achieved the best Top-1 accuracy (73.5%percent73.573.5\\%) and Top-5 accuracy (91.8%percent91.891.8\\%) across all the presented SSL pretraining algorithms. Particularly, the proposed SwAV+UOTA pretrained for 200 epochs even surpasses SimCLR¬†[ref]7 and Barlow Twin¬† trained for 1000 epochs. Besides, the SwAV+UOTA framework outperforms the original SwAV baseline by 0.8%percent0.80.8\\% accuracy. In the meanwhile, the total training time for SwAV+UOTA is 181.5 hours, with only negligible 2 hours more than SwAV‚Äôs training time 179.2 hours on 4 V100 GPUs. These results demonstrate clear evidence of our proposed hypothesis: OOD samples broadly exist in the training data. Importantly, the OOD issue is not vanishing as the the number of instances in training significantly grows (much more than in ImageNet100). Fortunately, our lightweight UOTA procedure is able to modify the sampling distribution and reduce the estimator bias, guaranteed by our Lemma 1 and Theorem 1. We think this 0.8%percent0.80.8\\% improvement effectively raises a warning flag to the community, and it verifies that OOD samples has a clear and non-negligible impact that should be attended to. Binary classification between OOD data and clean data. In this section, we empirically verify that OOD samples and original image are linear separable on frozen features learned by UOTA. For this purpose, we choose ImageNet100 training data as training set and ImageNet1K val set (50,000 images) as test set. Each of the training data is randomly augmented into 5 views. We reorder all the samples according to their computed w¬Øi‚Äãjsubscript¬Øùë§ùëñùëó\\bar{w}_{ij} value in an ascending order (Group 1 contains the lowest w¬Øi‚Äãjsubscript¬Øùë§ùëñùëó\\bar{w}_{ij} valued samples, showing strongest sign of OOD sample; Group 5 has the highest w¬Øi‚Äãjsubscript¬Øùë§ùëñùëó\\bar{w}_{ij} samples, best resembling the semantic of the original training sample). We sequentially split such reordered augmentation set into 5 groups with equal sample size. Different groups then reflect the detected semantic uncertainty via UOTA. The test data are augmented in the same way and split into 5 groups, too. We then train the binary classifier on top of the frozen pre-trained model (SwAV+UOTA model producing Table 6), by respectively treating each Group nùëõn as class 1 (OOD class), with clean data considered as class 0 (class 0 and 1 have equal number of training data). Group 6 is a baseline with equal size of clean data in two subsets representing class 1 and class 0 respectively. More training details are included in the supplementary file. As Table 5 shows, the binary linear classifier between OOD and clean data on their frozen features always show clear statistical significance and better separability against the reference baseline Group 6. Notably, as the data exhibits weaker OOD signs (e.g., Group 5), the training becomes harder and harder, returning lower training accuracy, while the OOD samples still demonstrate much stronger linear separability against the baseline model Group 6. Finetuning on pretrained network for more downstream tasks. In this section, we evaluate the presented SSL algorithms by finetuning the pretrained ResNet50 equipped with FPN¬† on more downstream tasks. Table 7 respectively reports the performance on object detection, instance segmentation and keypoint detection tasks. These tasks, to some extent, evaluate the generalization capability of the pretrained features when transferred to other tasks and training datasets. According to Table 7, SwAV+UOTA still outperforms its baseline model SwAV on all evaluation metrics for the object detection and instance segmentation tasks. Notably, SwAV baseline drops drastically on the keypoint detection tasks in comparison to MoCo-v2. We speculate that the multi-resolution multi-crop augmentation has introduced more OOD samples into SwAV than in MoCO-v2, leading to vague semantic feature that is critical for successful key-point detection tasks. This well reveals that, even if we further finetune the pretrained network using alternative dataset, SwAV+UOTA is still able to benefit tasks by suppressing the OOD samples and balancing the estimator bias-variance trade-off during the pretrain. The advantage of UOTA is not erased due to the finetuning. Table 7 concludes that the down-weighted OOD samples through training using UOTA approach successfully forced the network to focus more on the true invariant semantics shared across multi-views, which plays pivotal importance on downstream task performance. \n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nEpochs\nBatch size\nTop-1 (%)\nTop-5 (%)\n\nCPC v2 \n200\n512\n63.8\n85.3\n\nCMC \n240\n/\n64.8\n86.1\n\nMoCo [ref]18\n200\n256\n60.6‚Ä†\n83.1‚Ä†\n\nMoCo v2 \n200\n256\n67.6‚Ä†\n88.0‚Ä†\n\nJCL \n200\n256\n68.7\n89.0\n\nSimCLR [ref]7\n1000\n4096\n69.3\n89.0\n\nSimSiam \n200\n256\n70.0\n/\n\nInfoMin Aug. \n200\n256\n70.1\n89.4\n\nBYOL \n200\n4096\n70.6‚Ä†\n/\n\nBarlow Twin \n1000\n2048\n73.2\n91.0\n\nSwAV [ref]5\n200\n256\n72.7‚Ä°\n91.5‚Ä°\n\nSwAV+UOTA (Ours)\n200\n256\n73.5 (+0.8%)\n91.8 (+0.3%)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nFaster R-CNN + R50-FPN\nMask R-CNN + R50-FPN\nKeypoint R-CNN + R50-FPN\n\nAPbbsubscriptsuperscriptabsentbb{}^{\\text{bb}}_{\\text{}}\nAP50bbsubscriptsuperscriptabsentbb50{}^{\\text{bb}}_{\\text{50}}\nAP75bbsubscriptsuperscriptabsentbb75{}^{\\text{bb}}_{\\text{75}}\nAPmksubscriptsuperscriptabsentmk{}^{\\text{mk}}_{\\text{~{}}}\nAP50mksubscriptsuperscriptabsentmk50{}^{\\text{mk}}_{\\text{50}}\nAP75mksubscriptsuperscriptabsentmk75{}^{\\text{mk}}_{\\text{75}}\nAPkpsubscriptsuperscriptabsentkp{}^{\\text{kp}}_{\\text{~{}}}\nAP50kpsubscriptsuperscriptabsentkp50{}^{\\text{kp}}_{\\text{50}}\nAP75kpsubscriptsuperscriptabsentkp75{}^{\\text{kp}}_{\\text{75}}\n\nrandom\n30.1\n48.6\n31.9\n28.5\n46.8\n30.4\n63.5\n85.3\n69.3\n\nsupervised\n38.2\n59.1\n41.5\n35.4\n56.5\n38.1\n65.4\n87.0\n71.0\n\nMoCo-v1[ref]18\n37.1\n57.4\n40.2\n35.1\n55.9\n37.7\n65.6\n87.1\n71.3\n\nMoCo-v2 \n37.6\n57.9\n40.8\n35.3\n55.9\n37.9\n66.0\n87.2\n71.4\n\nJCL \n38.1\n58.3\n41.3\n35.6\n56.2\n38.3\n66.2\n87.2\n72.3\n\nInfoMin Aug. \n/\n/\n/\n36.7\n57.7\n39.4\n/\n/\n/\n\nSwAV\n38.5\n60.5\n41.4\n36.3\n57.7\n38.9\n65.6\n86.9\n71.6\n\nSwAV+UOTA\n39.0\n61.0\n42.0\n36.7\n58.4\n39.4\n66.3\n87.4\n72.3\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Implementation details.\nIn this section, we compare the result of various SSL approaches pretrained on the ResNet-50 .
