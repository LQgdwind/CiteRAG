Barenboim et al. showed that, if we also consider the dependency in ΔΔ\\Delta, MIS can be solved in O​(log2⁡Δ)+2O​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑂superscript2Δsuperscript2𝑂𝑛O(\\log^{2}\\Delta)+2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log\\log n})} rounds . Ghaffari improved this running time to O​(log⁡Δ)+2O​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑂Δsuperscript2𝑂𝑛O(\\log\\Delta)+2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log\\log n})} . The MIS problem has been studied also in specific classes of graphs    . For example, for computing MIS on trees with randomized algorithms, Lenzen and Wattenhofer showed an O​(log⁡n​log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(\\sqrt{\\log n}\\log\\log n)-round algorithm  . This was later improved by Barenboim et al. to O​(log⁡n​log⁡log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(\\sqrt{\\log n\\log\\log n}) , and then further improved to O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{\\log n}) by Ghaffari . Barenboim et al. also showed that MIS on trees can be solved in O​(log⁡Δ​log⁡log⁡Δ+log⁡log⁡n/log⁡log⁡log⁡n)𝑂ΔΔ𝑛𝑛O(\\log\\Delta\\log\\log\\Delta+\\log\\log n/\\log\\log\\log n) rounds . Ghaffari later improved this bound to O​(log⁡Δ+log⁡log⁡n/log⁡log⁡log⁡n)𝑂Δ𝑛𝑛O(\\log\\Delta+\\log\\log n/\\log\\log\\log n) rounds . While all the above algorithms are randomized, Panconesi and Srinivasan provided a deterministic algorithm for solving MIS in 2O​(log⁡n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n})} rounds . Later, Barenboim, Elkin and Kuhn showed an O​(Δ+log∗⁡n)𝑂Δsuperscript𝑛O(\\Delta+\\log^{*}n)-round algorithm . Very recently, Rozhoň and Ghaffari proved that MIS can be solved deterministically in poly⁡(log⁡n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(\\log n) rounds . Meanwhile, the exponent of the polylog has been improved by Ghaffari et al. . The MIS problem has been studied also in the CONGEST101010The CONGEST model is the same as the LOCAL model with the difference that in CONGEST the size of the messages is bounded by O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) bits. We refer the reader to Section 2.1 for more details on these models. model (e.g., see [ref]23 ).\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: model with the difference that in CONGEST the size of the messages is bounded by O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) bits.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
