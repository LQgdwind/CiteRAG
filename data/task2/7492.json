      "content": "Paper Title: The Quantum Abstract Machine (Extended Version)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum Process Algebra.\nThe QAM’s design was inspired by several existing quantum process calculi:\nqCCS   ,\nCommunicating Quantum Processes (CQP) ,\nquantum model checker (MQC) 0 ,\nQPAlg , and eQPAlg .\nThese process calculi enhance existing message-passing models, such as CSP  and ΠΠ\\Pi-calculus , to define HCQN protocols.\nThey do not intend to provide abstract semantics and a new communication model for specifically describing HCQNs.\nFirst, they did not define the unique properties of quantum resources.\nFor example, qCCS allows the message passing of variables referring to quantum resources and permits their remote controls; thus, HCQN protocols that do not meet the physical realities can be defined in qCCS. Second, their message-passing views did not capture the lifetime properties of quantum channels, as we describe in \\Creffsec:design-resource.\nThird, all of the previous quantum process calculi are not based on abstract semantics, which is the mathematical characterization of program behaviors.\nThey mainly admit concrete operational semantics instead of abstract ones by integrating quantum circuits and states in the syntax of some process algebra, e.g., CQP and qCCS extend CSP  and ΠΠ\\Pi-calculus  with operations describing quantum circuits and semantic states that do not appear in their language operation syntax.\nThe key to process calculi is to provide insight into HCQN communications.\nAlthough quantum circuit semantics provides a thorough story of HCQN protocols, many subtleties in these protocols might be glossed over, e.g., the projective nondeterminism.\nIt would be unfortunate for protocol designers to examine the projective nondeterminism behavior through a heavy study of quantum circuit states,\nespecially considering the fact that projective nondeterminism is essential in HCQN communications, and a system should show the behavior directly in front of users. Traditional Process Algebra.\nCommunicating Sequential Processes (CSP)  and ΠΠ\\Pi-calculus  are process calculi suitable for defining concurrent systems based on the message-passing model.\nSeveral bisimulation and trace-refinement protocol verification methodologies exist for CSP and the ΠΠ\\Pi-calculus   .\nAs noted earlier, the Chemical Abstract Machine  and Linda  are the inspiration of the QAM.\nMembrane computing , Modulo structural operational semantics , and the K framework \nare three general language definition frameworks for defining language semantics formally. Quantum Network Protocols.\nQuantum teleportation  2 serves as the basis for quantum communication between two parties. Julia-Diaz et al.  provides a two-qubit quantum teleportation protocol. Superdense coding  encodes a classical message into a quantum channel.\nQuantum routing investigates long-distance quantum message transmission, with QES being one of the promising protocols for the task [ref]38 7 .\nQPass and QCast are protocols based on the quantum-swap algorithm 5 to maximize the transmission chances, through static and semi-dynamic analyses.\nResearchers developed their circuit implementations 3  and new protocols for enhancing the reliability .\nChakraborty et al.  provided an alternative routing protocol to permit distributed routing.\nLi et al.  and Caleffi  provide systems to improve transmission chances and message delivery rates.\nThe refinement of HCQN network protocols strongly motivates the QAM’s development.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: coding  encodes a classical message into a quantum channel.\nQuantum routing investigates long-distance quantum message transmission, with QES being one of the promising protocols for the task [ref]38 7 .\nQPass and QCast are protocols based on the quantum-swap algorithm 5 to maximize the transmission chances, through static and semi-dynamic analyses.\nResearchers developed their circuit\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
