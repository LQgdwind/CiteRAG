      "content": "Paper Title: Maximum Clique in Disk-Like Intersection Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn an intersection graph, the vertices are represented by sets and there is an edge between two sets whenever they intersect.\nOf course if the sets are not restricted, every graph is an intersection graph.\nInteresting proper classes of intersection graphs are obtained by forcing the sets to be some specific geometric objects.\nThis comprises unit interval, interval, multiple-interval, chordal, unit disk, disk, axis-parallel rectangle, segment, and string graphs, to name a few.\nFor the most part, they transparently consist of all the intersection graphs of the corresponding objects.\nNote that strings are (polygonal) curves in the plane, and that chordal graphs are the intersection graphs of subtrees in a tree.\nIntersection graphs have given rise to books (see for instance , where applications to biology, psychology, and statistics, are detailed) chapters in monographs (as in ), surveys  , and theses .\nIn this paper we consider objects that are convex sets in the plane. One especially interesting problem on geometric intersection graphs is Maximum Clique.\nThe first reason is that Maximum Clique is neither a packing\nnor a covering problem, for which our theoretical understanding is rather comprehensive.\nPacking problems (such as Maximum Independent Set) and covering problems\n(such as Dominating Set) are often NP-hard in intersection graphs since these\nproblems are already hard on planar graphs.\nNote for instance that disk intersection graphs  and segment\nintersection graphs  both contain all the planar graphs.\nIt turns out that Maximum Independent Set (MIS)\nand Dominating Set remain intractable in unit disk,\nunit square, or segment intersection graphs :\nNot only they are NP-hard but, being W-hard, they are\nunlikely to admit a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT),\nthat is, f​(k)​nO​(1)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑂1f(k)n^{O(1)}-time algorithms, with n𝑛n being the\ninput size, k𝑘k the size of the solution, and f𝑓f any computable function.\nThis intractability is sharply complemented by PTASes for many problems 9     ,\nwhereas efficient PTASes (EPTASes) are ruled out by the W-hardness of Marx .\nThe existence or unlikelihood of subexponential algorithms\nfor various problems on segment and string graphs was conducted in 1. On the contrary, many questions are still open when it comes\nto the computational complexity of Maximum Clique in intersection graphs.\nClark et al.  show a polynomial-time algorithm for unit disks.\nA randomized EPTAS, deterministic PTAS, and\nsubexponential-time algorithm were recently obtained for general disk graphs [ref]9 .\nHowever neither a polytime algorithm nor\nNP-hardness is currently known for Maximum Clique on disk graphs.\nMaking progress on this open question is\nthe main motivation of the paper.\nMaximum Clique was shown NP-hard in segment intersection\ngraphs by Cabello et al. 6.\nThe proof actually carries over to intersection\ngraphs of unit segments or rays.\nThe existence of an FPT algorithm or of a\nsubexponential-time algorithm for Maximum Clique in segment graphs are both open.\nMaximum Clique can be solved in polynomial-time in axis-parallel\nrectangle intersection graphs, since their number of\nmaximal cliques is at most quadratic\n(every maximal clique corresponds to a distinct cell in any representation).\nThis result was generalized to d𝑑d-dimensional polytopes\nwhose facets are all parallel to k𝑘k fixed (d−1)𝑑1(d-1)-dimensional hyperplanes,\nwhere Maximum Clique can be solved in time nO​(d​kd+1)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑑superscript𝑘𝑑1n^{O(dk^{d+1})} 4.\nNote that if the rectangles may have arbitrary slopes, then Maximum Clique is NP-hard since the class then contains segment graphs. The second reason, to study Maximum Clique, is that it translates into a very natural question: what is the maximum subset of pairwise intersecting objects?\nFor unit disks, this is equivalent to looking for the maximum subset of centers with (geometric) diameter 2.\nThis is a useful primitive in the context of clustering a given set of points.\nA related question with a long history is the number of points necessary and sufficient to pierce a collection of pairwise intersecting disks.\nDanzer  and Stacho  independently showed that four points are sufficient and sometimes necessary.\nRecently Har-Peled et al.  gave a linear-time algorithm to find five points piercing a pairwise intersecting collection of disks.\nA bit later, Carmi et al. 7 obtained a linear-time algorithm for only four points. Up to this point, we remained vague on how the input intersection graph was given.\nFor, say, disk graphs, do we receive the mere abstract graph or a list of the disks specified by their centers and radii?\nComputing the graph from the geometric representation can be done efficiently, but not the other way around.\nIndeed recognizing disk graphs is NP-hard 3 and even ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete , where ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R} is a class between NP and PSPACE of all the problems polytime reducible to solving polynomial inequalities over the reals.\nRecognizing string graphs is NP-hard , and rather unexpectedly in NP , while recognizing segment graphs is ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete .\nIn this context, an algorithm is said robust if it does not require the geometric representation.\nA polytime robust algorithm usually decides the problem for a proper superclass of the intersection graph class at hand, or correctly reports that the input does not belong to the class.\nHence the robust algorithm does not imply an efficient recognition of the class.\nThe polynomial-time algorithm of Clark et al.  for Maximum Clique in unit disk intersection graphs requires the geometric representation.\nRaghavan and Spinrad later extended it to an efficient robust algorithm .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: graphs.\nClark et al.  show a polynomial-time algorithm for unit disks.\nA randomized EPTAS, deterministic PTAS, and\nsubexponential-time algorithm were recently obtained for general disk graphs [ref]9 .\nHowever neither a polytime algorithm nor\nNP-hardness is currently known for Maximum Clique on disk graphs.\nMaking progress on this open question is\nthe main motivation of the paper.\nMaximum\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
