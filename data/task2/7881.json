      "content": "Paper Title: SquirrelFS: using the Rust compiler to check file-system crash consistency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the most important properties for file systems is to preserve their integrity and user data in the face of a crash or a power loss       .\nUnfortunately, building crash-consistent file systems is challenging; checking or ensuring crash consistency is even more so  . There are two main approaches to building file systems today, as summarized in Table 1.\nFirst, we build file systems using low-level languages like C, and we use runtime testing to gain some confidence in the correctness of the systems      .\nNote that this approach is necessarily incomplete; testing can only reveal bugs, not prove their absence.\nHowever, this approach allows rapid development, and entire testing ecosystems have sprung up around this basic approach, like the widely-used xfstests  and Linux Test Project . A different approach to building file systems is to verify them: we write a high-level specification of correct behavior (including crash behavior) and then prove that the implementation matches the specification\n  3   .\nThis approach can prove that the implementation does not have certain classes of bugs;\nhowever, it comes at a high cost.\nFor each line of code in the implementation, we may need to write 7–13 lines of proof.\nWriting and maintaining proofs is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, constraining rapid development. In this work, we seek to find a middle ground between these two approaches.\nWe would like to verify some aspects of file systems, but without the burden of having to write and maintain proofs.\nIn particular, we are interested in crash consistency, a correctness property that is especially difficult to test for.\nIn order to be crash consistent, systems must ensure that updates become persistent on storage media in the correct order; however, hardware or caching layers may reorder updates to improve performance in unanticipated ways.\nExposing crash-consistency bugs thus requires one to find and reproduce these low-level orderings, which requires specialized testing software      .\nOur goal is to develop lightweight approaches to statically check for crash-consistency bugs without the overhead of full verification. We exploit two recent developments to achieve this goal (§2).\nFirst, the Rust programming language has a strong type system that supports powerful compile-time safety checks.\nOur work takes inspiration from Corundum , a Rust crate (library) that uses Rust’s type system to check low-level PM safety properties.\nIn this work, we observe that Rust’s type system can also statically enforce that certain operations are carried out in a given order  .\nSince the root of crash consistency is ordering updates to storage, if we can encode those ordering-based invariants in the type system,\nthe compiler can ensure the invariants hold at compile time. However, to do so, crash consistency must be derived purely from ordering-based invariants;\nsome mechanisms such as journaling use writes to a log to obtain atomicity, which is harder to encode in the type system.\nSoft updates achieves crash consistency purely via ordering , but the traditional soft updates scheme is complex and hard to implement  . We observe that the low latency of persistent memory  6 allows file-system operations to be synchronous; all updates to storage media are durable by the time each operation returns 7  [ref]34  .\nWe take advantage of persistent memory’s synchronous updates and byte addressability\nto develop a new mechanism for crash consistency we term Synchronous Soft Updates. Synchronous Soft Updates builds on the classical soft updates mechanism , but avoids most of the complexity that prevented the widespread adoption of soft updates .\nTwo of the most complicated aspects of soft updates, dependency structures and cyclic dependency management, arise due to the need to track ordering requirements between block-sized updates across asynchronous operations.\nSynchronous Soft Updates eliminates these challenges entirely by using fast, fine-grained storage to back synchronous operations. We ensure that the ordering invariants of Synchronous Soft Updates hold by using the Rust compiler.\nWe take advantage of Rust’s support for the typestate pattern, an API design pattern where an object’s type reflects the operations that have been performed on it 4.\nThe legal order of operations is encoded in function signatures and enforced by Rust’s typechecker.\nFor example, an uninitialized inode has a different type than an initialized one; attempting to use one where the other is expected will result in a compile-time error.\nFigure 1 illustrates the approach. We implement Synchronous Soft Updates in a new file system for PM called SquirrelFS and use the typestate pattern in Rust to check that update orderings are implemented correctly. SquirrelFS provides crash-atomic metadata system calls, including rename; on the original soft updates, a crash during rename could result in both the source and destination existing.\nSquirrelFS compiles and typechecks in seconds, whereas running verification on existing storage systems takes minutes or hours. Building SquirrelFS required no modifications to the Rust language. We evaluate SquirrelFS by comparing to a number of file systems meant for persistent memory, such as NOVA 7 and WineFS [ref]34 (§5).\nWe use Intel’s Optane DC Persistent Memory Module for our comparison, and find that SquirrelFS offers comparable or better performance to other PM file systems across a broad range of workloads.\n\nThe current SquirrelFS prototype prioritizes simplicity of update ordering rules over performance in some areas, leading to relatively high mount times and memory utilization; however, these are not fundamental limitations of the design.\n\nWe also model the design of SquirrelFS using the Alloy model-checking language  to gain confidence in the correctness of its Synchronous Soft Updates mechanism. We note that SquirrelFS is not fully verified, and thus does not obtain the strong correctness guarantees of verified storage systems like FSCQ .\nCrash-consistency bugs may still occur in SquirrelFS if their root causes are unrelated to ordering, if the ordering rules enforced by the compiler are incorrect, or if trusted code in SquirrelFS’s implementation or the Rust compiler are buggy.\nFor example, SquirrelFS’s ordering rules guarantee that inodes are always initialized before they are linked into the file system tree, but they do not guarantee that the contents of the inode are correct.\nSquirrelFS’s static checks are also limited by the capabilities of the Rust compiler.\nFor instance, the Rust compiler cannot check properties about variable-sized sets of data structures, as checking such properties is undecidable in general. SquirrelFS offers a useful new point in the spectrum of approaches to building robust storage systems;\nit provides weaker guarantees than verified systems, but comes at a lower cost.\nAs such, we hope that it proves useful for developers of storage systems that require strong guarantees, good performance, and rapid development. In summary, this work makes the following contributions: Statically-checked crash consistency, an approach where high-level properties are encoded into the type system and checked at compile time (§3) The Synchronous Soft Updates crash-consistency mechanism for persistent-memory file systems (§3.1) The SquirrelFS prototype, along with a discussion of lessons learned during its development (§4).
