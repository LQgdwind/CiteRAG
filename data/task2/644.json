      "content": "Paper Title: ezLDA: Efficient and Scalable LDA on GPUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs one of the most popular topics in machine learning, LDA  has received enormous attentions. This section restricts our discussions to the projects that are closely related to ezLDA, that is, efficiency, scalability and GPU-based LDA. There mainly exist four directions to make LDA more efficient than the original attempt , that is, sparsity-aware, Metropolis-Hasting (MH) and Expectation Maximization (EM) approaches, as well as the hybrid of them. i). Sparsity-aware method utilizes the sparsity of word-topic and document-topic matrix to make the sampling time sublinear to number of topics K (detailed in Section II-B). SparseLDA  pioneers this attempt. ii). MH  method generates a complex distribution by constructing a Markov Chain (MC) with a simple easy-to-sample distribution and update the topic with some acceptance rates at each step.\nSince MH requires frequent random memory address to word-topic and doc-topic matrices, thus is not friendly for sparse matrix.\niii). LDA*  uses sparsity-aware and MH samplers to deal with short and long documents separately.\nThe follow-up variations are  [ref]26  [ref]28 [ref]29  .\niiii). EM  divides the LDA training into E-step and M-step while the former is responsible for sampling and the latter for updating.\nComparing with standard LDA sampling, EM can enjoy better parallelism because frequent random memory access to update word-topic and document-topic matrices during sampling can be avoided. Large-scale training is another important field for LDA considering real-world corpus often contains billions of tokens.\nLightLDA [ref]26 leads this effort. Particularly, it trains LDA model with 1 million topics and 1 million words on eight machines via data parallelism (corpus partition) and model parallelism (word-topic matrix splitting).\nWhile LightLDA allows both D and W to be sparse, it relies upon hash table for fast sampling, which is a hardership for GPU because collision handling in hash table remains elusive on GPUs .\nThis concern is evident by SaberLDA [ref]28 which only stores D in sparse format for fast sampling.\ncuLDA [ref]29 further attempts this challenge on multi-GPU but ends up with identical strategy as SaberLDA except scaling the sampling towards multiple GPUs.\nAs we will evaluate in Table I, only allowing D to be sparse will greatly hinder the scalability of LDA. Last, for GPU-based LDA, which is the interest of this work, we find very few efforts. Yan et al  implements collapsed Gibbs sampling  and collapsed variational Bayesian  on GPU. BIDMach  toolkit implements Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM)  method on GPU without much GPU specific optimizations thus ends up with moderate performance. SaberLDA [ref]28 proposes the PDOW (partition by document, order by word) strategy to reduce random memory access. Warp-based sampling is also adopted, which means using a warp to process a token and a block to process a word, to avoid thread-divergence and uncoalesced memory access. Further, cuLDA [ref]29 scales LDA to multiple GPUs based on collapsed Gibbs sampling with similar optimizations as SaberLDA. In summary, the curse of GPU-based LDA is the limited number of topics because they have to store W in dense format - larger topics will exhaust the limited memory space of GPUs.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: and doc-topic matrices, thus is not friendly for sparse matrix.\niii). LDA*  uses sparsity-aware and MH samplers to deal with short and long documents separately.\nThe follow-up variations are  [ref]26  [ref]28 [ref]29  .\niiii). EM  divides the LDA training into E-step and M-step while the former is responsible for sampling and the latter for updating.\nComparing with standard LDA sampling,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
