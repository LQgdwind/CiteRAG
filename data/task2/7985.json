      "content": "Paper Title: Static Analysis of Logic Programs via Boolean Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTheorem 3 and the subsequent results immediately suggest that we can compute stable models of an LP P𝑃P by using fixed points of its encoded BN f𝑓f.\nRecall that a fixed point of f𝑓f may be not a stable model of P𝑃P, but checking whether a fixed point is a stable model or not can be done in linear time .\nNotably, there is a rich history for computing fixed points in BNs: SAT-based methods , ILP-based methods , and structure-based methods .\nWe can first check if dg+​(P)superscriptdg𝑃\\text{dg}^{+}({P}) does not contain any cycle.\nIf so, sm​(P)=fix​(f)sm𝑃fix𝑓\\text{sm}({P})=\\text{fix}({f}) and we can apply directly some efficient methods for fixed point computation.\nOtherwise, we need to check if each fixed point is a stable model or not.\nThis approach would be efficient if |fix​(f)∖sm​(P)|fix𝑓sm𝑃|\\text{fix}({f})\\setminus\\text{sm}({P})| is not too large.\nNote however that we can estimate |fix​(f)|fix𝑓|\\text{fix}({f})| in prior by using some known upper bounds of the number of fixed points of a BN (e.g., 2|U+|superscript2superscript𝑈2^{|U^{+}|} where U+superscript𝑈U^{+} is a PFVS of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}), which can be efficiently computed by using some approximation methods [ref]33 because U+superscript𝑈U^{+} is unnecessarily minimum).\nIf the chosen bound is too large, we can apply some transformations (e.g., [ref]21) to P𝑃P to get a new LP P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} such that sm​(P)=sm​(P′)=fix​(f′)sm𝑃smsuperscript𝑃′fixsuperscript𝑓′\\text{sm}({P})=\\text{sm}({P^{\\prime}})=\\text{fix}({f^{\\prime}}) where f′superscript𝑓′f^{\\prime} is the encoded BN of P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime}.\nSuch a transformation might introduce more atoms, but it seems that there are less changes in cycle structures (e.g., the size of the minimum PFVS seems to still retain [ref]21).\nIn this case, structure-based methods for fixed point computation, especially the PFVS-based method  whose complexity is O​(2|U+|×n2+k)𝑂superscript2superscript𝑈superscript𝑛2𝑘O(2^{|U^{+}|}\\times n^{2+k}) where the Boolean functions of the BN can be evaluated in time O​(nk)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑘O(n^{k}), would be very helpful in complementary to standard ASP solvers such as Cmodels, Smodels, and clasp.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: points of a BN (e.g., 2|U+|superscript2superscript𝑈2^{|U^{+}|} where U+superscript𝑈U^{+} is a PFVS of dg​(P)dg𝑃\\text{dg}({P}), which can be efficiently computed by using some approximation methods [ref]33 because U+superscript𝑈U^{+} is unnecessarily minimum).\nIf the chosen bound is too large, we can apply some transformations (e.g., [ref]21) to P𝑃P to get a new LP P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime}\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
