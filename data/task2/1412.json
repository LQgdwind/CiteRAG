Santo et al.  first solved the photometric stereo task via deep learning and proposed a pixelwise method that utilizes a fully connected network (DPSN) to establish a mapping from given observations to the surface normal. The assumption that light directions must be predefined and remain the same during the training and test phases restricts the application of DPSN. Ikehata et al. [ref]11 introduced a CNN-based method, CNN-PS, which relaxes the limitation of lighting information and image structure through a novel network input (2-D observation map). A synthetic photometric stereo dataset, called Cycles PS, was presented in this paper, considering the global illumination effects. CNN-PS performs significantly better on the benchmark dataset than most traditional photometric stereo approaches. Chen et al.  first proposed a fully convolutional network called PS-FCN that also takes unstructured images and lighting information as input. PS-FCN takes the full-size images into account and effectively utilizes the spatial information among local pixels, and this process is neglected in the previously proposed pixelwise method. Thus, the frame-based PS-FCN method performs better with a sparse input setting than the pixelwise methods. Then, Chen et al.  extended PS-FCN and proposed an uncalibrated PS method (SDPS-Net) for non-Lambertian surfaces. SDPS-Net contains two processing steps: a classification network (LCNet) is used to approximate the light information, and a subsequent prediction network (NENet) is utilized to estimate the surface normal. Given sufficient input images, pixelwise methods (e.g., CNN-PS [ref]11 and DPSN ) are generally more accurate for surface normal estimations than framewise methods (e.g., PS-FCN  and SDPS-Net ). However, a sparse input setting will adversely decrease the performance of pixelwise methods due given that these methods ignore spatial information. To handle sparse input, Li et al. [ref]32 proposed a deep learning pixelwise approach, which applies a connection table that can select relatively effective light directions, to minify the input of pixelwise photometric stereo methods. Zheng et al.  proposed SPLINE-Net, which generates dense lighting observations by lighting interpolation, to improve the performance of sparse photometric stereo. Wang et al.  proposed a photometric stereo network that utilizes collocated light images as supplementary information to improve the performance.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: observations to the surface normal.
