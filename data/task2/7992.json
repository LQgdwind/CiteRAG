      "content": "Paper Title: Structure and Independence in Hyperbolic Uniform Disk Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur first structural result is a balanced clique-based separator theorem presented in Section 3. We note that all of our results in hyperbolic uniform disk graphs assume that the graph is given via some geometric representation, i.e., with the Euclidean coordinates of its disk centers in some Euclidean model of the hyperbolic plane. Let G𝐺G be a hyperbolic uniform disk graph with radius r𝑟r. Then\nG𝐺G has a separator S𝑆S that can be covered with\n𝒪​(log⁡n⋅(1+1r))𝒪⋅𝑛11𝑟\\mathcal{O}\\big{(}\\log n\\cdot\\big{(}1+\\frac{1}{r}\\big{)}\\big{)} cliques, such that all connected components of G−S𝐺𝑆G-S have at most 23​n23𝑛\\frac{2}{3}n vertices. The separator can be computed in 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n) time. Our separator is in fact a carefully chosen line; the proof bounds the number of cliques intersecting the separator via decomposing some neighborhood of the chosen line into a small collection of small diameter regions. Notice that the theorem guarantees a separator with 𝒪​(log⁡n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log n) cliques in the hyperbolic setting, and deteriorates linearly as a function of 1/r1𝑟1/r. In the almost-Euclidean setting of r=1/n𝑟1𝑛r=1/\\sqrt{n} the separator has 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log n) cliques, which almost matches the 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}) clique separator for unit disk graphs [ref]3. This is also a direct generalization of the 222-dimensional separator of Kisfaludi-Bak 8 from r∈Θ​(1)𝑟Θ1r\\in\\Theta(1) to general radii. Moreover, in Section 7 we observe that the techniques of [ref]3 8 can be utilized as the above separator implies 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}-flattened treewidth 𝒪​(log2⁡n​(1+1r))𝒪superscript2𝑛11𝑟\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log^{2}n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\right) for any natural clique partition 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. []\n\n\nLet G𝐺G be a hyperbolic uniform disk graph with radius r𝑟r.\nThen a maximum independent set of G𝐺G can be\ncomputed in n𝒪​((1+1/r)​log2⁡n)superscript𝑛𝒪11𝑟superscript2𝑛n^{\\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\\log^{2}n)} time. Thus, a quasi-polynomial n𝒪​(log2⁡n)superscript𝑛𝒪superscript2𝑛n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{2}n)} algorithm is possible for all r∈Ω​(1)𝑟Ω1r\\in\\Omega(1). If r≤1𝑟1r\\leq 1 — or even r∈𝒪​(1)𝑟𝒪1r\\in\\mathcal{O}(1) — then for any G∈HUDG​(r)𝐺HUDG𝑟G\\in\\mathrm{HUDG}(r) the neighborhood of a disk can be covered by a constant number of cliques of G𝐺G (see also 8 for the case r∈Θ​(1)𝑟Θ1r\\in\\Theta(1)). Together with our separator in Theorem 1, the machinery of [ref]3 8 now yields the following result. []\n\n\nLet G𝐺G be a hyperbolic uniform disk graph with radius r∈𝒪​(1)𝑟𝒪1r\\in\\mathcal{O}(1). Then\nDominating Set, Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, Connected\nDominating Set, Connected Vertex Cover, Connected Feedback Vertex Set\ncan be solved in n𝒪​((1/r)​log⁡n)superscript𝑛𝒪1𝑟𝑛n^{\\mathcal{O}((1/r)\\log n)} time, and q𝑞q-Coloring\nfor q∈𝒪​(1)𝑞𝒪1q\\in\\mathcal{O}(1), Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle\ncan be solved in n𝒪​(1/r)superscript𝑛𝒪1𝑟n^{\\mathcal{O}(1/r)} time. While the above separator is already powerful and can be used as a basis for quasi-polynomial divide-and-conquer algorithms, the separator size stops improving when increasing the radius r𝑟r beyond a constant. Nonetheless, a more powerful result is possible for super-constant radius r𝑟r, which requires a different type of separator. Rather than separating hyperbolic uniform disk graphs, our second structural result is about separating the Delaunay complex, which is the dual of the Voronoi diagram, of a set of sites with pairwise distance at least 2​r2𝑟2r. Note that in some graph G∈HUDG​(r)𝐺HUDG𝑟G\\in\\mathrm{HUDG}(r), the disk centers corresponding to an independent set will have pairwise distance more than 2​r2𝑟2r, which is what motivated us to study such point sets. A plane graph (a planar graph with a fixed planar embedding) is called outerplanar or 111-outerplanar if all of its vertices are on the unbounded face. A plane graph is called k𝑘k-outerplanar if deleting the vertices of the unbounded face (and all edges incident to them) yields a (k−1)𝑘1(k-1)-outerplanar graph.\nOur result concerns the outerplanarity of a Delaunay complex. We prove the following tight result on the outerplanarity of the Delaunay complex 𝒟​(S)𝒟𝑆\\mathcal{D}(S) of such a site set S𝑆S. We believe that this result presented in Section 4 may be of independent interest. Let S𝑆S be a set of n𝑛n sites (points) in ℍ2superscriptℍ2\\mathbb{H}^{2} with pairwise distance at least 2​r2𝑟2r. Then the Delaunay complex 𝒟​(S)𝒟𝑆\\mathcal{D}(S) is 1+𝒪​(log⁡nr)1𝒪𝑛𝑟1+\\mathcal{O}\\big{(}\\frac{\\log n}{r}\\big{)}-outerplanar. In plane graphs, the treewidth, the outerplanarity, and the dual graph’s treewidth and outerplanarity are all within a constant multiplicative factor of each other  .\nConsequently, we get the bound 𝒪​(1+log⁡nr)𝒪1𝑛𝑟\\mathcal{O}\\big{(}1+\\frac{\\log n}{r}\\big{)} for the treewidth and outerplanarity of the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay complex of such point sets. Note that this implies constant outerplanarity for the firmly hyperbolic setting of r∈Ω​(log⁡n)𝑟Ω𝑛r\\in\\Omega(\\log n). In particular, the theorem shows that for some constant c𝑐c and r>c​log⁡n𝑟𝑐𝑛r>c\\log n the Delaunay complex is outerplanar. We recover the outerplanarity bound of 8 for r=Θ​(1)𝑟Θ1r=\\Theta(1), and get a sublinear outerplanarity bound (𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)) even in the almost-Euclidean setting of r=1/n𝑟1𝑛r=1/\\sqrt{n}. This is surprising in light of the fact that Delaunay-triangulations can have outerplanarity Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) in the Euclidean setting, as demonstrated by the set of sites in Figure 2. Notice however that the construction requires a point set where the ratio of the maximum and minimum distance among the points is Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n); mimicking this construction in ℍ2superscriptℍ2\\mathbb{H}^{2} with a point set of minimum distance r=1/n𝑟1𝑛r=1/\\sqrt{n} is not possible as at distance n⋅r=n⋅𝑛𝑟𝑛n\\cdot r=\\sqrt{n} the hyperbolic distortion is very significant compared to the Euclidean setting. Using the outerplanarity bound, we are able to give the following algorithm for Independent Set in Section 5. Let G𝐺G be a hyperbolic uniform disk graph with radius r𝑟r and let k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0.\nThen we can decide if there is an independent set of size k𝑘k in G𝐺G in\nmin⁡{n𝒪​(1+1r​log⁡k),2𝒪​(n),n𝒪​(k)}superscript𝑛𝒪11𝑟𝑘superscript2𝒪𝑛superscript𝑛𝒪𝑘\\min\\big{\\{}n^{\\mathcal{O}\\big{(}1+\\frac{1}{r}\\log k\\big{)}},2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})},n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k})}\\big{\\}}\ntime. Our algorithm yields the first component of the running time\n(n𝒪​(1+1r​log⁡k)superscript𝑛𝒪11𝑟𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}\\big{(}1+\\frac{1}{r}\\log k\\big{)}}), but for very small r𝑟r we can\nswitch to the general disk graph algorithms with running times\n2𝒪​(n)superscript2𝒪𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})} by De Berg et al. [ref]3 and\nn𝒪​(k)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k})} by Marx and Pilipczuk .\nOur algorithm is best possible under ETH\nfor r=Θ​(1)𝑟Θ1r=\\Theta(1) as 8 showed a lower bound of\nnΩ​(log⁡n)superscript𝑛Ω𝑛n^{\\Omega(\\log n)} (for large k𝑘k). Notice moreover that the almost-Euclidean case of r=1/n𝑟1𝑛r=1/\\sqrt{n}\ngives a running time of n𝒪​(n​log⁡k)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑛𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log k)}, which almost\nrecovers the Euclidean running time of 2𝒪​(n)superscript2𝒪𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})}. Recall\nthat the Euclidean running time is also ETH-tight for Euclidean unit\ndisks [ref]3. While this Euclidean lower bound cannot be\ndirectly applied to HUDG​(1/n)HUDG1𝑛\\mathrm{HUDG}(1/\\sqrt{n}), it can be adapted to the\nthis setting, so the running time lower bound 2Ω​(n)superscript2Ω𝑛2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}\nholds also in the hyperbolic\nplane (assuming ETH). See 7 for a similar adaptation of a\nEuclidean lower bound to the setting of r=1/n𝑟1𝑛r=1/\\sqrt{n}. Finally, but most surprisingly, we get a polynomial running time for Independent Set in the firmly hyperbolic setting of r∈Ω​(log⁡n)𝑟Ω𝑛r\\in\\Omega(\\log n); in fact, our algorithm is polynomial already for r∈Ω​(log⁡k)𝑟Ω𝑘r\\in\\Omega(\\log k). In particular, this provides a polynomial exact algorithm for hyperbolic random graphs. It thereby directly generalizes the algorithm of  which gives a polynomial running time in hyperbolic random graphs with high probability: our algorithm has no assumptions on the input graph distribution and provides a polynomial worst-case running time. The underlying idea of our exact algorithm can be regarded as a dynamic programming algorithm along the (unknown) tree decomposition of the Voronoi diagram of the solution disks, inspired by Marx and Pilipczuk . More precisely, both  and the present paper use so-called sphere cut decompositions, a variant of branch decompositions for plane graphs  to guide the algorithm. We introduce well-spaced and valid sphere cut decompositions, and prove that they are in one-to-one correspondence with independent sets of G𝐺G. Finally, we consider approximation algorithms for Maximum Independent Set when the graph in question has low ply, that is, each point of ℍ2superscriptℍ2\\mathbb{H}^{2} is covered by at most ℓℓ\\ell disks. In Section 6 we show the following. Let ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1) and let G𝐺G be a hyperbolic uniform disk graph of radius r𝑟r and ply ℓℓ\\ell.\nThen a (1−ε)1𝜀(1-\\varepsilon)-approximate maximum independent set of G𝐺G can be found in\n𝒪​(n4​log⁡n)+n⋅(ℓε)𝒪​(1+1r​log⁡ℓε)𝒪superscript𝑛4𝑛⋅𝑛superscriptℓ𝜀𝒪11𝑟ℓ𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{4}\\log n\\right)+n\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{\\mathcal{O}(1+\\frac{1}{r}\\log\\frac{\\ell}{\\varepsilon})} time. An important component of the algorithm’s correctness proof is bounding the so-called degeneracy of hyperbolic uniform disk graphs in terms of their clique size and in terms of their ply. This generalizes the Euclidean results of .\nWhen compared to the n𝒪​(1/ε)superscript𝑛𝒪1𝜀n^{\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)} algorithm for disk graphs by Chan  or the 2𝒪​(1/ε)​nsuperscript2𝒪1𝜀𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)}n algorithm in planar graphs by Baker , both of which are conditionally optimal , our algorithm has a surprising quasi-polynomial dependence on 1/ε1𝜀1/\\varepsilon rather than exponential. The dependence on r𝑟r exhibits the classic Euclidean-to-hyperbolic scaling seen in our earlier structural results. For ε=1/n𝜀1𝑛\\varepsilon=1/n, we are guaranteed to get the optimal solution, and setting ℓ=nℓ𝑛\\ell=n covers the general case. The resulting running time for 1/ε=ℓ=n1𝜀ℓ𝑛1/\\varepsilon=\\ell=n is n𝒪​(1+1r​log⁡n)superscript𝑛𝒪11𝑟𝑛n^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{r}\\log n\\right)}, which matches our exact algorithm. Consequently, our approximation scheme is a generalization of our exact algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: setting of r=1/n𝑟1𝑛r=1/\\sqrt{n} the separator has 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log n) cliques, which almost matches the 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}) clique separator for unit disk graphs [ref]3.
