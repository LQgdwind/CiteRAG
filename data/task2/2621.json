      "content": "Paper Title: Information Symmetry Matters: A Modal-Alternating Propagation Network for Few-Shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic information usually plays a crucial role in various tasks, such as image-text matching  , emotion recognition [ref]26  and zero-shot learning [ref]28 . When the samples in visual modality are scarce, the semantic information is a good choice to assist model in training. Many zero-shot learning methods align visual and semantic representation to achieve the classification of novel classes without labeled samples. For example, Frome e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al. [ref]28 presented a deep visual-semantic embedding model to learn the semantic relationships among classes with the semantic data, and map the visual samples into a semantic space to be classified. Ji e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al.  employed a semantic embedding space to transfer knowledge from seen domain to unseen domain with an attribute-guided network to address the cross-modal zero-shot hashing retrieval tasks. Considering the potential bias between seen and unseen classes, Gao e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al. [ref]30 utilized a joint generative model to generate high-quality unseen features, which is further augmented with a self-training strategy. Guan e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al.  learned a robust cross-modal projection by synthesizing the unseen class data and designing a novel projection learning model to best utilize the synthesized data. Based on the success of zero-shot learning, some methods utilizing auxiliary semantic information are proposed to boost the few-shot learning in recent years. Xing e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al.  integrated the semantic embeddings into visual features with an adaptive convex combination to assist the classification. Similarly, SAP-Net  refines the embeddings with the guidance of semantic information. Schwartz e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al.  further improved the few-shot learning with multiple semantics. For the discrepancy between visual and semantic modalities, Tokmakov e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al.  designed a semantic-based soft constraint regularization to learn the compositional representation of each sample. Chen e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al.  synthesized sample features in a semantic space with an encoder-decoder framework to increase the diversity of feature embeddings.\nHuang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al.  employed the attention mechanism to emphasize or suppress the representation with the guidance of semantic information. Zhang e​t​a​l.𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et\\,al.  addressed few-shot classification in both relative and absolute views, which utilizes the semantic information and class labels simultaneously to represent the similarities among different samples and the absolute concept of instances.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Semantic information usually plays a crucial role in various tasks, such as image-text matching  , emotion recognition [ref]26  and zero-shot learning [ref]28 .
