      "content": "Paper Title: FedDW: Distilling Weights through Consistency Optimization in Heterogeneous Federated Learning *Corresponding Author\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter [ref]21 demonstrated that transmitting gradients could also leak local information, FedAvg[ref]4 became the most effective FL method. It is simple to implement and has very competitive performance. However, FedAvg does not perform well with heterogeneous local data. As the degree of heterogeneity increases, the performance of the FedAvg method declines rapidly. To address this issue, FedProto  clients use server aggregated average feature vectors to regularize local training. FedGH  uses these feature vectors as training data to train the classifier part of the model. FedTGP[ref]12, leveraging the idea of contrastive learning ,,,, aligns and enhances the performance of heterogeneous data and models from different clients in FL through shared trainable global prototypes and adaptive boundary contrastive learning. FedKTL achieves effective local transmission of pre-trained knowledge to the client through image vector pairs generated by the server. FedProx and FedDyn are classic FL frameworks that use neural network parameters as globally shared information. The objective function of the local model introduces a proximal term, preventing local updates from straying too far from the initial global model. Moon ensures that the features extracted by the local model are closer to the features obtained by the global model transmitted by the server while simultaneously being further away from the features extracted by the local model from the previous training round. FedHEAL maintains the variance distance between the local model and the global model during local training on the client. PerAda, MH-pFLID, Fedistill, DaFKD, and FedAUX all use soft labels as global shared information. Their core idea is to aggregate the average soft labels generated by all clients and use them for regular local training through different methods. There are other FL methods that do not use any DLE data but can still mitigate the problem of data heterogeneity, such as FedRep, FedALA, FedPer, and FedRAP. These methods often fall under Personalized Federated Learning(pFL). pFL does not produce a single model but rather personalizes a model for each user based on their data distribution. However, deep learning training requires large amounts of data, and pFL trains or fine-tunes most of the network structure using only locally stored data, which is insufficient. Thus, as the name pFL itself suggests, it cannot provide a generalized model on the server side. This limitation restricts its range of applications. Using DLE data to mitigate data heterogeneity introduces additional computational costs. None of the aforementioned methods attempt to alleviate the extra computational burden. With the increasing size of models in todayâ€™s training landscape, especially with the advent of large models,,, the additional computational cost of regularizing data heterogeneity is something that absolutely cannot be ignored. In this regard, FedDW offers a significant advantage.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: After [ref]21 demonstrated that transmitting gradients could also leak local information, FedAvg[ref]4 became the most effective FL method.
