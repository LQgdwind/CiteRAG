      "content": "Paper Title: Spot Check Equivalence: an Interpretable Metric for Information Elicitation Mechanisms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEliciting precise and valuable information from individuals is becoming paramount, especially with the rising demands for data labeling in the realms of AI and machine learning. Recent advancements, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have proven the value of high-quality human-labeled data. For example, Meta is estimated to have invested upward of 25 million dollars in collecting preference data from human labelers to align Llama 2 with human preferences . This raises a pressing question: How can human agents be incentivized to provide high-quality information. E.g., without the proper incentives, human labelers for LLM alignment may not exert effort to distinguish between truthful LLM responses and merely authoritative-sounding responses (i.e. hallucinations), even when truthfulness is important for the task at hand. Research from Amazon reveals that monetary compensation is the principal motivator for Amazon Mechanical Turk workers , and indeed the primary solution is to monetarily reward agents in exchange for effortful and truthful labeling. Two distinct compensation strategies, spot-checking [ref]13 and peer prediction , each rate the quality of user feedback with a score. This score can then be transformed into a payment for an agent. Spot-checking mechanisms reward agents by comparing their reports with the ground truth on a small fraction of gold standard questions. When the ground truth information is expensive or even infeasible to obtain, peer prediction mechanisms are proposed, which reward an agent based on the correlation between her reports and the reports of other agents. To understand and compare the performance of mechanisms developed from these paradigms, there is a need for standard metrics similar to accuracy, recall, and F1 score used in supervised learning. Notice that all these metrics range from 0 to 1 where 1 is good/perfect and 0 is bad. While several studies have proposed methods for comparing these mechanisms   , there remains a conspicuous gap for both a unified understanding of how these metrics relate, and, if possible, a unified interpretable metric. To this end, we introduce the concept of Spot Check Equivalence (SCE), which uses a spot-checking mechanism as a benchmark to quantify the motivational proficiency of an arbitrary incentive mechanism. As introduced in Zhang and Schoenebeck , the motivational proficiency is the minimum cost of budget to induce a desired effort level in a symmetric equilibrium. Then, a SCE of 1 will indicate that a mechanism does as well as a certain spot-checking mechanism does when the spot-checking mechanism has access to the ground truth of every task. A SCE of 0 will indicate that a mechanism does as well as this same spot-checking mechanism when it has no access to the ground truth of any task (essentially, it is paying agents randomly). Note that accessing the ground truth might be costly, e.g., hiring an expert to get the ground truth might be much more expensive than hiring several non-expert crowd workers. Thus, SCE can quantify the considerable cost savings that might be achieved by employing a peer prediction mechanism over a straightforward spot-checking mechanism. By sufficiently harshly punishing the agents for the checked low-quality reports, spot-checking mechanisms can effectively motivate effort, even when only a small fraction of the tasks are checked. However, in most real applications, the payoff should be non-negative which precludes this approach. Gao et al.  [ref]10 study a peer grading setting where agents are modeled as having a binary choice for the effort to exert: low versus high. In their setting, the goal is to minimize the fraction of random questions that must be spot-checked to incentivize agents to exert high effort (make choosing high effort a Nash equilibrium). They find that, in their model, combining spot-checking with peer prediction does not help reduce the spot-checking ratio required to achieve the desired incentive properties, i.e. peer prediction makes things worse. However, their results rest on several assumptions, which we will discuss later in Section 6. Burrell and Schoenebeck  propose a metric called Measurement Integrity to quantify the ex-post fairness of a peer prediction mechanism. Mechanisms with high Measurement Integrity can produce payments that are strongly correlated with the quality of the agents’ reports. Their motivation and definitions look beyond incentives to fairness. They do not study spot-checking mechanisms, but it is clear that the more agents are spot-checked the more accurately their scores will reflect their true quality. For example, with ground truth for all the tasks, an agent’s score could exactly reflect the true quality of her responses. Moreover, they model continuous effort but do not establish a clear link between Measurement Integrity and the ability to incentivize effort. Zhang and Schoenebeck  study incentivizing effort in a crowdsourcing setting where agents can choose their effort from a continuum. Their goal is to maximize the motivational proficiency by rescaling the scores output by the incentive mechanism into practical payments. They suggest a tournament-based payment scheme: first rank the agents based on their scores output by an incentive mechanism, and then pay a predetermined reward for each ranking. Under the tournament setting, they further propose a sufficient statistic of a mechanism’s motivational proficiency, called the Sensitivity. Intuitively, the Sensitivity measures how responsive a score is to changes in an agent’s effort. For example, a spot-checking mechanism that checks a larger fraction of tasks is more sensitive to changes in an agent’s effort (intuitively, it has more chances to detect a change), and thus has a larger motivational proficiency. However, there is a lack of discussions on how to estimate Sensitivity in practice. An apparent contradiction arises. Zhang and Schoenebeck  empirically show that when agents exert a reasonably high effort, peer prediction mechanisms have Sensitivity competitive with spot-checking mechanisms that randomly check 20% of the tasks. However, the aforementioned implication of Gao et al.  [ref]10 would seem to predict that the spot-checking mechanisms are always superior to peer-prediction mechanisms. First, we propose Spot Check Equivalence which uses the equivalent spot-checking ratio as an interpretable way to measure an information elicitation mechanism’s performance under specified information elicitation contexts. We study the Spot Check Equivalence based on Measurement Integrity and Sensitivity, and demonstrate its effectiveness as a metric for motivational proficiency both theoretically and empirically. Second, we unify Measurement Integrity (the metric for ex-post fairness) and Sensitivity (the metric that serves as a proxy for motivational proficiency). In particular, we prove that Spot Check Equivalence based on Measurement Integrity and Sensitivity are sometimes exactly the same. We also show why these results differ so much from Gao et al.  [ref]10, and thus refute, or at least qualify, the titular statement that “Peer-prediction makes things worse.\" Third, we present two approaches to compute Spot Check Equivalence, which are suitable for settings with and without ground truth data, respectively. Our method enables the comparison of the motivational proficiency of different mechanisms across various information elicitation contexts. Furthermore, our simulation results show that both approaches result in similar estimations of SCE, which implies the robustness of our methods.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Amazon Mechanical Turk workers , and indeed the primary solution is to monetarily reward agents in exchange for effortful and truthful labeling.
