      "content": "Paper Title: MiVOLO: Multi-input Transformer for Age and Gender Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAge and gender recognition of a person in a photo is a highly important and complex task in computer vision. It is crucial for various real-world applications, including retail and clothes recognition, surveillance cameras, person identification, shopping stores and more. Additionally, this task becomes even more challenging in uncontrolled scenarios. The significant variability of all conditions such as image quality, angles and rotations of the face, partial facial occlusion, or even its absence in the image, coupled with the necessary speed and accuracy in real-world applications, makes the task quite challenging. Our objective was to develop a simple and easy to implement approach capable of simultaneously recognizing both age and gender, even in situations where the face is not visible. We aimed for scalability and speed in our solution. In this paper, ‚Äùgender recognition‚Äù refers to a well-established computer vision problem, specifically the estimation of biological sex from a photo using binary classification. We acknowledge the complexity of gender identification and related issues, which cannot be resolved through a single photo analysis. We do not want to cause any harm to anyone or offend in any way. Meanwhile, gender recognition is a classification task, while age estimation can be solved either through regression or classification. Many popular benchmarks and research papers   consider age as a classification problem with age ranges. However, this approach can be inaccurate because age, by its nature, is a regression problem. Moreover, it is inherently imbalanced . Treating it as a classification causes several issues. For a classification model, it makes no difference whether it misclassifies into a neighboring class or deviates by several decades from the ground truth. Additionally, as stated in , classification models cannot approximate age ranges from unseen classes, while regression models can. However, regression models are much trickier to train, and collecting or cleaning datasets for such task is more challenging. In this paper, we consider the following popular benchmarks: IMDB-Clean , UTKFace , Adience , FairFace , AgeDB [ref]28. These are some of the most famous datasets containing both age and gender ground truth. IMDB-Clean is the largest available dataset for this task, but it consists of celebrities and is heavily biased. This bias poses a problem for recognition in the wild, you can see an example in Figure 1. For more details, refer to the 3 section.\nTherefore, in our work, we introduce a completely new Layer Age Gender¬†benchmark comprising 84,192 pairs (F‚Äãa‚Äãc‚Äãe‚ÄãC‚Äãr‚Äão‚Äãp,B‚Äão‚Äãd‚Äãy‚ÄãC‚Äãr‚Äão‚Äãp)ùêπùëéùëêùëíùê∂ùëüùëúùëùùêµùëúùëëùë¶ùê∂ùëüùëúùëù(FaceCrop,BodyCrop) randomly selected from the Open Images Dataset.\nThese images were annotated on a crowd-sourcing platform, and we have achieved remarkably high accuracy using a weighted averaging votes strategy. While most existing works focus on estimating age and/or gender solely from face images, this work introduces the MiVOLO model, which is built upon the visual transformer model VOLO [ref]42. The MiVOLO¬†allows for the simultaneous prediction of age and gender by incorporating both face and body features. Our model, trained using both body and face images, achieves SOTA results on the 5 largest benchmarks.\nAdditionally, it attains a high frame rate of 971 frames per second (FPS) when utilizing a batch size of 512 on the NVIDIA V100. Moreover, our model accommodates the inclusion of images that may lack visible faces. Human-level estimation is also an open question. Accuracy heavily depends on conditions and is unclear in this task. Some articles [ref]36 state that neural network models have already surpassed human-level performance. However, there are not many works where exact human-level performance has been estimated, and we did not find any that have been conducted on images with full-sized persons in the wild.\nIn this paper, we estimated this level using random images from the IMDB-clean dataset. The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: We provide publicly available models that achieved SOTA results in 5 benchmarks. We have developed a readily implementable architecture called MiVOLO, capable of simultaneously handling faces and bodies. It enables accurate age and gender prediction, even in cases where humans may struggle. The architecture supports predictions with and without face input. MiVOLO¬†has achieved top-1 results on 5 popular benchmarks, 3 of them without any fine-tuning on training data. Additionally, we have once again demonstrated that a carefully implemented multi-output (multi-task) approach can provide a significant performance boost compared to single-task models. We have also shown that multi-input models able to gain generalization ability in the same way as multi-task models. The original UTKFace dataset has been restored to include full-sized images. The annotations of IMDB-clean, UTK and FairFace datasets have been modified to include annotations of all detectable persons and faces in each image using our models. Human-level estimation for the task with a substantial sample size. A completely new, very well balanced Layer Age and Gender Dataset¬†that we propose to use as a benchmark for age and gender recognition in the wild.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: to train, and collecting or cleaning datasets for such task is more challenging.
