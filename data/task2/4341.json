      "content": "Paper Title: MRF-UNets: Searching UNet with Markov Random Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural architecture search (NAS) has greatly improved the performance on various vision tasks, for example, classification [ref]4  , object detection    and semantic segmentation     via automating the architecture design process. UNet  is widely adopted to a large number of problem settings such as aerial [ref]9  and medical image segmentation    due to its simplicity and effectiveness, but either with no architecture optimization, or with simple manual tuning. A natural question is, can we improve its manually-designed architecture with NAS? AOWS [ref]4 is a resource-aware NAS method and it is able to find effective architectures that strictly satisfy resource constraints, e.g. latency or the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). The main idea of AOWS is to model the search problem as parameter learning and maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference over a Markov Random Field (MRF). However, the main limitation of AOWS is the adoption of Viterbi inference. As a result, the approach is only applicable to simple tree-structured graphs where the architecture cannot have skip connections . Skip connections are widely adopted in modern neural networks as they can ease the training of deep models via shortening effective paths ; skip connections have also played an important role in the success of semantic segmentation where an encoder and a decoder are connected by long skip connections to aggregate features at different levels, e.g. UNet. Besides, MAP assignment over a weight-sharing network is usually sub-optimal due to the discrepancy between the one-shot super-network and stand-alone child-networks  . Restricting the search to a single MAP solution also results in the search method having high variance [ref]25, so one usually needs to repeat the search process with different random seeds and hyper-parameters. Furthermore, parameter learning of AOWS is non-differentiable, and this disconnects AOWS from recent advances in the differentiable NAS community [ref]25  , despite its advantages in efficient inference. The contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we propose MRF-NAS, which extends and improves AOWS with\n\n\n(i) a more general framework that shows close connections with other NAS approaches and yields better representation capability,\n\n(ii) loopy inference algorithms so we can apply it to more complex search spaces,\n\n(iii) diverse M-best inference instead of a single MAP assignment to reduce the search variance and to improve search results and\n\n(iv) a novel differentiable parameter learning approach with Gibbs sampling and Long-Short-Burnin-Scheme (LSBS) to save on computational cost.\n\n\nWith UNet as the backbone, we find an architecture, MRF-UNet, that shows several interesting characteristics. Secondly, through the lens of these characteristics, we identify the sub-optimality of the original UNet architecture and further improve our results with MRF-UNetV2. We show the effectiveness of our approach on three aerial image datasets: DeepGlobe Land, Road and Building [ref]9 and two medical image datasets: CHAOS  and PROMISE12 . Compared with the benchmarks, our MRF-UNets achieve superior performance while maintaining low computational cost.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Neural architecture search (NAS) has greatly improved the performance on various vision tasks, for example, classification [ref]4  , object detection    and semantic segmentation     via automating the architecture design process.
