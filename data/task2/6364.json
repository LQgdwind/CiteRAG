      "content": "Paper Title: The Universal Law of Generalization Holds for Naturalistic Stimuli\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur approach builds on advances in large-scale online recruitment and experiment design to exhaustively estimate similarity matrices over naturalistic stimuli by directly scaling up pairwise judgment elicitation. For stimuli, we focused on natural images (Figure 1A) for three reasons, namely, a) they strike a balance between being perceptually complex and being intuitive and widespread across cultures, b) they can be easily embedded within an online study, which facilitates crowdsourcing, and c) high-quality sets of natural images along with accompanying behavioral data are available in the literature (; ; ). As for the paradigm, we used simple pairwise judgment elicitation on a Likert scale with two complementary types of human judgments that are common to the study of representations, namely, direct similarity judgments that answer the query “How similar are the animals in the following two images?” (Figure 1B; ; ), and generalization judgments that answer the query “If the animal in image 1 has enzyme X321, how likely is it that the animal in image 2 has it too?” (Figure 1C; ; ). In the latter case, we used a fictitious enzyme name so as to prevent participants from resorting to any technical knowledge.\nRecent work on similarity judgments for images has also used an alternative paradigm where participants judge which of three images is the odd one out [ref]10. However, we chose to use pairwise similarity judgments to maximize the correspondence with the paradigm used by Shepard, and because triplets scale cubically in the number of stimuli making them even harder to scale (without further assumptions about deriving pairwise similarity from triplets).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: from resorting to any technical knowledge.\nRecent work on similarity judgments for images has also used an alternative paradigm where participants judge which of three images is the odd one out [ref]10.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
