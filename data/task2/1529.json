      "content": "Paper Title: A Review of Speaker Diarization: Recent Advances with Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDuring the early years of diarization technology (in the 1990s), the research objective was to benefit automatic speech recognition (ASR) on air traffic control dialogues and broadcast news recordings, by separating each speaker’s speech segments and enabling speaker-adaptive training of acoustic models       . In this period some fundamental approaches for measuring the distance between speech segments for speaker change detection and clustering, such as generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)  and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) , were developed and quickly became the golden standard. All these efforts collectively laid out paths to consolidate activities across research groups worldwide, leading to several research consortia and challenges in the early 2000s, among which there were the Augmented Multiparty Interaction (AMI) Consortium  supported by the European Commission and the RT Evaluation  hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). These organizations, spanning over from a few years to a decade, fostered further advancements on speaker diarization technologies across different data domains from broadcast news      and conversational telephone speech (CTS)     to meeting conversations     . The new approaches resulting from these advancements include, but not limited to, beamforming , information bottleneck clustering (IBC) , variational Bayesian (VB) approaches , joint factor analysis (JFA) . Speaker specific representation in a total variability space derived from simplified JFA, known as i-vector , found great success in speaker recognition and was quickly adopted by speaker diarization systems as feature representation for short speech segments, segmented in an unsupervised fashion. i-Vector successfully replaced its predecessors such as merely mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) or speaker factors (or eigenvoices)  to bolster clustering performance in speaker diarization, being combined with principal component analysis (PCA)  , variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) , mean shift  and probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) . Since the advent of deep learning in the 2010s, there has been a considerable amount of research to take advantage of powerful modeling capabilities of the neural networks for speaker diarization. One representative example is the extraction of the speaker embeddings using neural networks, such as the d-vectors [ref]37   or the x-vectors 0, which most often are embedding vector representations based on the bottleneck layer output of a deep neural network (DNN) trained for speaker recognition. The shift from i-vector to these neural embeddings contributed to enhanced performance, easier training with more data 1, and robustness against speaker variability and acoustic conditions. More recently, end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) where individual sub-modules in the traditional speaker diarization systems (c.f., Fig. 1) can be replaced by one neural network gets more attention with promising results 2 3. This research direction, although not fully matured yet, could open up unprecedented opportunities to address challenges in the field of speaker diarization, such as, the joint optimization with other speech applications, with overlapping speech, if large-scale data is available for training such powerful neural network-based models.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: of powerful modeling capabilities of the neural networks for speaker diarization.
