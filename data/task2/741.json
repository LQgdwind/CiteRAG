      "content": "Paper Title: Joint Policy Search for Multi-agent Collaboration with Imperfect Information\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep reinforcement learning has demonstrated strong or even super-human performance in many complex games (e.g., Atari , Dota 2 , Starcraft [ref]42, Poker  9, Find and Seek , Chess, Go and Shogi   [ref]39). While massive computational resources are used, the underlying approach is quite simple: to iteratively improve current agent policy, assuming stationary environment and fixed policies of all other agents. Although for two-player zero-sum games this is effective, for multi-agent collaborative with imperfect information, it often leads to sub-optimal Nash equilibria where none of the agents is willing to change their policies unilaterally. For example, if speaking one specific language becomes a convention, then unilaterally switching to a different one is not a good choice, even if the other agent actually knows that language better. In this case, it is necessary to learn to jointly change policies of multiple agents to achieve better equilibria. One brute-force approach is to change policies of multiple agents simultaneously, and re-evaluate them one by one on the entire game to seek for performance improvement, which is computationally expensive. Alternatively, one might hope that a change of a sparse subset of policies might lead to “local” changes of game values and evaluating these local changes can be faster. While this is intuitively reasonable, in imperfect information game (IG), changing policy on one decision point leads to reachability changes of downstream states, leading to non-local interplay between policy updates. In this paper, we realize this locality idea by proposing policy-change density, a quantity defined at each perfect information history state with two key properties: (1) when summing over all states, it gives overall game value changes upon policy update, and (2) when the local policy remains the same, it vanishes regardless of any policy changes at other parts of the game tree. Based on this density, the value changes of any policy update on a sparse set of decision points can be decomposed into a summation on each decision point (or information set), which is easy and efficient to compute. Based on that, we propose a novel approach, called Joint Policy Search (JPS). For tabular IG, JPS is proven to never worsen the current policy, and is computationally more efficient than brute-force approaches. For simple collaborative games with enumerable states, we show that JPS improves policies returned by Counterfactual Regret Minimization baseline  by a fairly good margin, outperforming methods with explicit belief-modeling 6 and Advantageous Actor-Critic (A2C)  with self-play, in particular in more complicated games. Furthermore, we show JPS has a sample-based formulation and can be readily combined with gradient methods and neural networks. This enables us to apply JPS to Contract Bridge bidding, in which enumerating the information sets are computationally prohibitive111In the bidding phase, asides the current player, each of the other 3 players can hold 6.35×10116.35superscript10116.35\\times 10^{11} unique hands and there are 1047superscript104710^{47} possible bidding sequences. Unlike hint games like Hanabi , public actions in Bridge (e.g. bid) do not have pre-defined meaning and does not decrease the uncertainty when game progresses.. Improved by JPS upon a strong A2C baseline, the resulting agent outperforms Wbridge5, a world computer bridge program that won multiple championships, by a large margin of +0.630.63+0.63 IMPs per board over a tournament of 1000 games, better than previous state-of-the-art 8 that beats WBridge5 by +0.410.41+0.41 IMPs per board. Note that +0.10.1+0.1 IMPs per board is regarded as nontrivial improvement in computer bridge .\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated strong or even super-human performance in many complex games (e.g., Atari , Dota 2 , Starcraft [ref]42, Poker  9, Find and Seek , Chess, Go and Shogi   [ref]39).
