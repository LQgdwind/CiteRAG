      "content": "Paper Title: Content and Context Features for Scene Image Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost of the scene image features are based on the content of the images        0   6  [ref]29   [ref]36    2 4 3    . These features focus on the visual content of the images. These features can be further divided into two types: traditional content features        0   6  [ref]29   [ref]36  and deep learning-based content features   2 4 3    . Most of the traditional content features are computed based on the popular traditional methods\nsuch as Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)  ,\nHistogram of Gradient (HOG) ,\nGeneralized\nSearch Trees (GIST)  ,\nSpatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) ,\nCENsus TRansform hISTogram (CENTRIST) , multi-channel (mCENTRIST) 0,\nOriented Texture Curves (OTC) ,\nGIST-Color  ,\nRoI (Region of Interest) with GIST  ,\nMax margin Scene (MM-Scene) 6,\nObject bank  ,\nReconfigurable BoW (RBoW)  [ref]29,\nBag of Parts (BoP)  ,\nImportant Spatial Pooling Region (ISPR)  ,\nLaplacian Sparse Coding SPM (LscSPM)  [ref]36,\nImproved Fisher Vector (IFV)  , and so on. In early works such as Search Trees GIST  , CENTRIST  and mCENTRIST 0, features were extracted from local details such as colors, pixels, orientations, etc.\nof the images. They have a limited ability to deal with the significant variations in the local content of images. Local features extracted by SIFT , are multi-scale and rotation-invariant in nature. These local information may not provide global layout information of images and hence results in lower classification accuracy. SPM  extracted the features based on the spatial regions of the image defined, by partitioning images into different slices. The features of each region were extracted as Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) of SIFT descriptors. Though their method captures some semantic regions of the image by partitioning method to some extent, it is not good at representing complex scene images that demand high-level information (object or scene details) for their better separability. In HoG , features were based on the gradient orientations in local grids of images. Since these features focus on designing histograms based on edge orientations, they are not suitable for complex scene images with multiple objects and their associations. In OTC , features were based on the color variation of patches in images. These features are suitable to represent texture images but they may not be suitable for scene images. Similarly, several other methods such as   6  [ref]29   [ref]36  extracted features based on local sense of images. Since all these methods rely on the fundamental components and fail to capture the association/relations between components, they have limited capability for the classification of scene images. To sum up, these traditional content features are insufficient to represent the complex images such as scenes, where multiple factors such as context, background and foreground need to be considered for better differentiation. Recent research works such as\nCNN-MOP ,\nCNN-sNBNL ,\nResNet152 2,\nVGG 4,\nEISR 3,\nGM2SF ,\nBag of Surrogate Parts (BoSP)  , CNN-LSTM , and HDF  used deep learning models to extract semantic features of images. Deep features are extracted from the intermediate layers of such pre-trained models and outperform existing traditional visual content features in scene image classification. Initially, Gong et al.\n  and Kuzborskij et al.  extracted deep features from Caffe 3 model pre-trained on hybrid datasets (ImageNet  and Places 4) and ImageNet , respectively. Specifically, Gong et al.  utilized fully connected layers (F​C𝐹𝐶FC-layers) resulting in features size of 4,09640964,096-D for each scale of the image to achieve orderless multi-scale pooling features. The size of final features is higher as the number of scales increases in their experiments. Their method outperforms single-scaled features though Gong et al. has a higher dimensional features size.\nSimilarly, Kuzborskij et al.  also used F​C𝐹𝐶FC-layers after fine-tuning. The features were used on top of Naive Bayes non-linear learning approach for the image classification purpose. Their method needs fine-tuning operations, which could need massive datasets for learning discriminating features. Furthermore, He et al. 2 proposed a deep architecture to extract features based on residual networks. The network was trained with ImageNet  dataset, as with previous researchers in prior deep learning models such as VGG-Net .\nNevertheless, there was a necessity of deep architectures pre-trained with scene related images for the extraction of scene features.\nThus, Zhou et al. 4 trained VGG-Net model  with scene image dataset, which utilizes\nthe background information of the image. Their background features (scene-based) of scene images were more prominent (in terms of classification) than foreground features (object-based) obtained from ImageNet  pre-trained models such as VGG16 . Furthermore, some studies extracted the mid-level features based on the pre-trained deep learning models to improve the separability. Zhang et al. 3 performed random cropping of images into multiple crops and extracted the visual features from the AlexNet 8 model, pre-trained on ImageNet , to design a codebook of size of 1,00010001,000. Then, sparse coding technique was used to extract the proposed features. The sparse coded features were concatenated with the tag-based features as the final features. Such types of features were extracted for each crop and concatenated as the final features of images. Their method suffers from the curse of the high features dimensionality. Furthermore, due to the chance of repetition of random patches, the chances of classification performance degradation is not surprising. Tang et al.  chose three classification layers of GoogleNet , which was fine tuned with the scene images of corresponding domains. The features were extracted in the form of probabilities from classification layers and then performed feature fusion of these three probability-based features. Their method is also called multi-stage CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Their method demands large datasets and rigorous hyper-parameter tuning process to learn the separable features for the better discrimination of each input image.\nLikewise, Guo et al.   proposed Bag of Surrogate Parts (BoSP) features based on the higher pooling layers of the VGG16 model  pre-trained with ImageNet  such as 4t​hsuperscript4𝑡ℎ4^{th} and 5t​hsuperscript5𝑡ℎ5^{th} pooling layers.\nTheir method based on foreground information outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.\nHowever, their method simply focuses on the foreground (object-based) information because their deep learning model has been pre-trained on ImageNet  with frequent object based information. Bai et al.  extracted image features based on the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on top of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They assumed that the ordered slices of the images come under the LSTM problem in scene image representation, which yields prominent features. The features of each slice were extracted from the VGG16  pre-trained on Places 4 and fed into the LSTM model. The use of background information with such model outperformed several other previous methods including traditional methods and deep learning-based methods. Since their method uses both CNN and LSTM models for the classification, it not only requires massive datasets to learn the highly separable features but also needs arduous hyper-parameter tuning process to mitigate both over-fitting and under-fitting problems. In addition, their method ignores the object-level information, which could be very important clues for better differentiation of complex scene images. Recently, Sitaula et al.  adopted the whole and part-level approach to represent the scene images. For this, they utilized both foreground and background information. From their experiment, they reported that the feature extraction using both foreground and background information at both whole level and part level can help capture the more interesting regions, which improves the class separability.  Since their method only relies on content information, it still may be unable to differentiate complex scene images having higher inter-class similarity problems. Aggregation of multi-scale features provides more discriminating information of scene images by their multi-scale nature. However, this has been ignored by previous methods whose representation are often based on either foreground features or background features using pre-trained deep learning models. The fusion of such multi-scale foreground features and background features can help to provide the stable and improved classification accuracy of scene images even on varying sized images.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Most of the scene image features are based on the content of the images        0   6  [ref]29   [ref]36    2 4 3    .
