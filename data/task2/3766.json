Given a 333-colourable graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices, is it possible to\nfind a k𝑘k-colouring of G𝐺G? On the tractability side, the current best is a\npolynomial-time algorithm of Kawarabayashi and Thorup  that finds a k𝑘k-colouring\nwith k=k​(n)=n0.199𝑘𝑘𝑛superscript𝑛0.199k=k(n)=n^{0.199} colours. On the intractability side, the\nstate-of-the-art for constant k𝑘k has only recently been improved from\nk=4𝑘4k=4, due to Khanna, Linial, and Safra  and Guruswami and\nKhanna  to k=5𝑘5k=5, due to Barto, Bulín, Krokhin, and Opršal [ref]5. The authors of [ref]5 introduced a general algebraic\nmethodology for studying the computational complexity of so-called promise\nconstraint satisfaction problems (PCSPs). Going beyond the work in [ref]5, for\ngraphs with a promised higher chromatic number than three, the current best\nintractability results for constantly many extra colours is due to\nWrochna and Živný , building on the work of\nHuang .\nHardness of approximate graph colouring has been established under stronger assumptions. In particular,\nDinur, Mossel, and Regev  showed NP-hardness under a non-standard variant of the UGC Conjecture of Khot  and Guruswami and Sandeep  (building on ) showed NP-hardness under the d𝑑d-to-111 conjecture  for any fixed d𝑑d. The situation is much better understood for the approximate hypergraph colouring\nproblem with the classic notion of a colouring leaving no edge monochromatic.\nA celebrated result of Dinur, Regev, and Smyth established\nthat finding a k𝑘k-colouring of a 333-uniform hypergraph that is ℓℓ\\ell-colourable\nis \\NP-hard for every constant 2≤ℓ≤k2ℓ𝑘2\\leq\\ell\\leq k  (and this also\nimplies the same result on r𝑟r-uniform hypergraphs for every constant uniformity r≥3𝑟3r\\geq 3). This was also recently proved, with different techniques, by Wrochna . Different variants of approximate hypergraph colourings, such as rainbow\ncolourings, were studied, e.g.\nin   5 7 , but most complexity\nclassifications related to these problems are open.\nSome intractability results are also known for colourings with a super-constant\nnumber of colours. For graphs, conditional hardness was established by\nDinur and Shinkar 2. For hypergraphs, intractability results were\nobtained by Bhangale  and by Austrin, Bhanghale, and Potukuchi [ref]1. Barto, Battistelli, and Berg have recently studied systematically a certain type of PCSPs on non-Boolean domains and\nidentified a very natural\nvariant of k𝑘k-colourings of 333-uniform hypergraphs, called linearly ordered (LO)\nk𝑘k-colourings [ref]4. A k𝑘k-colouring of a 333-uniform hypergraph\nwith colours [k]={1,…,k}delimited-[]𝑘1…𝑘[k]=\\{1,\\ldots,k\\} is an LO colouring if, for every edge, it holds\nthat, if two vertices are coloured with the same colour, then the third vertex is\ncoloured with a larger colour. (In the classic non-monochromatic colouring, the\nrequirement is that the third vertex should be coloured with a different\ncolour, but not necessarily a larger one.) An LO 222-colouring is thus\na “111-in-333” colouring. Barto et al. asked whether finding an LO\nk𝑘k-colouring of a 333-uniform hypergraph is \\NP-hard for a fixed k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3 if the input hypergraph is\npromised to admit an LO 222-colouring.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: the\nstate-of-the-art for constant k𝑘k has only recently been improved from\nk=4𝑘4k=4, due to Khanna, Linial, and Safra  and Guruswami and\nKhanna  to k=5𝑘5k=5, due to Barto, Bulín, Krokhin, and Opršal [ref]5.
