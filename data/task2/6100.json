These problems are\nquite well-understood in various computational models \nand under complexity-theoretic assumptions such as the counting exponential-time\nhypothesis #​𝖤𝖳𝖧#𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{\\#ETH}  , which\npostulates that counting satisfying assignments to Boolean formulas\non n𝑛n variables requires exp⁡(Ω​(n))Ω𝑛\\exp(\\Omega(n)) time. Under this hypothesis,\nit is known that the complexity of counting homomorphisms is essentially\ndetermined by the treewidth tw​(H)tw𝐻\\mathrm{tw}(H), a graph width measure\nthat is polynomially related to the maximum r∈ℕ𝑟ℕr\\in\\mathbb{N} such\nthat H𝐻H contains an r×r𝑟𝑟r\\times r grid minor  . For any graph H𝐻H of treewidth t𝑡t, the graph\nparameter hom⁡(H,⋅)hom𝐻⋅\\hom(H,\\,\\cdot\\,) can be evaluated in time O​(nt+1)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑡1O(n^{t+1})\non n𝑛n-vertex graphs. Assuming #​𝖤𝖳𝖧#𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{\\#ETH}, there exists a constant\nc>0𝑐0c>0 such that, for any graph H𝐻H of treewidth t𝑡t, the graph\nparameter hom⁡(H,⋅)hom𝐻⋅\\hom(H,\\,\\cdot\\,) cannot be evaluated in time O​(nc​t/log⁡t)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑐𝑡𝑡O(n^{ct/\\log t}). Together with Theorem 4, we obtain the following\ncorollary. Let p𝑝p be a graph motif parameter and let\nq=maxH◁p⁡tw​(H)𝑞subscript◁𝐻𝑝tw𝐻q=\\max_{H\\triangleleft\\,p}\\mathrm{tw}(H). Then p𝑝p can be evaluated in time O​(nq+1)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑞1O(n^{q+1}).\nAssuming #​𝖤𝖳𝖧#𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{\\#ETH}, there is a constant c>0𝑐0c>0 that is independent\nof p𝑝p, such that p𝑝p cannot be evaluated in time O​(nc​q/log⁡q)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑐𝑞𝑞O(n^{cq/\\log q}). This corollary allows us to study the complexity of a graph motif\nparameter p𝑝p by determining the maximum treewidth of graphs H◁p◁𝐻𝑝H\\triangleleft\\,p\nin the hom-expansion of p𝑝p. Following [ref]14,\nlet us investigate the complexity of sub​(H,⋅)sub𝐻⋅\\mathrm{sub}(H,\\,\\cdot\\,) for fixed H𝐻H.\nBy Fact 2, we have F◁sub​(H,⋅)◁𝐹sub𝐻⋅F\\triangleleft\\,\\mathrm{sub}(H,\\,\\cdot\\,)\niff F𝐹F is a quotient of H𝐻H, so it suffices to determine the maximum\ntreewidth q𝑞q that can be attained by quotients of H𝐻H. Up to constant\nfactors, q𝑞q equals the maximum size k𝑘k of a matching in H𝐻H: Every graph Q𝑄Q on k𝑘k edges is a quotient of a matching on k𝑘k\nedges. Thus, for every graph Q𝑄Q on k𝑘k edges, some quotient of\nH𝐻H contains Q𝑄Q as a subgraph. As we can choose Q𝑄Q to be an expander\nwith k𝑘k edges and treewidth Ω​(k)Ω𝑘\\Omega(k), it follows that q≥Ω​(k)𝑞Ω𝑘q\\geq\\Omega(k). Since H𝐻H has no matching of size k+1𝑘1k+1, it has a vertex-cover of\nsize ≤2​kabsent2𝑘\\leq 2k. Because taking quotients does not increase the vertex-cover\nnumber of a graph, any quotient of H𝐻H also has a vertex-cover of\nsize ≤2​kabsent2𝑘\\leq 2k. It follows that q≤O​(k)𝑞𝑂𝑘q\\leq O(k), since the treewidth\nof any graph is upper-bounded by its vertex-cover number. Together, these two facts imply that q=Θ​(k)𝑞Θ𝑘q=\\Theta(k). It follows by\nCorollary 6 that sub​(H,⋅)sub𝐻⋅\\mathrm{sub}(H,\\,\\cdot\\,) can be evaluated\nin time nO​(k)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑘n^{O(k)} and, assuming #​𝖤𝖳𝖧#𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{\\#ETH}, not in time no​(k/log⁡k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘𝑘n^{o(k/\\log k)}. It can be shown similarly that ind​(H,⋅)ind𝐻⋅\\mathrm{ind}(H,\\,\\cdot\\,) with |V​(H)|=k𝑉𝐻𝑘|V(H)|=k\ncannot be solved in time no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(k)} under #​𝖤𝖳𝖧#𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{\\#ETH}: We use that\nthe complete graph Kksubscript𝐾𝑘K_{k} satisfies Kk◁ind​(H,⋅)◁subscript𝐾𝑘ind𝐻⋅K_{k}\\triangleleft\\,\\mathrm{ind}(H,\\,\\cdot\\,)\nby Fact 3 and that hom⁡(Kk,⋅)homsubscript𝐾𝑘⋅\\hom(K_{k},\\,\\cdot\\,) cannot\nbe solved in time no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(k)} under #​𝖤𝖳𝖧#𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{\\#ETH}, see [ref]9.\nSimilar results are known for other graph motif parameters related\nto restricted types of homomorphisms [ref]38,\nvertex-induced subgraphs inducing monotone properties   ,\nedge-induced subgraphs satisfying minor-closed properties  ,\nand a variant of the Tutte polynomial .\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: q}).
