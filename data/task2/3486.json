      "content": "Paper Title: A Tutorial on Adversarial Learning Attacks and Countermeasures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDefensive distillation is a process that uses knowledge distilled from a neural network architecture in order to increase its robustness to adversarial examples . This idea was extended from work done in [ref]29, where they reasoned that computational complexity of larger architectures could be bypassed by using smaller architectures that contain knowledge of larger, previously trained neural networks. The intuition behind this is that knowledge from complex architectures can be fitted onto smaller resource-constrained devices . The distillation training procedure involves the utilisation of ‚Äòsoft labels‚Äô output by the first neural network, to train a second neural network. The only difference is in the training procedure of soft labels.  argue that the use of soft targets in training is justified because the probabilities encode extra knowledge about each class. The vector of soft labels that are output for each datapoint, represents the probability of membership to each of the classes, with the highest probability being the most likely class the datapoint belongs to. The soft labels for a datapoint are calculated in (17), where qisubscriptùëûùëñq_{i} is the class probability for the i-th class, zisubscriptùëßùëñz_{i} the input to the softmax layer and T the temperature, which controls how ‚Äôsoft‚Äô the probability is distributed over the classes [ref]29. The higher the temperature value used, the more the output probability distribution resembles a uniform one. A breakdown of the distillation procedure is illustrated in Figure 3. Source:   built a distilled network using the same architecture which provided the soft labels. They used the same high-temperature values to train both networks, then set the temperature back to 1 during test time. They trained, tested, and measured the model‚Äôs sensitivity to adversarial examples when trained on the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR10 dataset. They crafted adversarial samples using a succession of two techniques: direction sensitivity estimation, and perturbation selection. A reduction in adversarial sample success rate from 95.89% to 0.45% was noticed in the model trained on the MNIST dataset and a drop from 87.89% to 5.11% on the model trained in the CIFAR10 dataset. The percentage changes observed were from a model with no distillation to a distilled model, both trained with temperature values of 100. Conflicting results are obtained in [ref]30 where a distilled network was used in defending text processing neural networks. Little to no change in the robustness of their network was obtained when a distilled network was used. They speculate that the use of distillation in text processing is misplaced, as gradients are not directly added to the input, but are rather just used to highlight the importance of a given word. The distillation method seems to succumb to the black box attack proposed in . The researchers recreated the models trained in  and successfully implemented an FGSM attack under black box conditions. They accredit the success of the attack to a phenomenon called gradient masking, the method in which distillation defence works. They postulate that the distillation method makes the gradient harder for the adversary to obtain, but does not nullify the attack vector itself. An extension to the defensive distillation was made by co-authors of the original papers of . In the revised paper , they attempt to bypass the gradient masking effect by making modifications to the original defensive distillation process. They add two major additional components to their new model: an uncertainty metric for the inputs to the network, and an outlier class with the sole purpose of classifying adversarial samples. These are accompanied by changes made to the training procedure of networks, namely a modification to the loss function in the distilled network, and the setting of the temperature value to 1 at all times. The result of this was a network that proved to be less likely to suffer from gradient masking. Because of this, black box attacks were more likely to be flagged by the model as outliers, as supposed to white-box attacks. They conclude by stating the following, ‚ÄòDefensive distillation‚Äôs most appealing aspect remains that it does not require that the defender generate adversarial samples‚Äô .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: distillation is a process that uses knowledge distilled from a neural network architecture in order to increase its robustness to adversarial examples .
