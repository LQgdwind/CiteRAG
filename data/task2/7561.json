      "content": "Paper Title: REWIND Dataset: Privacy-preserving Speaking Status Segmentation from Multimodal Body Movement Signals in the Wild\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the study of conversational social behavior, turn-taking patterns are a fundamental unit of analysis. Therefore, most previous mingling datasets have contained speaking status annotations and have presented estimating it as a baseline task   . These datasets contain raw modalities like video and acceleration from wearable devices. Subjects are usually localized in videos using bounding boxes, with the exception of the recent ConfLab dataset  which contains full-body keypoint annotations. Table I presents an overview of existing mingling datasets used for speaking status detection. Follow-up work using some these datasets has addressed speaking status detection from video by classifying 3-second windows as speech / non-speech   0 [ref]30 . Cabrera-Quiros et al.  presented MILES, a method making use of multiple instance learning to classify bags of dense trajectories, also making use of 3-second windows. In a MediaEval multimedia evaluation benchmark addressing this task, Fisher Vectors were also explored as an alternative to represent dense trajectories . Wang et al. showed significant improvements over both of these methods using a 3D CNN method on 1-second windows. Poses, often derived from video frames, are another modality of interest due to their lower dimensionality compared to raw video and their ability to capture gestures. Individual pose detections have been used in action recognition work, both as standalone inputs and in combination with video, to provide precise localization information  . However, the application of this work to speaking status detection in the wild has been limited . It is not known whether body-pose-based methods are capable of reaching the same levels of performance as video-based ones, or the effect that different pose detection approaches have on performance. Despite their advantages, video and pose inputs to action recognition models are affected by subject occlusion, cross-contamination, poor lighting conditions, and differences in perspective, orientation, and distance with respect to the camera. Wearable accelerometers circumvent the aforementioned challenges and are capable of capturing subtle body movements in space.\nAccelerometer readings from a smart ID badge hung around the neck (Figure 1(c)) have long been studied for recognizing actions in mingling settings  . Hung et al.  explored recognition of actions like gesturing, laughing, and speaking, obtaining the highest performance among them for speaking detection. The MediaEval multimedia evaluation benchmark also evaluated acceleration-based methods [ref]30 on a subset of the MatchNMingle dataset , which used the same accelerometer sensors used in this work. Here, CNNs for time series have been shown to improve over traditional classifiers . Particularly, a previous approach made use of transfer-learning to obtain person-specific classifiers 7. Multiple works have found speaking status detection performance from acceleration to be higher than that of video-based methods. 7    As with video, all of these works made use of 1-second or 3-second windows for classification. Despite all these works, a key challenge remains: existing mingling datasets    do not contain high-quality audio. In  and  speaking status has been annotated from the video. In  speaking status was annotated from low-resolution audio and the authors noted the difficulty of distinguishing speakers in their recordings. Lack of high-quality audio in these datasets not only limits the time-resolution of the speaking status annotations (and of the trained models) but may affect the correctness of the annotations themselves. The quality of video-based speaking status annotations has not been compared with that of audio-based ground truth. Furthermore, lack of audio makes such datasets unusable for the study of other verbal phenomena, due to the impossibility of annotating them.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: datasets used for speaking status detection.
