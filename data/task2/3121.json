      "content": "Paper Title: SegDiff: Image Segmentation with Diffusion Probabilistic Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present segmentation results for three datasets, as well as an ablation study. Datasets  The Cityscapes dataset  is an instance segmentation dataset containing 5,000 annotated images divided into 2,975 images for training, 500 for validation, and 1,525 for testing. The experimental setting used is sometimes referred to as interactive segmentation and is motivated by the need to accelerate object annotation [ref]1. Under this setting, there are eight object categories, and the goal is to recover the objects’ per-pixel masks, given a cropped patch that contains the bounding box around each object. Our per-object training and validation sets are created by taking crops from images in the original Cityscapes sets using the locations of the ground truth classes (we do not have access to the ground truth labels of the original Cityscapes test set). We compared our method for the Cityscapes dataset with PSPDeepLab , Polygon-RNN++ [ref]1, Curve-GCN  Deep active contours [ref]14, Segformer-B5 0 and Stdc1 . For most baselines, we report the results obtained from previous publications. For Segformer and Stdc, we train from scratch. We did not perform a comparison with PolyTransform , since it uses a different protocol. Specifically, this method, which improves upon Mask R-CNN , utilizes the entire image (and not just the segmentation patch) as part of its inputs, and does not work on standard patches in a way that would enable a direct comparison. The Vaihingen dataset  contains 168 aerial images of Vaihingen, in Germany, divided into 100 images for training and 68 for the test. The task is to segment the central building in each image. For this dataset, the leading baselines are DSAC , DarNet [ref]7, TDAC , Deep active contours [ref]14, FCN-UNET , FCN-ResNet-34, FCN-HarDNet-85 , Segformer-B5 0 and Stdc1 . The MoNuSeg dataset   contains a training set with 30 microscopic images from seven organs, with annotations of 21,623 individual nuclei. The test dataset contains 14 similar images. We resized the images to a resolution of 512×512512512512\\times 512, following 5. The relevant baseline methods are FCN , UNET , UNET++ 3, Res-Unet 8, Axial attention (A.A) Unet 6 and Medical transformer 5. Evaluation \nThe Cityscapes dataset is evaluated using the common metrics of mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) per class. Where N𝑁N is the number of classes in the dataset, TP is the true positive between the ground truth y𝑦y and output mask y^^𝑦\\hat{y}, FN is a false negative, and FP is a false positive. The Vaihingen dataset is evaluated using several metrics: mIoU, F1-score, Weighted Coverage (WCov), and Boundary F-score (BoundF), as described in [ref]7. Briefly, the prediction is\ncorrect if it is within a certain distance threshold from the\nground truth. The benchmarks use five thresholds, from 1px to 5px, for evaluating performance. Following previous work, evaluation on the MoNuSeg dataset is performed using mIoU and the F1-score. Training details \nThe number of diffusion steps in previous works was 1000  and even 4000 5. The literature suggests that more is better 2. In our main experiments, we employ 100 diffusion steps to reduce inference time. An additional set of experiments investigated the influence of the number of diffusion steps on the performance and runtime of the method. The AdamW 2 optimizer is used in all our experiments. Based on the intuition that the more RRDB blocks, the better the results, we used as many blocks as we could fit on the GPU without overly reducing batch size. The Unet used for datasets with a resolution of 256 ×\\times 256 has one additional layer with respect to the dataset with half that resolution, in order to account for the spatial dimensions. On the Cityscapes dataset, the input resolution of our model is 128×128128128128\\times 128. The test metrics are computed on the original resolution; therefore, we resized the prediction to the original image size. Training took place with a batch size of 30 images. The network had 15 RRDB blocks and a depth of six. The number of channels was set to [C,C,2​C,2​C,4​C,4​C]𝐶𝐶2𝐶2𝐶4𝐶4𝐶[C,C,2C,2C,4C,4C] with C=128𝐶128C=128.\nWe followed the same augmentation scheme as in [ref]14, including random scaling in the range of [0.75,1.25]0.751.25[0.75,1.25], with up to 22 degrees rotation in each direction, and a horizontal flip with a probability of 0.5. For the Vaihingen dataset, the size of the input image and the test image resolution was 256×256256256256\\times 256. The experiments were performed with a batch size of eight images, six RRDB blocks, and a depth of seven. The number of channels was set to [C,C,C,2​C,2​C,4​C,4​C]𝐶𝐶𝐶2𝐶2𝐶4𝐶4𝐶[C,C,C,2C,2C,4C,4C] with C=128𝐶128C=128. The same augmentations are used as in [ref]7: random scaling by a factor sampled uniformly in the range [0.75,1.5]0.751.5[0.75,1.5], a rotation sampled uniformly between zero and 360 degrees, independent horizontal and vertical flips, applied with a probability of 0.5, and a random color jitter, with a maximum value of 0.6 brightness, 0.5 contrast, 0.4 saturation, and 0.025 hue. For MoNuSeg, the input image resolution was 256×256256256256\\times 256, but the test resolution was 512×512512512512\\times 512. To address this, we applied a sliding window of 256×256256256256\\times 256 with a stride of 256256256, i.e., we tested each quadrant of the image separately. The experiments were carried out with a batch size of eight images, with 12 RRDB blocks. The network depth was seven, and the number of channels in each depth was [C,C,C,2​C,2​C,4​C,4​C]𝐶𝐶𝐶2𝐶2𝐶4𝐶4𝐶[C,C,C,2C,2C,4C,4C], with C=128𝐶128C=128. We used the same augmentation scheme as in 5 with random cropping of 256×256256256256\\times 256 to adjust for GPU memory. It is worth noting that all baseline methods except Segformer and Stdf rely on pre-trained weights obtained on the ImageNet, PASCAL or COCO datasets. Our networks are initialized with random weights. Results \nFollowing previous work, Cityscapes is evaluated in one of two settings. Tight: in this setting, the samples (image and associated segmentation map) are extracted by a tight crop around the object mask.\nExpansion: samples are extracted by a crop around the object mask, which is 15% larger than the tight crop. The inputs of the model are crops 10% - 20% larger than the tight one. This setting is slightly more challenging, since there is less information on the location of the target object. The results for the Cityscapes dataset are reported in Tab. 1. As can be seen, our method outperforms all baseline methods, across all categories and in both settings. The gap is apparent even for the most recent baseline methods and, as can be seen in Fig. 3, the gap in performance is especially sizable for datasets with less training images. The results for the Vaihingen dataset are presented in Tab. 3. As can be seen, our method outperforms the results reported in previous work for all four scores. The results for the MoNuSeg dataset are presented in Tab. 3. In both segmentation metrics, our method outperforms all previous works, including very recent variants of U-Net and transformers that were developed specifically for this segmentation task. The performance of the mIoU segmentation metric as a function of the number of iterations is presented for the three datasets in Fig. 4. It is interesting to note that the number of diffusion steps required to achieve the maximal score differs across the datasets. All Cityscapes classes present similar behavior (with different levels of performance), saturating around the 60th iteration. The Vaihingen score takes longer to reach its maximal value. While one may attribute this to the larger input image size observed by the network, MoNuSeg, which has the same input image size as Vaihingen, reaches saturation earlier, similarly to the Cityscapes classes. An alternative hypothesis can relate the number of required iterations to the ratio of pixels within the segmentation mask, which is higher for Cityscapes and MoNuSeg than for Vaihingen. This requires further validation. We next study the effect of the number of generated instances on performance. The results can be seen in Fig. 5. In general, increasing the number of generated instances tends to increase the mIoU score. However, the number of runs required to reach optimal performance varies between classes. For example, for the “Bus” and “Train” classes of Cityscapes, the best score is achieved when using 10 and 3 generated instances, respectively. MoNuSeg, requires considerably more runs (25) for maximal performance. On the other hand, when the number of generated instances is increased, inference time also increases linearly, resulting in a slower method compared to architectures such as Segformer and Stdc. Another aspect of achieving improvement by employing multiple generations is calibration. The calibration score is measured as the difference between the prediction probability and the true probability of the event. For example, a perfectly calibrated model is defined by ℙ​(Y^=Y|P^=p)=pℙ^𝑌conditional𝑌^𝑃𝑝𝑝\\mathbb{P}(\\hat{Y}=Y|\\hat{P}=p)=p, which means that the prediction probability equals the true probability of the event. We estimate the calibration score by splitting the  [ref]1 range into ten uniform bins, then average the squared difference between each bin’s mean prediction probability and the percentage of positive samples. The results of examining the calibration scores are presented in Fig. 6. For most datasets, increasing the number of generated instances improves the calibration score, especially when the increase is from a single instance. In addition, for the larger classes in Cityscapes - Rider and Bicycle - and for the MoNuSeg and Vaihingen datasets, the improvement continues to increase even more compared to the other datasets. The “Train” class in Cityscapes is an exception; here, the single-instance calibration score is better than other experiments with a larger number of generated instances. This phenomenon may be a result of the highly varied size and the small number of test images. Ablation Study \nWe evaluate various alternatives to our method. The first variant concatenates [F​(xt),G​(I)]𝐹subscript𝑥𝑡𝐺𝐼[F(x_{t}),G(I)] at the channel dimension. The second variant employs FC-HarDNet-70 V2  instead of RRDBs.\nThe third variant, following 1 , concatenates I𝐼I channelwise to xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}, without using an encoder. The last alternative method is to propagate F​(xt)𝐹subscript𝑥𝑡F(x_{t}) through the U-Net module and add it to G​(I)𝐺𝐼G(I) after the first, third, and fifth downsample blocks (variants four–six), instead of performing F​(xt)+G​(I)𝐹subscript𝑥𝑡𝐺𝐼F(x_{t})+G(I). In this variant, G​(I)𝐺𝐼G(I) is downsampled to match the required number of channels by propagating it through a 2D-convolutional layer with a stride of two. These variant experiments were tested by averaging nine generated instances on the Vaihingen dataset and on Cityscapes “Bus” (the performance reported for our method is therefore slightly different from those reported in Tab. 3). The summation we introduce as a conditioning approach outperforms concatenation (variant one) on Vaihingen by a large margin, while on Cityscapes “Bus”, the difference is small. The RRDB blocks are preferable to the FC-HarDNet architecture in both datasets (variant two). Removing the encoder affects the metrics significantly (variant three), slightly more so on Vaihingen. The change in the signal’s integration position of variant four leads to a negligible difference on Vaihingen and even outperforms our full method on Cityscapes “Bus”. Variants five and six lead to a decrease in performance as the distance from the first layer increases. Fig. 7 depicts sample results for the various variants (one–four) of the Vaihingen dataset. Parameter sensitivity  For testing the stability of our proposed method, we experimented with the two hyperparameters that can affect performance the most: the number of diffusion steps, and the number of RRDB blocks. To study the effect of these parameters, we varied the number of diffusion steps in the range of  0   0 , and the number of RRDB blocks in the range of [ref]1    for Vaihingen and      for Cityscapes “Bus”. We started from a baseline configuration (which was 100 diffusion steps, 3 RRDB blocks for Vaihingen, and 10 RRDB blocks for Cityscapes “Bus”) and experimented with different values around these. The effect of the number of RRDB blocks \nIn this part we set the number of diffusion steps to 100. As can be seen in Fig. 8, with our configuration, the optimal number of RRDB blocks is 3 for Vaihingen, and 10 for Cityscapes “Bus”. However, evidently, the number of blocks has a limited impact in the case of both Cityscapes and Vaihingen. The gap between the best and worst performance points is less than 1 mIoU for Vaihingen and less than 2 mIoU for Cityscapes “Bus”. Therefore, we conclude that this hyperparameter has a small effect on performance. Varying the number of diffusion steps T𝑇T \nIn this part, we set the number of RRDB blocks of Vaihingen to 3 and Cityscapes “Bus” to 10.\nWe explore the possible accuracy/runtime tradeoff with regards to the number T𝑇T of diffusion steps. Results are shown in Fig. 9. When the number of diffusion steps is increased - as we can see in Fig. 9(a) - the graph fluctuation for Vaihingen is less than 1 mIoU, and for Cityscapes “Bus” it is less than 2 mIoU. Surprisingly, when the number of diffusion steps is reduced, even to just 25, which is a very low number compared to the literature  5, the segmentation results remain stable in both datasets, with a degradation of only up to 2 mIou for Vaihingen, and 1 mIou for Cityscapes “Bus”. This reduction can speed up performance by a factor of four and provide a reasonable accuracy to runtime tradeoff. The results for the generation time of one sample in seconds are presented in Fig. 9(b). As can be observed, both graphs are linear, with a different slope. The main reason for this is the difference in image size (which is 256×256256256256\\times 256 for Vaihingen and 128×128128128128\\times 128 for Cityscapes “Bus”). Another, minor reason is the difference in the number of RRDB blocks in this experiment.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: training, 500 for validation, and 1,525 for testing.
