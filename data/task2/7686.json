That is,\nthere is an algorithm\nwhich determines whether a given input graph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C} satisfies a given MSO formula φ𝜑\\varphi in time\nf​(|φ|)⋅|V​(G)|c⋅𝑓𝜑superscript𝑉𝐺𝑐f(|\\varphi|)\\cdot|V(G)|^{c} for some\nfunction f:ℕ→ℕ:𝑓→ℕℕf\\colon\\mathrm{\\mathbb{N}}\\to\\mathrm{\\mathbb{N}} and some constant c𝑐c (in this case c=1𝑐1c=1).\nMore generally, the model checking problem for MSO is fpt on all classes of bounded cliquewidth . In this paper, we focus on\nthe model-checking problem for\nfirst-order logic (FO), which allows to relax the structure of the input graphs greatly, at the cost of restricting the logic.\nGraph classes for which this problem is fpt\ninclude classes of bounded degree , the class of planar graphs , classes which exclude a minor , classes of bounded expansion , and more generally, nowhere dense classes 8, all of which are sparse graph classes\n(specifically, every n𝑛n-vertex graph in such a class has O​(n1+ε)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝜀O(n^{1+\\varepsilon}) edges, for every fixed ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0).\nThe problem is moreover fpt on\nproper hereditary classes of permutation graphs, some classes of bounded twin-width [ref]9, structurally nowhere dense classes , monadically stable classes 0, and others .\nThe central question in the area, first phrased in [37, Sec. 8.2], is the following. What are the structural properties that exactly characterize the hereditary111A graph class is hereditary if it is closed under vertex removal. graph classes with fpt first-order model checking? Sparsity theory , initiated by Nešetřil and Ossona de Mendez,\nhas provided solid structural foundations, and a very general notion of structural tameness for sparse graph classes.\nMore recently, twin-width theory [ref]9 provides\nanother notion of graph classes\nwhich are structurally tame, and not necessarily sparse.\nWhile twin-width theory and sparsity theory bear striking similarities, they are fundamentally incomparable in scope.\nThe community eagerly anticipates a theory that unifies both frameworks, and answers the central question.\nStability theory –\nan area in model theory developed initially by Shelah –\nprovides very general notions of logical tameness of classes of graphs (or other structures), called (monadic) stability and dependence222In the literature, dependence is also referred to as NIP, which stands for negation of the independence property., which subsume the notions studied in sparsity theory and in twin-width theory,\nbut are not easily amenable to combinatorial or algorithmic treatment.\nLet us briefly review sparsity theory, twin-width theory,\nand stability theory, which we build upon.\nFigure 1 shows the relationships between the properties of graph classes discussed in this paper. The central notion of sparsity theory  is that of a nowhere dense graph class.\nThis is a very general notion of structural tameness of sparse graph classes, and encompasses all classes with bounded degree, bounded treewidth, the class of planar graphs, and classes that exclude some graph as a minor.\nAfter a long sequence of prior work     ,\nthe celebrated result of Grohe, Kreutzer and Siebertz 8\nestablished that the model checking problem is fpt on every nowhere dense graph class.\nFor classes that are monotone (closed under removal of vertices and edges) this is optimal  ,\nyielding the following milestone result. A monotone graph class admits fpt model checking if and only if it is nowhere dense\n(assuming FPT≠AW​[∗]FPTAWdelimited-[]\\textnormal{FPT}\\neq\\textnormal{AW}[*]) 8. Here, FPT≠AW​[∗]FPTAWdelimited-[]\\textnormal{FPT}\\neq\\textnormal{AW}[*] is a standard complexity assumption in parameterized complexity, equivalent to the statement that\nmodel checking is not fpt on the class of all graphs.\nThe major shortcoming of this result\nis that it only captures monotone classes,\nand thus sparse graph classes, while there are dense graph classes which are not monotone, and have fpt model checking.\nA trivial example is the class of cliques.\nMore generally, all classes of bounded cliquewidth have fpt model checking.\nFor many years, not many examples of\ngraph classes for which the model checking problem is fpt – beyond nowhere dense classes and classes of bounded cliquewidth – were known. A recent line of research\nextends sparsity theory beyond the sparse setting using transductions.\nWe say a graph class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} transduces a graph class 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} if\nthere exists a first-order formula φ​(x,y)𝜑𝑥𝑦\\varphi(x,y) such that\nevery graph in 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} can be obtained by the following four steps:\n(1) taking a graph G∈𝒞𝐺𝒞G\\in\\mathcal{C}, (2) coloring the vertices of G𝐺G,\n(3) replacing the edge set of G𝐺G with {u​v∣u,v∈V​(G),u≠v,G⊧φ​(u,v)∨φ​(v,u)}conditional-set𝑢𝑣formulae-sequence𝑢𝑣𝑉𝐺formulae-sequence𝑢𝑣models𝐺𝜑𝑢𝑣𝜑𝑣𝑢\\{uv\\mid u,v\\in V(G),u\\neq v,G\\models\\varphi(u,v)\\lor\\varphi(v,u)\\},\nand (4) taking an induced subgraph.\nStep 3 can construct, for example, the edge-complement of G𝐺G with φ​(x,y)=¬E​(x,y)𝜑𝑥𝑦𝐸𝑥𝑦\\varphi(x,y)=\\neg E(x,y)\nor the square of G𝐺G with φ​(x,y)=∃z​E​(x,z)∧E​(z,y)𝜑𝑥𝑦𝑧𝐸𝑥𝑧𝐸𝑧𝑦\\varphi(x,y)=\\exists z~{}E(x,z)\\land E(z,y).\nNote that the formula φ𝜑\\varphi has access to the colors of G𝐺G from step 2.\nTherefore, for example, the class of all graphs is transduced by the class of 111-subdivided cliques\n(by coloring the subdivision vertices that should be turned into edges),\nbut is not transduced by the class of cliques.\nIt was recently shown that model checking is fpt on transductions of nowhere dense classes ,\nextending the work of Grohe, Kreutzer, and Siebertz 8 beyond the sparse setting. This result has been generalized very recently in 0, as described below. Stability, and its variants, are logical tameness conditions arising in Shelah’s classification program 4.\nA graph class is monadically333Monadically refers to the coloring step of a transduction, which is an expansion of the graph with unary/monadic predicates. In classical model theory monadically stable (monadically dependent) classes are equivalently defined as those classes that remain stable (dependent) under unary expansions.\nstable\nif it does not transduce the class of all half-graphs (see Figure 2).\nMonadically stable classes include all structurally nowhere dense classes  .\nIn 0 it is shown that FO model checking is fpt on all monadically stable classes,\nand moreover obtains matching hardness bounds via a new characterization of such classes in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs.\nA class is orderless\nif it avoids some half-graph as a semi-induced444Semi-induced half-graphs look similar to Figure 2,\nbut the connections within the top row and within the bottom row may be arbitrary.\nsubgraph.\nThis establishes monadically stable classes as the limit of tractability among orderless classes. An orderless, hereditary graph class admits fpt model checking if and only if it is monadically stable\n(assuming FPT≠AW​[∗]FPTAWdelimited-[]\\textnormal{FPT}\\neq\\textnormal{AW}[*]) 0. Twin-width [ref]9 is a recently introduced notion which has its roots in enumerative combinatorics and the Stanley-Wilf conjecture/Marcus-Tardos theorem.\nGraph classes with bounded twin-width include the class of\nplanar graphs, all classes of bounded cliquewidth, the class of unit interval graphs, and every proper hereditary class of permutation graphs.\nIt was shown that model checking is fpt on graph classes of bounded twin-width,\nassuming an appropriate decomposition of the graph (in form of a so-called contraction sequence)\nis given as part of the input [ref]9.\nOn ordered graphs (that is, graphs equipped with a total order on the vertex set, which can be accessed by the formulas)\na recent breakthrough result has lifted this additional proviso, and also characterized classes of bounded twin-width as the limit of tractability [ref]7. A hereditary class of ordered graphs admits fpt model checking if and only if it has bounded twin-width\n(assuming FPT≠AW​[∗]FPTAWdelimited-[]\\textnormal{FPT}\\neq\\textnormal{AW}[*]) [ref]7. As discussed above, an exact characterization\nof classes with fpt model-checking\nhas been established in three settings:\nfor monotone graph classes, for the more general hereditary orderless graph classes, and for hereditary classes of ordered graphs, in terms of the notions of nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively.\nThose notions turn out to be three facets of a single notion, again originating in stability theory.\nA graph class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is monadically independent\nif it transduces the class of all graphs .\nOtherwise 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is monadically dependent.\nIn all three settings where we have a complete characterization of fpt model checking,\nmonadic dependence precisely captures the limit of tractability. On monotone classes, nowhere denseness is equivalent to monadic dependence  . On orderless classes, monadic stability is equivalent to monadic dependence 5. On classes of ordered graphs, bounded twin-width is equivalent to monadic dependence [ref]7. This suggests that the known tractability limits 8 [ref]7  0 are fragments of a larger picture,\nwhere monadically dependent classes unify sparsity theory, twin-width theory, and stability theory into a single theory of tractability. Let 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be a hereditary class of graphs. Then the model checking\nproblem for first-order logic is fpt on 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} if and only if 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is monadically dependent.555The conjecture stated in  mentions dependence instead of monadic dependence, but for hereditary classes, those notions are equivalent 2.\nFurthermore, the conjecture in  states only one implication, but the other one was also posed at the same workshop as an open problem. Originally stated in 2016 , the above conjecture is now the central open problem in the area.\nBoth directions have been open.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: edges, for every fixed ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0).\nThe problem is moreover fpt on\nproper hereditary classes of permutation graphs, some classes of bounded twin-width [ref]9, structurally nowhere dense classes , monadically stable classes 0, and others .\nThe central question in the area, first phrased in [37, Sec. 8.2], is the following.
