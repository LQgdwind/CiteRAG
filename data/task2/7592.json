      "content": "Paper Title: Automated Software Verification of Hyperliveness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost methods for kùëòk-safety verification are centered around the self-composition of a program  and often improve upon a na√Øve self-composition by, e.g., exploiting the commutativity of statements    .\nRelational program logics for kùëòk-safety offer a rich set of rules to over-approximate the program behavior  [ref]60 [ref]56    .\nRecently, much effort has been made to employ under-approximate methods that find bugs instead of proving their absence; so far, mostly for unary (non-hyper) properties        . Dardinier et al.¬† propose Hyper Hoare Logic ‚Äì a logic that can express arbitrary hyperproperties, but requires manual deductive reasoning.\nDickerson et al.¬† introduce RHLE, a program logic for the verification of ‚àÄ‚àó‚àÉ‚àósuperscriptfor-allsuperscript\\forall^{*}\\exists^{*} properties, focusing on the composition (and under-approximation) of function calls.\nThey present a weakest-precondition-based verification algorithm that aligns loops in lock-step via user-provided loop invariants.\nUnno et al.¬† present an extension of constraint Horn-clauses (called pfwCSP).\nThey show that pfwCSP can encode many relational verification conditions, including many hyperliveness properties like GNI (see Section¬†5).\nCompared to the pfwCSP encoding, we explore a less liberal program alignment (guided by LABEL:rule:loop-count).\nHowever, we gain the important advantage of generating standard (first-order) SMT constraints that can be handled using existing SMT solvers (which shows significant performance improvement, cf.¬†Section¬†5). Most work on the verification of hyperliveness has focused on more general temporal properties, i.e., properties that reason about infinite executions, based on logics such as HyperLTL  3 .\nCoenen et al.¬† study a method for verifying hyperliveness in finite-state transition systems using strategies to resolve existential quantification.\nThis approach is also applicable to infinite-state systems by means of an abstraction [ref]12 9 (see HyPA in Section¬†5).\nBounded model-checking (BMC) for hyperproperties 8 unrolls the system to a fixed bound and can, e.g., find violations to GNI.\nExisting BMC tools target finite-state (boolean) systems and construct QBF formulas; lifting this to support infinite-state systems by constructing SMT constraints is an interesting future work and could, e.g., complement ForEx in the refutation of FEHTs.\n\nReference markers found: [60]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]60: upon a na√Øve self-composition by, e.g., exploiting the commutativity of statements    .\nRelational program logics for kùëòk-safety offer a rich set of rules to over-approximate the program behavior  [ref]60 [ref]56    .\nRecently, much effort has been made to employ under-approximate methods that find bugs instead of proving their absence; so far, mostly for unary (non-hyper) properties        .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
