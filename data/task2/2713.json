      "content": "Paper Title: G-CoS: GNN-Accelerator Co-Search Towards Both Better Accuracy and Efficiency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs).\nGNNs have achieved great success in graph-based learning tasks  . Depending on their graph representation domains, GNNs can be categorized into spectral and spatial GNNs. Specifically, spectral GNNs model the representation in the graph Fourier transform domain based on eigen-decomposition and usually handle the whole graph simultaneously  . However, it becomes impractical for spectral GNNs to process large graphs and difficult for them to take advantage of parallel processing [ref]10 . On the other hand, spatial GNNs  , which directly perform the computation in the graph domain by aggregating the neighbor nodes’ features, have undergone rapid development. Recently,  introduced an attention mechanism to further improve the performance of spatial GNNs; and  utilized mini-batch training to improve GNNs’ scalability to handling large graphs. Combined with sampling strategies, the whole graph is no longer required during aggregation, leaving much room for potential hardware acceleration  . Therefore, in this work, we will primarily focus on the spatial GNNs for their advantages on scalability and potential hardware acceleration. Graph neural architecture search (GNAS).\nNeural architecture search (NAS) has become a popular approach to designing neural networks   , which can significantly relieve human efforts from manually designing complex networks. The recent NAS success and the large distinction among GNN structures for different tasks have motivated the use of NAS for GNNs (denoted as GNAS). For example, [ref]10  used reinforcement learning (RL) methods along with parameter sharing to efficiently search for GNNs;  adopted an evolutionary search algorithm; and  proposed a more generic GNN design space and a standardized evaluation method for GNNs across various graph learning tasks. Despite the preliminary success, existing works still heavily rely on excessive rounds of sampling and retraining, limiting their scalability to more generic search spaces. Hardware-aware architecture search (HA-NAS).\nTo ensure the searched networks’ hardware efficiency, hardware-aware NAS (HA-NAS) proposes to incorporate hardware metrics, e.g., the latency on mobile phones, into the search process. Early works, e.g.,   , utilized RL-based methods, and thus suffered from substantial search time and costs, limiting their scalability to larger and more diverse search spaces. Inspired by DARTS , differentiable HA-NAS     has emerged to greatly improve both the search and hardware efficiency.\nHowever, restricted by the large difference among different GNN structures and thus the difficulty for hardware acceleration, HA-NAS targeting GNNs has rarely been explored. Furthermore, existing HA-NAS methods have not yet fully explored the hardware design space. As the acceleration efficiency is determined by both the network structures and their accelerators, it is thus desirable to jointly search for both the networks and their accelerators. GNN inference accelerators.\nGNNs’ ultra-sparse graph matrices, corresponding to extremely dynamic and irregular data accesses as well as distinct execution patterns from DNNs, have fueled a growing interest in developing dedicated GNN accelerators . For instance, HyGCN  explored both intra/inter-vertex parallelisms to separately handle the irregularity in the aggregation phase and reusability in the combination phase.\nLater, aiming to boost the overall hardware utilization, AWB-GCN  proposed to balance the workload during runtime with an auto-tuning algorithm and to increase the data locality by regionally clustering the non-zero values (i.e., connected neighbors) within the adjacency matrices; EnGN  proposed a ring-edge-reduce dataflow to handle graphs with arbitrary dimensions and increase the accelerator’s scalability to large graphs; and GRIP  employed fine-grained vertex-tiling to reduce the weight bandwidth requirements;\nIn parallel, to reduce the human efforts in designing GNN accelerators and democratize the process, pioneering works have attempted to characterize the design space of dataflows and micro-architectures for GNN accelerators , and developed an automated framework to generate GNN accelerators . Nevertheless, existing automated frameworks for GNNs still have limited support to various GNN structures and thus suffer from low hardware utilization and achievable efficiency on certain tasks. Software/Hardware Co-exploration.\nJointly exploring the networks and their accelerators has shown promising results [ref]15   [ref]18    .\nFor instance,   conducted RL-based search to jointly optimize the networks and some design parameters of FPGA-based accelerators;  [ref]15 developed the first differentiable network and accelerator co-search framework to boost both the task accuracy and acceleration efficiency; and [ref]18 co-searches for networks, bitwidths, and accelerators to achieve superior performance. However, co-optimizing the GNN structures and their accelerators has not been studied.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: and usually handle the whole graph simultaneously  . However, it becomes impractical for spectral GNNs to process large graphs and difficult for them to take advantage of parallel processing [ref]10 .
