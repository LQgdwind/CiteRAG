      "content": "Paper Title: Attention, please! A survey of Neural Attention Models in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past eight years, most of the papers published in the literature have involved attentional mechanisms. Models that are state of the art in DL use attention. Specifically, we note that end-to-end attention networks, such as Transformers [ref]37 and Graph Attention Networks [ref]97, have been expanding significantly and have been used successfully in tasks across multiple domains (Section 2). In particular, Transformer has introduced a new form of computing in which the neural network’s core is fully attentional. Transformer-based language models like BERT [ref]286, GPT2 , and GPT3  are the most advanced language models in NLP. Image GPT  has recently revolutionized the results of unsupervised learning in imaging. It is already a trend to propose Transfomer based models with sparse attentional mechanisms to reduce the Transformer’s complexity from quadratic to linear and use attentional mechanisms to deal with multimodality in GATs. However, Transformer is still an autoregressive architecture in the decoder and does not use other cognitive mechanisms such as memory. As research in attention and DL is still at early stages, there is still plenty of space in the literature for new attentional mechanisms, and we believe that end-to-end attention architectures might be very influential in Deep Learning’s future models.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: published in the literature have involved attentional mechanisms.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
