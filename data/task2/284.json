      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond the Nav-Graph: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpringing forth from the pages of science fiction and capturing the daydreams of weary chore-doers everywhere, the promise and potential of general-purpose robotic assistants that follow natural language instructions has been long understood. Taking a small step towards this goal, recent work has begun developing artificial agents that follow natural language navigation instructions in perceptually-rich, simulated environments [ref]4 [ref]6. An example instruction might be “Go down the hall and turn left at the wooden desk. Continue until you reach the kitchen and then stop by the kettle.” and agents are evaluated by their ability to follow the described path in (potentially novel) simulated environments. Many of these tasks have been developed from datasets of panoramic images captured in real scenes – e.g. Google StreetView images in Touchdown [ref]6 or Matterport3D panoramas captured in homes in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) [ref]4. This paradigm enables efficient data collection and high visual fidelity compared to 3D scanning or creating synthetic environments; however, scenes are only observed from a sparse set of points relative to the full 3D environment (∼similar-to\\sim117 viewpoints per environment in VLN). As a consequence, environments in these tasks are defined in terms of a navigation graph (or nav-graph for short) – a static topological representation of 3D space. As shown in Fig. 1(a), nodes in the nav-graph correspond to 360° panoramic images taken at fixed locations and edges between nodes indicate navigability. This nav-graph based formulation introduces a number of assumptions that make it a poor proxy for what a robotic agent would encounter while navigating the real world. Focusing our discussion on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), the existence and common usage of the nav-graph imply the following assumptions: Known topology.\nRather than continuous environments in which agents can move freely, agents operate on a fixed topology of traversable nodes (shown in blue in Fig. 1(a)). Aside from being a poor match to robot control, this also provides prior information about environment layout to agents – even in “unseen” test settings. For example, it is common practice to define agent actions by selecting directions in the current panorama and ‘snapping’ to the nearest adjacent nav-graph node in that direction. How an actual agent might acquire and update such a topology in new environments is an open question. Oracle navigation.\nMovement between adjacent nodes in the nav-graph is deterministic, implying the existence of an oracle navigator capable of accurately traversing multiple meters in the presence of obstacles – abstracting away the problem of visual navigation. Further, this movement between nodes is perceptually akin to teleportation – the current panorama is simply replaced by the panorama at the new location meters away. This is in contrast to the continuous stream of observations a real agent would encounter while moving. Perfect localization.\nAgents are given their precise location and heading at all times. Most works use this data to encode precise geometry between nodes in the nav-graph as part of the decision making process, e.g. moving  30°W and 1.12m forward from the previous node. Others use precise agent localization to construct spatial maps of the environment on which to reason about paths [ref]3. However, precise localization indoors is still a challenging problem. Taken together, these assumptions make current settings poor reflections of the real world both in terms of control (ignoring actuation, navigation, and localization error) and visual stimuli (lacking the poor framing and long observation-sequences agents will encounter). In essence, the problem is reduced to that of visually-guided graph search. As such, closing the loop by transferring these trained agents to physical robotic platforms has not been examined. These assumptions are often justified by invoking existing technologies as potential oracles. For example, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems can offer strong localization in appropriate conditions  . Likewise, algorithms for path planning and control can navigate short distances in the presence of obstacles   . Further, it is reasonable to suggest that issuing commands at the level of relative waypoints (in analogy to nav-graph nodes) is the proper interface between language-guided AI navigators and lower-level agent control. However, these techniques are each independently far from perfect and such an agent would need to learn the limitations of these lower-level control systems – facing consequences when proposed waypoints cannot be reached effectively. Integrative studies such as these that combine and evaluate techniques for control and mapping with learned AI agents are not possible in current nav-graph based problem settings.\nIn this work, we develop a continuous setting that enables these types of studies and take a first step towards integrating VLN agents with control via low-level actions. Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments. In this work, we focus in on the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) [ref]4 task and lift these implicit assumptions by instantiating it in continuous 3D environments rendered in a high-throughput simulator . Consequently, we call this task Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE). Agents in our task are free to navigate to any unobstructed point through a set of low-level actions (e.g. move forward 0.25m, turn-left 15 degrees) rather than teleporting between fixed nodes. This setting introduces many challenges ignored in prior work. Agents in VLN-CE face significantly longer time horizons; the average number of actions along a path in VLN-CE is ∼similar-to\\sim55 compared to the 4-6 node hops in VLN (as illustrated in Fig. 1). Moreover, the views the agent receives along the way are not well-posed by careful human operators as in the panoramas, but rather a consequence of the agent’s actions. Agents must also learn to avoid getting stuck on obstacles, something that is structurally impossible in VLN’s navigability defined nav-graph. Further, agents are not provided their location or heading while navigating. We develop agent architectures for this task and explore how popular mechanisms for VLN transfer to the VLN-CE setting. Specifically, we develop a simple sequence-to-sequence baseline architecture as well as a cross-modal attention-based model.\nWe perform a number of input-modality ablations to assess the biases and baselines in this new setting (including models without perception or instructions as suggested in ). Unlike in VLN where depth is rarely used, our analysis reveals depth to be an integral signal for learning embodied navigation – echoing similar findings in point-goal navigation tasks  . We also apply existing training augmentations    popular in VLN to our setting, finding mixed results. Overall, our best performing agent successfully navigates to the goal in approximately a third of episodes in unseen environments – taking an average of 88 actions in this long-horizon task. To further examine the relationship between the nav-graph-based VLN task and VLN-CE, we also transfer paths from agents trained in continuous environments back to the nav-graph to provide a direct comparison. We find significant gaps in performance between these settings indicative of the strong prior provided by the nav-graph. This suggests prior results in VLN may be overly optimistic in terms of progress towards instruction-following robots functioning in the wild. Contributions. To summarize our contributions, we: Lift the VLN task to continuous 3D environments – removing many unrealistic assumptions imposed by the nav-graph-based representation. The VLN-CE codebase and our baseline models are available at https://github.com/jacobkrantz/VLN-CE.\n Develop model architectures for the VLN-CE task and evaluate a suite of single-input ablations to assess the biases and baselines of the setting. \n Investigate how a number of popular techniques in VLN transfer to this more challenging long-horizon setting – identifying significant gaps in performance.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Taking a small step towards this goal, recent work has begun developing artificial agents that follow natural language navigation instructions in perceptually-rich, simulated environments [ref]4 [ref]6.
