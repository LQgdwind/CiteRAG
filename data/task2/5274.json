      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Subgrid-Scale Models with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section briefly reviews NODEs and provides the methodology for parameterizing the source term in (2).\nOur presentation focuses on three problems: the two-scale Lorenz 96 system, the linear convection-diffusion equation, and the viscous Burgers’ equation, which are utilized to approximate the coupling term and the corrective forcing terms, respectively. We also fix the neural network architecture to a configuration that has sufficient expressiveness, and we focus on the methodological aspects of the proposed strategy. NODE [ref]15 is a neural network model that uses ordinary differential equations to learn the dynamics of a stream of input-output data.\nIn NODE, the functional R𝑅R in (1) is approximated by a neural network Rθsubscript𝑅𝜃R_{\\theta} at a continuous level, Here, Rθsubscript𝑅𝜃R_{\\theta} is parameterized by network weights and biases θ𝜃\\theta, and u​(t)𝑢𝑡u(t) represents the state of NODE.\nBy integrating (3), we can evaluate the state u𝑢u at any target time T𝑇T, We let Ntsubscript𝑁𝑡N_{t} be the number of subintervals from 00 to T𝑇T.\nWith T0=0subscript𝑇00T_{0}=0 and TNt=Tsubscript𝑇subscript𝑁𝑡𝑇T_{N_{t}}=T, (4) can be written as We note that (5) has only one neural network architecture.\nNODE does not require storing intermediate network parameters between subintervals.\nThus, NODE can be more memory efficient than a traditional neural network such as ResNet [ref]16, where Ntsubscript𝑁𝑡N_{t} network architectures are needed for u​(T)𝑢𝑇u(T).\nNODE can also handle nonuniform samples by flexibly selecting any subinterval in time.\nFurthermore, backpropagation  or adjoint methods [ref]15 through the ODE solver can be used to train NODEs, allowing the neural network to modify its parameters and architecture according to the input data. This makes NODEs particularly useful for modeling time series data. While NODEs have several benefits over traditional networks, they also have limitations.\nNODEs can be computationally expensive to train for complex models with many network parameters  .\nNODEs lack robustness and uncertainty modeling capabilities .\nNODEs have no direct mechanism for incorporating data that arrives later\n[ref]26.\nTo address these issues, researchers have presented several variants of NODEs   [ref]26.\nNonetheless, we concentrate on the standard NODEs in our study as proof of concept. Let us consider a neural-network-based source term Sθ​(u)subscript𝑆𝜃𝑢S_{\\theta}(u) that approximates the source functional S​(u)𝑆𝑢S(u) in (2): The neural network architecture is composed of an input layer, three internal layers, and an output layer, as shown in Figure\n1.\nThe input state is linearly connected to the input layer. Following that,\nthe internal layers with 128128128 neurons are connected by using rectified linear unit (ReLU)  activation functions.\nThe linear output layer yields\nthe source term Sθsubscript𝑆𝜃S_{\\theta} evaluated on state u𝑢u. The corrected solution is obtained by integrating (6). We can thus evaluate the state u𝑢u at any target time (t=T𝑡𝑇t=T) by Various timestepping methods can be utilized to approximate the integral of (7). In this study, however, we focus only on s𝑠s-stage explicit Runge–Kutta (ERK) schemes with uniform timestep size.\nApplying ERK schemes to (7) yields where Ri:=R​(tn+ci​△​t,Un,i)assignsubscript𝑅𝑖𝑅subscript𝑡𝑛subscript𝑐𝑖△𝑡subscript𝑈𝑛𝑖R_{i}:=R(t_{n}+c_{i}{\\triangle t},U_{n,i});\nSθi:=Sθ​(Un,i)assignsubscript𝑆subscript𝜃𝑖subscript𝑆𝜃subscript𝑈𝑛𝑖S_{\\theta_{i}}:=S_{\\theta}(U_{n,i}); and ai​jsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗a_{ij}, bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i}, and cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} are scalar coefficients for s𝑠s-stage ERK methods. Given an initial condition u0subscript𝑢0u_{0}, the N𝑁N step ERK timestepping method generates N𝑁N discrete instances of a single trajectory, {u1,u2,⋯,uN}subscript𝑢1subscript𝑢2⋯subscript𝑢𝑁\\left\\{u_{1},u_{2},\\cdots,u_{N}\\right\\}. We denote the approximated solution u𝑢u of (6) by u^^𝑢\\hat{u} from now on.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: terms, respectively.
