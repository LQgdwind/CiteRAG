Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Select2Col: Leveraging Spatial-Temporal Importance of Semantic Information for Efficient Collaborative Perception\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRather than evaluating on popular datasets such as KITTI[ref]42 and Nuscenes, which mainly provide single-agent samples, all experiments in this article are conducted on open collaborative perception datasets OPV2V, V2XSet[ref]10 and V2V4Real.\nSpecifically, OPV2V is the first large-scale open dataset targeted at vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative perception, generated using CARLA and SUMO. On the other hand, V2XSet is an open dataset that focuses on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure collaborative perception, generated employing CARLA and OpenCDA. Consequently, these two popular datasets are inherently distinct.\nIn addition, the V2V4Real dataset which comprises collaborative perception data extracted from real-world road scenarios spans a three-day period of driving in Columbus, Ohio, covering a total driving area of 410410410 kilometers, incorporating 347347347 kilometers of highway roads and 636363 kilometers of city roads. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed Select2Col, we utilize the average accuracy (AP) at IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7. All experiments are conducted on an X86 station equipped with an Intel TM i7-11700 @2.50 GHz, 128-core CPU, 256 GB RAM, and NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU. As presented in TABLE III, the key parameters employed in our study are in line with V2VNet, V2X-Vit[ref]10, and Where2comm[ref]11. In addition, Eq. (3) is further adopted for a more realistic calculation of the transmission time, where the related parameters are consistent with the literature . Notably, we allocate equal bandwidth to each individual agent. Consequently, our setting is more precise compared to V2X-Vit[ref]10 and Where2comm[ref]11, which employ a fixed transmission rate of 272727 Mbps for all agents. Furthermore, the semantic information extraction latency tj‚Äãiextsuperscriptsubscriptùë°ùëóùëñextt_{ji}^{\\mathrm{ext}} is obtained based on our computing device. More experimental parameters can be found in our open-source code.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Rather than evaluating on popular datasets such as KITTI[ref]42 and Nuscenes, which mainly provide single-agent samples, all experiments in this article are conducted on open collaborative perception datasets OPV2V, V2XSet[ref]10 and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
