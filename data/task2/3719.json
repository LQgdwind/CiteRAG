A one-to-many seq2seq VC model was presented by .\nThe authors focused on training efficiency and stability by manually balancing the word distribution and increasing the proportion of uncommon words in the dataset.\nIn this way, the size of the training dataset could be also decreased to achieve a similar or even better performance.\nWith the implementation of an emotion encoder, the model is able to convert high-quality emotional speech. Considering the fact that it is impractical to find a large-sized parallel emotional dataset suitable for seq2seq training,  presented in their recent paper a training strategy called ‘two-stage training’, including style initialisation with a TTS dataset and emotion training. This is able to help the many-to-many EVC model improve its performance by using only a small-sized parallel emotional dataset. Finally, the last two papers focus on emotional intensity control.\nA key difference is that [ref]20 required a parallel multi-speaker emotional dataset with the help of a speaker encoder, while the most recent solution in [ref]21 only requires a small-sized parallel single-speaker emotional dataset.\nHowever, [ref]20 used a weight to control the emotional intensity by multiplying it with the emotion embedding, while [ref]21 trained the model with variations of intensity without any annotation on it (cf. Section 2.3).\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: emotional category.\nIn other words, this is a one-to-one neutral-to-emotional EVC model.  addressed a major problem plaguing both VC and EVC tasks – mispronunciation.\nInstead of text-supervision [ref]28, TTS was introduced to seq2seq EVC for guiding the linguistic information .\nFurthermore, this was the first many-to-many EVC system based on a seq2seq mechanism, which was facilitated by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
