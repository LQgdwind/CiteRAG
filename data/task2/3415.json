      "content": "Paper Title: Concept Bottleneck Model with Additional Unsupervised Concepts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor the CUB-200-2011, we used the Inception-v3 network  pretrained by the ImageNet as the intermediate network 𝒉𝒉h, as in Koh et al. . Following 𝒉𝒉h, we set 𝒄𝒄c and 𝜽𝜽\\theta. As 𝒄𝒄c, we used a fully connected (FC) layer to output Dex+Dimsubscript𝐷exsubscript𝐷imD_{\\rm{ex}}+D_{\\rm{im}} concepts. As 𝜽𝜽\\theta, we used three FC layers (2048×1024204810242048\\times 1024, 1024×51210245121024\\times 512, 512×(Dex+Dim)512subscript𝐷exsubscript𝐷im512\\times(D_{\\rm{ex}}+D_{\\rm{im}})) because 𝜽𝜽\\theta required more complex network than 𝒄𝒄c . For the first two layers of 𝜽𝜽\\theta, we used batch normalization before the activation function Mish [ref]31. As the discriminator d𝑑d, we set the three FC layers ((Dex+Dim)×512subscript𝐷exsubscript𝐷im512(D_{\\rm{ex}}+D_{\\rm{im}})\\times 512, 512×512512512512\\times 512, and 512×15121512\\times 1, the same as global deep infomax architecture in 9), and the activation of the first two layers is Mish. For the BDD-OIA, we used Faster RCNN network [ref]32 as 𝒉𝒉h, as in Xu et al. [ref]8. This network was pretrained by COCO , fine-tuned with BDD100k , and was frozen during training. Following Faster RCNN, we computed the input features for 𝒄𝒄c and 𝜽𝜽\\theta by referring to the global module [ref]8. The difference is that we flattened the output of the module and executed one FC layer with ReLU to match the input of 𝒄𝒄c and 𝜽𝜽\\theta described above. Note that the network architectures of 𝒄𝒄c, 𝜽𝜽\\theta, and d𝑑d are the same as those used on the CUB-200-2011 experiment. It should be noted that the selection of 𝒉(.)\\mbox{\\boldmath$h$}(.) is arbitrary as long as 𝒉(.)\\mbox{\\boldmath$h$}(.) is a good representation of the input due to the desiderata of SENN . Assuming that the well-known pre-trained models are satisfied with this condition, we selected the pre-trained Inception-v3 and faster RCNN for CUB200-2011 and BDD-OIA, respectively, as in  and [ref]8.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: because 𝜽𝜽\\theta required more complex network than 𝒄𝒄c .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
