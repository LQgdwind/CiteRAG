      "content": "Paper Title: Data fusion strategies for energy efficiency in buildings: Overview, challenges and novel orientations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn energy efficiency literature, there are three main application levels of data fusion, which are multi-sensor fusion, appliance features fusion and semantic data fusion. L1. Appliance level fusion One important application of data fusion strategies is related to appliance identification and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). This application provides promising insights since the power consumption of each electrical device can be inferred from the aggregated energy consumption record without the need to install a sensor for each appliance [ref]32. Therefore, this considerably reduces the implementation cost of energy saving ecosystems. In addition, different feature fusion techniques can be deployed to extract appliance fingerprints, and thereby help in improving the appliance identification accuracy. In , a non-intrusive appliance recognition method providing particular consumption footprints of each appliance is proposed. Electrical devices are recognized by the combination of different descriptors via the following steps: (a) investigating the applicability along with performance comparability of several time-domain (TD) feature extraction schemes; (b) exploring their complementary features; and (c) making use of a new design of the ensemble bagging tree (EBT) classifier. Consequently, a powerful feature extraction technique based on the fusion of TD features (FTDF) is proposed, aimed at improving the feature discrimination ability and optimizing the recognition task. In , a multi-sensor fusion technique is implemented to infer appliance-level power consumption. In this regard, appliance features extracted from various domestic devices after the event detection stage are fused before applying various unsupervised ML algorithms. The multi-sensor fusion aims mainly at correlating data gathered by energy consumption submeters, light, and acoustic sensors in order to reduce possible sensing errors. In , an NILM method is developed using the fusion of acoustic and power signatures. To that end, Pathak et al. correlate an electrical device’s inherent acoustic noise with its power usage footprints separately and in presence of other devices. Following, various classifiers are investigated to model the relation between device energy consumption and acoustic\nstates. This aids in providing an efficient appliance identification and detecting abnormal events. L2. Sensor level fusion Occupancy detection in buildings supports reducing wasted energy and personalizing comfort management. In fact, occupancy-driven management helps saving more than 15% of the total energy consumption in buildings . End-users can then be provided with appropriate energy saving recommendations based on the analysis of occupancy patterns. However, from analyzing existing occupancy detection frameworks, it is clearly seen that in order to collect real-time occupancy data in a household, data fusion of various implemented, not-necessarily-smart, yet accurate enough sensors is required. The sensor fusion aims at making the task of occupancy detection smart without the need of user intervention. In , a multi-sensor fusion technique is described to detect occupancy in household building using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This framework records ambient conditions, indoor events and power consumption patterns collected from a domestic household to gather occupancy footprints. In , a multi-sensor fusion technique is proposed, which combines multiple types of data, including sound degree, indoor temperature, CO2 level and motion patterns for estimating occupancy footprints. An infrared camera is also deployed to detect occupancy rates. To extract features, the authors deploy symmetrical uncertainty test and a genetic-based method for evaluating an optimum sensor aggregation. Further, the information fusion procedure is conducted using a neural network. In , an occupancy detection system in an office space is proposed. In this regards, a smart-door prototype has been designed through the combination of data analytic patterns and multi-sensor fusion. This helps monitoring building with a high occupancy level through managing the indoor conditions and hence reducing energy consumption, especially due to air-conditioning and heating systems. In , the status of house occupancy is inferred using a multi-sensor fusion. Specifically, spatial and temporal patterns are combined based on a fusion model. This technique resolves the issue of losing sensing values of pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors, and hence enhancing the occupancy detection. In , Woodstock et al. propose a multi-sensor fusion testbed incorporating a sparse matrix of time-of-flight range sensors and ML models for occupancy detection. Accordingly, a multi-sensor fusion is proposed using the combination of data from the matrix of 18 time-of-flight sensors and associated techniques linking sensor footprints to occupancy and activity detection. In , different ML models are used to build a household occupancy detection using environmental sensor patterns. The outcomes of those ML schemes are then fused to improve the occupancy detection accuracy. Afterwards, occupancy-patterns are used to automatically control the energy usage and thereby help saving up to 15% of wasted energy. In , an occupancy-driven control is implemented to accurately monitor occupancy data through the fusion of multi-sensor count lines. To that end, a probabilistic model is applied using occupancy constraints to accurately estimate the number of occupants.\nIn , an occupancy detection framework is implemented to improve the energy management in a domestic building. Footprints collected from six air quality sensors are used along with a set of semantic data that represent calendar entries to estimate the number of occupants in a pilot building. Recorded data are then preprocessed before extracting the features that are then fed into a set of multi-classifier models, including multilayer perceptrons (MLP), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees (DT) and random forests (RF). Following, a fusion strategy is applied on the results obtained from those classifiers to detect occupancy level. In , occupancy patterns are identified in a university campus using data fusion of three sensor modalities, including energy consumption, characteristics of (wireless fidelity) WiFi sensors and rate of water usage. After extracting the features from these modalities, a data fusion stage is applied before deploying a clustering mechanism for identifying similarity in buildings’ features and training per cluster occupancy estimation models.\nIn , a low-intrusive occupancy detection system in a typical workspace is proposed, which is built upon the fusion of data collected from each office energy consumption at aggregated and appliance levels and applications running on workers’ mobile devices. The received signal strength (RSS) of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) nodes utilized in the workspace are used to pinpoint phone devices in each office.\nIn  , to design an optimal occupancy detection model, Wang et al. combine three modalities of data, which represent ambient footprints, WiFi data and fused environmental sensing data. Three ML models are also investigated, including kNN, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs).\nIn , to detect whether a room is occupied or not, Fayed et al. propose a heterogeneous data fusion from different sensor modalities. Specifically, they use neutrosophic ensembles with the correlation of multi-sensor fingerprints. In , a remote monitoring of energy consumption in a building through heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control is achieved based on detecting occupants. Specifically, occupancy detection is realized using the fusion of ambient conditions, including temperature, humidity, light and CO2. While in , HVAC monitoring is managed using an occupancy-count estimation via the fusion of multi-sensor patterns. This framework considers data from different sensor modalities such as WiFi parameters, CO2 information, PIR motion detection values, plug and light power consumption footprints.\nIn , an information fusion framework is proposed to predict energy usage gains achieved through the heating system using a deep learning model. In practice, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used to predict heating gains using multiple categories of data from various sensors, including miscellaneous electric loads (MELs), lighting, occupancy patterns, WiFi connection counts.\nIn , data collected from different sensor modalities are fused to develop a smart energy usage system. The latter can manage energy consumption of cooling and heating systems in a reference building with respect to expected climate changes. Two fusion strategies are deployed using the correlation between errors of punctual historical patterns or prediction models and real data. Consequently, obtained features are then utilized to predict heating and cooling power requirements. In , a data fusion strategy based on Kalman filter is proposed to predict energy consumption in a typical building. The developed model is then used to monitor various electrical appliances in a realistic scenario. The fusion is performed to achieve an enhanced energy efficiency behavior using data from multiple modalities, including outdoor air temperature, lighting patterns, indoor temperature and humidity, direct solar radiation and ventilation rate. L3. Semantic level fusion Also called decision level fusion, it mainly refers to the fusion of high-level information, which are usually linked to decision generation. The data fusion step is performed to help triggering final decisions based on aggregating/combining multiple sub-decisions. In comparison to the low-level fusion, semantic fusion schemes generally produce an initial classification based on the use of various information types and hence can achieve high fusion accuracy. In , Wun at al. propose a high-level semantic data fusion scheme occurring through different sensor networks along with aggregating data within every single network.\nIn , a semantic data fusion architecture is introduced helping in aggregating, enriching, managing and querying data from various sensor modalities. A smart energy efficiency solution is then designed through extracting meaningful patterns from the sensor nodes raw data.\nIn , Fensel at al. propose the SESAME framework that is based on the fusion of ontology-based data, aiming at reducing wasted energy and describing the relation between IoT nodes and consumers within domestic buildings.\nIn , in order to surmount semantic issues in energy efficiency based heterogeneous systems, a semantic data fusion technique is developed using the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) fusion strategy. In , two semantic models are developed and fused in order to portray electricity usage and behavioral properties of end-users and further reduce energy consumption via influencing their consumption behavior. This has been achieved using personalized recommendations provided through a specific gamification application.\nIn , the contribution of ontology based approaches in helping data fusion from multiple information modalities is discussed. Specifically, a systematic scheme supporting high-level data fusion is proposed to promote a better semantic information integration and hence developing a powerful energy efficiency ecosystem.\nIn , an ontology method to model information fusion, exchange and further semantic data retrieval is proposed for a better energy management in buildings. In this regard, semantic information collected from multiple data sources and ontologies are then deployed for representing energy consumption states and describing functionalities of a developed energy efficiency system.\nIn , an energy efficiency ecosystem is implemented using an information fusion mechanism. It comprises four main steps defined as (a) collecting data from different sensor modalities, (b) representing them in a semantic space, (c) defining semantic models, and (d) applying various data fusion strategies to come with efficient and personalized energy saving measures.\nIn , high-level decisions are generated in order to reduce wasted energy on campus based on a multidimensional situational data fusion technique. The latter aims at normalizing, analyzing and predicting different information over multiple source modalities, including natural, humanistic and spatiotemporal footprints.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: promising insights since the power consumption of each electrical device can be inferred from the aggregated energy consumption record without the need to install a sensor for each appliance [ref]32.
