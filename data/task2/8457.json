      "content": "Paper Title: GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA significant number of works have attempted to build photorealistic 3D Avatars that can be animated. Most of these works use an existing animatable model, known as a 3D morphable model (3DMM) [ref]1 [ref]20. Earlier works improve the realism of a 3DMM in image space using compositing [ref]35, a CNN model  or pixel-level MLPs . Some work   improve the CNN models by adding a learnable latent texture known as a neural texture  and evaluating this with a deferred neural renderer. Other works make use of volumetric rendering, either in the form of a point-based representation , or a NeRF    . Each of these methods has shown great potential but is too slow or too prone to artifacts to provide a complete solution. Gaussian Splatting  has allowed for unprecedented photorealism and real-time capabilities in volumetric rendering.\nUnsurprisingly, this technology has been adapted for applications in the photorealistic avatar space.\nWe refer to this class of methods as Gaussian Avatars.\nMost Gaussian Avatar methods have built upon 3DMMs as a coarse representation of the geometry and Gaussian Splatting for finer geometry and appearance.\nQian et al.  do this by binding Gaussians individual triangles in the mesh. Xiang et al.  initialize Gaussians by sampling from a UV map and moving the Gaussians by barycentric interpolation of the posed meshes.\nThey add a dynamic MLP that learns to introduce wrinkles based on the 3DMM expression blend weights.\nChen et al.  learn an extension to the LBS function of FLAME [ref]20 by extending the blendshape basis to apply per Gaussian.\nXu et al. 1 model deformations and dynamics with MLPs and apply a CNN-based super-resolution network.\nGiebenhain et al.  do similar but attach the Gaussians to an implicit geometry model using cycle consistency.\nThese methods can produce photorealistic avatars with real-time rendering and impressive quality, but either train on a single camera and evaluate on the same camera or allow novel view synthesis but only within a small range and rely on multiple cameras.\nA similar method to our work is the recent Gaussian Morphable Model of Xu et al. 2, which can fit to a single input image.\nHowever, as most of the training data used is from the front half of the head, it cannot produce results in the back of the head and as a new task-specific expression basis is learned, control with an existing 3DMM is impossible.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: A significant number of works have attempted to build photorealistic 3D Avatars that can be animated.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
