      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-aware Collaborative Filtering with Pre-trained Language Model for Personalized Review-based Rating Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graph usually contains abundant relations between various entities and sees many applications in recommender systems [ref]29 [ref]30.\nBasically speaking, the users and items occurring in recommender systems can be linked to the nodes in a knowledge graph.\nThen the user-item interaction modeling could be conducted accompanied by knowledge graph representation learning.\nAs such, the rich entity and relation information contained in a knowledge graph helps to improve the precision of recommendation. Specifically, DKN , proposed for news recommendation, adopts knowledge graph embeddings methods (e.g., TransE [ref]32) to learn entity representations.\nAfterward, knowledge-aware CNN is devised to perform convolution operations on the multi-channel input composed of word embeddings, transformed entity embeddings, and transformed context embeddings.\nTo better unify the knowledge graph learning and recommendation, KTUP  uses TransH  and hyperplane-based translation for generating recommendations.\nCompared to the graph embedding methods used in the above studies, graph neural networks   model the high-order propagation among nodes and have also been found in knowledge graph-based recommendation .\nSome recent studies    try to utilize attention mechanisms or reinforcement learning for reasoning in knowledge graphs, which could provide explanations towards recommendations. However, for the personalized review-based rating prediction task, there are only a few studies   that exploit knowledge graphs.\nBut only considering user and item nodes is relatively limited.\nSometimes these graphs are regarded as bipartite graphs.\nContrary to these studies, the knowledge graph constructed in this paper contains fine-grained aspects.\nAs such, richer knowledge is promising to be distilled.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Knowledge graph usually contains abundant relations between various entities and sees many applications in recommender systems [ref]29 [ref]30.\nBasically speaking, the users and items occurring in recommender systems can be linked to the nodes in a knowledge graph.\nThen the user-item interaction modeling could be conducted\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
