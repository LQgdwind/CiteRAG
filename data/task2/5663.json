      "content": "Paper Title: The Descriptive Complexity of Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA fundamental result on the expressiveness of GNNs\n[ref]24  states that two graphs are\ndistinguishable by a GNN if and only if they are distinguishable by\nthe 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm, a simple\ncombinatorial algorithm originally introduced as a graph isomorphism\nheuristics [ref]23 . This result has had\nconsiderable impact on the subsequent development of GNNs, because it\nprovides a yardstick for the expressiveness of GNN extensions (see\n). Its generalisation to higher-order GNNs and\nhigher-dimensional WL algorithms [ref]24 even gives a\nhierarchy of increasingly more expressive formalisms against which\nsuch extensions can be compared. However, these results relating GNNs\nand their extensions to the WL algorithm only consider a restricted\nform of expressiveness, the power to distinguish two\ngraphs. Furthermore, the results are non-uniform, that is, the\ndistinguishing GNNs depend on the input graphs or at least on their\nsize, and the GNNs may be arbitrarily large and deep. Indeed, the\nGNNs from the construction in  may be exponentially\nlarge in the graphs they distinguish. Those of [ref]24\nare polynomial. Both have recently been improved by\n, mainly showing that the messages only need to\ncontain logarithmically many bits. We are not the first to study the logical expressiveness of GNNs (see\n2 for a recent survey). It\nwas proved in  that all unary queries definable in the\nguarded fragment GC of the extension C of first-order\nlogic by counting quantifiers ‚àÉ‚â•nxsuperscriptabsentùëõùë•\\exists^{\\geq n}x (‚Äúthere exist at\nleast nùëõn vertices xùë•x satisfying some formula‚Äù) are computable by a\nGNN. The logic GC is weaker than our GFO+C in that it does\nnot treat the numbers nùëõn in the quantifiers ‚àÉ‚â•nxsuperscriptabsentùëõùë•\\exists^{\\geq n}x as\nvariables, but as fixed constants. What is\ninteresting about this result, and what makes it incomparable to ours,\nis that it is a uniform result: a query definable in\nGC is computable by a single GNN across all graph\nsizes. There is a partial converse to this result, also from\n: all unary queries that are definable in first-order\nlogic and computable by a GNN are actually definable in\nGC. Note, however, that there are queries computable\nby GNNs that are not definable in first-order logic. A different approach to capturing GNNs by logic has been taken in\n[ref]9. There, the authors introduce a new logic\nMPLang  that operates directly on the reals. The logic, also\na guarded (or modal) logic, is simple and elegant and well-suited to\ntranslate GNN computations to logic. The converse translation is more\nproblematic, though. But to be fair, it is also in our case, where it requires\nfamilies of GNNs and hence non-uniformity. However, the purpose of the\nwork in [ref]9 is quite different from ours. It is our goal\nto describe GNN computations in terms of standard descriptive\ncomplexity and thus to be able to quantify the computational power of\nGNNs in the framework of classical complexity. It is the goal\nof [ref]9 to expand logical reasoning to real-number\ncomputations in a way that is well-suited to GNN computations. Of\ncourse, both are valid goals. There is another line of work that is important for us. In the 1990s,\nresearchers studied the expressiveness of feedforward neural networks\n(FNNs) and compared it to Boolean computation models such as Turing\nmachines and circuits (for example,\n8   ). Like GNNs, FNNs\nare analogue computation models operating on the reals, and this work\nis in the same spirit as ours. An FNN has fixed numbers pùëùp of inputs\nand qùëûq of outputs, and it thus computes a function from ‚Ñùpsuperscript‚Ñùùëù{\\mathbb{R}}^{p} to\n‚Ñùqsuperscript‚Ñùùëû{\\mathbb{R}}^{q}. Restricted to Boolean inputs, we can use FNNs with pùëùp\ninputs to decide subsets of {0,1}psuperscript01ùëù\\{0,1\\}^{p}, and we can use families of\nFNNs to decide languages. It was proved in  that a\nlanguage is decidable by a family of bounded-depth polynomial-weight\nFNNs using piecewise-polynomial activation functions if and only if it\nis in TC0superscriptTC0\\textsf{TC}^{0}. It may seem that our Corollary¬†1.2, at\nleast for GNNs with piecewise-linear (or even piecewise-polynomial)\nactivations, follows easily from this result. But this is not the\ncase, because when processing graphs, the inputs to the FNNs computing\nthe message and update functions of the GNN may become large through\nthe aggregation ranging over all neighbours. Also, the arguments of\n do not extend to rpl-approximable activation functions\nlike the logistic function. There has been related work\n8 that extends to a wider class of activation\nfunctions including the logistic function, using arguments based on\no-minimality. But the results go into a different direction; they\nbound the VC dimension of FNN architectures and do not relate them to\ncircuit complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: A fundamental result on the expressiveness of GNNs\n[ref]24  states that two graphs are\ndistinguishable by a GNN if and only if they are distinguishable by\nthe 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm, a simple\ncombinatorial algorithm originally\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
