The problem is that educators should discover each student’s endowment and expertise and provide sufficient conditions, said Sukhomlinsky, the renowned humanistic educator of the twentieth century. Adaptive learning, also called adaptive teaching, is an educational method employing algorithms to orchestrate interaction and provide customized resources and learning activities to stimulate and meet the needs of individual learners , which consists of multiple tasks, including modeling learning resources  [ref]3, estimating student mastery of skills  , and making personalized learning recommendations [ref]6  . The prosperity of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has made adaptive learning increasingly crucial and greatly facilitated  since MOOCs attract large-scale learners of diversified backgrounds and knowledge levels, highly demanding tailored learning and targeted guidance that traditional teaching approaches cannot satisfy. With the growing number of technical attempts [ref]3 0 [ref]6, adaptive learning in MOOCs has entered the era of deep learning. Although these deep learning methods have outperformed traditional statistical models 1, they still suffer from two main problems. On the one hand, some 2 [ref]6 only target a single task and require optimization on abundant expert-annotated task-specific data, which cannot accumulate generalization across tasks. On the other hand, emerging approaches   3 are designed with sophisticated, heavily-engineered architectures to introduce multiple educational elements like student background and knowledge structures, which can only adapt to small, coarse-grained scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to explore more rational ways of exploiting large-scale, fine-grained data throughout the learning process provided by integrated educational datasets launched in recent years, such as Tutorialbank 4 and MOOCCubeX . In the face of these predicaments, pedagogical researchers have proposed Epistemic Frame Theory 5 to unify diverse adaptive learning tasks, calling for general adaptive systems 6. Meanwhile, in computer technology, the explosion of pre-trained models in NLP, such as ELMO 7, BERT 8, GPT 9, and T5 0, has profoundly changed the paradigm of deep learning and facilitated other AI research fields, offering an attractive tool for unifying varied tasks and realizing general systems. Therefore, we try to conduct a practical exploration to apply the pre-training technique to the scenario of adaptive learning by modeling student learning behaviors. Since student behaviors in MOOCs are sparse and fragmented and contain diversified information, we hope to analyze and answer the following three critical questions: What elements in learning processes do contribute to the learning behavior modeling, and what are their roles? Is indirectly relevant information contained in unified pre-training helpful across different adaptive learning tasks?  Do the findings from pre-training confirm or supplement the current pedagogical perspectives? With the assistance of MOOCCubeX , which covers a wide range of learning resources and detailed student activities from XuetangX, the largest MOOC platform in China, we conduct a thorough learning style analysis in online learning environments. Through the analysis, we observe that watching videos is essential in MOOCs and that student learning behaviors are consistent with Felder-Silverman’s 1 non-sequential pattern but still obey underlying coherence, where the course structure, text, and knowledge background of each behavior reveal content relevance and global connections in student learning sequences. As student learning behaviors implicitly involve diversified educational elements, we propose a pre-training framework PAL for adaptive learning in place of heavily-engineered architectures to model students’ non-strictly sequential behaviors employing a bidirectional Transformer 8 as the backbone. To unify different downstream tasks and benefit them from the pre-training stage, we introduce multi-level embedding layers to exploit heterogeneous learning elements considering text, knowledge concepts, and meta-information and design a specific ‘Masked Learning Behavior Prediction’ task as the pre-training objective. Based on the pre-training foundation, we establish a series of benchmarks for various adaptive learning tasks in MOOCs to conduct comprehensive experimental exploration, including Learning Recommendation [ref]6, Learning Resource Evaluation 2, Knowledge Tracing 3, and Dropout Prediction 0. The experimental results show that the unified pre-training framework can better integrate diverse learning elements shared across downstream adaptive learning tasks, promoting effectiveness even if the information is indirectly relevant. The systematic application of resource retrieval and recommendation implemented on PAL can improve students learning outcomes aligned with pedagogy views. In summary, our contributions are as follows: ∙∙\\bullet We thoroughly explore applying pre-training to adaptive learning and propose a unified framework to model student learning behaviors considering heterogeneous learning elements, including course structures, text, and knowledge. ∙∙\\bullet We build a series of benchmarks for several adaptive learning tasks to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, and find that indirectly relevant information considered in the pre-trained base can facilitate downstream performance. ∙∙\\bullet We conduct a comprehensive survey and analysis of adaptive learning and provide an example of a systematic application to benefit the development of both pedagogy and machine learning for intelligent education.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: interaction and provide customized resources and learning activities to stimulate and meet the needs of individual learners , which consists of multiple tasks, including modeling learning resources  [ref]3, estimating student mastery of skills  , and making personalized learning recommendations [ref]6  .
