      "content": "Paper Title: Morph-SSL: Self-Supervision with Longitudinal Morphing to Predict AMD Progression from OCT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMotivation: Let {𝐈t|1≤t≤T}conditional-setsubscript𝐈𝑡1𝑡𝑇\\{\\mathbf{I}_{t}|1\\leq t\\leq T\\} represent a set of 3D OCT scans of an eye acquired over T𝑇T visits, in which 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t} is taken on the tt​hsuperscript𝑡𝑡ℎt^{th} visit. The Encoder projects each 𝐈𝐭subscript𝐈𝐭\\mathbf{I_{t}} to a feature map 𝐅tsubscript𝐅𝑡\\mathbf{F}_{t} of size 128​@​12×12×16128@121216128@12{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}12{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}16. 𝐅tsubscript𝐅𝑡\\mathbf{F}_{t} can be interpreted as 128-dimensional features for overlapping 3D image patches in 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t}, with the patch size defined by the effective receptive field of the Encoder. As AMD progresses over successive visits, 𝐅tsubscript𝐅𝑡\\mathbf{F}_{t} traces a trajectory (denoted by the violet dotted line in Fig 1 b.) that is locally linear between nearby visits 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t}, and 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k} (assuming a smooth feature manifold) but maybe non-linear over the entire AMD progression. Let 𝒯D,A(.)\\mathcal{T}_{D,A}(.) denote a transformation which morphs 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t} to look similar to 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k}, with parameters 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} and 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. As 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t} morphs into 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k} in the image space, 𝐅tsubscript𝐅𝑡\\mathbf{F}_{t} should be linearly displaced to 𝐅t+ksubscript𝐅𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{F}_{t+k} by 𝐕t=𝐅t+k−𝐅tsubscript𝐕𝑡subscript𝐅𝑡𝑘subscript𝐅𝑡\\mathbf{V}_{t}=\\mathbf{F}_{t+k}-\\mathbf{F}_{t} in the feature manifold. This observation motivates our pretext task for Morph-SSL which employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture. The Encoder projects scans from two nearby visits, 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t} and 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k} to their features 𝐅tsubscript𝐅𝑡\\mathbf{F}_{t} and 𝐅t+ksubscript𝐅𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{F}_{t+k}. The Decoder uses the displacement 𝐕tsubscript𝐕𝑡\\mathbf{V}_{t} as input to predict 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} and 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} of the morphing transformation 𝒯D,Asubscript𝒯𝐷𝐴\\mathcal{T}_{D,A}. Our pretext task ensures that the displacements in the learned feature manifold capture the corresponding appearance changes in the image space. 𝒯D,Asubscript𝒯𝐷𝐴\\mathcal{T}_{D,A} comprises a spatial deformation with the 3-channel 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} and an additive intensity transformation with the 1-channel 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}, both of the same spatial size as 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t}. Each voxel at location p→→𝑝\\vec{p} in 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t} is displaced to the location p→+𝐃​(p→)→𝑝𝐃→𝑝\\vec{p}+\\mathbf{D}(\\vec{p}), where 𝐃​(p→)𝐃→𝑝\\mathbf{D}(\\vec{p}) is a 3-dimensional displacement vector. Additionally, 𝐀​(p→)𝐀→𝑝\\mathbf{A}(\\vec{p}) captures the intensity changes at each location p→→𝑝\\vec{p}, caused by newly formed pathologies in 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k} such as fluids or drusen. Thus, the transformed image 𝐈^t=𝒯D,A​(𝐈t)=Φ​(𝐈t;𝐃)+𝐀subscript^𝐈𝑡subscript𝒯𝐷𝐴subscript𝐈𝑡Φsubscript𝐈𝑡𝐃𝐀\\mathbf{\\widehat{I}}_{t}=\\mathcal{T}_{D,A}\\left(\\mathbf{I}_{t}\\right)=\\Phi\\left(\\mathbf{I}_{t};\\mathbf{D}\\right)+\\mathbf{A}, where ΦΦ\\Phi is the spatial deformation applied in a differentiable manner similar to the registration methods in [ref]27, [ref]28 based on the Spatial Transformer Networks [ref]29. Morph-SSL framework: The details are depicted in Fig.1c. 𝐅𝐭subscript𝐅𝐭\\mathbf{F_{t}} is split into two subspaces 𝐅tDsubscriptsuperscript𝐅𝐷𝑡\\mathbf{F}^{D}_{t} and 𝐅tAsubscriptsuperscript𝐅𝐴𝑡\\mathbf{F}^{A}_{t} of 64 channels each. The Decoder has two sub-networks, Decoder-D and Decoder-A that operate on 𝐅tDsubscriptsuperscript𝐅𝐷𝑡\\mathbf{F}^{D}_{t} and 𝐅tAsubscriptsuperscript𝐅𝐴𝑡\\mathbf{F}^{A}_{t} feature maps respectively, to predict 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} and 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. A notion of semantically meaningful directions and distance is incorporated. The amount of deformation between 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t} and 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k} should be proportional to the Euclidean distance ‖V→D‖=‖F→t+kD−F→tD‖2normsubscript→𝑉𝐷subscriptnormsubscriptsuperscript→𝐹𝐷𝑡𝑘subscriptsuperscript→𝐹𝐷𝑡2||\\vec{V}_{D}||=||\\vec{F}^{D}_{t+k}-\\vec{F}^{D}_{t}||_{2}, while the nature and location of the deformation should be captured by the direction alone, represented by the unit vector V→D/‖V→D‖subscript→𝑉𝐷normsubscript→𝑉𝐷\\vec{V}_{D}/||\\vec{V}_{D}||. This property is enforced by our Decoder architecture. Only the direction information γ1.(V→D/‖V→D‖)formulae-sequencesubscript𝛾1subscript→𝑉𝐷normsubscript→𝑉𝐷\\gamma_{1}.(\\vec{V}_{D}/||\\vec{V}_{D}||) is input to Decoder-D and its output 𝐃^^𝐃\\mathbf{\\widehat{D}} is normalized and scaled to obtain 𝐃=α1.‖V→D‖.(𝐃^/‖𝐃^‖)formulae-sequence𝐃subscript𝛼1normsubscript→𝑉𝐷^𝐃norm^𝐃\\mathbf{D}=\\alpha_{1}.||\\vec{V}_{D}||.(\\mathbf{\\widehat{D}}/||\\mathbf{\\widehat{D}}||). This ensures that ‖𝐃‖=α1.‖𝐕D‖formulae-sequencenorm𝐃subscript𝛼1normsubscript𝐕𝐷||\\mathbf{D}||=\\alpha_{1}.||\\mathbf{V}_{D}||. Both γ1subscript𝛾1\\gamma_{1}, α1subscript𝛼1\\alpha_{1} are learnable parameters (positive scalar weights) employed for numerical stability during training. A similar scheme is employed to predict 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. The direction γ2.(V→A/‖V→A‖)formulae-sequencesubscript𝛾2subscript→𝑉𝐴normsubscript→𝑉𝐴\\gamma_{2}.(\\vec{V}_{A}/||\\vec{V}_{A}||) is input to Decoder-A and its output scaled to 𝐀=α2.‖V→A‖.(𝐀^/‖𝐀^‖)formulae-sequence𝐀subscript𝛼2normsubscript→𝑉𝐴^𝐀norm^𝐀\\mathbf{A}=\\alpha_{2}.||\\vec{V}_{A}||.(\\mathbf{\\widehat{A}}/||\\mathbf{\\widehat{A}}||), where γ2subscript𝛾2\\gamma_{2}, α2subscript𝛼2\\alpha_{2} are learnable positive weights (see Fig. 1 c). Loss Function: The Encoder-Decoder network is trained to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between 𝐈^tsubscript^𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{\\widehat{I}}_{t} and 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k} by comparing their voxel intensities (ℒm​s​esubscriptℒ𝑚𝑠𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{mse}) as well as their feature maps extracted with a CNN (ℒp​r​csubscriptℒ𝑝𝑟𝑐\\mathcal{L}_{prc}). ℒm​s​esubscriptℒ𝑚𝑠𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{mse} alone leads to blurred reconstructions which is remedied by using the additional perceptual loss ℒp​r​csubscriptℒ𝑝𝑟𝑐\\mathcal{L}_{prc} ,. The background noisy region is ignored while computing ℒm​s​esubscriptℒ𝑚𝑠𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{mse} and ℒp​r​csubscriptℒ𝑝𝑟𝑐\\mathcal{L}_{prc} using a binary Region of Interest (ROI) mask of the retinal tissue, 𝐑tsubscript𝐑𝑡\\mathbf{R}_{t} (for 𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t}) and 𝐑t+ksubscript𝐑𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{R}_{t+k} (for 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k}), obtained during pre-processing. Before computing the loss, the background regions are masked out through element-wise multiplication 𝐈t+k=𝐈t+k⊙𝐑t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘direct-productsubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘subscript𝐑𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k}=\\mathbf{I}_{t+k}\\odot\\mathbf{R}_{t+k} and 𝐈^t=𝐈^t⊙Φ​(𝐑t;𝐃)subscript^𝐈𝑡direct-productsubscript^𝐈𝑡Φsubscript𝐑𝑡𝐃\\mathbf{\\widehat{I}}_{t}=\\mathbf{\\widehat{I}}_{t}\\odot\\Phi(\\mathbf{R}_{t};\\mathbf{D}). The Encoder does not require the binary masks at inference time as it is only used to compute the loss. ℒm​s​esubscriptℒ𝑚𝑠𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{mse} has two terms. First, the MSE is computed with the only spatially deformed image Φ​(𝐈t;𝐃)Φsubscript𝐈𝑡𝐃\\Phi(\\mathbf{I}_{t};\\mathbf{D}). Next, 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is fitted to the residual difference left after the spatial deformation, 𝐔=𝐈t+k−Φ​(𝐈t;𝐃).d​e​t​a​c​h​()formulae-sequence𝐔subscript𝐈𝑡𝑘Φsubscript𝐈𝑡𝐃𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑐ℎ\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{I}_{t+k}-\\Phi(\\mathbf{I}_{t};\\mathbf{D}).detach(). The d​e​t​a​c​h​()𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑐ℎdetach() indicates that the gradients are not allowed to backpropagate through 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} which is computed on the fly and treated as the GT for 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}. This two step design is to ensure that 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} accounts for most of the reconstruction and avoid trivial solutions where 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} is an identity transformation (0 displacement for all voxels) while 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} tries to learn the entire difference 𝐈t+k−𝐈tsubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘subscript𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{I}_{t+k}-\\mathbf{I}_{t}. Thus, where |Ω|Ω|\\Omega| is the total number of voxels in the image and the relative weights λ1=101subscript𝜆1superscript101\\lambda_{1}=10^{1}, λ2=102subscript𝜆2superscript102\\lambda_{2}=10^{2} were set empirically. Instead of using a standard pre-trained CNN, we copy the first 3 layers of our Encoder itself to build a Comparator Network ψ𝜓\\psi which is then used for the perceptual loss, ψjsubscript𝜓𝑗\\psi_{j} denotes the output of the jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} layer of ψ𝜓\\psi. The network weights of ψ𝜓\\psi are not updated through backpropagation as it may learn to collapse the features of 𝐈t+ksubscript𝐈𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{I}_{t+k} and 𝐈^tsubscript^𝐈𝑡\\mathbf{\\widehat{I}}_{t}, even though they appear different. Inspired by BYOL , we update ψ𝜓\\psi with an exponential moving average of the Encoder weights obtained while it is being trained. Additional regularization loss terms are also incorporated to obtain an anatomically feasible 𝒯D,Asubscript𝒯𝐷𝐴\\mathcal{T}_{D,A}. 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} is encouraged to be diffeomorphic by penalizing it to be smooth with ℒs​m​tsubscriptℒ𝑠𝑚𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{smt} and prevent folding with ℒf​l​dsubscriptℒ𝑓𝑙𝑑\\mathcal{L}_{fld}. The ℒs​m​t​h=∑p∈Ω‖∇𝐃​(p→)‖22subscriptℒ𝑠𝑚𝑡ℎsubscript𝑝Ωsubscriptsuperscriptnorm∇𝐃→𝑝22\\mathcal{L}_{smth}=\\sum_{p\\in\\Omega}||\\nabla\\mathbf{D}(\\vec{p})||^{2}_{2} was defined as in [ref]27, where the spatial gradient ∇𝐃​(𝐩)∇𝐃𝐩\\nabla\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{p}) is computed at all voxel positions through discrete numerical approximation. ℒf​l​dsubscriptℒ𝑓𝑙𝑑\\mathcal{L}_{fld} as defined in [ref]28, penalizes the anatomically infeasible deformations where the retinal tissue folds onto itself.\nFinally, the sparsity of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is ensured with an L1-regularization ℒa​d​d=∑p∈Ω|𝐀​(p→)|subscriptℒ𝑎𝑑𝑑subscript𝑝Ω𝐀→𝑝\\mathcal{L}_{add}=\\sum_{p\\in\\Omega}|\\mathbf{A}(\\vec{p})|. Thus the total loss is where λ3=101subscript𝜆3superscript101\\lambda_{3}=10^{1}, λ4=10−1subscript𝜆4superscript101\\lambda_{4}=10^{-1}, λ5=106subscript𝜆5superscript106\\lambda_{5}=10^{6} and λ6=10−5subscript𝜆6superscript105\\lambda_{6}=10^{-5} are empirically fixed, based on their relative importance and also to scale the different loss terms to a similar range. The range of the ℒf​l​dsubscriptℒ𝑓𝑙𝑑\\mathcal{L}_{fld} is orders of magnitude lower than the other terms, thus requiring a significantly larger scaling weight. Network Architecture: The separable 3D Convolution Block (S3DConv) depicted in Fig. 2a. replaces 3D convolutions throughout our Encoder and Decoder Networks to reduce computation and network parameters. It employs 2D convolution filters in the three orthogonal planes. While 50%percent5050\\% of the filters are 3×3×13313{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}1 that operate on individual B-scans, the remaining are an equal number of 1×3×31331{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3 and 3×1×33133{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}1{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3 filters to capture contextual information across the neighboring B-scans. Using Layer Normalization instead of Batch Normalization allows training with a batch size of 1. The pre-activation strategy  ensures that the normalization and E​L​U𝐸𝐿𝑈ELU activations are applied after the skip connections, at the beginning of the next S3DConv block for better gradient backpropagation. The Encoder depicted in Fig. 2 c. has a series of five Basic Encoder Blocks interleaved with downsampling. The Basic Encoder Block comprises two S3DConv Blocks followed by a concatenation based skip connection (see Fig. 2 b). Here, each S3DConv has C𝐶C input and output channels by setting P=C/4𝑃𝐶4P=C/4 in Fig. 2 a. The downsampling is performed with a strided 3×3×33333{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3 depthwise-separable convolution . It applies a separate 3×3×33333{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3 convolution (with 1 input and output channel) to each of the C𝐶C input channels individually and their outputs are concatenated together. It is implemented in Pytorch by setting groups=1 in the Conv3D layer. Due to large voxel spacing across the B-scans, downsampling along this direction is only performed in the final block (violet arrow in Fig. 2 c ) with a stride of (2,2,2)222(2,2,2) to ensure a roughly isotropic receptive field. All previous downsampling layers (red arrows) use a (2,2,1)221(2,2,1) stride to only halve the height and width dimensions. The last Encoder block is followed by two parallel pathways, each consisting of two 1×1×11111{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}1{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}1, 3D convolutional layers (orange arrows) to obtain the final 64 channel 𝐅Dsuperscript𝐅𝐷\\mathbf{F}^{D} and 𝐅Asuperscript𝐅𝐴\\mathbf{F}^{A}. Decoder: \nBoth Decoder-D and Decoder-A (in Fig. 1 c.) have the same architecture as shown in Fig. 2 e., except for the number of output channels in the last 1×1×11111{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}1{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}1, convolution layer (orange arrow) to have a 1 (or 3) channel output for 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} (or 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D}). The Decoder architecture employs a series of Basic Decoder Blocks (green arrows). They map a C​@​(H,W,D)𝐶@𝐻𝑊𝐷C@(H,W,D) input feature map to a C2@(2H,2W,D.s)\\frac{C}{2}@(2H,2W,D.s) output, where s𝑠s is the upsampling factor across B-scans (s=2𝑠2s=2 in the first block, 111 otherwise). As depicted in Fig. 2 d, it comprises an upsampling layer followed by a S3DConv whose outputs are concatenated with a skip connection. The upsampling layer performs two operations. First the input of size C​@​(H,W,D)𝐶@𝐻𝑊𝐷C@(H,W,D) is upsampled to C@(2H,2W,D.s)C@(2H,2W,D.s) using trilinear interpolation. Next, a Depth-separable 3×3×33333{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3{\\mkern-2.0mu\\times\\mkern-2.0mu}3 convolution is employed, which divides the C𝐶C input channels into C4𝐶4\\frac{C}{4} groups of 444 channels each. A separate convolution filter is applied to each group to compress them to a single channel resulting in a C4@(2H,2W,D.s)\\frac{C}{4}@(2H,2W,D.s) output.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: where ΦΦ\\Phi is the spatial deformation applied in a differentiable manner similar to the registration methods in [ref]27, [ref]28 based on the Spatial Transformer Networks [ref]29.
