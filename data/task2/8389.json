The reduction from Subset Sum to Knapsack is a simple folklore result.\nEach number a𝑎a is transformed to an object (a,a)𝑎𝑎(a,a) of the same price and weight.\nThe price and weight threshold P𝑃P and W𝑊W is set to the target value M𝑀M of the Subset Sum instance.\nA number a𝑎a is in the Subset Sum solution if and only if the corresponding object (a,a)𝑎𝑎(a,a) is in the Knapsack solution.\nThen, we have f​(a)=(a,a)𝑓𝑎𝑎𝑎f(a)=(a,a) and Uon=Uoff=∅subscript𝑈onsubscript𝑈offU_{\\textit{on}}=U_{\\textit{off}}=\\emptyset. For a reduction between Subset Sum and Partition, we use basically the same reduction as Karp’s from Knapsack to Partition [ref]29.\nEach number a𝑎a is mapped to the same number a𝑎a in the Partition instance.\nFurthermore, additional numbers M+1𝑀1M+1 and ∑iai+1−Msubscript𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖1𝑀\\sum_{i}a_{i}+1-M are added.\nA number a𝑎a is in the Subset Sum solution if and only if the corresponding number a𝑎a is in the Knapsack solution.\nThen, we have f​(a)=a𝑓𝑎𝑎f(a)=a, Uon={∑iai+1−M}subscript𝑈onsubscript𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖1𝑀U_{\\textit{on}}=\\{\\sum_{i}a_{i}+1-M\\}, and Uoff={M+1}subscript𝑈off𝑀1U_{\\textit{off}}=\\{M+1\\}. The reduction from Partition to Two-Machine-Scheduling is a folklore reduction, which exploits the equivalence of the problems.\nEach number a𝑎a in the Partition instance is mapped to a job with processing time a𝑎a in the Two-Machine-Scheduling instance.\nThe threshold is set to T=12​∑iai𝑇12subscript𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖T=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}a_{i}.\nA number a𝑎a is in the Partition solution if and only if the corresponding job with processing time a𝑎a is in the Two-Machine-Scheduling solution.\nThen, we have f​(a)=a𝑓𝑎𝑎f(a)=a, Uon=Uoff=∅subscript𝑈onsubscript𝑈offU_{\\textit{on}}=U_{\\textit{off}}=\\emptyset. We extend the reduction from 3Sat to Directed Hamiltonian Path from Arora and Barak by simply adding an arc from t𝑡t to s𝑠s.\nAn arc a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A is in the solution Directed Hamiltonian Path if and only if the corresponding arc is in the Directed Hamiltonian Cycle solution.\nThen, we have f​(a)=a𝑓𝑎𝑎f(a)=a, Uon={(t,s)}subscript𝑈on𝑡𝑠U_{\\textit{on}}=\\{(t,s)\\}, and Uoff=∅subscript𝑈offU_{\\textit{off}}=\\emptyset.
