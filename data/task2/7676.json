      "content": "Paper Title: Semialgebraic Range Stabbing, Ray Shooting, and Intersection Counting in the Plane\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present our main new data structure for pseudo-lines below: Given a set ΓΓ\\Gamma of n𝑛n pseudo-lines\n444We only assume that primitive operations such as deciding whether a point is above a pseudo-line, and computing the intersection of two pseudo-lines, can be done in constant time.\n\nin ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2},\nthere is a data structure for counting the number of pseudo-lines below a query point with O∗​(n)superscript𝑂𝑛O^{*}(n) preprocessing time and space and O∗​(n)superscript𝑂𝑛O^{*}(\\sqrt{n}) query time. One approach to proving this theorem is via “spanning trees with low crossing number”  .\nChazelle and Welzl [ref]30 actually showed that such spanning trees can yield range searching data structures in a general bounded-VC-dimension setting; our problem fits their framework, and so we can\nimmediately obtain a data structure with O​(poly⁡(n))𝑂poly𝑛O(\\operatorname{poly}(n)) preprocessing time, O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\widetilde{O}(n) space, and O~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}) query time for our problem.\nWe won’t discuss this any further as it will be subsumed by our new approach which has much better preprocessing time and also has the advantage of supporting multi-level data structures (needed in our applications later). Instead, our approach is based on dualizing Matoušek’s partition theorem.\nRecall that a standard way to solve the problem of counting lines (not pseudo-lines) below a query point\nis to apply point/line duality to reduce the problem to counting points above a query line (i.e., halfplane range searching), which can then be solved using Matoušek’s partition tree.\nAgarwal and Sharir  showed that there exists a similar duality between points and pseudo-lines.\nHowever, this duality transform is only applicable when we know all the query points in advance—we can’t dualize a new query point without potentially changing the entire transform.\nNonetheless, we have found a way to\novercome this issue. We say that a point p𝑝p crosses S𝑆S if there is at least one pseudo-line in S𝑆S above p𝑝p, and at least one pseudo-line in S𝑆S below p𝑝p.\nIt turns out the right way to reformulate Matoušek’s partition theorem in the dual is the following, whose proof requires several delicate steps: Given a set ΓΓ\\Gamma of n𝑛n pseudo-lines in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} and a parameter r≤n𝑟𝑛r\\leq n, there exists a partition of ΓΓ\\Gamma into r𝑟r disjoint subsets Γ1,…,ΓrsubscriptΓ1…subscriptΓ𝑟\\Gamma_{1},\\ldots,\\Gamma_{r} each of size Θ​(n/r)Θ𝑛𝑟\\Theta(n/r), such that any point crosses at most O​(r)𝑂𝑟O(\\sqrt{r}) of these subsets.\nFurthermore, this partition can be computed in O​(n​rO​(1))𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟𝑂1O(nr^{O(1)}) time. We start with a version of Matoušek’s partition theorem, which follows directly from his original proof \n(see also the generalization in [11, Lemma 5.2]): Given a set P𝑃P of n𝑛n points in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}, a set Q𝑄Q of t𝑡t “test” pseudo-lines, and a parameter r≤n𝑟𝑛r\\leq n,\nthere exists a partition of P𝑃P into r𝑟r disjoint subsets P1,…,Prsubscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑟P_{1},\\ldots,P_{r} each of size Θ​(n/r)Θ𝑛𝑟\\Theta(n/r),\ntogether with r𝑟r (pseudo-trapezoidal) cells Δ1,…,ΔrsubscriptΔ1…subscriptΔ𝑟\\Delta_{1},\\ldots,\\Delta_{r} with Pi⊂Δisubscript𝑃𝑖subscriptΔ𝑖P_{i}\\subset\\Delta_{i}, such that any pseudo-line in Q𝑄Q\nintersects at most O​(r+log⁡t)𝑂𝑟𝑡O(\\sqrt{r}+\\log t) of the cells. Next, we state a version that does not involve the cells ΔisubscriptΔ𝑖\\Delta_{i} (this will be crucial, as it would be difficult to dualize ΔisubscriptΔ𝑖\\Delta_{i}). Say that\na pseudo-line γ𝛾\\gamma crosses a point set P𝑃P if γ𝛾\\gamma is above at least one point of P𝑃P and below\nat least one point of P𝑃P. Given a set P𝑃P of n𝑛n points in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2}, a set Q𝑄Q of t𝑡t “test” pseudo-lines, and a parameter r≤n𝑟𝑛r\\leq n,\nthere exists a partition of P𝑃P into r𝑟r disjoint subsets P1,…,Prsubscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑟P_{1},\\ldots,P_{r} each of size Θ​(n/r)Θ𝑛𝑟\\Theta(n/r),\nsuch that any pseudo-line in Q𝑄Q\ncrosses at most O​(r+log⁡t)𝑂𝑟𝑡O(\\sqrt{r}+\\log t) of the subsets. Observe that (II) follows from (I), since Pi⊂Δisubscript𝑃𝑖subscriptΔ𝑖P_{i}\\subset\\Delta_{i} implies that any pseudo-line crossing Pisubscript𝑃𝑖P_{i} must intersect ΔisubscriptΔ𝑖\\Delta_{i}. Now, we apply the point/pseudo-line duality transform by Agarwal and Sharir , which turns (II) into the following statement: Given a set ΓΓ\\Gamma of n𝑛n pseudo-lines, a set M𝑀M of t𝑡t “test” points, and a parameter r≤n𝑟𝑛r\\leq n,\nthere exists a partition of ΓΓ\\Gamma into r𝑟r disjoint subsets Γ1,…,ΓrsubscriptΓ1…subscriptΓ𝑟\\Gamma_{1},\\ldots,\\Gamma_{r} each of size Θ​(n/r)Θ𝑛𝑟\\Theta(n/r),\nsuch that any point in M𝑀M\ncrosses at most O​(r+log⁡t)𝑂𝑟𝑡O(\\sqrt{r}+\\log t) of the subsets. The construction time for the partition in (I), and thus (II), is naively bounded by O​(n​(r​t)O​(1))𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟𝑡𝑂1O(n(rt)^{O(1)})\nfrom Matoušek’s work .\nUnfortunately, the construction time for (III) is larger, since Agarwal and Sharir’s duality transform\nrequires O​((n​t)O​(1))𝑂superscript𝑛𝑡𝑂1O((nt)^{O(1)}) time to compute  (they obtained faster algorithms only under certain restricted settings). We describe a way to speed up the construction for (III).\nSay that two pseudo-lines γ𝛾\\gamma and γ′superscript𝛾′\\gamma^{\\prime} are equivalent with respect to M𝑀M if the subset of points of M𝑀M below γ𝛾\\gamma\nis identical to the subset of points of M𝑀M below γ′superscript𝛾′\\gamma^{\\prime}.\nThe problem of computing the equivalence classes of pseudo-lines with respect to a point set\nhas luckily already been addressed in a paper by Chan [24, Sections 2.1–2.2] (which studied a seemingly unrelated\nproblem: selection in totally monotone matrices).\nChan observed that the number of equivalence classes is O​(t2)𝑂superscript𝑡2O(t^{2}) (this follows either by using\nAgarwal and Sharir’s duality transform to reduce to counting cells in the dual arrangement, or by\ndirect VC dimension arguments), and he presented a simple deterministic O~​(n+t3)~𝑂𝑛superscript𝑡3\\widetilde{O}(n+t^{3})-time algorithm\nand a simple randomized O~​(n+t2)~𝑂𝑛superscript𝑡2\\widetilde{O}(n+t^{2})-time algorithm\n(by incrementally adding points of M𝑀M one by one and splitting equivalence classes using\ndynamic data structures for lower/upper envelopes of pseudo-lines). Afterwards, we can replace each pseudo-line with a representative member of its equivalence class.\nAs a result, we get a multi-set Γ′superscriptΓ′\\Gamma^{\\prime} of size n𝑛n that has only O​(t2)𝑂superscript𝑡2O(t^{2}) distinct pseudo-lines.\nWe apply Agarwal and Sharir’s duality transform to Γ′superscriptΓ′\\Gamma^{\\prime} and M𝑀M, which now takes only tO​(1)superscript𝑡𝑂1t^{O(1)} time.\nWe obtain a partition satisfying (III) for Γ′superscriptΓ′\\Gamma^{\\prime}, which is automatically a partition satisfying (III) for ΓΓ\\Gamma by the definition of equivalence.\nThe overall construction time is O​(n​(r​t)O​(1))𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟𝑡𝑂1O(n(rt)^{O(1)}). Finally, we construct an appropriate (small) test set M𝑀M to establish our theorem.\nThe idea is similar in spirit to Matoušek’s “test set lemma”  (though his lemma is not directly applicable here).\nWe first compute a (1/(c​r))1𝑐𝑟(1/(cr))-cutting of ΓΓ\\Gamma with O​(r2)𝑂superscript𝑟2O(r^{2}) cells in O​(n​rO​(1))𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟𝑂1O(nr^{O(1)}) time for a sufficiently large constant c𝑐c;\neach cell is a pseudo-trapezoid, with two vertical sides and the upper/lower sides being sub-segments\nof the given pseudo-lines.\nWe just define M𝑀M to be the set of all vertices of these cells, with t=|M|=O​(r2)𝑡𝑀𝑂superscript𝑟2t=|M|=O(r^{2}),\nand construct the partition in (III) for this test set M𝑀M in O​(n​(r​t)O​(1))=O​(n​rO​(1))𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟𝑡𝑂1𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟𝑂1O(n(rt)^{O(1)})=O(nr^{O(1)}) time. Consider an arbitrary point q∈ℝ2𝑞superscriptℝ2q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}. Let ΔΔ\\Delta be the pseudo-trapezoid cell containing q𝑞q,\nwith top-left vertex vT​Lsubscript𝑣𝑇𝐿v_{TL}, bottom-left vertex vB​Lsubscript𝑣𝐵𝐿v_{BL}, top-right vertex vT​Rsubscript𝑣𝑇𝑅v_{TR}, and\nbottom-right vertex vB​Rsubscript𝑣𝐵𝑅v_{BR}.\nConsider one subset ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}.\nSuppose that none of vT​L,vB​L,vT​R,vB​Rsubscript𝑣𝑇𝐿subscript𝑣𝐵𝐿subscript𝑣𝑇𝑅subscript𝑣𝐵𝑅v_{TL},v_{BL},v_{TR},v_{BR} crosses ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}. We prove that q𝑞q cannot cross ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}: Case 1: all pseudo-lines in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} are between vT​Lsubscript𝑣𝑇𝐿v_{TL} and vB​Lsubscript𝑣𝐵𝐿v_{BL}.\nThen all pseudo-lines in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} intersect ΔΔ\\Delta, and so |Γi|≤n/(c​r)subscriptΓ𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑟|\\Gamma_{i}|\\leq n/(cr), which is\na contradiction if we choose c𝑐c large enough (compared to the hidden constant in the Θ​(n/r)Θ𝑛𝑟\\Theta(n/r) bound). Case 2: all pseudo-lines in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} are above vT​Lsubscript𝑣𝑇𝐿v_{TL}.\nIf all pseudo-lines in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} are also below vT​Rsubscript𝑣𝑇𝑅v_{TR}, then all pseudo-lines in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} intersect ΔΔ\\Delta and\nwe again get a contradiction as in Case 1.\nThus, we may assume that all pseudo-lines in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} are above both vT​Lsubscript𝑣𝑇𝐿v_{TL} and vT​Rsubscript𝑣𝑇𝑅v_{TR}.\nBut then all pseudo-lines in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} are completely above ΔΔ\\Delta (since no pseudo-line\ncan intersect the upper side twice), and\nso q𝑞q cannot cross ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}. Case 3: all pseudo-lines in ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} are below vB​Lsubscript𝑣𝐵𝐿v_{BL}. Similar to Case 2. We conclude that the subsets ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} crossed by q𝑞q must be crossed by one of\nthe test points vT​L,vB​L,vT​R,vB​Rsubscript𝑣𝑇𝐿subscript𝑣𝐵𝐿subscript𝑣𝑇𝑅subscript𝑣𝐵𝑅v_{TL},v_{BL},v_{TR},v_{BR},\nand so there are at most O​(4⋅(r+log⁡t))=O​(r)𝑂⋅4𝑟𝑡𝑂𝑟O(4\\cdot(\\sqrt{r}+\\log t))=O(\\sqrt{r}) such subsets. We construct a partition for ΓΓ\\Gamma by Theorem 2.5.\nFor each subset ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i},\nwe store its upper and lower envelopes (which, for pseudo-lines, have O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) complexity and can be constructed in O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time, e.g., by a variant of Graham’s scan [ref]33).\nWe recursively build the data structure for each ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}. Given a query point q𝑞q,\nwe examine each subset ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}.\nIf q𝑞q is below the lower envelope of ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} (which we can check by binary search in O~​(1)~𝑂1\\widetilde{O}(1) time),\nwe ignore ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}.\nIf q𝑞q is above the upper envelope of ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i},\nwe add |Γi|subscriptΓ𝑖|\\Gamma_{i}| to the current count.\nOtherwise, q𝑞q crosses ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}, and we recursively query ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i}. Let P​(n)𝑃𝑛P(n) and Q​(n)𝑄𝑛Q(n) be the preprocessing time and query time of the data structure (space is bounded by the preprocessing time).\nThey satisfy the following recurrence relations: Setting r𝑟r to be a large enough constant,\nwe obtain P​(n)=O∗​(n)𝑃𝑛superscript𝑂𝑛P(n)=O^{*}(n) and Q​(n)=O∗​(n)𝑄𝑛superscript𝑂𝑛Q(n)=O^{*}(\\sqrt{n}). By using a segment tree [ref]33, we can easily extend Theorem 2.4 to handle pseudo-segments: Given a set ΓΓ\\Gamma of n𝑛n pseudo-segments in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2},\nthere is a data structure for counting the number of pseudo-segments below a query point with O∗​(n)superscript𝑂𝑛O^{*}(n) preprocessing time and space and O∗​(n)superscript𝑂𝑛O^{*}(\\sqrt{n}) query time.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: preprocessing time and space and O∗​(n)superscript𝑂𝑛O^{*}(\\sqrt{n}) query time. One approach to proving this theorem is via “spanning trees with low crossing number”  .\nChazelle and Welzl [ref]30 actually showed that such spanning trees can yield range searching data structures in a general bounded-VC-dimension setting; our problem fits their framework, and so we can\nimmediately\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
