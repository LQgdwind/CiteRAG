      "content": "Paper Title: Continual Learning via Inter-Task Synaptic Mapping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the continual learning domain, there exists other approaches to combat the catastrophic forgetting approach encompassing the memory-based approach and the structure-based approach. It is outlined as follows:\n\nMemory-based Approach: the catastrophic forgetting problem is solved here by utilizing external memory of past samples to be replayed such that the catastrophic forgetting problem can be overcome. iCaRL is a representative approach utilizing the external memory in addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem [ref]22. It creates exemplar sets representing each class and the classification decision is performed by checking the similarity of a sample to the most similar exemplar set. Gradient Episodic Memory  and its extension A-GEM [ref]21 are categorized as the memory-based approaches. GEM utilizes an episodic memory  storing a subset of the observed samples where the forgetting case is indicated by measuring the angle of the gradient vector and the proposed update. A-GEM modifies the loss function of GEM expediting the model update. Deep Generative Replay (DGR)  does not store previous samples to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem rather utilizes generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate pseudo-data preventing the catastrophic forgetting problem. This work is extended in [ref]1 with the knowledge distillation and feedback connection. Since the memory-based approach utilizes the experience-replay mechanism to address the catastrophic forgetting problem, it is capable of handling the single-head continual learning scenario where other approaches cannot deliver. Nevertheless, compared to regularization-based approach, the memory-based approach is computationally prohibitive. Furthermore, choosing which samples to retain remains an open question because of the dynamic learning environments.\n\nStructure-based Approach: another approach in the continual learning uses the structure-based approach where it freezes some components of a model while introducing a new component to embrace new task. Progressive Neural Network  is a pioneering work in this domain where a new column is inserted for new task while freezing the old components to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. Dynamically Expandable Networks (DEN)  is another technique in this domain where it addresses some flaws of PNN. It adopts the selective retraining approach and the splitting/duplicating strategy. Recently, the so-called learn-to-grow framework is put forward in . It adopts the neural architecture search to find a network structure that best handles each task. The underlying limitation of the structure-based approach for continual learning is seen in its high computational and memory burdens.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: to be replayed such that the catastrophic forgetting problem can be overcome. iCaRL is a representative approach utilizing the external memory in addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem [ref]22. It creates exemplar sets representing each class and the classification decision is performed by checking the similarity of a sample to the most similar exemplar set.
