      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Machine Learning-Based Ride-Hailing Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGeographical regions or grids (i.e., abstracts of individual locations) are usually used to model the road networks in the problem of ride-hailing repositioning.\nDifferent from most of the repositioning methods (e.g., [ref]53 [ref]141   ) in which the region of interest is divided into predefined and static geographic zones, Castagna et al.  [ref]152 leverage the Expectation-Maximization clustering algorithm to derive zones for rebalancing vehicles in an online manner.\nThey leverage the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO)  to train a policy for each vehicle to decide whether to make a pick-up, drop-off, or repositioning action.\nSpecifically, similar to , the repositioning destination is also sampled from a probability distribution over all potential positions, which is determined by the number of unserved requests.\nDifferent from  [ref]152, Verma et al.  propose an iterative method to dynamically split the zones based on their expected revenue (Q-values).\nThe iterative splitting process does not terminate until the historical data is exhausted for the Q-values learning.\nDifferent from most of the works that model the drivers as agents, Jin et al.  regard each geographical region as an agent.\nBy hierarchically partitioning the target areas into regions with different granularities, they perform hierarchical RL where the multi-head attention mechanism is used to capture the impacts among the neighboring agents.\nGuo et al.  try various methods (e.g., Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors regression) to predict future demand density, which is then used to evaluate each region for their spatial-temporal value.\nEach available vehicle chooses to stay still or relocate to a neighbor region in a probabilistic manner based on their spatial-temporal values, which can help avoid over-saturation of supply.\nIn , the region of interest is represented as a graph.\nThey build two neural networks to predict the demand on vertices and the passenger flows on edges, respectively.\nThe proposed repositioning algorithm aims at satisfying the demand on edges in the decreasing order with the nearest vehicles found by backward traversing. However, in spite of the various grid-based methods as discussed in most of the related works mentioned above, e.g., [ref]53 , Jiao et al.   argue that grid-based repositioning policies are not satisfactory in practice because of the excessively-simplified and overlooked non-stationarity in the environment caused by the dynamic environment and the large number of vehicles when coarse-grained region-wise decisions are considered.\nThey put forward the process of carrying out repositioning in industrial production by combining offline learning, i.e., batch RL, and online planning stages, i.e., decision-time planning 0.\nTo counter the issues of coarse-grained decisions, Kim and Kim  uses a graph to model the road networks which is more realistic.\nThey build a Graph Neural Network to predict the future demands.\nThe repositioning destination of each driver is decided greedily based on a function of the predicted demand, the number of excessive vehicles, and the distance information to each candidate position. Some other works also spend special effort on tackling the non-stationarity.\nWith the observation that the actions of drivers are independent (based on self interests), Chaudhari et al.  propose a vanilla RL framework where each driver, based on a probabilistic value denoting the extent to which coordination is needed, stochastically chooses to perform an action guided by the independent or coordinated policy.\nNote that, although vehicles execute repositioning decisions sequentially in this solution framework, coordination in the latter policy is explicitly considered by solving a minimum cost flow problem for the optimal rebalancing flow of vehicles among all the regions (which is similar to ).\nIn addition, the independence between different repositioning policies learned by the drivers concurrently also contributes to the non-stationarity of the environment.\nIn this regard, Verma et al.  propose a method for each driver to learn the information of other vehicles in order to make a better planning decision.\nThe principle of maximum entropy  is leveraged to improve the predictability of the distribution of drivers even with only limited knowledge available, e.g., the local density of supply.\nTo tackle the non-stationary challenge in online ride-hailing as well as the catastrophic forgetting of RL , Haliem et al.   propose to learn multiple repositioning policies to deal with different contexts of environments (e.g., peak/non-peak hours and weekends/weekdays).\nWhen changes in the distribution of experiences are identified by their proposed change point detection algorithm, switching among those different policies is enabled so as to enhance adaptability to the dynamic environment.\nLei et al.  define the concept of stochastic relocation matrix.\nThe element in the i𝑖i-th row and the j𝑗j-th column within the matrix represents the probability that an empty vehicle located in the i𝑖i-th region should relocate to the j𝑗j-th region.\nTo circumvent the curse of dimensionality, they leverage low-rank approximation to project the original matrix onto a low-dimensional vector.\nThey propose a deep convolution-LSTM model to learn how to predict the approximation vector based on the system status.\nTo alleviate the instability of the state-value function approximator caused by the large scale of its states, Tang et al.  propose to bound its outputs by regularizing its worst-case variation w.r.t. changes in its inputs (i.e., states).\nTransfer learning proposed in 3 is applied to increase the adaptability of the trained model across different cities. Besides the traditional ML techniques discussed above, RL, being another well-known technique for decision making in non-stationary environments, has been a key technology in distributed repositioning   .\nLiu et al.  propose a single-agent deep RL approach which relocates vacant vehicles to regions with a large demand gap in advance.\nNguyen et al.  propose to use the RL framework to train a homogeneous repositioning policy for all agents, i.e., vehicles.\nThe policy is trained in a centralized manner with collective behaviors of drivers considered while executing in a distributed manner.\nHe and Shin  leverage Double DQN with their proposed spatial-temporal capsule-based neural network as the state-action value approximator.\nThe inputs of the network proposed include the location of the vehicle to be relocated, distribution of other vehicles and riders, ride preferences, and some external factors that have impacts on supply and demand, e.g., weather conditions and holiday events.\nWith all those information processed, the estimated value for each candidate position given the current state of the target vehicle is obtained, and the final decision can be decided in a probabilistic manner.\nA more elaborate analysis is presented in their follow-up study .\nYu et al.  formulate the single-vehicle repositioning planning problem as a Markov Decision Process.\nThey propose to leverage parallelized matrix operations to re-formulate the Bellman equation 0, thus reducing the computational complexity in finding optimal planning policy.\nMulti-hop ride-hailing repositioning is considered in  .\nSimilar to , they predict the number of vehicles in each region for certain time slots ahead of time using an estimated time of arrival (ETA) model.\nDouble DQN is adopted for each vehicle to choose the best neighbor region to move forward based on the current status of all the vehicles and the predicted demand and supply.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: or grids (i.e., abstracts of individual locations) are usually used to model the road networks in the problem of ride-hailing repositioning.\nDifferent from most of the repositioning methods (e.g., [ref]53 [ref]141   ) in which the region of interest is divided into predefined and static geographic zones, Castagna et al.  [ref]152 leverage the Expectation-Maximization clustering algorithm to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
