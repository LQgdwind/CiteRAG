      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Algorithm Selection: A Proof-of-Principle Study on Differential Evolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvolutionary Computation (EC) has experienced considerable development in the past few decades . Many EC paradigms, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) , Differential Evolution (DE) , Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) , and their variants, have exhibited good performance in solving Black Box Optimization (BBO) problems, owing to their outstanding global exploration and local exploitation abilities.\nHowever, it has long been observed that for different benchmark or practical problems, when several ECs are available, no single one can dominate on all problem instances, known as the “No-Free-Lunch” (NFL) theorem . To address this issue, an intuitive idea is to leverage the performance complementarity among a group of different EC algorithms, or different configurations for a single EC algorithm, which can serve as different specialties for respective problem instance. This attracted many research efforts to investigate which algorithm or algorithm configuration could be promising\nin dealing with a particular problem instance [ref]6. We have carefully sorted out the related studies and roughly divided them into three categories: Algorithm Portfolio (AP), Algorithm Configuration (AC) and Algorithm Selection (AS). AP, also known as parallel algorithm portfolio, runs all candidates from a given algorithm set in parallel to determine the most outstanding one for tackling a given problem instance. It was first proposed by Huberman et al.  and then improved by Gomes et al.  on the necessary conditions when the parallel portfolio outperforms its component solvers. Although AP algorithms benefit from the development of parallel hardware, their huge computation requests are inevitable.  AC refers to finding a proper configuration of an algorithm in order to maximize its performance across a set of problem instances. Classical AC algorithms target an united parameter configuration for all problem instances. For example,\nAnsotegui et al.  took advantage of the iterated searching algorithms\nto search proper parameter settings in the configuration space. Recently, the AC paradigms dynamically adjusted the algorithmic settings not only for each problem instance but also at each time step during optimization. Typically, the reinforcement learning (RL) methods were adopted to learn an online policy for parameter control, such as in the studies of Xue et al. 0 and Biedenkapp et al. 1. Generally, AC provides a flexible way to configure an efficient algorithm to different problem instances. But since the configuration space of AC could be extremely large by containing infinite sets of algorithmic components, so far the configuration efficiency remains a challenge [ref]6. One way to relieve the above issue of AC is to reduce the configuration space by using expert knowledge to pre-determine a finite set of parameter and operator combinations with guaranteed performance. This is typically known as the AS, which targets at selecting the most promising expert-designed algorithm for a given problem. Existing AS on real-parameter optimization tasks, such as those proposed by Bischl et al. 2 and\nKerschke et al. [ref]6, both probed the problem with a few samplings and thereafter calculated informative landscape features. These features then served as input for a machine learning model\nthat decided which algorithm should be applied to the given problem. Nonetheless, existing AS works still face the following challenges.\nFirst, some existing studies focus on static AS that, once an algorithm is selected, it will be executed for the whole optimization process. Such methods neglect the utilization of the performance complementary among candidates to achieve comprehensively better performance than the best single algorithm in the candidate set.\nSecond, existing AS studies adopt supervised learning methods to estimate candidates’ performance based on analytical features and take the estimation results as the basis for algorithm selection.\nHowever, without modeling the optimization progress in detail, the available features for characterizing the problem landscape and/or algorithm behavior are rather limited.\n To address the above issues, this paper proposes a deep Reinforcement Learning based Dynamic Algorithm Selection (RL-DAS) framework, presenting following key contributions. We extend the AS to a Dynamic Algorithm Selection (DAS) setting that supports dynamically scheduling different algorithms upon request throughout the optimization process. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the optimization process is divided into time intervals. At each interval, an algorithm is dynamically selected to improve the population, taking into account the problem state and the performance of previously selected algorithms. This ensures that the overall optimization outcome is maximized.  Since our objective is to find the best sequential selections for different problems, we formulate the DAS as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for sequential decision making. We then leverage the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to solve the formulated MDP.\nMeanwhile, RL-DAS supports the warm start when switching between different algorithms by maintaining an algorithm context memory and applying an algorithm restoration step, ensuring a smooth switching process. Furthermore, in order to fully inform the DRL agent and guide it to make wise decisions, we design a set of simple yet representative features to capture both landscape and algorithmic properties. A deep neural network model is then carefully designed to infer the best action based on the derived features. Our designs allow RL-DAS to generalize to various BBO problems. We apply RL-DAS on the augmented CEC2021 competition benchmark, with a number of DE algorithms as candidates. The experimental results show that RL-DAS not only outperforms all candidates in the algorithm pool but also exhibits promising zero-shot generalization on unseen problems.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the preliminaries on DRL and DE. Section 3 introduces the detail of RL-DAS. Section 4 is the proof-of-principle study of applying RL-DAS on advanced DE algorithms. The experimental results are depicted in Section 5 with detailed analysis, followed by a conclusion in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: for respective problem instance.
