      "content": "Paper Title: Neural-Swarm2: Planning and Control of Heterogeneous Multirotor Swarms using Learned Interactions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe aerodynamic interaction force applied to a single UAV flying near the ground (ground effect), has been modeled analytically   .\nIn many cases, the ground effect is not considered in typical multirotor controllers and thus increases the tracking error of a multirotor when operating close to the ground.\nHowever, it is possible to use ground effect prediction in real-time to reduce the tracking error  [ref]10. The interaction between two rotor blades of a single multirotor has been studied in a lab setting to optimize the placement of rotors on the vehicle [ref]15.\nHowever, it remains an open question how this influences the flight of two or more multirotors in close proximity.\nInteractions between two multirotors can be estimated using a propeller velocity field model .\nUnfortunately, this method is hard to generalize to the multi-robot or heterogeneous case and it only considers the stationary case, which is inaccurate for real flights. The use of DNNs to learn higher-order residual dynamics or control actions is gaining attention in the areas of control and reinforcement learning settings [ref]10       .\nFor swarms, a common encoding approach is to discretize the whole space and employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which yields a permutation-invariant encoding. Another common encoding for robot swarms is a Graphic Neural Network (GNN)  . GNNs have been extended to heterogeneous graphs , but it remains an open research question how such a structure would apply to heterogeneous robot teams.\nWe extend a different architecture, which is less frequently used in robotics applications, called deep sets .\nDeep sets enable distributed computation without communication requirements.\nCompared to CNNs, our approach: i) requires less training data and computation; ii) is not restricted to a pre-determined resolution and input domain; and iii) directly supports the heterogeneous swarm.\nCompared to GNNs, we do not require any direct communication between robots.\nDeep sets have been used in robotics for homogeneous  and heterogeneous  teams.\nCompared to the latter , our heterogeneous deep set extension has a more compact encoding and we prove its representation power. For motion planning, empirical models have been used to avoid harmful interactions  7 [ref]4  8.\nTypical safe boundaries along multi-vehicle motions form ellipsoids [ref]4 or cylinders  along the motion trajectories.\nEstimating such shapes experimentally would potentially lead to many collisions and dangerous flight tests and those collision-free regions are in general conservative.\nIn contrast, we use deep learning to estimate the interaction forces accurately in heterogeneous multi-robot teams.\nThis model allows us to directly control the magnitude of the interaction forces to accurately and explicitly control the risk, removing the necessity of conservative collision shapes. We generalize and extend the results of our prior work  as follows. i) We derive heterogeneous deep sets to extend to the heterogeneous case and prove its expressiveness, which also unifies the approach with respect to single-agent residual dynamics learning (e.g., learning the ground effect for improved multirotor landing [ref]10) by regarding the environment as a special neighbor. ii) We present a novel two-stage method to use the learned interaction forces for multi-robot motion planning. iii) We explicitly compensate for the delay in motor speed commands in our position and attitude controllers, resulting in stronger experimental results for both our baseline and Neural-Swarm2. iv) Leveraging i)-iii), this paper presents a result of close-proximity flight with minimum vertical distance 24 cmtimes24cm24\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{m} (the prior work [ref]4 requires at least 60 cmtimes60cm60\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{m} as the safe distance) of a 16-robot heterogeneous team in challenging tasks (e.g., the 3-ring task in Fig. 1(b,c)). Our prior work  only demonstrated 5-robot flights in relatively simple tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: and thus increases the tracking error of a multirotor when operating close to the ground.\nHowever, it is possible to use ground effect prediction in real-time to reduce the tracking error  [ref]10.
