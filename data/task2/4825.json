Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Usually, a large number of errors need to be injected and a variety of fault configurations need to be explored to ensure steady simulation results, which can be rather time-consuming and expensive. Orthogonal to prior fault simulation approaches, we mainly investigate how the modeling proposed in this work can be utilized to accelerate the fault simulation with negligible simulation accuracy loss.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Fault simulation is a typical practice for neural network resilience analysis under hardware errors and several fault simulation tools   [ref]12 targeting at neural networks have been developed with different trade-offs between simulation accuracy and speed.
