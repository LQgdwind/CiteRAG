      "content": "Paper Title: Active learning for medical code assignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen working with text data, the first step as data mining is to convert the text into numeric vectors. As we are following the Huang\net al. ’s frameworks, we used Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) and Word2Vec with Continuous Bag-of-Words Model (CBOW) in this study. TFIDF attempts to represent the importance of words in the document . Such a method extracts words that appear often in a document. However, it is not common in the collection under analysis. TFIDF is commonly used as a feature extractor in the MIMIC database, which is followed by a machine learning technique in order to perform the coding assignment   . On the other hand, Word2Vec employs neural networks to convert words into numeric vectors keeping the semantic relationship among them 0. In the coding assignment of the MIMIC database, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are the most employed machine learning techniques. However, they were outperformed by deep learning models, such as Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrence Neural Networks (RNN). Typically, the multi-label task seems to be a binary classification problem, in which a model is created for each ICD-9 code under analysis. Then, the model will classify if the clinical note is associated or not with this particular code. Thus, in machine learning models, a model is trained for each label, while, for deep learning models, each neuron in the output layer will represent a label and provide a probability for each one. A benchmark to serve as a baseline for new approaches for this task was proposed by Huang\net al. , which we will use to evaluate the efficiency of AL in the coding assignment. They employed Logistic Regression and Random Forest, in which Logistic Regression provided the best results. Logistic regression estimates the probability of samples belonging to a class or not, a binary classification task . On the other hand, Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines the classification provided by a set of non-correlated decision trees in order to avoid overfitting and reduce the variance [ref]12. In the context of deep learning, they employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN), Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network (GRU). So, we started employing the FNN, which is also known as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), using backpropagation to update the parameter of the network  . One challenge faced by researchers is to identify the best design of the network to produce a good classification . In this aspect, Huang\net al.  employed a FNN with 333 hidden layers, having 500050005000, 500500500, and 100100100 neurons respectively, while Nigam  employed 222 hidden layers with 300300300 and 100100100 neurons respectively. In both cases, they employed ReLU as activation function in hidden layers, sigmoid function in the output layer, binary cross-entropy as the loss function, and stochastic gradient descent as the optimizer. In case of top 100100100 ICD-9 codes, Nigam  uses 100010001000 and 100010001000 neurons.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: the other hand, Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines the classification provided by a set of non-correlated decision trees in order to avoid overfitting and reduce the variance [ref]12. In the context of deep learning, they employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN), Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
