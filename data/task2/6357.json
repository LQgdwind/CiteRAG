      "content": "Paper Title: Skill-Critic: Refining Learned Skills for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success across various domains  [ref]2  .\nHowever, standard RL algorithms often lack the ability to incorporate prior structure, knowledge, or experience, which may be necessary for complex tasks  [ref]6 [ref]7 . Incorporating prior experience by learning from demonstration can facilitate efficient exploration in complex environments . For example, statistical methods can infer the hidden structure of offline data and inform the decision-making process [ref]6 [ref]7. However, offline data alone may not suffice for determining an optimal policy, particularly when the data originates from simpler environments or pertains to intricate or stochastic tasks. In such cases, online policy optimization is imperative to refine suboptimal policies. In this work, we present a hierarchical RL framework that can leverage offline data to accelerate RL training without limiting its performance by the quality of offline data. Our framework employs skills, temporally extended sequences of primitive actions 0. Previous works extract skills from unstructured data and transfer them to downstream RL tasks with a skill selection policy whose action space is the skill itself 1. Skill-Prior RL (SPiRL) [ref]6 found learning a set of skills may not be adequate to guide skill selection; rather, exploration is improved when high-level skill selection is regularized by a data-informed prior distribution known as the skill prior. In SPiRL, the skill prior informs high-level policy selection, but the low-level policy, i.e. the skill, is stationary. However, when offline data is low-coverage or low-quality, stationary low-level skills may not suffice in complicated downstream environments. Our Skill-Critic approach aims to leverage joint high-level and low-level policy optimization to critique the skills themselves during skill selection. Intuitively, agents could use their experience to improve their skill set, rather than being constrained to select skills from a stationary, offline library.\nWe show this problem can be formulated as the joint optimization of a high-level (HL) policy to select a skill and a low-level (LL) policy to select an action based on that skill. We guide HL skill selection with an offline data-informed skill prior [ref]6, and we extend this notion to initialize and regularize the LL skills using an action prior informed by offline data. Skill-Critic is reminiscent of the discrete options framework 2 3; however, the continuous skill space that is initialized and regularized by offline data adds a unique structure for guiding and stabilizing the joint policy optimization. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We formulate the joint optimization of the HL and LL policies to simultaneously select skills and improve the skill set, (2) We use an action prior to guide LL policy fine-tuning to improve a skill set learned from offline data, and (3) We show our method can improve the skill set and performance in simulated navigation tasks, and solve a new sparse reward autonomous racing task in the challenging Gran Turismo Sport environment.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success across various domains  [ref]2  .\nHowever, standard RL algorithms often lack the ability to incorporate prior structure, knowledge, or experience, which may be necessary for complex tasks  [ref]6 [ref]7 .
