      "content": "Paper Title: RouteNet-Fermi: Network Modeling with Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe use of Deep Learning (DL) for network modeling has recently attracted much interest from the networking community. The authors from  survey different techniques and discuss data-driven models that can learn from real networks. Initial attempts to implement this idea use fully-connected neural networks (e.g.,  ). Such early attempts do not generalize to different networks unseen in training, they are not tested with realistic traffic models, and they do not model QoS-aware queue scheduling configurations. More recent works propose elaborated neural networks models, like Variational Auto-encoders  or ConvNN . However, they have similar limitations. Since the introduction of Graph Neural Networks [ref]37, they have already been applied to different fields such as chemistry  or logistics . In the field of computer networks, early pioneering works leverage GNNs [ref]58 . However, they use a basic GNN architecture that considers a simplified model of the network, ignoring traffic models, queuing policies, and the critical property of generalizing to larger networks. More recent works leverage GNNs to model complex characteristics of computer networks. For example, xNet  learns the state transition function between time steps and rolls it out to obtain the complete fine-grained prediction trajectory, but it does not take into account scaling to larger networks. Others focus on data center networks to predict the Flow Completion Time . Finally, state-of-the-art simulators MimicNet  and DeepQueueNet  leverage DL models (LSTMs and transformers, respectively) to accelerate parts of the simulation process, with a focus on per-packet delay prediction, as opposed to our per-path average delay prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: More recent works propose elaborated neural networks models, like Variational Auto-encoders  or ConvNN .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
