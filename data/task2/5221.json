      "content": "Paper Title: Curiosity creates Diversity in Policy Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPopulation-based algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms [ref]25 simulate natural selection over a population of individuals in order to maximize an objective (fitness) function, usually resulting in a set of optimal solutions.\nHowever, natural evolution diverges, creating and maintaining a wide variety of solutions for different problems.\nNovelty Search  and other Quality Diversity algorithms  use a behavior characterisation for each generated individual in order to maintain behavioral diversity.\nBehaviors are characterized by a function bùëèb that takes in the individual parameter vector (genome) Œ∏isubscriptùúÉùëñ\\theta_{i} and output its corresponding behavior bŒ∏isubscriptùëèsubscriptùúÉùëñb_{\\theta_{i}}, often based on the trajectory taken in an environment. The distance between the behavior of individuals is used to bias search towards exploration into new parts of the behavior space. Quality Diversity algorithms have been demonstrated on a number of domains, such as robotic control , urban design [ref]20, and chair and lamp design . In these methods, behavior can be used to calculate an intrinsic fitness based on distance to existing individuals, as in NS-ES [ref]9, or to store individuals with a diversity of behaviors, as in MAP-Elites . The use of behavioral diversity as a search mechanism has made them especially suited for reward-sparse environments such as the Atari games Pitfall and Montezuma‚Äôs revenge . Novelty Search in particular has often been studied using robotic locomotion or maze navigation tasks   [ref]9, where the final state of an agent is used as the behavior descriptor. Searching for diversity in the final state of the agent therefore brings it to different states, some of which may be finally rewarding. QD algorithms aim to optimize both exploration and an extrinsic fitness, often the sum of reward of a policy. As shown in the next section, NS-ES [ref]9 does so using a weighted sum from an exploration fitness term and an objective fitness term, as we do in Curiosity-ES. MAP-Elites  and Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC)  balance quality and diversity by simulating competition, based on extrinsic fitness, between policies that have similar behavior. Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elite (CMAME) , which is based on MAP-Elites, balances exploration and exploitation in the same was as MAP-Elites, but uses an ES for policy optimization. The design of a useful behavior descriptor can often be a limiting factor for the use of QD algorithms. Recent methods such as AURORA   and TAXONS  propose the use of a neural network to learn a behavior descriptor throughout evolution. Similarly, we propose the use of a neural network to calculate Curiosity throughout evolution, however we do not rely on a behavior descriptor to calculate Novelty or behavioral diversity but rather directly compute an intrinsic fitness using Curiosity.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Population-based algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms [ref]25 simulate natural selection over a population of individuals in order to maximize an objective (fitness) function, usually resulting in a set of optimal solutions.\nHowever, natural evolution\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
