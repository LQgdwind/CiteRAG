      "content": "Paper Title: Nerfbusters: Removing Ghostly Artifacts from Casually Captured NeRFs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvaluating NeRFs in-the-wild. Early works in neural rendering , including NeRF [ref]20, established an evaluation protocol for novel view synthesis, where every 8th frame from a camera trajectory is used for evaluation. Most follow-up works have adapted this protocol and demonstrated impressive results on forward-facing scenes in LLFF , synthetic scenes [ref]20, or 360 scenes [ref]2 . In these datasets, the training and evaluation views share camera trajectories, thus the methods are evaluated only for small viewpoint changes, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In contrast, we propose to record two camera trajectories, one for training and one for evaluation. Appendix B compares existing datasets (synthetic scenes [ref]20, LLFF , MipNeRF 360 [ref]2, and Phototourism ) with the proposed Nerfbusters dataset. We visualize the training and evaluation poses for each scene and quantify the difficulty of each dataset by computing the average rotation and translation difference between evaluation images and their closest training images. We find that viewpoint changes are very limited, and the proposed Nerfbusters dataset is much more challenging. Recently, Gao et al.  revisited the evaluation process for dynamic NeRFs, also highlighting shortcomings in dynamic NeRF evaluation. NeRFs for extreme viewpoint changes and few-shot reconstruction have been explored on ShapeNet , DTU , and CO3D , where a few or just a single view is available during training. These works focus on the generalization and hallucination of unseen regions, and either assume a category-specific prior 5 3 or focus on simple scenes 3. In contrast, our casual captures setting assumes that a 10−20102010-20 second video is available at training time, better reflecting how people capture NeRFs. We then evaluate fly-throughs with extreme novel views on an entirely different video sequence, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Diffusion models for 3D. Recently, several works have proposed the use of diffusion models for 3D generation or manipulation [ref]27   1. These approaches can be divided into (1) methods that distill priors from existing 2D text-to-image diffusion models into a consistent 3D representation [ref]27 , and (2) methods that train a diffusion model to explicitly model 3D objects or scenes . These directions are complementary, where the former benefits from the sheer size of image datasets, and the latter from directly modeling 3D consistency. DreamFusion [ref]27 proposes Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), where the text-guided priors from a large text-to-image diffusion model can be used to estimate the gradient direction in optimization of a 3D scene.\nWe take inspiration from the SDS optimization procedure but instead adapt it to supervise NeRF densities in an unconditional manner, directly on 3D density values. As the underlying model, we train a 3D diffusion model on local 3D cubes extracted from ShapeNet  objects.\nWe find the distribution of geometry (surfaces) within local cubes is significantly simpler than 2D natural images or global 3D objects, reducing the need for conditioning and high guidance weights.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to suggest a learned 3D prior for category-agnostic, unbounded NeRFs. Data-driven local 3D priors. Approaches for learning 3D geometry can be divided into local and global approaches, where global approaches reason about the entire scene, and local approaches decompose the scene into local surface patches. We learn a prior over local geometric structures, as local structures are simple, category-agnostic, and more repeatable than global structures  . DeepLS  proposes to decompose a DeepSDF  into local shapes, and finds that this simplifies the prior distribution that the network learns. Similarly, AutoSDF  learns a local 3D prior and tries to learn the distribution over a 3D scene with an autoregressive transformer. We are inspired by their approach, but use a diffusion model rather than a VQ-VAE  6, and show that the learned prior can be used to regularize NeRF geometry. Regularizers in NeRFs. Our work can be seen as a regularizer for NeRFs. Most existing regularizers are hand-crafted priors that encourage smoothness and discourage non-empty space. Plenoxels  proposed a Total-Variation (TV) regularizer in 3D that penalizes the large changes between neighboring voxels. TV has also been applied in 2D rendered images in RegNeRF  and on the basis of factorized plenoptic fields  . Plenoctrees 2 proposed a sparsity loss that penalizes densities from randomly queried 3D locations in space. This sparsity loss removes densities unnecessary in explaining the training views. To avoid penalizing all densities equally, MIP-NeRF 360 [ref]2 proposes a distortion loss\non accumulated weights that encourages surfaces to be sharp. Concurrent and most similar to our work, DiffusionRF 1 proposes a data-driven RGB-D diffusion prior. The method trains a diffusion model on synthetic RGB-D examples and uses the learned prior to regularize a NeRF. In contrast to the proposed local 3D diffusion prior, operating in 2.5D comes with several disadvantages, namely 1) occlusions are not modeled, 2) the joint distribution of RGB-D images is more complex than that of 3D occupancy (and as a result requires more data for generalization), 3) and unlike a 3D diffusion model, it is not by definition 3D-consistent, i.e., the view consistency has to come from the NeRF rather than the regularizer.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Evaluating NeRFs in-the-wild.
