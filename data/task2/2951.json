      "content": "Paper Title: Differentiable NAS Framework and Application to Ads CTR Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCTR prediction systems have historically evolved to leverage the technologies, computational power, and data available at any given time. Early collaborative-filtering based methods , as well as those based on factorization machines [ref]33, have evolved into more complex deep learning based methods due to such methods’ ability to handle larger and more complex datasets. Most CTR prediction systems today rely on two kinds of input features: dense and sparse (or categorical). The former are simply real-valued inputs. The latter typically represents a category instance (eg., the item being ranked, an attribute of interaction). Such categorical features are passed through an embedding table, which maps each category to a vector of real values, with the resulting embedding vectors being passed to the rest of the model. Note that such sparse features can easily have millions or billions of categories. The metrics used to make decisions concerning the implementations of CTR prediction systems are typically those focused on service revenue and user experience, such as revenue per impression and actual CTR [ref]7. For our purposes, however, we consider the CTR prediction objective to be logloss, or binary cross-entropy loss, which can be defined for a vector of predictions p∈(0,1)n𝑝superscript01𝑛p\\in(0,1)^{n} and a vector of binary labels y∈{0,1}n𝑦superscript01𝑛y\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} as: It is important to note that, in contrast to other fields such as computer vision where tradeoffs of many percentage points of accuracy for efficiency gains can be leveraged , recommender systems have the strictest accuracy requirements. A logloss difference of just 0.001 is practically significant [ref]22. This has influenced the direction of research in the field, which has focused on improving accuracy through new architectural elements designed to leverage certain types of data. We now examine some of the architectural innovations in this area. The Deep & Cross Network [ref]22 used a parallel deep network (consisting of fully connected or FC layers) and cross network (consisting of novel cross layers) to better model feature interactions. After concatenating the dense features and all embedding vectors into a single vector x𝑥x, we pass this through both networks, concatenate their outputs, and pass that to a fully-connected (FC) layer. A sigmoid function is used to generate the final click probability. The cross layer, as the name suggests, models cross features through use of an outer product: C​r​o​s​s​L​a​y​e​r​(x)=x​xT​w+b+x𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑥𝑥superscript𝑥𝑇𝑤𝑏𝑥CrossLayer(x)=xx^{T}w+b+x where x,w,b∈ℛd𝑥𝑤𝑏superscriptℛ𝑑x,w,b\\in\\mathcal{R}^{d} and w𝑤w and b𝑏b are weight and bias parameters for the layer respectively. The Deep Learning Recommendation Model , which will be covered in more detail in section VI-B, directly leverages pairwise dot products as in a factorization machine [ref]33, but then passes these through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). It uses a “bottom MLP” to directly process dense feature inputs, and uses a “feature interactions layer” to take pairwise products between embeddings. This is then concatenated with the bottom MLP’s output and fed to a top MLP, which outputs a click probability. Note that the DLRM can also use a concatenation-based feature interactions layer. The Multi-channel user Interest Memory Network (MIMN)  focuses specifically on modeling user history information to improve predictive performance. It focuses on designing specific mechanisms to allow for the retention of user history which can then be used to inform the “user interest representation.” The authors also focus on the inference time efficiency of their model for user history sequences of up to a length of 150.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: evolved to leverage the technologies, computational power, and data available at any given time.
