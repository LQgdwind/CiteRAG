      "content": "Paper Title: Reformulating Regression Test Suite Optimization using Quantum Annealing - an Empirical Study\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section discusses all aspects that could threaten the validity of the study conducted about the comparisons between SelectQA, DIV-GA, additional greedy, and BootQA. Construct Validity. The main threat in this regard concerns the correctness of the measures used to select tests: coverage, history of failures, cost of execution, and failure rate. We relied on open-source profiling and compilation tools (e.g., GNU gcc and gcov) and real-world case studies to limit this issue.\nDIV-GA has been implemented in MATLAB, while additional greedy and SelectQA have been implemented in Python. This difference could threaten validity due to the different code optimization mechanisms used by the two languages and the routines applied by the MATLAB environment to solve mathematical optimization problems. However, we performed this choice to replicate the DIV-GA base conditions and environment as presented in¬†.\nThe choice of efficiency metric constitutes another threat to construct validity. We have chosen the total run time to compare SelectQA with the traditional and quantum algorithms. Such a metric provides a straightforward measure of how long the examined strategies take to solve the requested problem; however, this choice poses some significant challenges. The SelectQA total run time not only considers the time used by CPUs, like for its classic counterparts, but also the execution time of the Advantage QPU; hence, the total run time reported by SelectQA could be subject to considerable variability depending on QPU availability, resource queues, and classical-quantum communication overhead. In other words, the total run time of SelectQA could be subject to different bottlenecks due to various causes. Internal Validity.\nOne of these threats is undoubtedly the random nature of quantum annealing algorithms.\nFor this reason, the experiments were repeated ten times for each program under examination and then considering the means of the obtained results.\nThe tuning of the PùëÉP penalty parameter is also a factor that could undermine the internal validity of this job. Therefore, we applied a method well-known in literature¬† when choosing this value.\nThe Œ±ùõº\\alpha parameter has been validated following repeated trials.\nWe used the D-Wave default settings for other QA hyper-parameters configurations coherently with the original BootQA paper¬†[ref]18 and also asked the researchers themselves who worked on it about the parameters‚Äô tuning.\nAnother threat to internal validity concerns the implementation of DIV-GA. The original version used the MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox release R2011b, while the version used for this work is the MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox release R2024a. So, the new version of DIV-GA could be subject to differences compared to its older version due to updated routines and different code optimization mechanisms.\nAlso, the difference between the languages used to implement DIV-GA, additional greedy, and SelectQA could be seen as a threat to the internal validity due to the aforementioned fluctuations. This threat has been mitigated by executing different runs for each algorithm using the same datasets.\nFinally, another threat to internal validity is that using other sampling strategies for the (m,n)ùëöùëõ{(m,n)} parameters of BootQA might result in better solutions. Our choice was to replicate the experiment conditions of the original BootQA work¬†[ref]18, so we did not experiment with different sampling strategies. External Validity.\nA dangerous threat to external validity corresponds to the impossibility of generalizing the obtained results, which is particularly true if the datasets are too small or distant from real-world scenarios. To mitigate this issue, the datasets chosen for the comparisons, extracted from reliable sources such as SIR, Google, and ABB Robotics Norway, have already been used for evaluating the approaches used as baselines in our study¬†¬†¬†¬†[ref]18¬†. The chosen SIR programs represent real-world medium-scale and small-scale scenarios. On the other hand, the datasets used to compare SelectQA and BootQA represent real-world industrial medium-scale and small-scale datasets. Conclusion Validity.\nWe interpreted the findings using appropriate statistical tests. To test the significance of the differences, we applied the (i) Mann-Whitney U test¬†1, while to estimate the magnitude and the effect size of the observed differences, we used the Vargha-Delaney¬†1 (√Ç12) effect size. Conclusions are based only on statistically significant results.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: value.\nThe Œ±ùõº\\alpha parameter has been validated following repeated trials.\nWe used the D-Wave default settings for other QA hyper-parameters configurations coherently with the original BootQA paper¬†[ref]18 and also asked the researchers themselves who worked on it about the parameters‚Äô tuning.\nAnother threat to internal validity concerns the implementation of DIV-GA.
