      "content": "Paper Title: SynthVSR: Scaling Up Visual Speech Recognition With Synthetic Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Speech Recognition.\nVSR has achieved remarkable progress with the success of deep learning and the availability of audio-visual datasets such as LRS2 [ref]1 and LRS3 . Progress was driven by adapting ASR approaches such as sequence-to-sequence models  and the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)   training objective. Recent studies have achieved noticeable results in VSR by using Transformer-based architecture [ref]1, a convolutional variant 3, Conformer-based models , and an attention-based feature pooling method . The recent advances in VSR models are mainly dependent on leveraging increasingly large-scale transcribed non-public video datasets such as LSVSR (3,800 hours)  and YT31k (31,000 hours) 8. Some recent works   use 90,000 hours of non-publicly machine-transcribed video data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Another popular trend is to leverage unlabeled audio-visual datasets such as AVSpeech  and VoxCeleb2  with semi- or self-supervised learning. Using pre-trained ASR models to transcribe audio streams in unlabeled audio-visual datasets i.e., pseudo-labeling has demonstrated great potential to improve VSR performance. Such pseudo-labeled video data can be used for supervised training 8 or knowledge distillation . Self-supervised approaches such as contrastive learning 2 9  and cross-modal feature prediction 6 have achieved significant improvement by exploiting unlabeled audio-visual data. AV-HuBERT  is the state-of-the-art self-supervised method that predicts iteratively refined cluster assignments\nfrom masked audio-visual streams and achieves impressive VSR performance, especially when only limited labeled video data is available (e.g., 30 hours). Speech-Driven Facial Animation. Speech-driven facial animation aims to produce a talking face video conditioned on speech content.\nWith the advances in deep visual generative models, speech-driven facial animation has significantly improved over the past years. Speech2Vid  is the first end-to-end neural network-based method for speech-driven facial animation. This method is optimized towards a pixel-level L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} reconstruction loss which results in blurry generated frames. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made impressive progress  0 in facial animation, as they are able to generate sharp and highly textured facial frames. Initially, most of these methods synthesized frontal faces and focused on improving lip-sync  0, preserving the identity of the target speaker 4. As the generation of synthetic frontal faces improved, researchers began to focus on generating talking heads that could handle natural head movements5 . Learning from Synthetic Supervision.\nTraining with synthetic data has attracted increasing research attention in recent years. Synthetic data could offer improved data diversity [ref]13, which is useful in many tasks where labeled data is limited, such as image classification , objection detection 4 6, semantic segmentation  1, human pose estimation [ref]13, and ASR  1. Unlike previous work, we focus on a new multimodal problem: how to produce and leverage synthetic video data for improving VSR.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Visual Speech Recognition.\nVSR has achieved remarkable progress with the success of deep learning and the availability of audio-visual datasets such as LRS2 [ref]1 and LRS3 .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
