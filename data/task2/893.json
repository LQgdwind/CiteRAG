      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Local and Global Descriptors in Parallel to Search Correspondences for Visual Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt first, let’s look at behavior of the direct random tree method [ref]11 while with our CRBNet and new probability model. This method is denoted as RT_AP+CRBNet. Please notice that RT_AP+CRBNet is a pure direct method at the moment and just uses the supervised information of local descriptors to select nearest neighbor candidates of a given query local feature.\nWe use 6 random trees with depth of 23 and check top 100 leaf nodes in the priority search strategy. The long-term visual localization RobotCar Seasons dataset and Aachen Day-Night dataset  are used in this section. The former dataset, including 20,862 reference images, 6.77M 3D points and 11,934 query images, is based on a subset of the Oxford RobotCar dataset . Some images are also badly blurry because of motion which adds extra difficulties for accurate visual localization.\nThe latter dataset, containing 4,328 reference images and 1.65M 3D points, is based on the Aachen localization dataset from .\nIn query image sets, 824 images are collected during daytime while the other 98 images are collected during nighttime.\nThe query images are captured by different types of cameras which makes it more difficult to localize.\nWe report the pose recall at different position and orientation thresholds for query images. The thresholds are the same as . We compare RT_AP+CRBNet with Active Search (AS) , City-Scale Localization (CSL) , DenseVLAD , NetVLAD , FAB-MAP  and Hierarchical Localization (NV+SP) . The first two are direct methods, the following three are indirect methods, and the last one is serial indirect-direct method.\nAS searches matches not only from the direction of 2D-to-3D but also 3D-to-2D direction which allows to find more matches. CSL exploits ancillary gravitational information to help handle outliers. RT_AP+CRBNet searches 2D-3D matches from 2D-to-3D direction and uses no additional information. NV+SP firstly uses NetVLAD to retrieve the top-k database images which are most similar to the given query image and then uses SuperPoint to search the nearest neighbor of the given query local feature among 3D points which can be seen by these retrieved images. All the results on RobotCar Seasons dataset are shown in Table 2 except for the last line. We see that RT_AP+CRBNet has already performed better than all others except for NV+SP. Compared with NV+SP, there are 13 items, including ”dawn”, ”dusk”, ”rain”, that RT_AP+CRBNet performs better, but in other 13 items, including ”night” and ”night-rain”, NV+SP is better. So the performance of RT_AP+CRBNet is on par with NV+SP. RT_AP+CRBNet just uses the supervised information of local descriptors to cluster 3D points and get nearest neighbor candidates of a given query local feature. Later, we will see if we use local and global information simultaneously to cluster 3D points and get nearest neighbor candidates of a given query local feature in the proposed parallel search framework, the performance is improved greatly as shown in the last line of Table 2. The localization results on Aachen Day-Night dataset are shown in the first seven lines of Table 3, from which we can draw similar conclusions. More accurate results by our method of the parallel search framework will be given in the following section.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: At first, let’s look at behavior of the direct random tree method [ref]11 while with our CRBNet and new probability model.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
