Specifically, we consider the problem of reconstructing a sequence of signals 𝐬t∈ℝn0subscript𝐬𝑡superscriptℝsubscript𝑛0\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{0}}, t=1,2,…,T𝑡12…𝑇t=1,2,\\dots,T, from low-dimensional measurements 𝐱t=𝐀𝐬tsubscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐀𝐬𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{t}={\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t}, where 𝐀∈ℝn×n0​(n≪n0)𝐀superscriptℝ𝑛subscript𝑛0much-less-than𝑛subscript𝑛0{\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n_{0}}~{}(n\\ll n_{0}) is a sensing matrix. We assume that 𝐬tsubscript𝐬𝑡\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t} has a sparse representation 𝐡t∈ℝhsubscript𝐡𝑡superscriptℝℎ{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h} in a dictionary 𝐃∈ℝn0×h𝐃superscriptℝsubscript𝑛0ℎ{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{0}\\times h}, that is, 𝐬t=𝐃𝐡tsubscript𝐬𝑡subscript𝐃𝐡𝑡\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t}={\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}. At each time step t𝑡t, the signal 𝐬tsubscript𝐬𝑡\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t} can be independently reconstructed using the measurements 𝐱tsubscript𝐱𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{t} by solving : where ∥⋅∥p\\|\\cdot\\|_{p} is the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-norm and λ𝜆\\lambda is a regularization parameter.

Under the assumption that sequential signal instances are correlated, we consider the following sequential signal reconstruction problem: where λ1,λ2>0subscript𝜆1subscript𝜆20\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2}>0 are regularization parameters and R​(𝐡t,𝐡t−1)𝑅subscript𝐡𝑡subscript𝐡𝑡1R({\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t},{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1}) is an added regularization term that expresses the similarity of the representations 𝐡tsubscript𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t} and 𝐡t−1subscript𝐡𝑡1{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1} of two consecutive signals.  proposed an RNN design (coined Sista-RNN) by unfolding the sequential version of ISTA. That study assumed that two consecutive signals are close in the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm sense, formally, R​(𝐡t,𝐡t−1)=12​‖𝐃𝐡t−𝐅𝐃𝐡t−1‖22𝑅subscript𝐡𝑡subscript𝐡𝑡112superscriptsubscriptnormsubscript𝐃𝐡𝑡subscript𝐅𝐃𝐡𝑡122R({\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t},{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1})=\\frac{1}{2}\\|{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}-{\\bm{\\mathrm{F}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1}\\|_{2}^{2}, where 𝐅∈ℝn0×n0𝐅superscriptℝsubscript𝑛0subscript𝑛0{\\bm{\\mathrm{F}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{0}\\times n_{0}} is a correlation matrix between 𝐬tsubscript𝐬𝑡\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t} and 𝐬t−1subscript𝐬𝑡1\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}_{t-1}. More recently, the study by  designed the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-RNN, which stems from unfolding an algorithm that solves the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization problem  [ref]6. This is a version of Problem (2) with R​(𝐡t,𝐡t−1)=‖𝐡t−𝐆𝐡t−1‖1𝑅subscript𝐡𝑡subscript𝐡𝑡1subscriptnormsubscript𝐡𝑡subscript𝐆𝐡𝑡11R({\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t},{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1})=\\|{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}-{\\bm{\\mathrm{G}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1}\\|_{1}, where 𝐆∈ℝh×h𝐆superscriptℝℎℎ{\\bm{\\mathrm{G}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h\\times h} is an affine transformation that promotes the correlation between 𝐡tsubscript𝐡𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t} and 𝐡t−1subscript𝐡𝑡1{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t-1}. Both studies   have shown that carefully-designed deep RNN models outperform the generic RNN model and ISTA  in the task of sequential frame reconstruction. Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in solving 1 for individual signals, both in terms of accuracy and inference speed . However, these models are often criticized for their lack of interpretability and theoretical guarantees . Motivated by this, several studies focus on designing DNNs that incorporate domain knowledge, namely, signal priors. These include deep unfolding methods which design neural networks to learn approximations of iterative optimization algorithms. Examples of this approach are LISTA  and its variants, including ADMM-Net 0, AMP 1, and an unfolded version of the iterative hard thresholding algorithm 2. LISTA \nunrolls the iterations of ISTA into a feed-forward neural\nnetwork with weights, where each\nlayer implements an iteration:\n𝐡t(l)=ϕγ(l)​(𝐖(l)​𝐡t(l−1)+𝐔(l)​𝐱t),superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑡𝑙subscriptitalic-ϕsuperscript𝛾𝑙superscript𝐖𝑙superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑡𝑙1superscript𝐔𝑙subscript𝐱𝑡{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(l)}=\\phi_{\\gamma^{(l)}}({\\bm{\\mathrm{W}}}^{(l)}{\\bm{\\mathrm{h}}}_{t}^{(l-1)}+{\\bm{\\mathrm{U}}}^{(l)}{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{t}),\nwith 𝐖(l)=𝐈−1c​𝐃T​𝐀T​𝐀𝐃superscript𝐖𝑙𝐈1𝑐superscript𝐃Tsuperscript𝐀T𝐀𝐃{\\bm{\\mathrm{W}}}^{(l)}=\\mathbf{I}-\\frac{1}{c}{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}^{\\mathrm{T}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}^{\\mathrm{T}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}, 𝐔(l)=1c​𝐃T​𝐀Tsuperscript𝐔𝑙1𝑐superscript𝐃Tsuperscript𝐀T{\\bm{\\mathrm{U}}}^{(l)}=\\frac{1}{c}{\\bm{\\mathrm{D}}}^{\\mathrm{T}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{A}}}^{\\mathrm{T}}, and γ(l)superscript𝛾𝑙\\gamma^{(l)} being learned\nfrom data. It has been shown  3 that a d𝑑d-layer LISTA network with trainable parameters 𝜣={𝐖(l),𝐔(l),γ(l)}l=1d𝜣superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝐖𝑙superscript𝐔𝑙superscript𝛾𝑙𝑙1𝑑{\\bm{\\mathrm{\\varTheta}}}=\\{{\\bm{\\mathrm{W}}}^{(l)},{\\bm{\\mathrm{U}}}^{(l)},\\gamma^{(l)}\\}_{l=1}^{d} achieves the same performance as the original ISTA but with much fewer iterations (i.e., number of layers). Recent studies 4 5 have found that exploiting dependencies between 𝐖(l)superscript𝐖𝑙{\\bm{\\mathrm{W}}}^{(l)} and 𝐔(l)superscript𝐔𝑙{\\bm{\\mathrm{U}}}^{(l)} leads to reducing the number of trainable parameters while retaining the performance of LISTA. These works provided theoretical insights to the convergence conditions of LISTA. However, the problem of designing deep unfolding methods for dealing with sequential signals is significantly less explored. In this work, we will consider a deep RNN for solving Problem 2 that outputs a sequence, 𝐬^1,…,𝐬^Tsubscript^𝐬1…subscript^𝐬𝑇\\hat{\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}}_{1},\\dots,\\hat{\\bm{\\mathrm{s}}}_{T} from an input measurement sequence, 𝐱1,…,𝐱Tsubscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑇{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{1},\\dots,{\\bm{\\mathrm{x}}}_{T}, as following: It has been shown that reweighted algorithms—such as the reweighted ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization method by 6 and the reweighted ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization by 7—outperform their non-reweighted counterparts. Driven by this observation, this paper proposes a novel deep RNN architecture by unfolding a reweighted-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization algorithm. Due to the reweighting, our network has higher expressivity than existing RNN models leading to better data representations, especially when depth increases. This is in line with recent studies 8 9 0, which have shown that better performance can be achieved by highly over-parameterized networks, i.e., networks with far more parameters than the number of training samples. While the most recent studies (related over-parameterized DNNs) consider fully-connected networks applied on classification problems 1, our approach focuses on deep-unfolding architectures and opts to understand how the networks learn a low-complexity representation for sequential signal reconstruction, which is a regression problem across time. Furthermore, while there have been efforts to build deep RNNs 2 3 4 , examining the generalization property of such deep RNN models on unseen sequential data still remains elusive. In this work, we derive the generalization error bound of the proposed design and further compare it with existing RNN bounds 5 6. Contributions. The contributions of this work are as follows: We propose a principled deep RNN model for sequential signal reconstruction by unfolding a reweighted ℓ1​-​ℓ1subscriptℓ1-subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}\\text{-}\\ell_{1} minimization method. Our reweighted-RNN model employs different soft-thresholding functions that are adaptively learned per hidden unit. Furthermore, the proposed model is over-parameterized, has high expressivity and can be efficiently stacked. We derive the generalization error bound of the proposed model (and deep RNNs) by measuring Rademacher complexity and show that the over-parameterization of our RNN ensures good generalization. To best of our knowledge, this is the first generalization error bound for deep RNNs; moreover, our bound is tighter than existing bounds derived for shallow RNNs 5 6. We provide experiments in the task of reconstructing video sequences from low-dimensional measurements. We show significant gains when using our model compared to several state-of-the-art RNNs (including unfolding architectures), especially when the depth of RNNs increases.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the study by  designed the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-RNN, which stems from unfolding an algorithm that solves the ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} minimization problem  [ref]6.
