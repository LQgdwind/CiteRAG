The problems above can be unified under the General Factor (GenFac) problem\n[ref]12  3,\nwhere one is given a graph G𝐺G and an associated set of integers Bvsubscript𝐵𝑣B_{v} for\nevery vertex v𝑣v of G𝐺G. The objective is to find a subgraph such that\nevery vertex v𝑣v has its degree in Bvsubscript𝐵𝑣B_{v}.\nCornuéjols [ref]12 showed that the complexity of GenFac depends on the maximum gap of the sets Bvsubscript𝐵𝑣B_{v}.\nThe maximum gap of a set B𝐵B (denoted by max−gap⁡(B)maxgap𝐵\\operatorname{max-gap}(B)) is defined as the largest\ncontiguous sequence of integers not in B𝐵B but whose boundaries are\nin B𝐵B.\nCornuéjols [ref]12 showed that if max−gap⁡(Bv)≤1maxgapsubscript𝐵𝑣1\\operatorname{max-gap}(B_{v})\\leq 1,\nthen GenFac is polynomial-time solvable.\nIn a sense, we can say that this case is the only one that is polynomial-time solvable.\nFormally, for a fixed, finite set B𝐵B of integers,\nB𝐵B-Factor is the special case of GenFac where every vertex has the same set Bv=Bsubscript𝐵𝑣𝐵B_{v}=B of allowed degrees.\nIt follows from a result of Dalmau and Ford \nthat if B𝐵B is a fixed finite set such that max−gap⁡(B)>1maxgap𝐵1\\operatorname{max-gap}(B)>1,\nthen B𝐵B-Factor is NP-hard. Given the hardness of B𝐵B-Factor in general,\nMarx et al. 3 studied the complexity of the problem on bounded treewidth graphs.\nRecall the long history of study on treewidth,\nwhich is a measure for how “tree-like” a graph is,\n  .\nFor a wide range of hard problems,\nalgorithms with running time of the form f​(k)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝒪1f(k)\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} exist\nif the input graph comes with a tree decomposition of width k𝑘k.\nIn many cases even the best possible form of f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k) in the running time is known\n(under suitable complexity assumptions, such as\nthe Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH)\n).\nMarx et al. 3 use a combination of standard dynamic programming techniques\nwith fast subset convolution (cf. 0)\nto give optimal (under SETH) (max⁡B+1)tw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝐵1twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max B+1)^{\\operatorname{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} time algorithms\nfor the decision, optimization, and counting versions. Fix a finite, non-empty set B⊆ℕ𝐵ℕB\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}}. We can count in time (max⁡B+1)tw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝐵1twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max B+1)^{\\operatorname{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\nthe solutions of a certain size\nfor a B𝐵B-Factor instance\nif we are given a tree decomposition of width twtw{\\operatorname{tw}}. For any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0,\nthere is no (max⁡B+1−ϵ)pw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝐵1italic-ϵpwsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max B+1-\\epsilon)^{{\\operatorname{pw}}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} algorithm\nfor the following problems,\neven if we are given a path decomposition of width pwpw{\\operatorname{pw}},\nunless SETH (resp. #SETH) fails: B𝐵B-Factor and Min-B𝐵B-Factor if 0∉B0𝐵0\\notin B and max−gap⁡(B)>1maxgap𝐵1\\operatorname{max-gap}(B)>1, Max-B𝐵B-Factor if max−gap⁡(B)>1maxgap𝐵1\\operatorname{max-gap}(B)>1, #B𝐵B-Factor if B≠{0}𝐵0B\\neq\\{0\\}. We study the complementary problem of\nX𝑋{X}-AntiFactor for finite sets X𝑋{X} of excluded degrees. Let x∈ℕ𝑥ℕ{x}\\in{\\mathbb{N}} be fixed.\nAntiFactorx is\nthe decision problem of finding for an undirected graph G𝐺G\nwhere all vertices v𝑣v are assigned a finite set Xv⊆ℕsubscript𝑋𝑣ℕ{X}_{v}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}}\nwith |Xv|≤xsubscript𝑋𝑣𝑥\\lvert{X}_{v}\\rvert\\leq{x},\na set S⊆E​(G)𝑆𝐸𝐺S\\subseteq E(G) such that for all v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V we have degS⁡(v)∉Xvsubscriptdegree𝑆𝑣subscript𝑋𝑣\\deg_{S}(v)\\notin{X}_{v}. For a fixed X⊆ℕ𝑋ℕ{X}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}} with |X|=x𝑋𝑥\\lvert X\\rvert=x,\nwe define X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor as the restriction of AntiFactorx\nto those graphs where all vertices are labeled with the same set X𝑋{X}. X¯¯𝑋{\\overline{{X}}}-Factor, the special case of\nGenFac where every vertex has set X¯¯𝑋{\\overline{{X}}},\nprecisely corresponds to X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nwhere we set X¯≔ℕ∖X≔¯𝑋ℕ𝑋{\\overline{{X}}}\\coloneqq{\\mathbb{N}}\\setminus{X}.\n\nThe decision and minimization versions are trivially solvable if 0∉X0𝑋0\\notin{X}\nas the empty set is a valid solution.\nFurther, if X𝑋{X} does not contain two consecutive numbers,\nthen X¯¯𝑋\\overline{X} has no gap of size at least two.\nIn this case, by results from Cornuéjols [ref]12\nand Dudycz and Paluch ,\nthe decision, maximization and minimization\nversion of X¯¯𝑋\\overline{X}-Factor are poly-time solvable. One could expect that similar results can be obtained for X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor as for B𝐵B-Factor,\nbut this is very far from the truth and the exact complexity of X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor is much less clear.\nIn the B𝐵B-Factor problem, a partial solution\n(a set of edges that we intend to further extend to a solution)\ncan have degree at most max⁡B𝐵\\max B at each vertex,\nwhich is the main reason one needs (max⁡B+1)tw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝐵1twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max B+1)^{\\operatorname{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} running time.\nFor X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor, a vertex can also have degree\nlarger than max⁡X𝑋\\max{X} in a (partial) solution,\nbut all degrees larger than max⁡X𝑋\\max{X} are\nequivalent in some sense.\nTherefore, the natural running time we expect is (max⁡X+2)tw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑋2twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max{X}+2)^{\\operatorname{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}.\nWe show that this running time can be achieved,\nbut requires some modification of the convolution\nto handle the state “degree more than max⁡X𝑋\\max{X}.” Let X⊆ℕ𝑋ℕ{X}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}} be finite and fixed.\nGiven an X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor instance and its tree decomposition of width twtw{\\operatorname{tw}}.\nThen we can\ncount the number of solutions of size exactly s𝑠s in time (max⁡X+2)tw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑋2twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max{{X}}+2)^{{\\operatorname{tw}}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\nfor all s𝑠s simultaneously. However, there are many cases where algorithms significantly faster than (max⁡X+2)tw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑋2twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max{X}+2)^{\\operatorname{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} are possible.\nAt first, this may seem unlikely:\nat each node of the tree decomposition,\nthe partial solutions can have up to (max⁡X+2)tw+1superscript𝑋2tw1(\\max{X}+2)^{{\\operatorname{tw}}+1} different equivalence classes111\nRecall that in a graph with treewidth twtw{\\operatorname{tw}}, the largest bag has size tw+1tw1{\\operatorname{tw}}+1.\n\nand it may seem necessary to find a partial solution for each of these classes.\nNevertheless, we show that the technique of representative sets\ncan be used to achieve a running time\nlower than the number of potential equivalence classes.\nRepresentative sets were defined by Monien 7\nfor use in an FPT algorithm for k𝑘k-Path,\nand subsequently found use in many different contexts,\nincluding faster dynamic programming algorithms on tree decompositions\n[ref]1       5 9.\nThe main idea is that we do not need to find a partial solution for each equivalence class,\nbut it is sufficient to find a representative set of partial solutions\nsuch that if there is a partial solution that is compatible with some extension,\nthen there is a partial solution in our set\nthat is also compatible with this extension.\nOur main algorithmic result shows that if X𝑋{X} is sparse,\nthen this representative set can be much smaller than (max⁡X+2)tw+1superscript𝑋2tw1(\\max{X}+2)^{{\\operatorname{tw}}+1},\nyielding improved algorithms.\nIn particular, AntiFactorx is FPT\nparameterized by twtw{\\operatorname{tw}} and x𝑥{x}. One can decide in time (x+1)𝒪​(tw)​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑥1𝒪twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1({x}+1)^{\\mathcal{O}({\\operatorname{tw}})}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\nwhether there is a solution of a certain size for AntiFactorx\nassuming a tree decomposition of width twtw{\\operatorname{tw}} is given. We note that Theorem 1.4 clearly distinguishes X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nfrom B𝐵B-Factor.\nBy the known lower bounds from Marx et al. 3\n(cf. Theorem 1.1),\na similar result for B𝐵B-Factor is not possible.\nIn light of Theorem 1.4,\nit is also far from obvious to determine\nthe exact complexity of X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor for a fixed set X𝑋{X}.\nThe combinatorial properties of the set X𝑋{X}\ninfluence the complexity of the problem in a subtle way\nand new algorithmic techniques seem to be needed to fully exploit this.\nCurrently, we do not have a tight bound similar to Theorem 1.1 for every fixed X𝑋{X}.\nInstead we propose a candidate for the combinatorial property that influences the complexity:\nWe define a bipartite compatibility graph for every set X𝑋{X}\nand conjecture that the maximum size of a so-called half-induced matching is the key property\nto obtain a faster algorithm via representative sets.\nSee 4.8 for a formal statement. We use such half-induced matchings of large size\nto show a lower bound for AntiFactorx that, assuming SETH,\ncomplements the algorithm in Theorem 1.4 up to constant factors\nin the exponent (see Theorem 5.6).\nMoreover, if there is a half-induced matching of size hℎh,\nthen, assuming SETH,\nwe show that\nthere is no (h−ϵ)tw​n𝒪​(1)superscriptℎitalic-ϵtwsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(h-\\epsilon)^{{\\operatorname{tw}}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} algorithm for X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor\nfor any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 (Theorem 5.4).\nAlthough, in this case\nthe representative set cannot be smaller than (h−ϵ)tw+1superscriptℎitalic-ϵtw1(h-\\epsilon)^{{\\operatorname{tw}}+1}\nfor any ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0\n(Lemma 4.6)\nwe do not have matching upper bounds at this point.\nThere are two main reasons why it is difficult to obtain tight upper bounds: Representative set bounds.\nIn Theorem 1.4, the upper bound on the size of representative sets\nare based on earlier algebraic techniques\n   9.\nIt is not clear how they can be extended to the combinatorial notion of half-induced matchings. Join nodes.\nEven if we have tight bounds on the size of representative sets\nthere is an additional issue that can increase the running time.\nAt join nodes of the tree decomposition,\nwe need to compute from two representative sets a third one.\nDoing this operation in a naive way results in a running time\nthat is at least the square of the bound on the size of the representative set.\nIf we want to have a running time that matches the size of the representative set,\nwe need a more clever way of handling join nodes. Representative sets of the form we study here could be relevant for other problems and tight bounds for such representative sets could be of fundamental importance. In particular, the notion of half-induced matchings could be a key property in other contexts as well. We also investigate the #AntiFactor problem,\nwhere we need to count the total number of solutions satisfying the degree constraints.\nThe idea of representative sets is fundamentally incompatible with exact counting:\nif we need to count every solution,\nthen we cannot ignore certain partial solutions\neven if they can be always replaced by others.\nTherefore, the algorithm of Theorem 1.4 cannot be extended to the counting version.222\nCounting the solutions approximately is a problem of independent interest.\n\nIn fact, we show that already #AntiFactor1\nis unlikely to be FPT\nby showing the following stronger statement for path decompositions. There is a fixed constant c𝑐c such that #AntiFactor1\ncannot be solved in time\n𝒪​(npw−c)𝒪superscript𝑛pw𝑐\\mathcal{O}(n^{{\\operatorname{pw}}-c}) on graphs with n𝑛n vertices given a path decomposition\nof width pwpw{\\operatorname{pw}}, unless #SETH is false.\nFurthermore, #AntiFactor1 is #W[ref]1delimited-[]1[ref]1-hard\nparameterized by pathwidth. Recall that #SETH (cf.  )\nis actually a weaker assumption than SETH.\nHence, the first result is stronger than a version based on SETH.\nMoreover, the algorithm from Theorem 1.3\nis essentially optimal for #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor. Let X⊆ℕ𝑋ℕ{X}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{N}} be a non-empty, finite and fixed set.\nFor any constant ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, there\nis no algorithm that can solve #X𝑋{X}-AntiFactor in time\n(max⁡X+2−ϵ)pw​n𝒪​(1)superscript𝑋2italic-ϵpwsuperscript𝑛𝒪1(\\max{X}+2-\\epsilon)^{{\\operatorname{pw}}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} given a graph along\nwith a path decomposition of width pwpw{\\operatorname{pw}}, unless #SETH fails. The paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 presents\nthe algorithms of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4.\nSection 3 introduces representative sets\nand proves the results we need in our algorithms.\nSection 4 introduces half-induced matchings\nand discusses some combinatorial properties related to representative sets.\nSections 5, 6 and 7 present\nthe lower bounds for the decision, optimization,\nand counting versions, respectively.\nOne special case, the counting version of\nEdge Cover is treated separately in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: in f𝑓f-AntiFactor\nthe task is to find a set S𝑆S of edges\nwhere the degree of v𝑣v is not f​(v)𝑓𝑣f(v) .
