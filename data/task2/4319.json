      "content": "Paper Title: DCCF: Deep Comprehensible Color Filter Learning Framework for High-Resolution Image Harmonization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to evalute the effectiveness of our proposed DCCF learning framework, we construct two kinds of baselines. (1) Applying recent state-of-the-art methods directly on the original input images to get the full-resolution harmonized results.\n(2) Applying recent state-of-the-art methods on the low-resolution inputs (256×256256256256\\times 256) to predict low-resolution harmonized images and adopting variates of state-of-the-art post-processing methods to get the final full-resolution harmonized results.\nIn this paper, we choose iDIH-HRNet  as the deep model provided by Sofiiuk et al.  and Bilinear Upsampling (BU), Guided Filter Upsampling [ref]14 (GF), Bilateral Guided Upsampling  (BGU) as post-processing methods.\nFor fair comparison, we adopt the same low-resolution (i.e. 256×256256256256\\times 256) feature extractor as  for our DCCF learning framework.\nThe performance comparison is shown in Table 1. Some harmonization results are shown in Fig. 7. For the comparison of efficiency metrics like inference time and memory usage, please refer to supplementary for details. The method of applying  directly on the full-resolution (first row in Table 1) performs pooly.\nThe principal reason is that  is designed and trained on the resolution of 256×256256256256\\times 256, directly applying this model in testing phase to the original image full-resolution would lead to serious feature misalignment.\nMoreover this strategy failed on HAdobe5k subset (max resolution: 6048×\\times4032) due to memory limitation. The method of applying post-processing after the low-resolutional prediction results from  with low-resolution inputs solves the memory problem.\nHowever, BU would lead to blurring effect, especially for high-resolution subset HAdobe5k, see Fig 7.\nTherefore, we adopt more advanced post-processing algorithms GF [ref]14 and BGU  that take original full-resolution image as detail guidance to mitigate the blurring effect from upsampling operation.\nTable  1 shows that these upsampling methods outperform bilinear upsampling methods by a large margin and the best one BGU achieves 26.85 on MSE and 37.24 on PSNR.\nHowever, the best performance of post-processing methods is behind our approach DCCF.\nOur approach achieves 24.65 on MSE and 37.87 on PSNR, 7.63%percent7.637.63\\% and 1.69%percent1.691.69\\% relative improvements on MSE and PSNR respectively compared with  + BGU .\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: methods to get the final full-resolution harmonized results.\nIn this paper, we choose iDIH-HRNet  as the deep model provided by Sofiiuk et al.  and Bilinear Upsampling (BU), Guided Filter Upsampling [ref]14 (GF), Bilateral Guided Upsampling  (BGU) as post-processing methods.\nFor fair comparison, we adopt the same low-resolution (i.e. 256×256256256256\\times 256) feature extractor as  for our DCCF\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
