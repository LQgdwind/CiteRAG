      "content": "Paper Title: Procrustes: a Dataflow and Accelerator for Sparse Deep Neural Network Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlgorithm¬†1 illustrates the operations required to evaluate a conv layer (the forward pass is shown but the backward and weight update passes can be expressed in the same way, with only the innermost MAC operation different). The computation can be represented as a seven-dimensional nested loop, where each loop traverses a different dimension of the operation space¬† (single-sample inference accelerators may not have the NùëÅN minibatch dimension). Regions of this operation space are then distributed as ‚Äúwork tiles‚Äù to different PEs by mapping two of the loops to the horizontal and vertical dimensions of a 2D PE array; together with exchanging the order in which loops are nested, this determines the dataflow¬† . Figure¬†3 shows the ubiquitous weight-stationary dataflow¬†[6, 48, 3, 39, 41, 22, 40, 34, etc.], which results from mapping the C,Kùê∂ùêæC,K dimensions across the PE array in the forward pass (mapping R,SùëÖùëÜR,S is less common due to small filter sizes); the corresponding mappings for the backward and weight-update passes are shown in the adjacent table. In this mapping, each workload (e.g., DNN layer) is first divided into PE-sized work tiles, all of which have the same number of weights. The tiles are mapped among the PEs; once PE receives one work-tile, the computation begins and runs until all work-tiles have finished. Finally, the next set of work-tiles is distributed among the PEs, and the process repeats until the entire layer has been evaluated (Figure¬†4a). This mapping results in advantageous dataflow properties in a 2D PE array. Because all work tiles have the same amount of work, execution is naturally synchronized, and data can be spatially reused by broadcasting across multiple PEs. For example, in the forward pass in Figure¬†3, input activations are broadcast horizontally (read-only reuse), while partial sums are reduced vertically (read-write reuse). The dataflow patterns also allow the on-chip network to be simple: our example requires two one-dimensional flows (for the activations and the partial sums) and one unicast flow (for the weights); typically, those would be three separate interconnects. However, difficulties arise when the network is sparse. At reasonable pruning levels, on the order of 10% of the weights survive¬†, with sparsity distributed unevenly among the worktiles (by chance and learning pressure). This leaves designers with two unpleasant alternatives: Retain the same tiling and mapping of operations to the PE array as in the dense case. This preserves the single-dimensional dataflow patterns shown in Figure¬†3, allowing input activations and partial sums to be spatially reused. However, different amounts of work are distributed to different PEs, and utilization is low because latency is limited by the ‚Äúslowest‚Äù PE (Figure¬†4b). Figure¬†5 shows how latency differs among full-PE-array sets of work tiles (i.e., columns in Figure¬†4b): frequently, the load imbalance causes execution time overheads in excess of 50%, and sometimes in excess of 100%. Distribute an equal number of non-zero weights to each PEs. This balances the workload among the PEs (Figure¬†4b), but destroys the desirable single-dimensional on-chip traffic flow patterns of Figure¬†3 and severely reduces the benefits from spatial reuse. In addition, because related partial sums can be generated in any PE, a complex interconnect is required to reduce them¬† [ref]7. Choosing other dataflows also does not provide a panacea: for example, the activation-stationary dataflow used for some sparse accelerators¬†[ref]36 suffers similar issues in the weight update pass, requires two datatypes to be unicast, and suffers from low PE array utilization towards the tail of many networks where the activation tensors are small¬†[ref]7. Section¬†IV-C describes how Procrustes employs the additional minibatch dimension available during training to achieve effective load balancing while preserving a hardware-friendly dataflow and avoiding the need for a complex interconnect.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: patterns of Figure¬†3 and severely reduces the benefits from spatial reuse.
