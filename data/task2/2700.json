      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Enhanced Optimisation for Routing Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDL and RL have recently been proposed to solve COPs. Learning-based method for routing problems can be categorised as constructive     [ref]11     and improvement heuristics [ref]18  [ref]35   . Constructive methods tend to predict the next node given a partially constructed tour and build up to a solution node by node. Improvement heuristics improve a solution by iteratively performing search based on LS heuristics to improve the solution , where a neural network guides a LS algorithm that iteratively finds promising solutions. A pioneering work in this area is Pointer Networks (PN)  based on attention mechanism and a supervised learning approach to solve TSP. It relies on having an existing set of good solutions or a good solver to generate training instances. One recent paper used a supervised learning approach to train a small-scale model, which could be repetitively used to build heat maps for TSP instances of arbitrarily large instances based on graph sampling, graph converting and heat maps merging techniques. Then the heat maps are fed into a reinforcement learning approach to guide the search for high-quality solutions based on the Monte Carlo tree search . In , a constructive neural method was proposed that uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder and an attention mechanism to build solutions for the CVRP and uses an actor-critic RL for training. A graph attention network is used in the method called AM  [ref]11 and generates solutions for different routing problems trained via RL, including TSP and CVRP. They trained their model using policy gradient RL with a baseline based on a deterministic greedy roll-out. ERRL  is another RL based approach that introduces more exploration via stochastic policies. POMO  introduced an end-to-end approach for building a heuristic solver based on policy optimisation with multiple optima. Bresson et al.  proposed adapting the popular Transformer architecture to solve TSP. Training is carried out through RL (without TSP training solutions) and decoding uses beam search. Other lines of research are Deep Policy Dynamic Programming that aims to combine the strengths of learned neural heuristics with those of dynamic programming algorithms  and the improvement methods [ref]18  [ref]35 and .\nMany improvement methods have been developed recently   [ref]18  [ref]35 . LHI  learns which combinations of local operators to apply to solve RPs. RL2OPT [ref]35 proposed a deep RL approach to learn an LS heuristic based on 2-opt operators. Chen et al. [ref]18 focuses on improving heuristics and proposes an RL based improvement approach that chooses a region of a graph representation of the problem and then selects and applies established local heuristics. L2I  proposed a combination of LS as an improvement operator and ML algorithm. To escape the local minimum, they further improved the solution by a perturbation operator in L2I . LS methods can easily get stuck in local minimum . In the OR field, various meta-heuristics have been proposed to avoid local optima. They show promising results to solve RPs  . However, meta-heuristics still require expert knowledge. Our work is similar to L2I , but differs in two important aspects; we use a different set of improving LS operators and we do not use perturbation operators to avoid local minimum. Hence, to produce promising results, we refine LS operators for routing problems and to tackle the local minima problems, we propose to include a set of penalty terms  that will adaptively guide the LS operators.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: DL and RL have recently been proposed to solve COPs.
