      "content": "Paper Title: Skill-Critic: Refining Learned Skills for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOffline RL.\nOffline RL algorithms use pre-collected demonstrations to learn optimal policies without environment interaction     . When environment interaction is limited, offline RL can warm-start and accelerate online RL training  [ref]20   , which is referred to as fine-tuning. However, the quality of offline RL priors highly relies on the demonstration. The performance of RL fine-tuning can deteriorate when attempting to transfer prior experience from one task to another . Skill-transfer RL\nSkill-transfer RL reuses pre-trained skills, i.e. sequences of actions, to accelerate RL training for downstream tasks    . One commonly used approach is to learn a skill latent space from offline data using variational autoencoder (VAE) . In the downstream RL task, an HL skill-selection policy is then trained to select the optimal skill from the learned skill space. In this way, RL only needs to explore how to stitch temporally-extended action sequences, instead of searching for the optimal action for each single time step. Furthermore, a prior for the HL policy can be obtained from VAE training to guide and further accelerate RL training. Prior works often consider a stationary skill space. Thus, the RL agent’s performance is constrained by the skills contained in the offline data. Adaptive Skill-Prior RL (ASPiRe)  alleviates this issue by enabling the RL agent to compose skill priors learned from multiple datasets. Nevertheless, the LL policies are still stationary, and the RL agent may still fail when the downstream task requires skills unseen in any available datasets. It motivates us to propose Skill-Critic, which can effectively leverage low-coverage or low-quality data for skill-transfer RL. Hierarchical RL. Hierarchical RL breaks long-horizon tasks down into simpler sub-tasks, enhancing training performance   [ref]5  . Commonly, algorithms employ intermediate variables, such as goals, options, or skills, to define subdomains that bridge high and low levels    [ref]33  .\nSingle-layer hierarchical RL (such as skill-transfer RL) may fail to adequately adjust to the downstream environment.\nJoint policy training can alleviate this issue, but may be unstable or more sample intensive than single-layer RL because the agent must explore both the intermediate space and action space [ref]33. Joint policy learning can be accelerated by pre-trained goal-conditioned\npolicies from demonstrations  [ref]5 that require structured goal states to be defined. Conversely, we leverage skills, thereby adding structure and prior experience to guide the joint policy optimization problem.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: use pre-collected demonstrations to learn optimal policies without environment interaction     .
