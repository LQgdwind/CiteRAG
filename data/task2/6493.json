      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Structure-Guided Diffusion Model for 2D Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion Model for Generation Tasks.\nRecently, diffusion models  [ref]38  have achieved superior performance on the generation tasks, such as image/video synthesis  , image super-resolution   , 3D shape and synthesis , etc.\nDiffusion models add noises to the signals and learn to recover signals from noised data samples by a progressive denoising process. Although diffusion achieves great success on many generation tasks, it has huge costs on computational resources. Thus, DDIM [ref]38 and its variant  transform the denoising process to the non-Markov process from the Markov process by skipping-step sampling, which improves the inference speed and booms the application of diffusion models on other computer vision tasks. Diffusion Model for Perception Tasks.\nWith the success of diffusion models on generation tasks, researchers pay attention to applying diffusion models to other perception tasks, such as object detection [ref]4, segmentation 4   , 3D pose lifting 3 8, and so on. DiffusionDet [ref]4 diffuses ground-truth object bounding boxes to noised boxes, then utilizes the diffusion model to recover ground-truth bounding boxes from randomly sampled boxes. Based on DiffusionDet, DiffusionInst 4 adds a segmentation head on the regression head of DiffusionDet, which achieves instance segmentation by the diffusion model. For 3D pose lifting, some works 3 8 start from a randomly sampled 3D pose and recover the 3D pose with the guidance of 2D pose context. The success of diffusion models on perception tasks inspires us to study how to apply the diffusion model in 2D pose estimation and utilize its strong ability of recovering signals from noises to generate high-quality keypoints heatmaps.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Diffusion Model for Generation Tasks.\nRecently, diffusion models  [ref]38  have achieved superior performance on the generation tasks, such as image/video synthesis  , image super-resolution   , 3D shape and synthesis , etc.\nDiffusion models add noises to the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
