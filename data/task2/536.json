Topics in this field include\ncode completion ,  , , program repair [ref]4, , 6, bug detection  and type inference , . , . A common factor among all these techniques is the use of an n-gram or RNN based LM with the tokenization defined by the programming language. Thus they are severely affected by the OOV and rare words problems.\nSub-word tokenization (e.g. BPE) was first proposed by  as a suitable alternative for source code and shows compelling results for code completion and bug detection. In our work, we show that finer grained tokenization techniques are beneficial for source code LMs compared to subword tokenizers. CuBert  is a recently introduced LM for modeling code. In contrast to our approach, this work does not consider character based tokenization and uses a subword tokenizer.\nA Github corpus in Python is used for pre-training a BERT-like model which is fine-tuned for tasks like variable misuse classification, wrong binary operator detection, swapped operands, function-docstring mismatch, and prediction of exception type.\nCodeBert [ref]7 is another transformer LM specialized for code generation from textual descriptions. Their specialized pre-training uses bimodal examples of source code paired with natural language documentation from Github repositories. Prior to the use of machine learning techniques, static code analysis was used to understand code structures and apply rules handcrafted by programmers to identify potential vulnerabilities. Tools like RATS , Flawfinder , and Infer  are of this type. However, they produce many false positives, a problem identified early on by   , making these tools difficult to use effectively as part of the developer tool chain. Current machine learning approaches to code analysis depend heavily on features derived from the compiler, such as the AST, or other derived structures that require the compilation of source code  . These features are paired with complex GGNN 6 models. In addition to the VI task  , combining the AST and GGNN have shown good results in type inference , code clone detection   and bug detection 2. This evidence motivated our AST tagging task.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: In recent years, research at the intersection of NLP, Machine Learning and Software Engineering has significantly increased. Topics in this field include\ncode completion ,  , , program repair [ref]4, , 6, bug detection  and type inference , . , .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
