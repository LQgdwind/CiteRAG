In the sequel, we use the same setup of [ref]31 to have a fair comparison.\nSynthetic Flow: We first test our architecture on the synthetic flow dataset from [ref]31. The simplicial complex is generated by sampling 400400400 points uniformly at random in the unit square, and then a Delaunay triangulation is applied to obtain the domain of the trajectories. The set of trajectories is generated on the simplicial complex shown in Fig. 3(a): Each trajectory starts from the top left corner and go through the whole map until the bottom right corner, passing close to either the bottom-left hole or the top-right hole. Thus, the learning task is to identify which of the two holes is the closest one on the path.\nOcean Drifters: We also consider a real-world dataset including ocean drifter tracks near Madagascar from 2011 to 2018 . The map surface is discretized into a simplicial complex with a hole in the centre, which represents the presence of the island. The discretization process is done by tiling the map into a regular hexagonal grid. Each hexagon represents a 00-simplex (vertex), and if there is a nonzero net flow from one hexagon to its surrounding neighbors, a 111-simplex (edge) is placed between them. All the 3-cliques of the 111-simplex are considered to be 222-simplex (triangles) of the simplicial complex shown in Fig. 3(b). Thus, following the experimental setup of [ref]31, the learning task is to distinguish between the clockwise and counter-clockwise motions of flows around the island. The flows belonging to each trajectory of the test set use random orientations. Both experiments are inductive learning problems.\nIn Table I we compare the accuracy of the proposed GSAN architecture against the MPSN architecture from [ref]31, the SCN architecture (same hyperparameters as ours) from [ref]37, and the architecture from , referred as SAT. Both SAT and GSAN exploit single-head attention. We believe that the the SAT architecture  we have chosen is the most appropriate one in terms of complexity and structure, being it a specific case also of a SAN. For the MPSN architecture, we use the metrics already reported in [ref]31. As the reader can notice from Table I, the proposed GSAN architecture achieves the best results among all the competitors in both the synthetic and real-world datasets, thanks to the attention mechanism and also to the harmonic projector, important in tasks involving holes.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: tasks have been adopted to solve many problems in location-based services, e.g. route recommendation , or inferring the missing portions of a given trajectory .\nInspired by , the works in ,[ref]31 exploited simplicial neural networks for trajectory prediction.
