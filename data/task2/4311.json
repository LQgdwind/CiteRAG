      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Log Instructions in Log-based Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBGL and HDFS are two benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection that are mostly used by the research community¬†  [ref]6. TABLE¬†III shows the key datasets properties. To find the unique log events, we used Drain¬†, a state-of-the-art log parsing method. Drain‚Äôs hyperparameters were set as recommended by Zhu et al.¬†[ref]19 resulting in an output of 29 and 360 unique events for HDFS and BGL, respectively. Following He, et al.¬†[ref]6 we split the dataset into 80-20% train-test split. The first, chronologically ordered 80% were used for training (and model tuning), while the remaining 20% were used for performance evaluation for the two datasets accordingly. HDFS contains 11,175,629 logs generated from a map-reduce tasks on more than 200 Amazon‚Äôs EC2 nodes¬†. Each log has a unique identifier (block_id) for each operation such as allocation, writing, replication and deletion. After parsing, there are 29 unique events, from which ten describe anomalous events and appear just when the block_id is anomalous. Therefore, they are indicators of an anomaly. We used this observation to create two datasets, which we refer to as HDFS-sin and HDFS-seq. HDFS-sin is composed of time-ordered logs with a label for each event if it is anomalous or not. This data allows the evaluation of methods performance in absence of external identifiers, i.e., single log anomaly detection. HDFS-seq uses the block_id as a natural identifier to construct sequences of events, and it is used in sequential anomaly detection evaluation. BGL contains 4,474,963 logs collected from a BlueGene/L supercomputer at Livermore Lab¬†. BGL has two important characteristics. The first BGL characteristic is the availability of labels for individual log events given by the system administrators. We use these labels as ground truth information for single log line anomaly detection. We refer to this data as BGL-sin (with 348,460 anomalous logs). The second BGL characteristic is the absence of identifiers for task sequences. To create log sequences, similar to related work¬†[ref]6, we use a time window of size TùëáT. Following, He et al.¬†[ref]6 we set T=ùëáabsentT=¬†6h, as optimal for BGL. This resulted in a total of 828 log sequences. To obtain sequence labels, similar to related work¬†[ref]6, if there is a single anomalous log in the window, the sequence is labeled as anomalous. We refer to this data as BGL-seq, and we use it for the sequential evaluation.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: BGL and HDFS are two benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection that are mostly used by the research community¬†  [ref]6.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
