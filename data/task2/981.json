      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Invariant Representations and Risks for Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe success of supervised learning hinges on the key assumption that test data should share the same distribution with the training data. Unfortunately, in most of the real-world applications, data are dynamic, meaning that there is often a distribution shift between the training (source) and test (target) domains. To this end, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods aim to approach this problem by adapting the predictive model from labeled source data to the unlabeled target data. Recent advances in UDA focus on learning domain-invariant representations that also lead to a small error on the source domain. The goal is to learn representations, along with the source predictor, that can generalize to the target domain  [ref]2 [ref]3   . However, recent works [ref]7   have shown that the above conditions are not sufficient to guarantee good generalizations on the target domain. In fact, if the marginal label distributions are distinct across domains, the above method provably hurts target generalization [ref]7. On the other hand, while labeled target data is usually more difficult or costly to obtain than labeled source data, it can lead to better accuracy 0. Furthermore, in many practical applications, e.g., vehicle counting, object detection, speech recognition, etc., it is often feasible to at least obtain a small amount of labeled data from the target domain so that it can facilitate model training with source data 1 2. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we focus on a more realistic setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (Semi-DA). In Semi-DA, in addition to the large amount of labeled source data, the learner also has access to a small amount of labeled data from the target domain. Again, the learner’s goal is to produce a hypothesis that well generalizes to the target domain, under the potential shift between the source and the target. Semi-DA is a more-realistic setting that allows practitioners to design better algorithms that can overcome the aforementioned limitations in UDA. The key question in this scenario is: how to maximally exploit the labeled target data for better model generalization? In this paper, we address the above question under the Semi-DA setting. In order to first understand how performance discrepancy occurs, we derive a finite-sample generalization bound for both classification and regression problems under Semi-DA. Our theory shows that, for a given predictor, the accuracy discrepancy between two domains depends on two terms: (i) the distance between the marginal feature distributions, and (ii) the distance between the optimal predictors from source and target domains. Our observation naturally leads to a principled way of learning invariant representations (to minimize discrepancy between marginal feature distributions) and risks (to minimize discrepancy between conditional distributions over the features) across domains simultaneously for a better generalization on the target. In light of this, we introduce our novel bound minimization algorithm LIRR, a model of jointly Learning Invariant Representations and Risks for such purposes. As a comparison, existing works either focus on learning invariant representations only [ref]2 [ref]3  , or learning invariant risks only 3 4 5 6 7 8, but not both. However, these are not sufficient to reduce the accuracy discrepancy for good generalizations on the target. To our best knowledge, LIRR is the first work that subtly combine above learning objectives with sound theoretical justification. LIRR jointly learns invariant representations and risks, and as a result, better mitigates the accuracy discrepancy across domains. To better understand our method, we illustrate the proposed algorithm, LIRR, in Fig. 1. In summary, our work provides the following contributions:\n Theoretically, we provide finite-sample generalization bounds for Semi-DA on both classification (Theorem 4.1) and regression (Theorem 4.2) problems. Our bounds inform new directions for simultaneously optimizing both marginal and conditional distributions across domains for better generalization on the target. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generalization analysis in the Semi-DA setting that takes into account both the shifts between the marginal and the conditional distributions from source and target domains. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we provide an information-theoretic interpretation of our theoretical results. Based on this perspective, we propose a bound minimization algorithm, LIRR, to jointly learn invariant representations and invariant optimal predictors, in order to mitigate the accuracy discrepancy across domains for better generalizations. We systematically analyze LIRR with extensive experiments on both classification and regression tasks. Compared with methods that only learn invariant representations or invariant risks, LIRR demonstrates significant improvements on Semi-DA. We also analyze the adaptation performance with an increasing amount of labeled target data, which shows LIRR even surpasses oracle method Full Target trained only on labeled target data, suggesting that LIRR can successfully exploit the structure in source data to improve generalization on the target domain.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: representations that also lead to a small error on the source domain.
