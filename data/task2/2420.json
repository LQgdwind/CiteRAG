In [ref]44, Stolz et al. studied the percentage of United Kingdom voters by district that voted to leave the European Union in the “Brexit” referendum. The holes that they identified using PH corresponded to districts that voted differently than the neighboring districts. However, their approach does not distinguish between homology classes that were merely noise and homology classes that corresponded to small geographical districts. In , Feng and Porter developed an approach to study PH by constructing FSCs using the level-set method  of front propagation from scientific computation666The name “level-set method” may cause confusion. Importantly, the level-set simplicial complex of  is not the simplicial subcomplex that has simplices with some prescribed filtration value (i.e., a level set of the filtration values of a simplicial complex).. Using their level-set complexes, they examined the percentage of voters in each precinct of California counties that voted for a given candidate (e.g., Hillary Clinton) in the 2016 United States presidential election. The homology classes represent precincts that voted more heavily for Clinton than the neighboring precincts; these regions are “islands of blue in a sea of red”. The level-set complexes in  have two key limitations. The first is that they cannot handle time-dependent data, as they are built to study either data at a single point in time or data that has been aggregated over some time window to yield time-independent data. The second limitation is that these simplicial complexes reduce real-valued data (e.g., the percentage of voters who voted for Clinton) to binary data (e.g., whether or not the majority voted for Clinton). Consequently, in this example, the level-set-based PH does not capture the extent to which a blue “political island” voted more heavily for Clinton. By contrast, our approach is designed specifically to capture such information. As a trade-off, we no longer capture the geographical sizes of the political islands. For further discussion, see Feng, Hickok, and Porter [ref]18, who applied the level-set filtration to study\nthe cumulative case count in Los Angeles on one specific day. Our new approach to compute PH is also able to resolve some other technical issues in . In particular, some of the homology classes in the level-set approach of  are geographical artifacts that are indistinguishable from true features of a data set. By contrast, the finite 1D homology classes in our approach are either in one-to-one correspondence with the local maxima of a real-valued geospatial function or in one-to-one correspondence with its local minima, depending on the choices that one makes. Additionally, unlike the level-set approach in , we are able to detect extrema that are adjacent to the boundary of a geographical space. Other methods to construct simplicial complexes from geospatial data, such as rasterization of a shapefile or treating the regions as a point cloud, require a trade-off between the number of simplices and the accuracy of the representation of the geographical regions. For example, the level-set-based PH method of  uses orders-of-magnitude more simplices to achieve sufficient resolution of the smallest geographical regions (e.g., densely populated urban centers that are important to analyze). See section 7 for further discussion. We use vineyards in the present paper, but there are also other ways to study the topology of time-varying data. For example, zigzag PH  was used in  to analyze time-dependent point clouds (such as swarms) and in  to study time-delay embeddings of dynamical systems. Crocker plots and crocker stacks (i.e., stacks of crocker plots for different values of a smoothing parameter) illustrate how the Betti numbers of a time-dependent point cloud change with time and with a scale parameter ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon . Additionally, Kim and Mémoli  used multiparameter PH  to study time-dependent point clouds. In appendices B.3 and B.4, we show how one can use multiparameter PH  and multiparameter zigzag PH  to study our COVID-19 spatiotemporal data sets.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: Our method addresses several limitations of previous efforts to combine TDA with geospatial analysis.
