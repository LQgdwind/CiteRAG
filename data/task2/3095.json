      "content": "Paper Title: 3D Pose Estimation and Future Motion Prediction from 2D Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe essence of motion prediction or generation can be thought of as a sequence generation task.\nConventional approaches leveraged Gaussian processes  and hidden Markov models  to learn the representation of human motion.\nWith the recent release of several large-scale motion capture (MoCap) datasets  , most of the recent research efforts involved deep models, more specifically, recurrent neural networks.\nEncoder-Recurrent-Decoder (ERD)  can be considered as one of the earliest attempts to leverage the superior learning power with deep models for human motion prediction.\nA residual Gated Rectified Unit network for generating future human dynamics is proposed in , as well as a zero-velocity baseline that outperforms previous works. Interestingly, the zero-velocity baseline outperforms  by simply predicting the last observed pose as the result.\nStructural-RNN [ref]31 considers the body parts of humans and the object in the scene from a graph structure perspective though it requires human intervention to design such graph structures.\nGenerative adversarial networks are employed and both the geometric property of articulated objects and adversarial learning concept are utilized to further push the quantitative results for predicting long-term human motion . The only drawback is the involvement of the classifier (discriminator) make the training process more sensitive and complicated.\nInstead of using a recurrent architecture to model the motion context, a modified highway unit is utilized in [ref]32.\nAnd a hierarchical motion context network combined with a Lie algebra pose representation similar to [ref]33 is introduced in . Furthermore, human dynamics can be learned by working directly in the trajectory space, instead of the traditionally used pose space , by using discrete cosine transform.\nWith recent advances of the attention mechanism, in , an attention-based feed-forward network is proposed to accommodate the observation that human motion tends to repeat itself.  applies a transformer-based architecture with the global attention mechanism as well as proposing a memory-based dictionary which help to preserve the global motion pattern.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: as well as a zero-velocity baseline that outperforms previous works. Interestingly, the zero-velocity baseline outperforms  by simply predicting the last observed pose as the result.\nStructural-RNN [ref]31 considers the body parts of humans and the object in the scene from a graph structure perspective though it requires human intervention to design such graph structures.\nGenerative adversarial\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
