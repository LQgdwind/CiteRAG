      "content": "Paper Title: SplineGen: a generative model for B-spline approximation of unorganized points\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative artificial intelligent (AI) models have proven to be very powerful in natural language processing, computer vision, and computer graphics [ref]1. In particular, there is emerging use for the synthesis of 3D shapes lately, such as meshGPT [ref]2, SolidGen [ref]3, and ComplexGen .\nHowever, there has been limited use of these models, or even the broader deep learning models, in computer-aided design (CAD) modeling. This is mainly because those models are probabilistic (and therefore inherent uncertainty therein), while all CAD algorithms require high certainty and accuracy.\nThis work aims to show that, despite this gap, generative models offer considerable potential for improving classic CAD algorithms by replacing the expertise-based, heuristic parts in classic algorithms with data-driven methods. Approximating a set of data points with a B-spline curve  is the algorithm of choice. It is a fundamental algorithm in CAD/CAM, underlying many high-level modeling operations such as boundary evaluation, Booleans, features, tool path generation, reverse engineering, shape optimization etc.          . The approximation involves three main procedures: parametrization, knot placement, and approximation error minimization . The first two are prerequisites for running the third.\nParametrization means associating each data point with a parameter value.\nKnot placement refers to the choice of the number of knots and their locations for constructing spline bases.\nIt is well known that the parameterization and knot placement have a significant impact on the final approximation accuracy . Existing parameterization and knot placement methods basically fall under two different strategies. The first strategy heuristically chooses a parameterization and knot placement a posteriori for given data points.\nTypical examples include uniform parameterization , chord length parameterization , centripetal parameterization , and Foley-Nielson parameterization , among many others .\nFor knot placement, uniform knots , the knot placement technique (KTP)  and the new KTP (NKTP)  are typical examples. These methods have also been augmented by incorporating various optimization techniques, e.g.,  .\nLike all heuristic methods, those mentioned above can provide acceptable results in many but not all of the potential cases.\nThe second strategy learns a neural network to directly map data points to their corresponding parameters and knots, in an end-to-end manner . Fully connected neural networks (FCNN)  and residual networks (ResNet)  have been used for this purpose so far. Reduced approximation errors were demonstrated, but the application of these methods is consistently limited to ordered and fixed-size data points. In this work, we propose to cast the problems of parameterization and knot placement as a generative sequence-to-sequence translation problem, where unorganized input becomes possible. Rather than directly adopting existing networks (e.g., FCNN and ResNet), this work develops an extended version of the existing Transformer network [ref]1 to meet the specific needs of B-spline approximation. The new generative model, SplineGen, can automatically determine the number of knots, their placement, parameter values, and their ordering. More specifically, SplineGen has the following features: Size-independent. Restricting input data points, parameters, and knots to a fixed size would limit the practical significance of learning-based methods. The point partitioning trick as used in   may help but cannot solve the problem altogether. By contrast, the proposed method provides a principled way to handle variable-size input data points, parameters, and knots through the use of autoregressive models. Point permutation invariant. In many practical scenarios, input points may not be in a well-ordered position as required by most existing methods. As a result, a B-spline approximation-oriented neural network should exhibit permutation invariance over the input. That is, the output parameters and knots remain unchanged when input data points are permuted. This problem is to be solved by extending the transformer network with an additional self-organization module. Parameter-knot alignment. Many existing methods consider parameterization and knot placement problems separately. However, they correlate highly with each other, and lower approximate errors will be achieved if they work in a cooperative way, refer to Section 3 for more details. This necessitates a neural network that can align the generation of parameters and knots. To do so, this work uses a shared autoencoder model to learn shared point embeddings for both tasks. Furthermore, we add a new module called internal cross-attention to the parameter decoder and the knot decoder to explicitly align parameter generation and knot generation. High robustness. For a set of input data points, removing some of them or adding more sample points from the same curve should not affect the output significantly, if not completely identical. This simply means robustness towards data point removal or addition (of course, without changing the unknown underlying curve). To achieve this, we further extend the transformer network by adding a masking mechanism for simulating point removal/addition and predicting the corresponding output masks. The remaining content is organized as follows: Sec. 2 provides a review of related research studies. Sec. 3 states the problem to be solved, and Sec. 4 elaborates the proposed SplineGen network.
