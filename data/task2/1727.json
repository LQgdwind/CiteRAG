      "content": "Paper Title: Computing the multicover bifiltration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor k=1ùëò1k=1 fixed, (Covr,1)r‚àà[0,‚àû)subscriptsubscriptCovùëü1ùëü0(\\textnormal{Cov}_{r,1})_{r\\in[0,\\infty)} is the well-known offset filtration (also known as the union of balls filtration),\na standard construction for analyzing the topology of a finite point sample across scales¬†. It is a central object in the field of persistent homology.\nWhile the persistent homology of this filtration is stable to small geometric perturbations of the\nsites¬†, it is not robust with respect to outliers, and it can be insensitive to topological structure in high density regions of the data. Within the framework of 1-parameter persistent homology, there have been many proposals for alternative constructions which address these issues. These approaches include the removal of low density outliers¬†, filtering by a density function¬†  , distance to measure constructions¬†  9 , kernel density functions¬†, and subsampling¬†[ref]4. A detailed overview of these approaches can be found in . Several of these constructions have good stability properties or good asymptotic behavior.\nHowever, as explained in , all of the known 1-parameter persistence strategies for handling outliers or variations in density share certain disadvantages: First, they all depend on a choice of a parameter. Typically, this parameter specifies a fixed spatial scale or a density threshold at which the construction is carried out. In the absence of a priori knowledge about the structure of the data, it may be unclear how to select such a parameter. And if the data exhibits topological features at multiple spatial or density scales, it may be that no single parameter choice allows us to capture all the structure present in the data. Second, constructions that fix a scale parameter are unable to distinguish between small spatial features and large ones, and constructions that fix a density or measure parameter are unable to distinguish features in densely sampled regions of the data from features involving sparse¬†regions. A natural way to circumvent these limitations is to consider a 2-parameter approach, where one constructs a bifiltration from the data, rather than a 1-parameter filtration 1. The multicover bifiltration is one natural option for this. Alternatives include the density bifiltrations of Carlsson and Zomorodian¬†1, and the degree bifiltrations of Lesnick and Wright ; again, we refer the reader to  for a more detailed discussion.\nAmong these three options, the multicover bifiltration has two attractive features which together distinguish it from the others. First, its construction does not depend on any additional parameters. Second, the multicover bifiltration satisfies a strong stability property, which in particular guarantees robustness to outliers . There is a substantial and growing literature on the use of bifiltrations in data analysis. Most approaches begin by applying homology with coefficients to the bifiltration, to obtain an algebraic object called bipersistence module. In contrast to the 1-parameter case, where the algebraic structure of a persistence module is completely described by a barcode , it is well-known that defining the barcode of bipersistence modules is problematic 1. Nevertheless, one can compute invariants of a bipersistence module which serve as useful surrogates for a barcode, and a number of ideas for this have been proposed 1 4   . Regardless of which invariants of the multicover bifiltration we wish to consider, to work with this bifiltration computationally, the natural first step is to find a reasonably sized combinatorial (i.e., simplicial or polyhedral) model for the bifiltration. With such a model, recently developed algorithms such as those described in  and  can efficiently compute minimal presentations and standard invariants of the homology modules of the bifiltration. In the 1-parameter setting, there are two well-known simplicial models of the offset filtration. The ƒåech filtration, is given at each scale by the nerve of the balls; the equivalence of the offset and ƒåech filtrations follows from the Persistent Nerve Theorem. For large point sets, the full ƒåech filtration is too large to be used in practical computations. However, the alpha filtration (also known as the Delaunay filtration)¬†  is a much smaller subfiltration of the ƒåech filtration which is also simplicial model for the offset filtration. It is given at each scale by intersecting each ball with the Voronoi cell¬† of its center, and then taking the nerve of the resulting regions. For dùëëd small (say d‚â§3ùëë3d\\leq 3), the Delaunay filtration is readily computed in practice for many thousands of¬†points. It is implicit in the work of Sheehy¬† that the multicover bifiltration has an elegant simplicial model, the subdivision-ƒåech bifiltration, obtained via a natural filtration on the barycentric subdivision of each ƒåech complex; see also [12, Appendix B] and [6, Section 4]. However, the subdivision-ƒåech bifiltration has exponentially many vertices in the size of the data, making it even more unsuitable for computations than the ordinary ƒåech filtration. Edelsbrunner and Osang¬† therefore seek to develop the computational theory of the multicover bifiltration using higher-order Delaunay complexes¬† , taking the alpha filtration as inspiration. Assuming the sites are in general position, they define a polyhedral cell complex in ‚Ñùd+1superscript‚Ñùùëë1\\mathbb{R}^{d+1} called the rhomboid tiling, which contains all higher-order Delaunay complexes as planar¬†sections.\nUsing the rhomboid tiling, they present a polynomial time algorithm to compute the barcodes of a horizontal or vertical slice of the multicover bifiltration (i.e., of a one-parameter filtration obtained by fixing either one of the two parameters r,kùëüùëòr,k).\nThe case of fixed rùëür and varying kùëòk is more challenging because the order-kùëòk Delaunay complexes do not form a filtration. The authors construct a zigzag filtration for this case.\nThe problem of efficiently computing 2-parameter persistent homology of the multicover bifiltration is not addressed by¬†. We note that the subdivision-ƒåech bifiltration is more general than the Rhomboid tiling: the rhomboid tiling is defined only for Euclidean data, whereas the topological equivalence of the subdivision-ƒåech and multicover bifiltrations extends to data in any metric space where finite intersections of balls are contractible.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: these issues.
