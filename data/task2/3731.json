      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Local Displacements for Point Cloud Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven the partial scan of an object similar to Fig. 1, 3D completion aims at estimating the missing shape. In most cases, the missing region is due to self-occlusion since the partial scan is captured from a single view of the object.\nParticularly for point cloud,\nFoldingNet  and\nAtlasNet [ref]11\nare among the first works to propose an object completion based on PointNet [ref]22 features by deforming one or more 2D grids into the desired shape.\nThen, PCN  extended their work by deforming a collection of much smaller 2D grids in order to reconstruct finer structures. Through encoder-decoder architectures, ASFM-Net  and VRCNet [ref]20 match the encoded latent feature with a completion shape prior, which produce good coarse completion results.\nTo preserve the observed geometry from the partial scan for the fine reconstruction, MSN  and VRCNet [ref]20 bypass the observed geometries by using either the minimum density sampling (MDS) or the farthest point sampling (FPS) from the observed surface and building skip connections.\nBy embedding a volumetric sub-architecture, GRNet  preserves the discretized input geometries with the volumetric U-connection without sampling in the point cloud space.\nIn more recent works, PMP-Net  gradually reconstructs the entire object from the observed to the nearest occluded regions.\nAlso focusing on only predicting the occluded geometries, PoinTr  is among the first few transformer methods targeted on point cloud completion by translating the partial scan proxies into a set of occluded proxies to further refine the reconstruction.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: missing shape. In most cases, the missing region is due to self-occlusion since the partial scan is captured from a single view of the object.\nParticularly for point cloud,\nFoldingNet  and\nAtlasNet [ref]11\nare among the first works to propose an object completion based on PointNet [ref]22 features by deforming one or more 2D grids into the desired shape.\nThen, PCN  extended their work by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
