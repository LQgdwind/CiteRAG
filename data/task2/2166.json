Eyeriss 1 only optimized energy efficiency for memory access with the consideration of feature sparsity and was enhanced in  to process sparse and compact networks.\nFurthermore, Cnvlutin  only utilized feature sparsity and Cambricon-X  only considered weight sparsity. As somewhat an extension of Eyeriss, ZeNA  skipped all of the unnecessary computations but did not optimize the memory access.\nSCNN  indeed fully exploited the sparsity with general pattern in both feature and weight, but required additional output coordinates transformation.\nCambricon-S  also fully deployed the feature and weight sparsity but was only applicable for coarse-grained sparsity pattern.\nDUET  could utilize both input and output feature sparsity through output speculation, but cannot support weight sparsity.\nSparTen  could support sparse vector-vector multiplication and improve the hardware utilization, but its energy efficiency was significantly degraded due to the existed additional computation resources.\nEyeriss-V2  was also capable of processing compressed sparse data of both weight and feature, but its NoC consumed a large number of routers and the data transmission or dispatching mechanism was much complicated, which was a burden on performance and energy consumption.\nIn summary, none of these works could fully utilize the fine-grained sparsity both in feature and weight. In regard to the mixed-precision quantization, Stripes  only supported one kind of precision for each layer and TPU  could support 888/161616-bit processing in a very coarse granularity.\nThe work in 7 introduced additional datapath for higher precision processing rather than reusing the computation logic resources, which significantly degraded the performance for processing higher precision cases.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Before the beginning of the era of machine learning, several systolic architecture-based accelerators were proposed for different algorithms  .\nAfter the era of deep learning begins by [ref]27, many accelerators have been proposed for deep neural networks.\nShiDianNao  utilized a systolic array with kernel elements broadcast for convolutions.\nThe work in  implemented AlexNet [ref]27\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
