      "content": "Paper Title: Amortized Analysis via Coalgebra\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn some cases, such as those considered thus far, amortized analysis is precise, where the specification exactly matches the amount of cost used by the implementation.\nHowever, it is common for the specified cost to be an upper bound, since some cases may be cheaper than specified due to internal factors that would be difficult to communicate via a concise specification.\nIn the literature, the equation is used to specify the amortized cost σ$, which is then given an upper bound.\nSince we treat (S,σ) as a specification implementation, though, we find it cleaner to treat σ as the upper bound itself, turning the above equation into the inequality To achieve this categorically, we augment our development slightly: rather than using coalgebras and morphisms for an endo(pro)functor on a category, we consider colax coalgebras and morphisms for a endo-2-(pro)functor on a bicategory.\nThe 2-cells of the bicategory will serve as inequalities for the purpose of cost analysis, drawing inspiration from Grodin et al. . First, we generalize the story about coalgebras of endofunctors, and then we discuss endoprofunctors.\nFixing a bicategory C, let Σ:C→C be an endo-2-functor.\nThis definition of Σ-coalgebra does not materially change, aside from the fact that Σ is a 2-functor.\nHowever, the definition of morphism between Σ-coalgebras will be affected: rather than considering coalgebra morphisms where the given square commutes exactly, we only ask for the square to commute colaxly according to a given 2-cell. Let (D,δ) and (S,σ) be Σ-coalgebras.\nA colax morphism of Σ-coalgebras    from (D,δ) to (S,σ) consists of a morphism Φ:D→S that colaxly preserves the Σ-coalgebra structure: Here, ¯Φ is a 2-cell Φ;σ⇐δ;ΣΦ, serving as a proof of inequality.\nWe refer to ¯Φ as the lax generalized amortization condition. For amortized analysis, we will typically find ourselves using a 2-poset, a bicategory whose 2-cells are mere propositions.\nIn this case, the 2-cell of a morphism is simply a proof that Φ;σ≥δ;ΣΦ.\nConcretely, we will choose C=Poset.\nFollowing Grodin et al. , we will use discrete posets everywhere except for the cost parameter on the writer monad, which will be the natural numbers equipped with the usual increasing ordering, written ω. Let (F¯D,δ) and (F1,σ) be Id-coalgebras.\nThen, a colax morphism from (F¯D,δ) to (F1,σ) consists of a map Φ:¯D→ω and a 2-cell demonstrating that Φ satisfies the lax generalized amortization condition.\nIn this case, the inequality condition exactly requires that matching the traditional amortization condition. Σ-coalgebras and their colax morphisms form a bicategory, where a 2-cell from (Φ,¯Φ) to (Φ′,¯Φ′) is a 2-cell Φ⇒Φ′ in C along with a coherence condition on ¯Φ and ¯Φ′ .\nIn the restricted case of 2-posets, the coherence condition is trivialized.\nThen, a 2-cell Φ≤Φ′ justifies that Φ expresses the amortization argument with at most as much overhead as Φ′.\nFor instance, in Example 5.2, if Φ is a colax morphism, then so is Φ′(d)=Φ(d)+$c for any c:ω, using the commutativity of addition in ω.\nThen, Φ≤Φ′, since Φ′ unnecessarily adds $c cost. The advantages and generalizations from the 1-categorical development translate immediately to the 2-categorical setting.\nFor example, the specification carrier can be altered to expose some state, and the monad can be varied to amortize other effects. Extending Example 2.8, a double-ended queue (or “deque”) data structure can also be implemented by a pair of lists; when an element is meant to be removed from an empty inbox or outbox list, the other list is split in half and shared between the two lists, though the amortized cost is treated as constant.\nDepending on whether there are an even or odd number of elements to split, the amortized cost bound will be either less than or equal to the specified cost, making use of the lax generalized amortization condition. For bicategories C and D, a 2-profunctor Σ:C\\ext@arrow0055-- ↦-- →D is a 2-functor Dop×C→Cat.\nThis definition of Σ-coalgebra does not materially change, aside from the fact that Σ is a 2-functor.\nAs with endo-2-functors, though, the definition of morphism between Σ-coalgebras is modified to only require that the given square commutes colaxly.\n\n\n\nDefinition 5.5.\n\n\nLet (D,δ) and (S,σ) be Σ-coalgebras, where Σ is an endo-2-profunctor.\nA morphism of Σ-coalgebras from (D,δ) to (S,σ) consists of a morphism Φ:D→S that preserves the Σ-coalgebra structure, as before:\n\n\n\nDΣ∘DSΣ∘SδσΦΣ∘Φ¯Φ\n\n\nHere, ¯Φ is a 2-cell Φ;σ⇐δ;Σ∘Φ, serving as a proof of inequality.\nNote that D and S are Cat-valued presheaves.\n\n\nAs in Section 3, when D=よD0 and S=よS0, the situation becomes simpler.\nThe structure preservation requirement can be simplified to the following:\n\n\n\n\n1Σ(D0,D0)Σ(S0,S0)Σ(D0,S0)δΣ(Φ,S0)σΣ(D0,Φ)¯Φ\n\n\nThis condition is the lax generalized amortization condition in the setting of multiple inputs and outputs.\nThe discussion of composition from Section 4 generalizes to the bicategorical setting, where we treat Coalg(-):Strong(C,C)→2Cat as an indexed bicategory.\n\n\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we observed that the condition imposed on a potential function in amortized analysis is generalized by the commutativity condition for a coalgebra in the category of writer monad algebras.\nUsing this perspective, we gave simple, clear accounts of examples, and we generalized amortized analysis to other effectful settings.\nWe expanded this definition to include branching amortization given a commutative cost model using profunctors, and we investigated the composition of amortized data structures via the indexed category of coalgebras.\nFinally, we observed that this development makes sense in a bicategory, where colax coalgebra morphisms give a more relaxed and practically useful definition of amortization.\nThe examples presented have been partially mechanized inside calf   in the Agda proof assistant.\n\n\n\n6.1 Related Work\n\nThis development principally expands upon the early work of Grodin and Harper [ref]8, which first proposed to use coalgebraic techniques to reason about amortized analysis.\nAmortized analysis was first characterized by Tarjan 4, providing a technique for describing the cost of data structure operations that takes into account the evolving state of the data structure and considers cost in aggregate, in contrast with algorithmic worst-case upper bounds on a per-operation basis.\nRepresenting abstract data types as coalgebras and simulations as coalgebra morphisms has been well studied; see, e.g., Jacobs   for an overview.\nFormalization of cost analysis using a writer monad has been studied extensively; see Niu et al.  for a comprehensive review of the literature.\nMechanizations of amortized cost analysis has also been pursued, but in the traditional algebraic form 1 7 .\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Future Work\n\nThe carriers of all endofunctor coalgebras considered are free algebras of the form FA, and the carriers of all endoprofunctor coalgebras considered are Yoneda-embedded free algebras of the form よ(FA).\nWe hope to investigate whether this restricted format is sufficient for practical use cases; if so, we may choose to consider only full subcategories of the category of coalgebras over a signature whose carriers are of the forms given above.\n\n\nIn the present work, we consider coalgebras in a category of algebras.\nThis construction appears in a more balanced manner in the development of mathematical operational semantics, there called a bialgebra, representing a transition system in the style of operational semantics.\nWe leave it to future investigation to understand the connections between amortized analysis and operational semantics.\n\n\nWhile we view amortized analysis as a simulation, i.e. a morphism of coalgebras, we suspect that a double categorical approach may be valuable for understanding a symmetric generalization more akin to bisimulation.\nCospans of coalgebras have been used to generalize bisimulations 3, which can serve as vertical morphisms to add to the bicategory of colax coalgebras.\nAdditionally, Goncharov et al.  propose a double category of (co)lax coalgebras of a lax-double functor, generalizing from a fundamentally double categorical perspective.\n\n\nIn our formalization within calf, the notion of coalgebra morphism is defined explicitly, in contrast with the notion of cost algebra that is built in as a primitive.\nWe hope to incorporate coalgebras and coalgebra morphisms more fundamentally, allowing amortized analysis to be more seamless within the language rather than embedded.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors wish to thank Max New, Yue Niu, and David Spivak for insightful conversations that directly impacted the direction of this work and Zachary Battleman, Runming Li, Parth Shastri, and Jonathan Sterling for fruitful adjacent collaboration that contributed broader inspiration.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research under grant number FA9550-21-0009 (Tristan Nguyen, program manager) and the National Science Foundation under grant number CCF-1901381.
