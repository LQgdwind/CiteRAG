      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Modal Adapter for Text-Video Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first introduce the five datasets, implementation details, evaluation metrics, and the baselines we compare. MSR-VTT¬†[ref]49 contains 10,000 videos, each labeled with about 20 captions. The lengths of videos range from 10 to 32 seconds. We adopt the 9k training split. For the test data, we use the 1k-A test set from [ref]53, which is comprised of 1,000 text-video pairs. MSVD¬†[ref]6 has 1,970 videos, each with approximately 40 associated captions in English. The duration of videos range from 1 to 62 seconds. We use the standard split of 1,200, 100, and 670 videos for training, validation, and test. VATEX¬† is a multilingual dataset with 34,991 video clips.\nWe adopt the official training split with 25,991 videos and report the performance on the validation split with 1,500 videos following HGR¬†. ActivityNet¬† consists of 20,000 YouTube videos. We concatenate all the descriptions of a video and conduct video-paragraph retrieval following the setting from  . The model is evaluated on the ‚Äòval1‚Äô split. DiDeMo¬† contains over 10,000 videos with 40,000 sentences.\nThere are 8,395, 1,065, and 1,004 videos in the training, validation, and test set, respectively.\nFollowing   , we concatenate all sentence descriptions of a video to evaluate video-paragraph retrieval. Implementation details:\nFollowing CLIP4Clip¬†5, we adopt the video encoder and text encoder from the pre-trained CLIP (ViT-B/32).\nThe cross-modal adapter is applied in every layer of two encoders.\nWe set the bottleneck dimension rùëür as {8, 8, 16, 16, 16} and weight-sharing dimension dssubscriptùëëùë†d_{s} as {16, 8, 16, 64, 512} for MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, MSVD, VATEX, ActivityNet.\nFor training settings, we fine-tune our model with the Adam optimizer for 5 epochs (or 20 epochs for the ActivityNet).\nWarm-up is applied in the first 10% of the training process following CLIP4Clip.\nThe learning rate is 1e-5 and decayed with a cosine schedule.\nThe batch size is set to 128, and the temperature œÑùúè\\tau for our parameter-free similarity calculator is set to 5.\nWe set the caption token length as 32 and the frame length as 12 by default.\nFor ActivityNet and DiDeMo, the caption token and frame length are set to 64.\nMore details are in the Appendix. Evaluation metrics: To measure the performance of our proposed method, we use standard retrieval metrics: recall at rank K (R@K, higher is better) and mean rank (MnR, lower is better).\nR@K calculates the proportion of test samples found in the top-K retrieved results. We report results for R@1, R@5, and R@10. MnR calculates the mean ranking of the test samples in the retrieval ranking list. Baselines: There are 5 major baselines for comparison. More details about the baselines are in the Appendix. 1. CLIP4Clip¬†5 is a strong, fully fine-tuned baseline. 2. CoOp¬† applies learnable tokens as the input of the text encoder. Since only these tokens are updated during fine-tuning, it has very few trained parameters. 3. VPT¬†. Contrary to CoOp, Vision Prompt Tuning is proposed for visual backbones. VPT has two variants: VPT-shallow and VPT-deep. The VPT-deep leverages learnable prompts as the input of each transformer layer in the visual encoder. We use VPT-deep in the following experiments. 4. VL-Prompt. Since the previous prompt learning methods only tune vision or language prompts, we further applied learnable vision and language prompts into the vision and language encoder, which we call VL-Prompt. Following VPT, learnable tokens are applied as the input of each transformer block for both visual and text encoder. 5. MaPLe¬†. VL-Prompt is designed to learn vision and language prompts independently without cross-modal interaction, which might limit its performance. Hence, we compare our method with the latest multi-modality prompt learning method, namely MaPLe. It proposes a vision-language coupling function to link vision and language prompts and jointly optimizes them.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: We first introduce the five datasets, implementation details, evaluation metrics, and the baselines we compare. MSR-VTT¬†[ref]49 contains 10,000 videos, each labeled with about 20 captions. The lengths of videos range from 10 to 32 seconds. We adopt the 9k training split. For the test data, we use the 1k-A test set\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
