      "content": "Paper Title: Use-Case-Grounded Simulations for Explanation Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe instantiate our general framework to study the utility of popular post-hoc and by-design explanations (e.g., LIME, SHAP, Anchors, GAM) for three different use cases, spanning a diverse set of problems (forward simulation , counterfactual reasoning [ref]25, and data bugs ). The first two use cases are local problems that focus on base model behavior at a specific point, while the third is a global problem that asks questions about the base model behavior more broadly. The human subject evaluations that studied these use cases primarily focused on studying which explanation method best helps users answer the use case questions. Next, we focus on a key portion of the SimEval framework that must be carefully defined, discussing the data generation process in Step (1) for each use case. Further details on data generation algorithms and agent architectures used for each use case can be found in Appendices B and E. Forward simulation measures whether a user correctly simulates (i.e., predicts) the ML model’s prediction on a given data-point   . Our particular set-up is motivated by Hase and Bansal , where the authors test whether providing users with explanations helps users better predict a base model’s behavior when compared to a control setting in which users are not given explanations. Here, each observation given as input to the SimEval agent consists of a single data-point and explanation (𝐱i,E​(𝐱i,f))subscript𝐱𝑖𝐸subscript𝐱𝑖𝑓(\\mathbf{x}_{i},E(\\mathbf{x}_{i},f)), where 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} is sampled from the base dataset 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. Following the same procedure as Hase and Bansal, we split 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} into train, test, and validation sets. The agent is trained on a dataset of observations from the training set and is then evaluated on observations\nfrom the unseen validation set. The use case label ui=f​(𝐱i)subscript𝑢𝑖𝑓subscript𝐱𝑖u_{i}=f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}) is the model f𝑓f’s output. Counterfactual reasoning is a concept from philosophy used to describe “what if” conditionals that are contrary to fact . Counterfactual reasoning can enable individuals to reason about how to achieve a desired outcome from a prediction model. We study a specific instantiation of counterfactual reasoning from Kumar et al. [ref]25. Our use case examines whether a model’s output f​(𝐱i)𝑓subscript𝐱𝑖f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}) increases for some input 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} in a counterfactual setting where a given feature of 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} is increased. Like forward simulation, each observation used to train and evaluate the agent consists of a single data-point but differs in that each observation also includes the base model prediction on that data-point: (𝐱i,f​(𝐱i),E​(𝐱i,f))subscript𝐱𝑖𝑓subscript𝐱𝑖𝐸subscript𝐱𝑖𝑓(\\mathbf{x}_{i},f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}),E(\\mathbf{x}_{i},f)). For a given input 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i}, the use case label uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} answers the question: “Does f​(𝐱i)𝑓subscript𝐱𝑖f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}) increase if a particular feature of 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} is increased?”. We use the same agent model architecture as in the forward simulation use case. One important difference for counterfactual reasoning is that each base dataset 𝒟isubscript𝒟𝑖\\mathcal{D}_{i} and its corresponding base model fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} can differ across observations. We construct the agent’s observations in this way to prevent the agent from simply memorizing where an individual base model is increasing versus decreasing with respect to a particular feature, instead encouraging the agent to learn a heuristic for this use case that generalizes across different base models (further discussion provided in Appendix D). Data bugs is a use case where the user is asked to predict whether the base model was trained on a dataset containing a systematic error. For this use case, the researcher additionally needs to provide a “bug definition\" B𝐵B, which corrupts the given base dataset. We consider bug definitions studied in Kaur et al.  and summarize their motivation for identifying each of these bugs: The missing value bug occurs when missing values for a feature are imputed using the mean feature value. This can bias the prediction model towards the mean value. The redundant feature bug occurs when the dataset contains features that are redundant, or contain the same predictive information. This can distribute the true importance of the measure between the redundant features, failing to convey the measure’s actual importance. We note that while explanations may not be the only approach to identify these data bugs, the authors demonstrate that model explanations can help users with this use case. A distinguishing feature of the data bugs use case is that the study participants in Kaur et al.  were given a set of data-points and explanations per observation because it might be easier to detect a model bug if given more than one data-point (an illustration provided in the Appendix F.3).\nAs such, each observation for the agent is also a set of data-point, model prediction, and explanation tuples: {(𝐱i(j),f​(𝐱i(j)),E​(𝐱i(j),fi))}j=1Ssuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝐱𝑖𝑗𝑓superscriptsubscript𝐱𝑖𝑗𝐸superscriptsubscript𝐱𝑖𝑗subscript𝑓𝑖𝑗1𝑆\\{(\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(j)},f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(j)}),E(\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(j)},f_{i}))\\}_{j=1}^{S}, where 𝐱i(j)superscriptsubscript𝐱𝑖𝑗\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(j)} denotes the j𝑗jth element in the set which is part of the i𝑖ith observation.\nIn our experiments, we vary the proportion of datasets 𝒟isubscript𝒟𝑖\\mathcal{D}_{i} that have bug B𝐵B. For the datasets that have the bug, we set ui=1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i}=1 and ui=0subscript𝑢𝑖0u_{i}=0 otherwise. For data bugs, each base dataset 𝒟isubscript𝒟𝑖\\mathcal{D}_{i} and its corresponding base model fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} differ across observations because data bugs is a global problem, i.e. the use case label uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} is a property of base model fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i}. Specifically, we derive many 𝒟isubscript𝒟𝑖\\mathcal{D}_{i} by subsampling one dataset 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. This allows us to create a variety of training (and evaluation) examples for the agent with varying use case labels, encouraging the agent to learn a heuristic that generalizes better across different sets of points.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: of popular post-hoc and by-design explanations (e.g., LIME, SHAP, Anchors, GAM) for three different use cases, spanning a diverse set of problems (forward simulation , counterfactual reasoning [ref]25, and data bugs ).
