      "content": "Paper Title: DiffSHEG: A Diffusion-Based Approach for Real-Time Speech-driven Holistic 3D Expression and Gesture Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCo-speech Expression Generation.\nCo-speech Expression Generation, also known as talking head/face generation, has been a topic of interest in the field. Early related methods primarily relied on rule-based procedural approaches [ref]10   , which required significant manual effort despite offering explicit and flexible control.\nWith the advancements in deep learning, data-driven methods          have emerged, focusing on generating images that correspond to audio input. However, these methods often produce distorted pixels and inconsistent 3D results.\nOn another front, some approaches   propose animating 3D faces. More recently, FaceFormer  and CodeTalker  have utilized Transformer models to animate 3D facial vertices using designed attention maps for temporal alignment. While lip movement is closely tied to speech, most data-driven methods for expression animation design deterministic mappings, lacking diversity in eye movement and facial expressions.\nIn contrast to these methods, our approach aims to leverage generative models to generate diverse facial expressions with precise lip movements driven by speech. Co-speech Gesture Generation.\nThe speech-driven gesture generation follows a similar path as face animation: from rule-based      to data-driven methods  4  . The early data-driven methods utilize statistical models to learn speech-gesture mapping.\nAfter that, deterministic models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) 4, convolutional networks , recurrent neural networks   1  7, and Transformers  are explored.\nSince speech-to-gesture mapping involves a many-to-many mapping, numerous state-of-the-art methods utilize generative models like normalizing flow , GAN  and diffusion-based models [ref]1 3 .\nRecently, DiffGesture 3 and DiffuseStyleGesture  first applied diffusion in gesture generation. However, both frameworks require initial gestures during training for long sequence generation, which lacks flexibility and diversity compared to our FOPPAS. LDA [ref]1 utilizes Conformer as the diffusion base network and takes advantage of Translation-invariant positional embedding to sample longer sequences in a go. Nevertheless, it cannot work with streaming audio and may not generalize well on very long sequences. Holistic Co-Speech Expression and Gesture Generation.\nThere are some recent methods   exploring the holistic joint generation of expression and gesture.\nHabibie et al.  first try to synthesize 3D facial and gesture motion at the same time. They propose a CNN-based framework that shares the same speech encoder and uses three decoders to generate distinct whole-body keypoints (i.e., for face, hand, body), followed by a discriminator to provide adversarial loss during training. However, this method learns deterministic mapping, which violates the nature of many-to-many mapping from speech to gesture motion.\nYi et al.  use an encoder-decoder network with pre-trained Wav2vec  audio feature for expression generation and VQ-VAE for gesture generation. Nevertheless, They generate the expressions and gestures separately, losing the coherency between them. Moreover, the VQ-VAE-based methods have limited motion tokens, which may fail to generate motion as diverse and agile as real motions.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Expression Generation, also known as talking head/face generation, has been a topic of interest in the field.
