      "content": "Paper Title: LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrently, there have been many research efforts in coupled SLAM and object tracking. Specifically, researchers perform separate SLAM and object tracking systems simultaneously and estimate the ego-vehicle state and object state with a loosely-coupled approach . In , visual odometry and persistent tracking are performed simultaneously to detect humans in dynamic environments. Additionally, in [ref]15, researchers use neural networks to estimate object motion or segment potential dynamic objects from LiDAR point clouds, and SLAM is performed after filtering out dynamic object points. Another category integrates vehicle state estimation and object tracking into a unified optimization problem for tightly coupled SLAM with object tracking, which mainly revolve around visual-based and range sensor-based methods. In , researchers propose a tightly-coupled approach for SLAMMOT based on stereo visual information. In , Dynamic SLAM is proposed, which performs object detection and tracking based on deep learning during the operation of SLAM in a dynamic environments. Furthermore, DynaSLAM II  demonstrates tightly-coupled multi-object tracking and visual SLAM through instance semantic segmentation and ORB features. Regarding range sensor-based solutions, researchers in [ref]4 propose a feasible tightly-coupled SLAMMOT system based on a laser scanner, deriving a dynamic Bayesian networks algorithm for coupling. In [ref]30, researchers present an online SLAMMOT method using a grid-based approach, achieving pose estimation and object tracking in two-dimensional space. In , researchers present DL-SLOT, which uses sliding window-based graph optimization to simultaneously optimize the vehicle state and dynamic-static object states based on LiDAR. Based on DL-SLOT, the researchers present LIMOT , which is also a tightly-coupled multi-object tracking and LiDAR-inertial odometry system, and it presents a dynamic feature filtering method for the LiDAR odometry module. Although their introduced trajectory-based state prediction improves the tracking performance, this sliding window-based local optimization reduces its ability to perform global optimization for ego-vehicle and object states. In , researchers propose the IMM-SLAMMOT, which integrates interactive multiple model into object tracking for SLAMMOT to deal with the ambiguous motion patterns of objects. The data association in all above tracking methods follows fixed assignments, which tend to struggle if the initial assignment is incorrect. In , researchers propose LIO-SEGMOT for asynchronous estimation of simultaneous ego-motion state and multiple object tracking, which integrates the factor graph based tracking that does not rely on explicit and fixed assignments in data association. However, these methods ignore considering the confidence during tracking, especially in scenarios with continuous missed detection due to occluded or distant objects, which can lead to performance degradation, affecting the accuracy and stability of SLAMMOT.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: state and object state with a loosely-coupled approach .
