      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Generating Real-World Time Series Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the setting from the previous work , the length of time series from these two datasets is set as 24. In total, 3,773 sequences are extracted from Stocks and 19,711 sequences are extracted from Energy. For a fair comparison, we use the same 3-layer GRU with hidden dimension 4 times the size of input features (4√ódx4subscriptùëëùë•4\\times d_{x}) for the autoencoder of RTSGAN. Since there is no global feature yùë¶y in these two datasets, we ignore that part in RTSGAN. The detailed hyper-parameter setting can be found in the Appendix¬†A-A. Compared Methods.\nWe compare RTSGAN with COT-GAN¬†[ref]7, TimeGAN¬†, RCGAN¬†[ref]6, C-RNN-GAN¬†[ref]11 for complete time series generation. Additionally, we consider the performance of WaveNet¬† and its GAN counterpart WaveGAN . We follow the same metrics used in¬† to measure the diversity, fidelity and utility of synthetic data from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Quantitative evaluation. We adopt the following metrics to quantitatively evaluate the synthetic data. a) Discriminative Score. It is a quantitative measure of similarity between real data and synthetic data. We train a 2-layer LSTM  to distinguish between time series from the real and synthetic datasets as a supervised learning task. We can then get classification accuracy on the held-out test set and the discriminative score is |0.5‚àíaccuracy|0.5accuracy|0.5-\\mathrm{accuracy}|. Lower discriminative score indicates higher similarity between the real and synthetic datasets.\nb) Predictive Score. To evaluate how well the synthetic data maintain the temporal dynamics, we perform next-step prediction task under the ‚Äútrain on synthetic, test on real‚Äù (TSTR) setting [ref]6. We train a 2-layer LSTM predictor and evaluate the model on the original dataset. Predictive score is calculated by the mean absolute error (MAE) and a lower score indicates better performance. Qualitative evaluation. We apply t-SNE  and PCA  on both the real and synthetic datasets after flattening the temporal dimension. This gives us qualitative assessments of how close the distribution of the synthetic data is to that of the real data in 2D space.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: is no global feature yùë¶y in these two datasets, we ignore that part in RTSGAN.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
