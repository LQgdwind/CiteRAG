      "content": "Paper Title: Probing Representation Forgetting in Supervised and Unsupervised Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe design of CL methods is often focused on mitigating the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, with aspects such as maximization of forward and backward transfer between tasks taken as secondary¬†7. One class of methods focuses on bypassing this problem by growing architectures over time as new tasks arrive¬† 5  . Under the fixed architecture setting, one can identify two main categories. The first category of methods rely on storing and re-using samples from the previous history while learning new ones; this includes approaches such as GEM¬†7 and ER¬†. The second category of methods encode the knowledge of the previous tasks in a prior that is used to regularize the training of the new task ¬†6 2   . A classic method in this vein is Learning without Forgetting (LwF)¬†6, which mitigates forgetting by a regularization term that distills knowledge¬†8 from the earlier tasks. The network representations from earlier stages are recorded, and are used during training for a new task to regularize the objective by distilling knowledge from the earlier state of the network.\nSimilarly, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)¬†0 preserves the knowledge of the past tasks through a quadratic penalty on the network parameters important to the earlier tasks. The importance of the parameters is approximated via the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix¬†. The scale of the importance matrix, ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, determines the network‚Äôs preference towards preserving old representations or acquiring new ones for the current task.\nIn¬†Sec.¬†4.1 we examine the effectiveness of these approaches in mitigating representation forgetting. Recent works on elucidating the nature of catastrophic forgetting have examined the influence of task sequence¬†, network architecture¬†, and change in representation similarity¬†8. Our work is related in spirit to¬†8 as we pursue measuring how much forgetting has occurred on the learned representation and we additionally study this for intermediate representations. One significant difference is that in¬†8, the authors use linear CKA (centred Kernel Alignment)¬†3 to measure the similarity between intermediate representations influenced by forgetting, while in our work we measure how much forgetting has occurred on the representations using LP. Several recent works have also studied the behavior of networks with increasing model capacity. In 9 the authors examine several common architectures under the task incremental setting and demonstrate that pre-training is essential to combat forgetting and to achieve high performance on all tasks. They conclude that training only with larger models yields no benefit for continual learning. Our analysis revisit this setting and take a closer look at how representation forgetting is affected with increase in model width and depth. Several works¬†[ref]40 have focused on modifying the last layer of a classification network to make more effective use of the representation for prior tasks. This indirectly highlights the fact that the last layer can be modified to yield better performance on prior tasks. Particularly¬†[ref]40 0 use a buffer of old examples at training time to improve learning and then use them at evaluation time to construct a class mean prototype. This allows for more effective use of the representations of the network. These works consider settings where the CL methods are used to control forgetting, while we also emphasize that naive continuation of training under task shift can yield strong representations. Our work can also be seen as both a way to explain and to motivate the need for such approaches. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is becoming increasingly popular in visual representation learning. Some of the best performing methods rely on contrastive learning¬† 5. These methods have been recently evaluated in a limited continual learning setting¬†9 where a sequence was trained on non-iid unsupervised streaming data and then applied in transfer learning settings on multiple datasets. However, forgetting was not evaluated. In contrast our work, which also uses a SSL loss, focuses on the LP evaluation and the study of representation forgetting with respect to previously seen distributions. Contrastive methods are also often used in the supervised setting, for example, the recently popular SupCon loss¬†1.\nIn¬† and¬†0 the use of SupCon is proposed in the online class-incremental setting in combination with experience replay. Our work too considers SupCon as one of the supervised representation learning approaches. However distinct from the other works we consider it in the offline task-incremental setting. We do not look at its use in combination with replay or other approaches, but study the effect of standard finetuning with SupCon loss, distinct from¬†, where it is used to facilitate separation of contrasts between old and new classes, specific to the class incremental setting.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: yields no benefit for continual learning.
