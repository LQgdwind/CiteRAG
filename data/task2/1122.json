      "content": "Paper Title: RANC: Reconfigurable Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, neuromorphic computing architectures have prompted interest from numerous disciplines due to their implications in understanding biological brain behavior as well as their efficiency for deploying machine learning algorithms [ref]1.\nNeuromorphic computing architectures are non-von Neumann architectures that exploit the strengths of biologically inspired neural networks and couple together massively parallel computations with low power execution.\nThese aspects have been demonstrated successfully for applications such as data classification [ref]2   [ref]5  , LIDAR and control applications , optimization problems  , signal processing , and even floating-point arithmetic . In particular, IBM’s TrueNorth  and Intel’s Loihi  are canonical examples of architectures that utilize so-called “leaky-integrate-and-fire” (LIF) neurons as their baseline neuron model.\nOn top of this, each platform implements unique features such as stochastic neuron behavior in TrueNorth or multicast routing in Loihi, but the fundamental behavior is primarily influenced by the underlying LIF neuron models.\nIn designing architectures for use in neuromorphic computing, there are an incredibly large number of configuration parameters – such as number and precision of weights per neuron, neuron and axon counts per core, network topology, and neuron behavior – that are not fundamentally inherent to the architecture but rather a product of physical constraints of architectural design.\nTo enable productive research in these kinds of architectures, there is a need for an open-source, configurable emulation environment where hardware engineers and application designers can investigate performance bottlenecks and explore design optimizations that stress evaluation of their full hardware-software stack before committing to silicon. Fundamentally, such research is not possible with existing commercial solutions as all existing chips are presented to the end-user as pre-fabricated ASICs, and\nthe programmer is restricted to the architecture constraints when mapping emerging applications.\nThese restrictions impact the academic research community’s ability to explore novel ideas without absorbing the costs associated with manufacturing custom silicon of their own.\nAs such, the lack of open-source neuromorphic architecture emulation tools has a dampening effect on the research community’s ability to converge towards the next generation of neuromorphic architectures.\nAs a point of comparison, FPGA architectures have continuously evolved, since their inception, from homogeneous island-style, 2-input lookup table-based designs to heterogeneous, 6-input lookup table-based designs with DSP and memory blocks to meet the needs of the ever growing application needs.\nOpen source tools  have played a key role in this progress.\nWe envision that neuromorphic computing is at a similar crossroads, with a large investment in architectural research emerging as we continue to reach the limits of transistor scaling.\nTo facilitate the development of future neuromorphic platforms, there is a need for a cohesive suite that enables easy and rapid prototyping of novel architectures.\nThere is a large body of work on neuromorphic architecture research through software based simulation environments that\nsupport a rich set of biological features    .\nThese software simulation tools are coupled with a strong drive for compiler designs  that can effectively restructure applications and enable maximizing resource usage under prefabricated hardware constraints.\nWe approach this area from the complementary perspective of designing reconfigurable neuromorphic architectures that can be adapted to a variety of application requirements and enable rich research to be conducted on fundamental questions about applications and architectures for neuromorphic computing.\nTo this end, in this study we propose the following contributions: We introduce RANC: a Reconfigurable Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing. RANC is an open source software and hardware ecosystem111Source available at https://ua-rcl.github.io/RANC that seeks to make neuromorphic architectures widely accessible to researchers and application developers through a cohesive programming and testing environment. We establish a baseline reconfigurable architecture, and we demonstrate RANC’s configurability by recreating TrueNorth behaviorally in both C++ simulation and FPGA emulation environments through application mapping studies covering\nclassification of MNIST and EEG images, and vector matrix multiplication (VMM) execution. We reveal application-specific bottlenecks arising from architectural constraints that require application developers to take inefficient implementation approaches through architecture-specific workarounds and demonstrate this claim with case studies on VMM and convolutional neural network execution. Driven by these application bottlenecks, we propose architectural modifications that span neuron behavior and hardware configuration changes and exemplify the capability of RANC to enable rich architectural trade studies in the area of neuromorphic computing. Together, these changes demonstrate the massive efficiencies to be gained in exploring alternative or heterogeneous neuromorphic architectures. A preliminary version of this work appeared in the “Reconfigurable Architectures Workshop (RAW 2020)”  where we presented a baseline FPGA emulation platform implemented on a Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ ZCU102 with a focus on FPGA specific design decisions and evaluated its ability to recreate TrueNorth via case studies involving MNIST and VMM.\nIn this paper, we expand the preliminary work with the following contributions: We expand RANC to a full-stack neuromorphic research platform by integrating a software simulation and library stack on top of the previous emulator. We develop software and hardware support in the RANC ecosystem for seamless deployment\nonto Xilinx Alveo datacenter-scale FPGAs. We present a detailed architectural discussion on RANC’s ability to replicate TrueNorth. We extensively verify previous results regarding recreation of TrueNorth in RANC by extending MNIST verification to 9 and 30 core network based implementations and expanding this verification to include EEG image classification. We improve evaluations on core RANC components through cycle-by-cycle analysis of VMM execution, expose\nand enable optimizations that are only possible with architectural customization. We demonstrate the utility of RANC in exploring architectures with heterogeneous crossbar configurations for convolution using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and CIFAR-10 image classifications. We thoroughly explore scalability on the Alveo U250 and demonstrate RANC’s ability to emulate in hardware as many as 259K neurons and 73.3M synapses. We present an exhaustive look at other neuromorphic computing environments and discuss RANC’s role. In the next section, we will present an overview of each component in the RANC architecture, and we will discuss usage of the simulation and emulation environments.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: have prompted interest from numerous disciplines due to their implications in understanding biological brain behavior as well as their efficiency for deploying machine learning algorithms [ref]1.\nNeuromorphic computing architectures are non-von Neumann architectures that exploit the strengths of biologically inspired neural networks and couple together massively parallel computations\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
