      "content": "Paper Title: Sequence-to-Sequence Predictive Model: From Prosody To Communicative Gestures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmbodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) are virtual agents endowed with the capacity to communicate verbally and non-verbally . We present existing works that aim to compute communicative gestures ECAs should display while speaking. Many researchers agree that gestures and speech are generated from a common process  . Most prior computational models simplify this relationship into that gestures can be inferred from speech. The earliest gesture generators for ECAs are rule-based  . However, the relationship between speech and gestures is complex. Lately, to deal with the lack of precise knowledge, researchers develop machine-learning based gesture generators. A common approach among the machine-learning based generators is generating a sequence of the gestures based on the acoustic. These techniques have a similar formulation: they express the problem as a time series prediction problem where the input is the acoustic and the output is the gesture motion. Hasegawa et al use Bi-Directional LSTM  with MFCC as their input. Kucherenko et al extend the work of Hasegawa et al by compacting the representation of the motion by using Denoising Autoencoder [ref]30. Kucherenko et al also experiment with other prosodic features, namely the energy of the speech signal, the fundamental frequency contour logarithm, and its derivative. Kucherenko et al report their technique yields a more natural movement. Ginosar et al  use UNet and use MFCC as their input. They also add an adversarial learning component to enable mapping an input to multiple possible outputs. Ferst et al  expand the use of adversarial learning further. They use multiple discriminators to evaluate the generated motion according to several qualities: phase structure, motion realism, intra-batch consistency, and displacement. They use fundamental frequency (F0) and MFCC as their input. Interestingly, embedded within their model architecture, there is a phase classifier. The classifier takes the three-dimensional velocities of the joints and the F0 as input and yield the phase (preparation, hold, stroke, and other). The purpose of the phase classifier is to enforce of a realistic phase structure. For example, a preparation cannot be immediately followed by a retraction. Among the machine-learning based generators, there are also text-based generators. Their aim is to generate ideational gestures. These gestures are related to the semantics, which are inferred from the text. Bergmann et al  use Bayesian Decision Network to generate iconic gestures, by using the referent features and the pre-extracted discourse context. Ishii et al  use Conditional Random Field to generate a whole body pose. This technique does not model temporal dependency: the technique works at the level of phrase and the dependency between consecutive phrases is not modeled. Ahuja and Morency [ref]1 use a joint-embedding of text and body pose. The text is processed by using Word2Vec . The technique generates whole body pose including arm movement. There are also approaches which learns gesture statically. Nihei et al  use neural network to statically learn iconic gestures from a set of images. They use various images of similar objects, feed them into a pre-trained image-recognition neural network, and then extract the simplified shapes from the network. These simplified shapes can be reproduced as iconic gestures. Lücking et al  attempt to statically gather the typical metaphoric gesture for each image schema by running a human experiment. Image schema itself is a recurring pattern of reasoning to map one entity to another . There is also an approach which use both the acoustic and the text. Kucherenko et al  build a neural network model which takes both the text and the acoustic as the input to generate body movements. The text is represented as BERT embedding and the acoustic is represented by log-power mel-spectrogram. Because this technique takes both the text and acoustic as the input, in principle it can generate both the beat gestures and the ideational gestures. Interestingly, in their subjective study, they find that their respondents have a low agreement on which segments of the gestures represent the semantic. Some interesting developments we observe in the recent work are the shift toward neural network  [ref]30   [ref]1   , the use of adversarial learning  , and the use of word embedding [ref]1  . Neural network has been successful in recent years, which therefore makes it into a reasonable choice for machine learning problems. Adversarial learning enables one input to be correctly mapped to multiple different outputs. Effectively, it allows the same acoustic input to be mapped into different body movements. Word embedding is a representation of word as a vector. Two similar words will have their corresponding vectors also close to each other. Therefore, given 2 similar text inputs, the outputs would also be similar. Our work is a bridge between the acoustic-based generators and the text-based generators. We attempt to tell when a virtual agent should perform a certain type of gesture. We distinguish beat gestures from ideational. First of all, the ideational gestures convey a specific meaning, beat gestures mark the speech rhythm. Moreover, beat gestures tend to appear during the theme while ideational gestures tend to appear  during the rheme that carry the new information . Additionally, we also distinguish the stroke phase from the other phases because the stroke phase is known to usually be near the pitch accent . Although it can be argued that a technique which learns the body movements from both the text and the acoustic also implicitly learns the timing, there is also a benefit from separating the learning of the timing and the shape. By learning them separately, it would enable different models to be plugged in. For example, as Kucherenko et al  find in their subjective study, the respondents have a low agreement on which segments are actually the semantic gestures. It suggests that the semantic gestures they generate probably happen to be not so prominent. However, because they have only one model, attempts to make the semantic gestures more prominent might change something else. Our usage of gesture phases as the classes is similar to . However, their phases do not differentiate between beat and ideational gestures. Besides that, their phase classifier takes both acoustic and body movements as input while we do not have any body movement data. We evaluate our results by using a sequence comparison technique which tolerates shift and dilation. The spirit is similar to adversarial learning: for each input, there can be multiple correct output.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Hasegawa et al use Bi-Directional LSTM  with MFCC as their input.
