Apart from yTsubscript𝑦𝑇y_{T}, they also leverage domain knowledge (label propagation-based source identification) to design a new node feature (1−α)​(I−α​L)​yT1𝛼𝐼𝛼𝐿subscript𝑦𝑇(1-\\alpha)(I-\\alpha L)y_{T} that captures the feature of centrality, where α𝛼\\alpha is a hyperparameter and L𝐿L is the normalized Laplacian matrix of the network.\nInstead of localizing sources directly, other works proposed to address it as an inverse problem of graph diffusion.\nFor example, Wang et al. introduced a graph diffusion model where W1,2subscript𝑊12W_{1,2} are trainable parameters. After trained, the diffusion model can be inversed with two fix point iterations to get a source node estimation xMsuperscript𝑥𝑀x^{M} from the diffusion vector yTsubscript𝑦𝑇y_{T}: Huang et al.[ref]91 integrated forward (source localization) and inverse (graph diffusion) perspectives together and proposed a two-stage approach: In the coarse stage, a GNN model generates coarse-grained source predictions, while in the fine stage, a generative diffusion model quantifies the prediction uncertainty by simulating the dissemination process to get a finer result.\nFor critical node detection, the definition of critical nodes in different fields also varies correspondingly.\nMunikoti et al. defined critical nodes as those whose removal substantially decreases network robustness (measured by effective graph resistance and weighted spectrum) and employed GNNs to learn the criticality score of nodes in an end-to-end fashion.\nZhao et al. adopted a similar definition, but they used the motif matrix rather than the adjacency matrix for message-passing to consider high-order interactions.\nRegarding social influence, Qiu et al. defined critical nodes as those that can be easily influenced by their neighbors.\nSpecifically, they break the network G=(𝒱,ℰ)𝐺𝒱ℰG=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}) into ego-networks Gi=(𝒱i,ℰi)subscript𝐺𝑖subscript𝒱𝑖subscriptℰ𝑖G_{i}=(\\mathcal{V}_{i},\\mathcal{E}_{i}) for each node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}, where 𝒱isubscript𝒱𝑖\\mathcal{V}_{i} is the set of nodes that can reach visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} within k𝑘k hops and ℰi=(𝒱i×𝒱i)∩ℰsubscriptℰ𝑖subscript𝒱𝑖subscript𝒱𝑖ℰ\\mathcal{E}_{i}=(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\times\\mathcal{V}_{i})\\cap\\mathcal{E}, and proposed a GCN-based end-to-end framework to estimate that given the ego-network Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i} and the neighbour nodes’ activation states sjt∈{0,1}​(j∈𝒱i)superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑗𝑡01𝑗subscript𝒱𝑖s_{j}^{t}\\in\\{0,1\\}~{}(j\\in\\mathcal{V}_{i}) at time t𝑡t, whether visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} will be activated before time t+Δ​t𝑡Δ𝑡t+\\Delta t. Formally, they trained the model with the following loss function: Link formation prediction.\nSome work leveraged graph embedding methods to predict missing links. For example,\nHamilton et al. proposed an inductive framework called GraphSAGE (SAmple and aggreGatE) that learns node embeddings by sampling a fixed-size set of nodes’ neighbors and aggregating their embeddings.\nIn contrast, Qiu et al. a NetMF method which generates embeddings by matrix factorization. They proved that typical random walk-based graph embedding methods such as DeepWalk and node2vec can be actually viewed as implicit factorization of a closed-form matrix when the length of random walks goes to infinity, and further proposed to factorize the closed-form matrix explicitly to get the node embedding with a better performance.\nHowever, none of these methods are efficient enough to scale to large networks with tens of millions of nodes. To address this problem, Qiu et al. further proposed a NetSMF method, which specifies the dense matrix used by NetMF while keeping spectrally close to the original one to reduce the computational complexity. NetSMF can largely reduce the computational complexity and scale to large networks while maintaining the link prediction performance compared to NetMF.\nApart from these graph embedding-based methods, there are also works predicting missing links with GNN in a supervised way. In these works, to predict whether two nodes (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) in a network (𝒱,ℰ)𝒱ℰ(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}) are likely to have a link, researchers typically consider the local subgraph of their hℎh-hop neighbors (𝒱u,vh,ℰu,vh)superscriptsubscript𝒱𝑢𝑣ℎsuperscriptsubscriptℰ𝑢𝑣ℎ(\\mathcal{V}_{u,v}^{h},\\mathcal{E}_{u,v}^{h}): where 𝒩uhsuperscriptsubscript𝒩𝑢ℎ\\mathcal{N}_{u}^{h} is the set of nodes that can reach u𝑢u within hℎh hops. For example,\nto predict the link between nodes (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v), Zhang et al.85 proposed to extract the subgraph induced by their hℎh-hop neighbors and then apply an MLP to the adjacency matrix of this subgraph to predict the likelihood of the link between them.\nZhang and Chen replaced the MLP with GNNs to empower it to handle local subgraphs with different sizes and learn from node features as well as an adjacency matrix. They also theoretically proved that remote parts of the network contribute little to link existence, and thus a small hℎh is enough to make accurate predictions.\nWang et al. proposed a Neo-GNN method inspired by the classical Common Neighbour (CN) method. CN predicts the likelihood of the link between two nodes with a score function that counts their common neighbors, i.e. In contrast, Neo-GNN considers multi-hop common neighbors and introduces a learnable function to improve performance: where A𝐴A is the adjacency matrix, dusubscript𝑑𝑢d_{u} is the degree of node u𝑢u, f𝑓f is a learnable function, β𝛽\\beta and l𝑙l are hyperparameters. Network property prediction.\nAhmad et al. introduced a spatio-temporal GCN to predict the potential cascading failure in power systems.\nSpecifically, they first constructed a graph to represent the power system, where each node is a bus with a specific load and/or generator and each edge is a transmission line or a transformer. They then use a GCN to extract the spatial features of each node and an LSTM to incorporate temporal information. The output is finally fed into a classifier to predict whether a cascade failure will happen.\nLiu et al. also focused on the cascade failure in power systems while they aimed to identify as many critical cascading failures as possible for a given network.\nTo achieve this goal, they proposed a GNN-based framework that can learn the vulnerability of nodes, and further leverage the vulnerability to heuristically search for the critical cascading failures.\nPanagopoulos et al. proposed a GNN-based model to predict the outbreak of COVID-19 in different countries. Specifically, they first constructed a graph where nodes correspond to regions and edge weights to mass mobility between their endpoints and then adopted a family of GNNs to learn the node representation based on their connectivity and history. Based on these representations, they can predict whether COVID-19 will outbreak in the graph with another classifier. They also leveraged Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to make their model generalizable among different countries, which addressed the problem that the availability of data is limited at the start of the outbreak in a country.\nWang et al.44 focused on a similar problem and adopted a GNN-based model as well. However, they further considered the underlying causal mechanisms to solve the challenge that epidemic data is sparse and noisy and a deep learning model thus tends to overfit. Specifically, they leveraged a causal model such as susceptible(S)-infected(I)-recovered(R)-deceased(D) (SIRD) or SIR to predict the infected cases and leveraged a GNN to generate the residual between the predicted and observed infected cases.\n\nReference markers found: [91]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]91: After trained, the diffusion model can be inversed with two fix point iterations to get a source node estimation xMsuperscript𝑥𝑀x^{M} from the diffusion vector yTsubscript𝑦𝑇y_{T}: Huang et al.[ref]91 integrated forward (source localization) and inverse (graph diffusion) perspectives together and proposed a two-stage approach: In the coarse stage, a GNN model generates coarse-grained\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
