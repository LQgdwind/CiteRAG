      "content": "Paper Title: Domain Reasoning in TopKAT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKleene algebra with tests (KAT) is an algebraic framework that extends Kleene\nalgebra with an embedded Boolean algebra to model control structures like\nif-statement and while-loops . This extension enables us to\nreason about several properties of imperative programs. For example, one of the\nkey early results in the area was that KAT can encode Hoare logic, in the sense\nthat any proof in the logic’s propositional fragment can be carried out\nfaithfully using KAT equations [ref]27 . Some applications, however, require us to look beyond KAT. For example, Zhang\net al. 1 recently proved that KAT alone\ncannot be used to encode incorrectness logic  —a close cousin of Hoare logic with\napplications in bug finding  . A similar result was proved by\nStruth , who showed that KAT cannot encode weakest liberal\npreconditions. If we view a program as a relation between its input and output\nstates, both of these limitations arise from KAT’s lack of power to encode the\n(co)domain of a relation. Indeed, Möller et\nal.  proved that incorrectness logic could be\nencoded by extending KAT with a codomain operation. Independently, Zhang et\nal. provided a similar encoding 1 by\nextending KAT with a top element, which can be used to express inequalities\nbetween codomains. They dubbed the resulting algebraic structure a TopKAT. The present paper investigates the expressive power of TopKAT as a tool for\n(co)domain reasoning. As noted by Zhang et al. 1,\none limitation of TopKAT is that it is\nnot expressive enough to derive all valid equations between relations. More\nprecisely, Zhang et al.’s encoding of incorrectness logic interprets the top\nelement of the algebra as the complete relation, which relates all pairs of\nprogram states. Under this interpretation, the inequality p⊤p≥ptop𝑝𝑝𝑝p\\top p\\geq p is\nvalid, but unprovable using the theory of\nTopKAT 1. This a potential issue when using\nTopKAT to reason in incorrectness logic: though Zhang et al.’s encoding covers\nall the rules of propositional incorrectness logic, there could be inequalities\nabout (co)domain that fall outside this fragment and cannot be established solely\nby the theory of TopKAT. Pous et al.   were able to make\nsome progress on the issue, by showing we can obtain a complete axiomatic system\nfor relational models TopKATs by adding in the inequality p⊤p≥ptop𝑝𝑝𝑝p\\top p\\geq p as an\nadditional axiom. In this paper, we look at the question from a different angle,\ninstead of working with a more complex theory,\nwe show that the original theory of TopKAT is complete with respect to relational models\nfor (co)domain comparisons, namely the inequalities of the form\n⊤t1≥⊤t2topsubscript𝑡1topsubscript𝑡2\\top t_{1}\\geq\\top t_{2} or t1⊤≥t2⊤limit-fromsubscript𝑡1toplimit-fromsubscript𝑡2topt_{1}\\top\\geq t_{2}\\top where t1,t2subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2t_{1},t_{2} are KAT terms.\nSince these inequalities suffice to encode incorrectness logic,\nthis completeness result lays a solid foundation for encoding program logics in TopKAT.\nWe have also showed that this completeness result is tight,\nin the sense that it does not extend to the case where t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} contain the top element,\nby explicitly constructing two TopKAT terms that witness the incompleteness. The result above is enabled by the homomorphic structure of the\nreduction 1  from\nTopKAT to KAT. This discovery also let us shorten the proofs of\nprevious results 1, and enables systematic generation of TopKAT complete interpretations from complete interpretations of KAT. We believe that this new representation of\nthe reduction technique could also be of independent interest. Structure of this paper and contributions:\nIn Section 2,\nwe present several previous results on KAT and TopKAT.\nInspired by universal algebra ,\nwe characterize fundamental concepts, like interpretation and completeness,\nusing homomorphisms.\nIn Section 3,\nwe uncover additional structure of the reduction technique  \nin the case of TopKAT: the reduction from TopKAT to KAT is a TopKAT homomorphism.\nThis discovery not only allows us to simplify several previous\nresults 1 by avoiding tedious induction proofs;\nbut also enables the techniques used in the later section.\nSection 4 presents the completeness results of TopKAT\nwith respect (co)domain comparison.\nThe codomain completeness result is proven by\nan equality that connects codomain operation with the language interpretation,\nand the domain completeness is then proven by applying the\ncodomain completeness result to the opposite TopKAT.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: one of the\nkey early results in the area was that KAT can encode Hoare logic, in the sense\nthat any proof in the logic’s propositional fragment can be carried out\nfaithfully using KAT equations [ref]27 .
