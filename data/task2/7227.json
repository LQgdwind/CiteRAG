      "content": "Paper Title: Cheetah: Bridging the Gap Between Machine Learning and Particle Accelerator Physics with High-Speed, Differentiable Simulations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe field of programmatic beam dynamics modelling is very mature. There exist various well-established simulation codes for modelling beam dynamics in particle accelerators, e.g. ASTRA , Bmad [ref]19, Elegant , and MAD-X .\nAs Python has become increasingly popular in scientific computing, many of these have been augmented with Python adaptors. Further, the Ocelot , Xsuite , and Bmad-X 3 simulation codes have been specifically developed directly in Python. Some calculations in Cheetah are based on those used in Ocelot. NN surrogate modelling is also finding increased use to acquire fast and accurate models of complex beam behaviours  .\nAn NN surrogate model is trained to infer the space charge field in a vacuum chamber cross-section using a physics-informed loss function including a partial differential equation with the Lorentz factor, elliptical bi-Gaussian charge density, and boundary condition in . An overview of opportunities for differentiable programming in particle physics instruments is given in 4. Specialised handcrafted differentiable simulations have been constructed for various applications.\nA handcrafted differentiable physics model is used as the discriminator in a  generative adversarial network (GAN) setup to train an NN to reconstruct time-domain measurements of X-ray pulses without labelled data in 5.\nIn 6 7 the hysteron density function of a Preisach model is fitted to accurately model hysteresis from experimental data.\nIn 7 8, a differentiable beam dynamics simulation of a tomographic beamline is used to reconstruct phase space distributions from experimental screen images.\nSimultaneous calibration of all detector parameters of a liquid argon time projection chamber using a differentiable simulation of the latter is performed in 9.\nIn 0, a differentiable self-consistent space charge simulation model based on the truncated power series algebra (TPSA) is developed to speed up the simulated optimisation of accelerator design parameters under consideration of space charge induced effects. A similar effort to Cheetah is pursued in 3, where the authors introduce Bmad-X, a library-agnostic differentiable particle tracking code written in Python based on Bmad. They demonstrate the application of Bmad-X on examples of beamline optimisation, model calibration, and phase-space reconstruction.\nBmad-X and Cheetah present very similar advantages, with both offering fast differentiable beam dynamics simulations.\nHowever, they differ in some aspects.\nIn contrast to Cheetah, Bmad-X can be used with backend libraries other than PyTorch, while Cheetah has a stronger focus on fast computations and currently supports a larger number of lattice elements and conversions from other simulation codes.\nSpecifically, the goal of Cheetah is to bridge the gap between fast hand-crafted and data-driven particle accelerator models, streamlining their applications to various applications. As such, it aims to enable researchers to collect low-fidelity data fast and to use differentiable models to train ML models or perform complex system identification. An early preliminary version of Cheetah was first presented in 1. It was not yet designed to support automatic differentiation and lacked the majority of the features Cheetah now has.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: The field of programmatic beam dynamics modelling is very mature.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
