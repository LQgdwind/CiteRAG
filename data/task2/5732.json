      "content": "Paper Title: SVDE: Scalable Value-Decomposition Exploration for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo encourage agents to explore in SARL tasks, prior works generally hope to visit novel states more frequently, i.e., those states visited less often .\nCount-based exploration methods provide an example of such bonuses, where the intrinsic reward is generally ri=1/n​(s)superscript𝑟𝑖1𝑛𝑠r^{i}=1/{n(s)}, where n𝑛n is the number of visits to the state [ref]45.\nAs the problem becomes more complex, the state space gradually increases, and almost every state can only be explored once.\nAn alternative is to calculate the prediction error associated with the agent’s transition .\nSince the environment only feeds back a team reward, there exists a credit assignment problem in MARL tasks.\nWe introduce an intrinsic reward based on prediction error, and calculate it for each agent’s local observations, so as to encourage the agent to explore.\nIn this way, we extend the intrinsic reward design from SARL to MARL [ref]15.\nAnd since each agent calculates its intrinsic reward based on its own local observations, the intrinsic reward can be used to represent the contribution of the agent to the whole, thus solving the problem of credit assignment to a certain extent. The IRD network is shown in Fig. 5.\nIt consists of a target network whose parameters are randomly initialized and fixed in the same way as in RND , and a predictor network trained with data collected by the agent.\nThe fixed parameters of the target network are intended to reduce the randomness of the target fitting function, so that prediction errors are all caused by the novelty of the observation.\nThus, the prediction error is large if similar observations are rarely seen, resulting in a higher intrinsic reward that encourages the agent to explore. The target and predictor networks accept the same input, which is the local observations of the agent, and output feature vectors of the same dimension: f^:𝒪→ℝk,g:𝒪→ℝk:^𝑓→𝒪superscriptℝ𝑘𝑔:→𝒪superscriptℝ𝑘\\hat{f}:\\mathcal{O}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k},g:\\mathcal{O}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k}.\nWe employ weight sharing across the network of agents.\nThe agent ID is included in the local observation to allow agents to have different intrinsic rewards.\nThe intrinsic reward and mean-square error (MSE) loss function are respectively defined as where ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} is the batch size sampled from the replay buffer, m𝑚m is a random time step as in DRQN [ref]46, and l𝑙l is the maximum length of an episode. We normalize the observations ot+1isuperscriptsubscript𝑜𝑡1𝑖o_{t+1}^{i} and intrinsic reward rt+1isuperscriptsubscript𝑟𝑡1𝑖r_{t+1}^{i} to keep the intrinsic reward at a consistent magnitude.\nA standard Gaussian distribution is set for observations o​b​s:𝐍​(0,1):𝑜𝑏𝑠𝐍01obs:\\mathbf{N}(0,1) and intrinsic rewards r​w:𝐍​(0,1):𝑟𝑤𝐍01rw:\\mathbf{N}(0,1), which regularly update the mean and standard deviation based on the network’s inputs and outputs:\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: .\nCount-based exploration methods provide an example of such bonuses, where the intrinsic reward is generally ri=1/n​(s)superscript𝑟𝑖1𝑛𝑠r^{i}=1/{n(s)}, where n𝑛n is the number of visits to the state [ref]45.\nAs the problem becomes more complex, the state space gradually increases, and almost every state can only be explored once.\nAn alternative is to calculate the prediction error associated\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
