      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Stock Price Movement Classification Using News Articles Based on Embeddings and Label Smoothing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo get the vectors at the word level, we used the CBOW version of Word2Vec 111We used the gensim library version of Word2Vec. available at: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html\ndue to this version having faster training and slightly better accuracy for frequent words [ref]10. The model was trained with the data from news article headlines and then, for each headline i𝑖i, the Word2Vec model was used to create word embeddings wksubscript𝑤𝑘w_{k} of dimension 60. All the word embeddings in the headline were further transformed into key vectors niKsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝐾n_{i}^{K} of dimension 60, using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency score (TFIDF) γksubscript𝛾𝑘\\gamma_{k}\n. The key vector is defined by: TFIDF is a statistic that gives unique words in a document more importance by computing the number of times the word appears in a document and the number of documents that the word appears in a collection  Equation (2) captures the headlines as word-level embeddings. However it is not able to get the context of the headline itself. For example, negation could change the meaning of a sentence with one word. To capture the meaning in a more context sensitive way, we utilized a BERT encoder as a service to output vectors of 1024. The embedding output from the BERT is achieved through the self-attention mechanism in the BERT achieved through transformers [ref]14 [ref]15. We then reduced the dimensions to 256 by using principal component analysis (PCA), thus reducing the number of parameters in the neural network and creating value vectors niVsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝑉n_{i}^{V} from the headlines of articles. Every news article nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} was then transformed into a pair of vectors (niK,niVsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝐾superscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝑉n_{i}^{K},n_{i}^{V}), utilizing Word2Vec for the word-level “Key” vector niKsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝐾n_{i}^{K}, and BERT for the context-level “Value” vector niVsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝑉n_{i}^{V}. To save computation time, these were computed once and stored in a dataset where, for each day t𝑡t, there is a pair of sets of key/value vectors NtK={niK}tsuperscriptsubscript𝑁𝑡𝐾subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝐾𝑡N_{t}^{K}=\\{n_{i}^{K}\\}_{t} and NtV={niV}tsuperscriptsubscript𝑁𝑡𝑉subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑛𝑖𝑉𝑡N_{t}^{V}=\\{n_{i}^{V}\\}_{t} respectively. The trained stock embeddings were given to us by the authors of the original paper. Let each stock embedding be sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j} where j=1,2,…,J𝑗12…𝐽j=1,2,...,J, and J=50𝐽50J=50 (number of stocks picked from R&B dataset). We utilized them to compute the market vector.\nWe utilized dot product as the inner product in order to recreate the results from the previous article which aimed to demonstrate the basic capabilities of the stock embedding. This was done using the text feature distiller process. It starts by calculating the attention score for every article nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} of day t𝑡t for stock sjsubscript𝑠𝑗s_{j} Then the weight of each article i𝑖i with respect to stock j𝑗j is found by: then finally, the market vector mtjsuperscriptsubscript𝑚𝑡𝑗m_{t}^{j} for day t𝑡t with respect to stock j𝑗j is computed by: The market vector is computed for every trading day in the window s𝑠s with respect to stock j𝑗j. Then we created a sequence of vectors, M[t−s+1,t]j=[mt−s+1j,mt−s+2j,…,mt−2j,mt−1j,mtj]superscriptsubscript𝑀𝑡𝑠1𝑡𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑡𝑠1𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑡𝑠2𝑗…superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑡2𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑡1𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑡𝑗M_{[t-s+1,t]}^{j}=[m_{t-s+1}^{j},m_{t-s+2}^{j},...,m_{t-2}^{j},m_{t-1}^{j},m_{t}^{j}] which is used as the input of the price movement classifier with the target class ytsubscript𝑦𝑡y_{t} for day t𝑡t. For this problem, we found the best value for the window s𝑠s to be 5. The distribution of the correct labels for the five day sequence between an upward stock price movement and downward stock price movement was fairly even (55%percent5555\\% and 45%percent4545\\% respectively).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: the gensim library version of Word2Vec. available at: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html\ndue to this version having faster training and slightly better accuracy for frequent words [ref]10.
