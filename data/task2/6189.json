      "content": "Paper Title: ChatAgri: Exploring Potentials of ChatGPT on Cross-linguistic Agricultural Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nChatGPT is a leading conversational language model developed by OpenAI, which serves as an expert in all fields with omnipotent and omniscient knowledge. ChatGPT is a disruptive revolution across numerous research domains, extending beyond NLP, providing a user-friendly interface that grants the general public unprecedented access to the capabilities of large language models. ChatGPT, also known as GPT-3.5 that built upon GPT-3 [ref]14, serves as a conversational robot capable of comprehending intricate instructions and producing high-quality replies across diverse scenarios. ChatGPT, acting as a valuable tool, has made a significant contribution to many application scenarios and has opened up new possibilities for virtual assistants.\nIn terms of model structure, ChatGPT [10; 9] can be regarded as a quantum leap characterized by several distinctive characteristic features that stands out from previous NLP models such as BERT [ref]1, BART [ref]2, and T5 . These can be summarized as: a very large language model using over billions of parameters, having the capability of a chain of thought prompting, and trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). As millions of users continue to tap into these language models, countless new use cases emerge, opening the door to a flurry of ChatGPT potentials.\nBased on a recent empirical study [27; 26], ChatGPT has shown remarkable proficiency in multilingual translations, particularly in high-resource languages translator such as mutual translation between various European and American languages. Furthermore, this study found that ChatGPT performs similarly to other prominent translation services like Tencent TranSmart, DeepL Translate, and Google Translate.\nWhat’s even more impressive is that ChatGPT can be used in code debugging and even code generation . Based on Haque et al. , ChatGPT was evaluated on its capability to provide code snippets that adhered to the syntax and semantics of the programming language, such as Python, Java, and JavaScript. Bang and colleagues 9 utilized several codes, including Python Turtle graphics and HTML Canvas, acted as tools for the multimodal task of generating images from text. These researchers demonstrate that ChatGPT was able to generate superior-quality codes based on brief business requirements expressed in natural language, overwhelmingly surpassing other code modification techniques. The growing fascination with ChatGPT has spurred a wide range of investigations into the myriad of possibilities presented by this groundbreaking language model, particularly those in the agricultural field. Gao et al.  investigates the feasibility of using ChatGPT for event extraction, highlights the difficulties posed by event extraction due to its complexity and the need of a comprehensive set of instructions. Wei et al.  designed a universal zero-shot information extraction framework via chatting with ChatGPT, namely ChatIE, handling NLP tasks including named entity recognition, event extraction, and relation extraction.\nSpecifically, ChatIE is devised as a decomposed multi-stages involving with several turns of QA: first stage to discover the element types presented in the sentence through one turn of QA, and second stage to find the elements to fill the corresponding element slots through multiple QA turns. Furthermore, OpenAI  released GPT-4, an advanced, large-scale, multi-modal generative PLM, in early March of this year. It exhibits significant improvements over ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) in terms of multi-modal image and text interaction, broader digital character limitations and more accurate semantic understanding. GPT-4 holds immense promise for future diverse applications and is regarded as a significant stride toward achieving general-purpose technology. Moreover, the official investigation of GPT-4  confirms the hypothesis that these technologies can have a substantial effect on a wide swath of occupations, especially for higher-wage occupations that face greater exposure to PLMs. Recently, an open letter signed by numerous prominent researchers has called for a halt to “Pause Giant AI Experiments” towards the successive development of GPT-5 due to GPT-4’s perceived terrifying power and its potential risks to society . Even Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has also signed this open letter, demonstrating that the future impact of General Purpose AI, represented by ChatGPT, on various industries will be revolutionary and profoundly impressive.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: beyond NLP, providing a user-friendly interface that grants the general public unprecedented access to the capabilities of large language models.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
