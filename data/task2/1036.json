      "content": "Paper Title: MESA: Boost Ensemble Imbalanced Learning with MEta-SAmpler\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFernández et al. , Guo et al. 5, and He et al. 8 9 provided systematic reviews of algorithms and applications of imbalanced learning.\nIn this paper, we focus on binary imbalanced classification problem, which is one of the most widely studied problem setting 5  in imbalanced learning.\nSuch a problem extensively exists in practical applications, e.g., fraud detection (fraud vs. normal), medical diagnosis (sick vs. healthy), and cybersecurity (intrusion vs. user connection).\nWe mainly review existing works on this problem as follows. Resampling Resampling methods focus on modifying the training set to balance the class distribution (i.e., over/under-sampling  6 7  ) or filter noise (i.e., cleaning resampling [ref]26 ).\nRandom resampling usually leads to severe information loss or overfishing, hence many advanced methods explore distance information to guide their sampling process 5.\nHowever, calculating the distance between instances is computationally expensive on large-scale datasets, and such strategies may even fail to work when the data does not fit their assumptions. Reweighting Reweighting methods assign different weights to different instances to alleviate a classifier’s bias towards majority groups (e.g.,  2  ).\nMany recent reweighting methods such as FocalLoss  and GHM  are specifically designed for DNN loss function engineering.\nClass-level reweighting such as cost-sensitive learning  is more versatile but requires a cost matrix given by domain experts beforehand, which is usually infeasible in practice. Ensemble Methods.\nEnsemble imbalanced learning (EIL) is known to effectively improve typical IL solutions by combining the outputs of multiple classifiers (e.g.,    [ref]39 ).\nThese EIL approaches prove to be highly competitive  and thus gain increasing popularity 5 in IL.\nHowever, most of the them are straight combinations of a resampling/reweighting solution and an ensemble learning framework, e.g., Smote +AdaBoost 2=SmoteBoost .\nConsequently, although EIL techniques effectively lower the variance introduced by resampling/reweighting, these methods still suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to their heuristic-based designs. Meta-learning Methods.\nInspired by recent meta-learning developments 1 , there are some studies that adapt meta-learning to solve IL problem.\nTypical methods include Learning to Teach  that learns a dynamic loss function, MentorNet  that learns a mini-batch curriculum, and L2RW /Meta-Weight-Net  that learn an implicit/explicit data weighting function.\nNonetheless, all these methods are confined to be co-optimized with a DNN by gradient descent.\nAs the success of deep learning relies on the massive training data, mainly from the well-structured data domain like computer vision and natural language processing, the applications of these methods to other learning models (e.g., tree-based models and their ensemble variants like gradient boosting machine) in traditional classification tasks (e.g., small/unstructured/tabular data) are highly constrained. We present a comprehensive comparison of existing IL solutions for binary imbalanced classification problem with our Mesa in Table 1.\nCompared with other methods, Mesa aims to learn a resampling strategy directly from data.\nIt is able to perform quick and adaptive resampling as no distance computing, domain knowledge, or related heuristics are involved in the resampling process. reweighting (RW), under-sampling (US), over-sampling (OS), cleaning-sampling (CS), iterative ensemble (IE), parallel ensemble (PE), meta-learning (ML).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: problem as follows. Resampling Resampling methods focus on modifying the training set to balance the class distribution (i.e., over/under-sampling  6 7  ) or filter noise (i.e., cleaning resampling [ref]26 ).\nRandom resampling usually leads to severe information loss or overfishing, hence many advanced methods explore distance information to guide their sampling process 5.\nHowever, calculating\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
