      "content": "Paper Title: Low-complexity Deep Video Compression with A Distributed Coding Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven the ubiquity and popularity of various video applications, deep learning (DL)-based video compression    [ref]4 [ref]5  has attracted increasing attention due to their superior performance over traditional methods  . Most methods adopt a predictive coding architecture inherited from standard video codecs. As illustrated in Figure 1(a), this architecture applies a computation-intensive motion compensation prediction loop at the encoder to explicitly reduce temporal redundancy between frames. According to Table I, the motion-related operations (i.e., estimation, compensation and compression) account for about 90% and 65% computation complexity in DVC  and DCVC [ref]5, two representative examples of DL-based video codecs. Therefore, these DL-based methods are typically characterized by a heavy encoder and a relatively simple decoder, making them suitable for broadcast-oriented applications (e.g., video streaming  and Blu-Ray discs 0), where the videos are encoded once and decoded many times. Recently there is an upsurge in uplink-based video applications such as video surveillance 1 and multi-view image acquisition 2, where the video encoder is deployed on a device with limited computational resource and power supply. Such scenarios demand low-complexity and low-power video encoders, rendering existing DL-based video codecs unsuitable. This calls for a radical change in the video coding architecture. Inspired by Slepian-Wolf (SW) 3 and Wyner-Ziv (WZ) 4 theorems111More details about these two theorems are provided in Appendix A-A. developed in the 1970s on distributed source coding, distributed video coding222Distributed video coding has been called as DVC in literatures, but as DVC is more often used to refer to deep video compression recently, we call distributed video coding as WZ video coding in this paper. More details about WZ video coding are provided in Appendix A-B., also known as WZ video coding 5, has emerged as a promising solution to complement existing video compression methods for multimedia applications. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to build a high-efficient and low-complexity practical video compression system by directly applying WZ video coding. Firstly, existing WZ video codecs only achieve the rate-distortion (RD) performance similar with H.264-intra coding 6 7. There is a large gap to popular standard video codecs, which is predominantly caused by the poor quality of side information (SI) at the decoder 8. It is unclear how to produce high-quality SI and effectively exploit SI at the decoder to approach the performance of predictive coding. Secondly, there is a feedback channel from the decoder to encoder in classical SW codecs 9 0 1. The decoder has to request additional parity bits repeatedly until the decoding procedure is successful, resulting in a large decoding delay. Furthermore, it demands an extra frame buffer to store the encoded stream, which consumes high memory at the encoder, making it unsuitable for mobile devices and cameras. To guarantee user experience for video applications, it is critically important to develop resource-friendly video compression methods. In this paper, we design the first end-to-end distributed deep video coding (Distributed DVC) system, which boosts the coding gains to match the ones with the predictive coding architecture by exploiting the advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs) in nonlinear transform and end-to-end optimization, while alleviating high encoding overheads of learning-based video codecs by removing the computation-intensive motion operations from the encoder side. The main contributions of this paper are summarized below. Firstly, our Distributed DVC enables low-complexity encoders, which are desirable for uplink-based video applications with resource-constrained devices. While distributed source coding theory has inspired such an architecture decades ago, there is a lack of practical methods that can achieve RD performance close to the predictive coding architecture, and our study fills the gap. Secondly, an SI generation module at the decoder is proposed to explicitly capture the temporal correlations between frames for reconstructing more informative frames and an encoder-decoder joint training strategy is introduced to implicitly make latent representation more compact. Furthermore, we use a channel-wise auto-regressive entropy model 2 to provide accurate probability distribution for the latent representation during entropy coding, which effectively reduces the statistical redundancy. Meanwhile, it replaces the SW codec and avoids the problems brought by the feedback channel in traditional WZ video coding. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework provides up to 10 dB gains over the traditional WZ video codec 7 in PSNR and outperforms H.264. Compared with H.265, our method achieves higher coding gains in most of bit ranges when measured by MS-SSIM. Meanwhile, it reduces about 85% and 90% encoding latency against DVC  and DCVC [ref]5, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Given the ubiquity and popularity of various video applications, deep learning (DL)-based video compression    [ref]4 [ref]5  has attracted increasing attention due to their superior performance over traditional methods  .
