      "content": "Paper Title: PATE-AAE: Incorporating Adversarial Autoencoder into Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles for Spoken Command Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe speech signal contains a rich set of information¬† that encompasses gender, accent, speaking environment, and other speaker characteristics; therefore, protecting data privacy becomes a raising concern when speech data is used to deploy commercial speech applications. In recent years, public regulations, e.g., GDPR¬† and CCPA¬†, have been proposed to establish new guidelines related to data privacy measurement and identity protection in end-user applications. Recent works on model inversion attacks¬†[ref]4  indeed highlighted the importance of data privacy when the original data profile (e.g., facial images¬†[ref]4) could be recovered from a machine learning model by using query-free optimization techniques. Differential privacy¬†[ref]6 (DP) is an effective mechanism for ensuring individual data protection, and it has been deployed in several industrial systems¬†[ref]7 Apple has also applied differential privacy with a privacy budget (ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon=8) based on an official document in https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf. to protect customer‚Äôs sensitive information by exploiting a sophisticated noisy perturbation scheme. The ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-DP mechanism¬†[ref]6 provides a way to quantify a privacy loss and set up a privacy budget (e.g., a minimum ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon value) for a given dataset. However, ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-differential private models¬†[ref]7 need to be refined in order to improve a degraded prediction accuracy¬† caused by the DP noise. The private aggregation of teacher ensembles¬†0 (PATE) is a recently proposed solution that aims to combat the accuracy loss of the machine learning models while ensuring privacy requirements. PATE follows a teacher-student architecture¬†1, where the teacher is an ensemble model. The underpinning idea in PATE is to leverage upon noisy outputs of aggregated teacher models to (re)label non-sensitive public data with DP guarantees. The PATE method and its improved version¬†2 were proven useful in reducing the model accuracy drop through a voting process during the noisy ensemble. Nonetheless, the teacher-student learning process highly depends on a hypothesis¬†0 2 3 that there exists a sufficient amount of public (non-sensitive) data to train the model. PATE-GAN¬†3 tries to overcome this issue by incorporating a generative block jointly trained with the PATE block; the goal is providing enough synthetic data to train deep models effectively. Unfortunately, PATE-GAN does not work well for high dimensional data synthesis (e.g., images), as demonstrated in recent studies¬†4 5. Moreover, generating speech samples is a challenging task, as shown in recent studies about neural vocoders 6 7. In this study, we introduce an adversarial autoencoder¬†8 (AAE) based model into PATE to improve the generative process for privacy-preserving speech classification. PATE-AAE first adapts an autoencoder to minimize a reconstruction loss, training on sensitive data. As shown in Fig.¬†1(a), the generative model produces synthetic data as non-sensitive samples. Meanwhile, the training data are divided into IùêºI isolated subsets to train individual teacher classifiers. For instance, IùêºI is equal to 333 in Fig.¬†1(b). The teacher classifiers then undergo an output aggregation process to generate noisy labels, which ensures the ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-differentially private protection. Finally, a student classifier uses the labeled synthetic samples (non-sensitive data) for training its model. The proposed PATE-AAE framework is assessed with the Google Speech Commands Dataset Version II 9. Our experimental evidence demonstrates competitive results in terms of synthetic sample quality and classification accuracy with a strong ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-DP guarantee (Œµ<1ùúÄ1\\varepsilon<1) considering established privacy-preserving learning (PPL) works¬†3 0. To the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce the PATE architecture into a speech classification task. Moreover, the proposed solution is benefited from adversarial autoencoder block, with advantages over existing GAN solutions [ref]4 3 of having a better test-likelihood estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: e.g., GDPR¬† and CCPA¬†, have been proposed to establish new guidelines related to data privacy measurement and identity protection in end-user applications.
