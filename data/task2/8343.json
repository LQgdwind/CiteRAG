Hence, to decide whether G𝐺G is k𝑘k-colourable it suffices to verify whether G𝐺G is Kk+1subscript𝐾𝑘1K_{k+1}-free,\nwhich is clearly in P. In this example, the promise is even verifiable in polynomial-time ,\nbut this need not be the case in general. A prominent example being the problem 1-in-3 SAT, which\nis tractable given the promise that the input\nformula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi either has a 1-in-3 solution, or does not even have a not-all-equal\nsolution [ref]29. In contrast, some problems remain hard even given some non-trivial promise.\nA typical example is 333-colourability which is NPNP\\operatorname{NP}-hard given the promise that the\ninput graph G𝐺G is either 333-colourable or not even 555-colourable . A general framework for studying hard promises was introduced in 0.\nFormally, a (decidable) promise problem is a pair of decidable sets (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) where\nQ𝑄Q is the promise, and R𝑅R is the property that needs to be decided\ngiven the promise Q𝑄Q. A deterministic Turing machine M𝑀M solves the promise\nproblem (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) if for every input x𝑥x the following holds In this case, we say that the language L𝐿L accepted by M𝑀M is a solution to (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R).\nIn particular, notice that R𝑅R and Q∩R𝑄𝑅Q\\cap R are solutions to (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R). Going back\nto our previous examples, if Q𝑄Q is the class of perfect graphs, and R𝑅R the class\nof k𝑘k-colourable graphs, then the class of Kk+1subscript𝐾𝑘1K_{k+1}-free graphs is a polynomial-time\nsolution to (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R). A promise problem (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) is in PP\\operatorname{P} if (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) has a solution L𝐿L in PP\\operatorname{P}, and\n(Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) is NP-hard if every solution to (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) is NP-hard. Note that for every promise\nproblem (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R), we have that R𝑅R is a solution to (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R), and hence if R𝑅R is in PP\\operatorname{P}, then (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) is in PP\\operatorname{P}.\nA promise problem (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) is polynomial-time Turing-reducible666Many-one, disjunctive, and conjunctive reductions are defined analogously,\nbut are not needed for this paper. to a promise problem (S,T)𝑆𝑇(S,T)\nif for every solution A𝐴A of (S,T)𝑆𝑇(S,T) there is a solution B𝐵B of (Q,T)𝑄𝑇(Q,T) such that B𝐵B\nis polynomial-time Turing-reducible to A𝐴A. Notice that if L𝐿L is a decidable set,\nthen the only solution to ({0,1}∗,L)superscript01∗𝐿(\\{0,1\\}^{\\ast},L) is L𝐿L, and hence, we say that a set\nL𝐿L is polynomial-time Turing-reducible to a promise problem (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R) if ({0,1}∗,L)superscript01∗𝐿(\\{0,1\\}^{\\ast},L)\nis polynomial-time Turing-reducible to (Q,R)𝑄𝑅(Q,R). Natural promise problems trace back to at least 1984, and they arise in the context\nof public-key cryptography . Given a decidable set L⊆Σ∗𝐿superscriptΣL\\subseteq\\Sigma^{*},\nfor some finite alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma, the natural promise problem for L𝐿L is the promise\nproblem That is, an instance to the problem is a pair (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y), the promise is that exactly one of x𝑥x or y𝑦y belongs to L𝐿L,\nand the property to decide is whether x∈L𝑥𝐿x\\in L.\nClearly, the natural promise problem for L𝐿L is at most as hard as L𝐿L, and thus, if L𝐿L is in PP\\operatorname{P}\nthen L𝐿L and the natural promise problem for L𝐿L are trivially polynomial-time equivalent.\nIn , the authors prove that the natural promise problem for SAT is NPNP\\operatorname{NP}-hard,\nand it follows from 0 that L𝐿L and its natural promise problem are polynomial-time\nTuring-equivalent for every NPNP\\operatorname{NP}-complete set L𝐿L. In particular, it follows from the finite domain dichotomy\nconjecture  3 that every finite domain CSP is polynomial-time\nTuring-equivalent to its natural promise problem – this will also follow from our next theorem without\nusing the finite domain dichotomy. The graph isomorphism problem (which\nis not known to belong to P and most likely not NP-complete) is polynomial-time equivalent to its natural promise problem 0. For every L𝐿L in any of the following classes, the natural promise problem\nfor L𝐿L is polynomial-time Turing equivalent to L𝐿L. CSPCSP\\operatorname{CSP}s of finitely bounded structures. Monotone extensional SNPSNP\\operatorname{SNP}. Extensional ESOESO\\operatorname{ESO}. Complements of Her−FOHerFO\\operatorname{Her-FO}. Clearly, every set L𝐿L is at least as hard as its natural promise problem.\nOn the other hand, Theorem 3 in 0 asserts that if L𝐿L is disjunctive self-reducible,\nthen there is a polynomial-time Turing-reduction from L𝐿L to the natural promise problem L𝐿L.\nBy Lemmas 6.1 and 6.2 we know that\nany problem in L𝐿L in any of the itemized classes is disjunctive self-reducible, and so,\nthe natural promise problem for L𝐿L is polynomial-time Turing equivalent to L𝐿L.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: prominent example being the problem 1-in-3 SAT, which\nis tractable given the promise that the input\nformula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi either has a 1-in-3 solution, or does not even have a not-all-equal\nsolution [ref]29.
