      "content": "Paper Title: Style-Preserving Lip Sync via Audio-Aware Style Reference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAudio-driven lip sync, also referred to as talking face generation, aims to generate a talking video having lip motion synchronized with the input audio.\nThis technology has garnered significant attention in the multimedia domain in recent years, spanning applications such as video translation [ref]1, visual dubbing , virtual avatars , and digital humans .\nTraditionally, achieving accurate lip sync has primarily involved training subject-specific models with data collected from specific individuals. However, these techniques are hampered by the significant costs associated with subject-specific training and data collection processes. Consequently, we focus on addressing the task of audio-driven lip sync through a subject-generic strategy [ref]5 [ref]6    , which, by training once on a large-scale dataset, can be generalized to any individual without the need for further training or fine-tuning. In general, when individuals speak the same utterance, variations in their speaking styles lead to differences in lip shapes  [ref]6 [ref]5    , posing a challenge to accurate lip sync.\nHowever, most previous subject-generic approaches, such as       [ref]1, have overlooked modeling the speaking style of individuals, as shown in Figure 1(a).\nThese approaches merely predict lip motion from audio without incorporating any reference information regarding the speaking style of subject. As a result, these subject-generic approaches typically only achieve lip sync consistent with the general speaking styles learned from audio-visual datasets. There are still discrepancies between the lip sync conforming to general speaking styles and those customized to individual speaking styles. To alleviate this issue, recent methods [ref]6 [ref]5     have attempted to incorporate a short style reference video of the individual into the lip sync model as illustrated in Figure 1(b).\nThey learn a video-level style code from the reference video to guide the lip sync for arbitrary audio.\nHowever, predicting lip shapes for different audio requires referencing different lip shapes from the style reference video. Therefore, the compact and static video-level style codes learned by these methods are still insufficient to achieve satisfactory lip sync. Inspired by the observation from  that similar pronunciations produce similar lip shapes, this paper posits that within a style reference video, if a lip shape corresponds to the reference audio that is closer to the input audio, it should contribute more significantly to the style coding. Thus, we approach Audio-driven Lip Sync from a novel perspective and propose an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme. As shown in Figure 1(c), our method leverages the audio signals in the style reference video to aggregate distinct style codes for different input audios, facilitating Style-Preserving Lip Sync. Specifically, we propose a novel Transformer-based architecture designed to predict lip motions from audio inputs, influenced by a style reference video. The process commences with the extraction of lip shapes from a style reference video utilizing the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) . Subsequently, these lip shapes and their associated audio signals are encoded via dual Transformer encoders, yielding respective representations for reference lip and audio features.\nInput audio information is then integrated into a Transformer decoder to generate hidden features, which are further processed by a cross-attention layer within the decoder to aggregate style information from the style reference video. Herein, the reference audio and lip features serve as keys and values, respectively, while the hidden features derived from the input audio act as queries. Ultimately, the Transformer decoder outputs mouth-related expression parameters representing lip motion.\nTo render realistic talking face videos from lip motion, this research devises a conditional latent diffusion model 0 tailored for producing lip-synced faces. Specifically, the integration of mouth-related expression parameters into the latent diffusion model is achieved through modulated convolutional layers. This approach ensures that the synthesized lip shapes are\naligned with those represented by mouth-related expression parameters.\nAdditionally, the incorporation of reference facial image into the diffusion model is facilitated via spatial cross-attention layers, which enhance the model’s capacity to capture subject-specific appearance details, thereby improving the fidelity of the generated talking faces. The primary contributions of this study are summarized as follows. We propose a novel audio-aware style reference scheme that leverages the intrinsic connections between input and reference audios to effectively aggregate speaking style information, thereby achieving style-preserving lip synchronization. We have devised an advanced Transformer-based lip sync model that integrates speaking style information from a style reference video to predict lip motions. Additionally, we introduced a novel conditional latent diffusion model to translate the predicted lip motions into lip-synced and realistic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves style-preserving lip synchronization, which effectively preserves the speaking style of the individual, resulting in realistic and high-fidelity talking face videos.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: having lip motion synchronized with the input audio.\nThis technology has garnered significant attention in the multimedia domain in recent years, spanning applications such as video translation [ref]1, visual dubbing , virtual avatars , and digital humans .\nTraditionally, achieving accurate lip sync has primarily involved training subject-specific models with data collected from specific\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
