The central intuition behind this concept is that comparing the output feature vectors will highlight the discrepancies between the inputs. Hence, this approach is advantageous in signature [ref]1 or face  recognition applications. Another application of SNNs is unsupervised representation learning, also designated as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). In particular, it is possible to learn representations from unlabeled data by feeding variations of the same input to twin Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 4 models and computing the similarity between the output feature vectors. This similarity metric is used as a loss function, leading the SNNs to learn robust representations (i.e., resisting disturbance in the input data). This process is denoted as contrastive unsupervised learning. Momentum Contrast (MoCo)  pre-trains a CNN using unsupervised learning with a momentum encoder and fine-tunes its classifier head on standard supervised linear classification. The authors of MoCo show that the unsupervised pre-trained approach can surpass standard CNN on multiple ImageNet  computer vision tasks. SimCLR  added a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head as a predictor and highlighted the critical role of strong data augmentation and large batches (e.g.,  8000) in contrastive learning. Following up on this, [ref]4 proposed an improved version of MoCo (dubbed MoCo V2) that added a two-layer MLP head in the encoder and modified the data transforms according to those of SimCLR. Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) 6 proposed an SNN framework centered around an online network and a target network. The output of the target network is iteratively bootstrapped to serve as input to the online network. The authors showed that BYOL could learn more robust representations than previous approaches. Finally, SimSiam  introduced a simpler SNN architecture that removes the need for negative sample pairs, momentum encoders, and large batches. More specifically, SimSiam implements a stop-grad mechanism that stops gradient backpropagation in one of the two branches of the twin model. Despite being a more straightforward approach than previous baselines, SimSiam reaches a competitive score on ImageNet classification.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Bromley et al. [ref]1 first proposed the Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) architecture as \\saytwin (i.e., identical and sharing the same weights) models that process two or more inputs and compare their outputs.
