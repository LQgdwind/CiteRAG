      "content": "Paper Title: Interactive Graph Convolutional Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past decade, interactive recommender systems (IRS) have received considerable attention due to their broad applicability in real-world scenarios [ref]1 , including personalized article recommendation , social media [ref]4, and online advertising [ref]5 , among others  .\nIn contrast to traditional recommender systems   , which treat recommendations as a one-step prediction task, IRS approach recommendations as a multi-step decision process.\nAt each step, the system presents one or more items to the user and may receive feedback, which then sequentially influences subsequent recommendation decisions.\nThe system calculates rewards based on the feedback received, with the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards for a finite number of recommendations. The key challenge in IRS is to provide accurate suggestions for users under insufficient observations, especially for interactive collaborative filtering [ref]1. This context is characterized by the lack of feature representation for users and items, with available information limited to user and item IDs accompanied by user feedbacks for specific items.\nMoreover, IRS faces significant problems with the cold start problem and data sparsity [ref]1  [ref]5.\nThe cold start problem occurs when new users enter the system without any interaction history, making it difficult to generate satisfactory recommendations.\nThis problem is particularly pronounced in interactive collaborative filtering, where no additional features are available for these new users or items.\nIn addition, data sparsity becomes a significant challenge when dealing with long-tail items.\nIn many real-world datasets, item popularity often follows a power-law distribution  , meaning that with the exception of popular items at the top of the distribution that receive significant attention, the majority of items have low exposure.\nThe data sparsity of some items, i.e., they have only interacted with a small number of users, poses a significant challenge for\ninteractive collaborative filtering (ICF) models to effectively learn the parameters of these items.\nThese items rarely receive enough user interactions, leaving the system with insufficient data to understand their characteristics and effectively recommend them, which affects the model’s accuracy in predicting user behavior for items. Efficient techniques to mitigate the aforementioned challenges require fast and accurate characterization of user profiles in as few interaction rounds as possible, while maintaining a degree of uncertainty in the prediction results.\nThis requires a model that is capable of solving an exploration-exploitation (EE) dilemma, where it must balance the trade-off between its prediction results (exploitation) and uncertainty (exploration) in decision-making.\nIn this context, bandit methods are particularly well suited to address such issues.\nIn existing methods, Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) methods conceptualize the recommendation task as multi-armed bandits or contextual bandits and address it with carefully designed exploration strategies such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) [ref]1  and Thompson Sampling (TS) .\nHowever, existing bandit methods in ICF that rely on traditional matrix factorization, while providing some mitigations, struggle to address the problems caused by data sparsity.\nIn addition, when faced with the cold start problem, they have significant difficulty providing satisfactory results, often due to the lack of interaction data available in the early stages.\nFurthermore, these methods prove to be computationally intractable when applied to non-linear models, severely limiting their applicability in the context of advanced deep models. Motivated by the desire to overcome the limitations of existing bandit techniques, we present a novel method Interactive Graph Convolutional Filtering (iGCF) that effectively addresses these problems.\nThe key features of our proposed methodology include the combination of bandit techniques with state-of-the-art graph neural networks, enabling our model to better exploit the power of collaborative filtering between users and items\nfor overcoming the data sparsity problem, thereby significantly improving the model’s expressiveness.\nTo overcome the computational hurdles posed by non-linear models, we also incorporate variational inference techniques to ensure effective computation even in the context of complex probabilistic models.\nFurthermore, we use meta-learning techniques to deal with the cold-start problem. To summarize, the main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose a novel Interactive Graph Convolutional Filtering (iGCF) model, which extends the interactive collaborative filtering into the graph model and addresses the aforementioned shortcomings of existing bandit methods. We employ a Bayesian meta-learning method to effectively deal with the cold-start problem, ensuring that our method maintains satisfactory recommendations even in the face of insufficient user-item interaction data. We derive theoretical regret bounds for our proposed method, providing a robust performance guarantee. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to validate our method. The results consistently indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the efficacy and applicability of our proposed methods. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn the next Section 2, we present the notation used in this work and the overview of proposed method.\nIn Section 3, we present the pretraining phase of our proposed method, including the modeling approach and effective optimization techniques.\nThen, in Section 4, we discuss the online phase, detailing our online update strategy, operational considerations, and theoretical results.\nThese include the derived regret bounds that provide a performance guarantee for our method.\nIn Section 5, we detail the experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on three real-world datasets.\nWe then present a review of related work in Section 6, discussing existing methods and their relation to our proposed method.\nFinally, in Section 7, we conclude the paper with a summary.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Over the past decade, interactive recommender systems (IRS) have received considerable attention due to their broad applicability in real-world scenarios [ref]1 , including personalized article recommendation , social media [ref]4, and online advertising [ref]5 , among others  .\nIn contrast to traditional recommender systems   , which treat\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
