      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation for Action Recognition: A Disentanglement Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised Video Domain Adaptation. Despite the great progress in image-based UDA, only a few methods have recently attempted video-based UDA. In , a temporal attentive adversarial adaptation network (TA3N) is proposed to integrate a temporal relation module for temporal alignment. Choi et al.  proposed a SAVA method using self-supervised clip order prediction and clip attention-based alignment. Based on a cross-domain co-attention mechanism, the temporal co-attention network TCoN [ref]29 focused on common key frames across domains for better alignment. Luo et al.  pay more attention to the domain-agnostic classifier by using a network topology of the bipartite graph to model the cross-domain correlations. Instead of using adversarial learning, Sahoo et al. [ref]31 developed an end-to-end temporal contrastive learning framework named CoMix with background mixing and target pseudo-labels. Recently, Chen et al.  learned multiple domain discriminators for multi-level temporal attentive features to achieve better alignment, while Turrisi et al. [ref]37 exploited two-headed deep architecture to learn a more robust target classifier by the combination of cross-entropy and contrastive losses. Although these approaches have advanced video-based UDA tasks, they all adopted to align features with diverse information mixed up from a compression perspective, which leaves room for further improvements. Multi-Modal Video Adaptation. Most recently, there are also a few works integrating multiple modality data for video-based UDA. Although we only use the single modality RGB features, we still discuss this multi-modal research line for a complete literature review. The very first work exploring the multi-modal nature of videos for UDA is MM-SADA , where the correspondence of multiple modalities was exploited as a self-supervised alignment in addition to adversarial alignment. A later work, spatial-temporal contrastive domain adaptation (STCDA) , utilized a video-based contrastive alignment as the multi-modal domain metric to measure the video-level discrepancy across domains.  proposed cross-modal and cross-domain contrastive losses to handle feature spaces across modalities and domains.  leveraged both cross-modal complementary and cross-modal consensus to learn the most transferable features through a CIA framework. In , the authors proposed to generate noisy pseudo-labels for the target domain data using the source pre-trained model and select the clean samples in order to increase the quality of the pseudo-labels. Lin et al.  developed a cycle-based approach that alternates between spatial and spatiotemporal learning with knowledge transfer. Generally, all the above methods utilize the flow as the auxiliary modality input. Recently, there are also methods exploring other modalities, for instance, A3R  with audios and MixDANN  with wild data. It is worth noting that the proposed TranSVAE – although only uses single modality RGB features – surprisingly achieves better UDA performance compared with most current state-of-the-art multi-modal methods, which highlights our superiority. Disentanglement.\nFeature disentanglement is a wide and hot research topic. We only focus on works that are closely related to ours. In the image domain, some works consider adaptation from a generative view.  learned a disentangled semantic representation across domains. A similar idea is then applied to graph domain adaptation  and domain generalization .  proposed a novel informative feature disentanglement, equipped with the adversarial network or the metric discrepancy model. Another disentanglement-related topic is sequential data generation. To generate videos, existing works  0  extended VAE to a recurrent form with different recursive structures. In this paper, we present a VAE-based structure to generate cross-domain videos. We aim at tackling video-based UDA from a new perspective: sequential domain disentanglement and transfer.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: et al.  proposed a SAVA method using self-supervised clip order prediction and clip attention-based alignment.
