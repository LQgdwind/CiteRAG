      "content": "Paper Title: The Gradient Convergence Bound of Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Efficient Communication\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the development of wireless communication and advanced machine learning technologies in the past few years, a large amount of data has been generated by smart devices and can enable a variety of multi-agent systems, such as smart road traffic control , smart home energy management , and the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)   . Through deep reinforcement learning (DRL), an intelligent agent can gradually improve the performance of its parameterized policy via the trial-and-error interaction with the environment [ref]6   . However, directly applying DRL to multi-agent systems commonly faces several challenging problems, such as the non-stationary learning environment and the difficulty of reward assignment 0 1. As an alternative, independent reinforcement learning (IRL) is often employed in practical applications to alleviate the above-mentioned problems, where each agent undergoes an independent learning process with only self-related observations 2. For each IRL agent, the training samples are obtained by going through a trajectory with the predefined terminal state or a certain number of Markov state transitions from Markov decision processes (MDPs). With the obtained samples, an agent can improve its performance by updating its policy’s parameters along the gradient descent direction. In this paper, a policy-based DRL algorithm (i.e., proximal policy optimization (PPO) ) is applied to calibrate the loss function, by repetitively calculating the gradients3. Generally speaking, the performance of DRL is closely related to the amount and variety of obtained samples, since the more fully explored state space leads to more accurate estimation of the cumulative reward signal 0. Meanwhile, for a multi-agent system with naturally distributed IRL agents, the locally calculated policy gradients need to be shared through a coordination channel. Therefore, in order to effectively improve the performance of DRL, we adopt a federated multi-agent reinforcement learning (FMARL) framework, by combining the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in DRL and federated learning (FL) 4 5 6. In particular, a central server in FL is leveraged by iteratively aggregating the policy gradients from multiple IRL agents and in turn providing updated policy parameters. Therefore, FL can facilitate the implementation of this coordination channel and significantly contribute to enriching the sample information of each IRL agent indirectly. However, targeting this FMARL framework, there may be a large number of agents or policy iterations during the training phase. This naive implementation of FL may generate excessive communication overheads between agents and the central server. To alleviate this problem, periodic averaging has been naturally considered and popularly applied in many studies 7 8 9, in which agents are allowed to perform several local updates within a period before transmitting their local gradients to the central server, so as to reduce the frequency of information exchange. However, an increase in the number of local updates would influence the convergence performance. Therefore, appropriate optimization methods should be developed to better balance the reduction of communication overheads and the improvement of the convergence performance. Besides, considering the heterogeneity of independent learning environments, multiple IRL agents may spend various amounts of time on state transition processes, and perform different numbers of local updates in the same period under the periodic averaging method, thus possibly affecting the convergence performance as well. Therefore, variations in the number of local updates under the periodic averaging method should be also considered. Taking account of the model’s error convergence bound with respect to the mainly required communication and computation overheads during the training phase, this paper proposes a system utility function-based metric to evaluate the effectiveness of different optimization methods for federated IRL (FIRL). Furthermore, in order to improve the system’s utility value, this paper develops two new optimization methods (i.e., the decay-based and consensus-based methods) on top of the variation-aware periodic averaging (VPA) method.\nIn particular, since the variance of model’s gradients gradually increases along with the progress of local updating, the decay-based method utilizes a discrete periodic decay function to decrease the weights of a model’s successive local gradients within one period, which also contrasts with the adoption of decaying learning rates for multiple epochs in 9. We concretely provide a practical implementation of this decay-based method with an exponential decay function and theoretically demonstrate its superior effectiveness. On the other hand, the consensus-based method introduces the consensus algorithm 0 into both IRL and FL, where agents are allowed to exchange their local gradients with neighbors directly before performing local updates. Different from the spectral radius-based theoretical analyses in 1, this paper obtains the consensus-based method’s error convergence bound dependent on the algebraic connectivity of the graph comprised by agents and their connections. We theoretically show that the consensus-based method can reduce the model’s error convergence bound dramatically and speed up the learning process. Table I summarizes the key differences with highly related works. Finally, through an MARL simulation scenario, we demonstrate the superiority of these two developed methods in terms of the model’s convergence performance and system’s utility value. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. We propose an on-line FMARL framework, by improving the policy performance of distributed IRL agents through FL. Considering the possible excessive communication overheads and heterogeneous independent learning environments, we take the VPA method as the basis of systematic analysis. In order to measure and optimize the effectiveness of policy-based DRL (i.e., PPO) through general SGD 3, we put forward a system’s utility function, which quantifies the convergence bound of the model’s error reduction per unit of resource cost during the training phase, so as to reasonably evaluate the effectiveness of different optimization methods. On top of the systematic analysis in this paper, we propose some novel implementation means to realize the decay-based and consensus-based methods for FIRL, so as to more efficiently aggregate the gradients from multiple agents within each period. Specifically, an exponentially decaying function is applied to decrease the weights of successive local gradients, while the gradients from multiple agents are merged together in a hierarchical manner. We demonstrate the superiority of both methods through theoretical analyses and numerical simulation results. The remainder of this paper is mainly organized as follows. In Section II, we explain the related works and clarify the novelty of our work. In Section III, we present preliminaries of the periodic averaging method. In Section IV, we introduce the system model and formulate the optimization problem. In Section V, we consider the possible heterogeneity of FMARL and analyze the VPA method with different numbers of updates each period. In Section VI, we describe two optimization methods (i.e., the decay-based and consensus-based methods) and give their error convergence bounds. In Section VII, we introduce the MARL simulation scenario and present the corresponding results of the developed methods. In Section VIII, we conclude this paper with a summary.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: (UAVs)   .
