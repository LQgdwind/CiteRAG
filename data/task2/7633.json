      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Convex Hulls for Simple PathsA preliminary version of this paper will appear in Proceedings of the 40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSuppose P𝑃P is a set of n𝑛n points in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} sorted from left to right. Consider the following operations on P𝑃P (assuming P=∅𝑃P=\\emptyset initially). (1) InsertRight; (2) DeleteRight; (3) TreeRetrieval: Return the root of a balanced binary search tree (BST) that stores all points of the current P𝑃P in the left-to-right order. We have the following lemma. Let P𝑃P be an initially empty set of points in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} sorted from left to right.\nThere exists a “Stack Tree” data structure S​T​(P)𝑆𝑇𝑃ST(P) for P𝑃P supporting the following operations: InsertRight: O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time. DeleteRight: O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time. TreeRetrieval: O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time, where n𝑛n is the current size of P𝑃P. In what follows, we describe the tree’s structure and then discuss the operations. Unless otherwise stated, P𝑃P refers to the current point set, and n=|P|𝑛𝑃n=|P|. It should be noted that the statement of Lemma 2.1 is not new. Indeed, one can simply use a finger search tree    to store P𝑃P to achieve the lemma (in fact, TreeRetrieval can even be done in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time). We propose a stack tree as a new implementation for the lemma because it can be applied to our dynamic convex hull problem. When we use the stack tree, TreeRetrieval will be used to return the root of a tree representing the convex hull of P𝑃P; in contrast, simply using a finger search tree cannot achieve the goal (the difficulty is how to efficiently maintain the convex hull to achieve constant time update). Our stack tree may be considered a framework for Lemma 2.1 that potentially finds other applications as well. The structure of the stack tree is illustrated in Figure 2 to the right of the line ℓℓ\\ell.\nThe stack tree S​T​(P)𝑆𝑇𝑃ST(P) consists of a sequence of trees Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} for i=0,1,…,⌈log⁡log⁡n⌉𝑖01…𝑛i=0,1,\\ldots,\\lceil\\log\\log n\\rceil. Each Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} is a balanced BST storing a contiguous subsequence of P𝑃P such that for any j<i𝑗𝑖j<i, all points of Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} are to the left of each point of Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j}. The points of all Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}’s form a partition of P𝑃P. We maintain the invariant that |Ti|subscript𝑇𝑖|T_{i}| is a multiple of 22isuperscript2superscript2𝑖2^{2^{i}} and 0≤|Ti|≤22i+10subscript𝑇𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖10\\leq|T_{i}|\\leq 2^{2^{i+1}}, where |Ti|subscript𝑇𝑖|T_{i}| represents the number of points stored in Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}.\n(The right side of ℓℓ\\ell in Figure 2 is a stack tree). In order for our construction to achieve worst-case constant time insertions, the joining of two trees is performed incrementally over subsequent insertions. Specifically, we apply the recursive slowdown technique of Kaplan and Tarjan , where every 2i+1superscript2𝑖12^{i+1}-th insertion, i≥1𝑖1i\\geq 1, performs delayed incremental work toward joining Ti−1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i-1} with Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}, if such a join is deemed necessary. The critical observation of our algorithm is that because the ranges of the trees do not overlap, we can join adjacent trees Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} and Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} to obtain (the root) of a new balanced BST that stores all points in Ti∪Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i}\\cup T_{i+1} in O​(log⁡(|Ti|+|Ti+1|))𝑂subscript𝑇𝑖subscript𝑇𝑖1O(\\log(|T_{i}|+|T_{i+1}|)) time. Later in the paper we generalize this idea to horizontally neighboring convex hulls which can be merged in O​(log⁡(|ℋ​(Ti)|+|ℋ​(Ti+1)|))𝑂ℋsubscript𝑇𝑖ℋsubscript𝑇𝑖1O(\\log(|\\mathcal{H}(T_{i})|+|\\mathcal{H}(T_{i+1})|)) time  and to convex hulls over consecutive subpaths of a simple path which can be merged in O​(log⁡|ℋ​(Ti)|⋅log⁡|ℋ​(Ti+1)|)𝑂⋅ℋsubscript𝑇𝑖ℋsubscript𝑇𝑖1O(\\log|\\mathcal{H}(T_{i})|\\cdot\\log|\\mathcal{H}(T_{i+1})|) time . In fact, the stack tree may be applied to solve other problems with polylogarithmic joining time so that that TreeRetrieval (or other operations) can be performed efficiently. Suppose we wish to insert into P𝑃P a point p𝑝p that is to the right of all points of P𝑃P. We start with inserting p𝑝p into the tree T0subscript𝑇0T_{0}, which takes O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time as |T0|=O​(1)subscript𝑇0𝑂1|T_{0}|=O(1). Next, we perform O​(1)𝑂1O(1) delayed incremental work on a tree Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} for a particular index i𝑖i. To determine i𝑖i, we maintain a counter N𝑁N that is a binary number. Initially, N=1𝑁1N=1, and it is an invariant that N=1+n𝑁1𝑛N=1+n (recall that n𝑛n is the size of the current point set P𝑃P). For each insertion, we increment N𝑁N by one and determine the index i𝑖i of the digit which flips from 00 to 111, indexed from the right where the rightmost digit has index 00. Note that there is exactly one such digit. Then, if i≥1𝑖1i\\geq 1, we perform incremental work on Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} (i.e., joining Ti−1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i-1} with Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}). To find the digit i𝑖i in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time, we represent N𝑁N by a sequence of ranges, where each range represents a contiguous subsequence of digits of 1’s in N𝑁N. For example, if N𝑁N is 101100111, then the ranges are  ,[ref]5 , 025688 ,[ref]5 , . After N𝑁N is incremented by one, N𝑁N becomes 101101000, and the ranges become  ,[ref]5 , 335688 ,[ref]5 , . Therefore, based on the first two ranges in the range sequence, one can determine the digit that flips from 00 to 111 and update the range sequence in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time (note that this can be easily implemented using a linked list to store all ranges, without resorting to any bit tricks). After i𝑖i is determined, we perform incremental work on Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} as follows. We use a variable njsubscript𝑛𝑗n_{j} to maintain the size of each tree Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j}, i.e., nj=|Tj|subscript𝑛𝑗subscript𝑇𝑗n_{j}=|T_{j}|. For each tree Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j}, with j≥1𝑗1j\\geq 1, we say that Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j} is “blocked” if there is an incremental process for joining a previous Tj−1subscript𝑇𝑗1T_{j-1} with Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j} (more details to be given later) and “unblocked” otherwise (T0subscript𝑇0T_{0} is always unblocked). If Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} is blocked, then there is an incremental process for joining a previous Ti−1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i-1} with Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}. This process will complete within time linear in the height of Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}, which is O​(2i)𝑂superscript2𝑖O(2^{i}), since |Ti|≤22i+1subscript𝑇𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1|T_{i}|\\leq 2^{2^{i+1}}. We perform the next c𝑐c steps for the process for a sufficiently large constant c𝑐c. If the joining process is completed within the c𝑐c steps, we set Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} to be unblocked. Next, if Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} is unblocked and ni≥22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}\\geq 2^{2^{i+1}} (in this case we prove in Observation 2.1 that nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} must be exactly equal to 22i+1superscript2superscript2𝑖12^{2^{i+1}}), then our algorithm maintains the invariant that Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} must be unblocked, which will be proved in Lemma 2.3. In this case, we first set Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} to be blocked, and then we start an incremental process to join Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} with Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} without performing any actual steps. For reference purpose, let Ti′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′𝑖T^{\\prime}_{i} refer to the current Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} and let Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} start over from ∅\\emptyset. Using this notation, we are actually joining Ti′superscriptsubscript𝑇𝑖′T_{i}^{\\prime} with Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1}. Although the joining process has not been completed, we follow the convention that Ti′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′𝑖T^{\\prime}_{i} is now part of Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1}; hence, we update ni+1=ni+1+nisubscript𝑛𝑖1subscript𝑛𝑖1subscript𝑛𝑖n_{i+1}=n_{i+1}+n_{i}. Also, since Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} is now empty, we reset ni=0subscript𝑛𝑖0n_{i}=0. This finishes the work due to the insertion of p𝑝p. If ni≥22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}\\geq 2^{2^{i+1}}, then ni=22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}=2^{2^{i+1}}. It holds that ni=0subscript𝑛𝑖0n_{i}=0 or 22i≤ni≤22i+1superscript2superscript2𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖12^{2^{i}}\\leq n_{i}\\leq 2^{2^{i+1}} for\ni≥1𝑖1i\\geq 1, and n0≤4subscript𝑛04n_{0}\\leq 4. According to our algorithm, T0subscript𝑇0T_{0} is never blocked and n0=4subscript𝑛04n_{0}=4 whenever N=1+4​k𝑁14𝑘N=1+4k for k=1,2,3,…𝑘123…k=1,2,3,\\ldots, where n0subscript𝑛0n_{0} is reset to 00 (this is because whenever n0≥4subscript𝑛04n_{0}\\geq 4, T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} must be unblocked, which is proved in Lemma 2.3). Hence, n0≤4subscript𝑛04n_{0}\\leq 4 always holds. In the following, we prove the case for i≥1𝑖1i\\geq 1. Observe that starting from ni=0subscript𝑛𝑖0n_{i}=0, whenever nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} increases, it increases by exactly the amount 22isuperscript2superscript2𝑖2^{2^{i}}. Hence, whenever ni≥22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}\\geq 2^{2^{i+1}} for the first time, it always holds that ni=22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}=2^{2^{i+1}}. According to our algorithm, whenever ni≥22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}\\geq 2^{2^{i+1}}, nisubscript𝑛𝑖n_{i} is reset to 00 (this is because whenever ni≥22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}\\geq 2^{2^{i+1}}, Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} must be unblocked, which is proved in Lemma 2.3). The observation thus follows. The following lemma proves the algorithm invariant mentioned above. If n0≥4subscript𝑛04n_{0}\\geq 4, then T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} must be unblocked. If i≥1𝑖1i\\geq 1 and ni≥22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}\\geq 2^{2^{i+1}} right after the process of joining Ti−1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i-1} with Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} is completed, then Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} must be unblocked. Recall that N𝑁N equals one plus the number of insertions performed, i.e., N𝑁N can be considered a timer. We have n0=4subscript𝑛04n_{0}=4 exactly when N=1+4​k𝑁14𝑘N=1+4k for k=1,2,3,…𝑘123…k=1,2,3,\\dots, where n0subscript𝑛0n_{0} is reset to 0, an incremental join at T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} is initiated, and T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} becomes blocked. But for the next insertion, i.e., when N=2+4​k𝑁24𝑘N=2+4k for k=1,2,3,…𝑘123…k=1,2,3,\\ldots, we have always n0=1subscript𝑛01n_{0}=1 and all the incremental O​(1)𝑂1O(1) work at T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} is processed if we make c𝑐c large enough, and T1subscript𝑇1T_{1} becomes unblocked and remains unblocked until n0=4subscript𝑛04n_{0}=4 again. This proves the first lemma statement. We assume that the process of joining Ti−1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i-1} with Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} is completed due to the insertion of p𝑝p and ni≥22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}\\geq 2^{2^{i+1}}. Let N′superscript𝑁′N^{\\prime} be the most recent timer where Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} changed status from unblocked to blocked. Hence, at N′superscript𝑁′N^{\\prime}, Ti=∅subscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}=\\emptyset, and the process of joining Ti′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′𝑖T^{\\prime}_{i} with Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} started at N′superscript𝑁′N^{\\prime} and Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} has been blocked due to that process. We argue below that by the time N𝑁N, the incremental process for joining Ti′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′𝑖T^{\\prime}_{i} with Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} has already been completed. Indeed, the joining process takes O​(2i+1)𝑂superscript2𝑖1O(2^{i+1}) time as the height of Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} is O​(2i+1)𝑂superscript2𝑖1O(2^{i+1}). Whenever the (i+1)𝑖1(i+1)-th bit of the counter N𝑁N flipped from 00 to 111, c𝑐c steps of the joining process will be performed. Note that the (i+1)𝑖1(i+1)-th bit of the counter N𝑁N flipped from 00 to 111 every 2i+2superscript2𝑖22^{i+2} insertions. Hence, for a sufficiently large constant c𝑐c, the joining process will be completed within 2i+1⋅2i+2=22​i+3⋅superscript2𝑖1superscript2𝑖2superscript22𝑖32^{i+1}\\cdot 2^{i+2}=2^{2i+3} insertions. If we make c𝑐c larger, then we can say that the joining process will be completed within 22​isuperscript22𝑖2^{2i} insertions. On the other hand, at N′superscript𝑁′N^{\\prime}, we have Ti=∅subscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}=\\emptyset. We argue that after 22​isuperscript22𝑖2^{2i} insertions, the size of Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} cannot be larger than or equal to 22i+1superscript2superscript2𝑖12^{2^{i+1}}. Indeed, all points of Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} are originally from Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j} for all 0≤j<i0𝑗𝑖0\\leq j<i. At N′superscript𝑁′N^{\\prime}, the total number of points in all trees Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j} for 0≤j<i0𝑗𝑖0\\leq j<i is no larger than 2⋅22i⋅2superscript2superscript2𝑖2\\cdot 2^{2^{i}} by Observation 2.1(2). Hence, after 22​isuperscript22𝑖2^{2i} insertions, the total number of points that can be inserted to Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} is at most 2⋅22i+22​i⋅2superscript2superscript2𝑖superscript22𝑖2\\cdot 2^{2^{i}}+2^{2i}, which is smaller than 22i+1superscript2superscript2𝑖12^{2^{i+1}} for i≥1𝑖1i\\geq 1. The above implies that by the time N𝑁N when ni≥22i+1subscript𝑛𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖1n_{i}\\geq 2^{2^{i+1}}, the incremental process for joining Ti′subscriptsuperscript𝑇′𝑖T^{\\prime}_{i} with Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} has already been completed, and therefore, Ti+1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i+1} cannot be blocked. This proves the second lemma statement.\n As we only perform O​(1)𝑂1O(1) incremental work, the total time for inserting p𝑝p is O​(1)𝑂1O(1). To perform DeleteRight, we maintain a stack that records the changes made on each insertion. To delete a point p𝑝p, p𝑝p must be the most recently inserted point, and thus all changes made due to the insertion of p𝑝p are at the top of the stack. To perform the deletion, we simply pop the stack and roll back all the changes during the insertion of p𝑝p. To perform TreeRetrieval, we start by completing all incremental joining processes. Then, we join all trees Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}’s in their index order. This results in a single BST T𝑇T storing all points of P𝑃P. In applications, we usually need to perform binary searches on T𝑇T, after which we need to continue processing insertions and deletions on P𝑃P. To this end, when constructing T𝑇T as above, we maintain a stack that records the changes we have made. Once we are done with queries on T𝑇T, we use the stack to roll back the changes and return the stack tree to its original form right before the TreeRetrieval operation. For the time analysis, it takes O​(2i)𝑂superscript2𝑖O(2^{i}) steps to finish an incremental joining process for each Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} (i.e., merging Ti−1subscript𝑇𝑖1T_{i-1} with Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}). Hence, it takes O​(∑i=1⌈log⁡log⁡n⌉2i)=O​(log⁡n)𝑂superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛superscript2𝑖𝑂𝑛O\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{\\lceil\\log\\log n\\rceil}2^{i}\\right)=O(\\log n) time to finish all such processes. Next, joining all trees Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i}’s in their index order takes O​(∑i=0⌈log⁡log⁡n⌉2i)=O​(log⁡n)𝑂superscriptsubscript𝑖0𝑛superscript2𝑖𝑂𝑛O\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{\\lceil\\log\\log n\\rceil}2^{i}\\right)=O(\\log n) time in total. As such, the stack used to record changes made during the operation has size O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) because it stores O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) changes. Rolling back all changes in the stack thus takes O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time as well. Therefore, TreeRetrieval  can be performed in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: in O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time, we represent N𝑁N by a sequence of ranges, where each range represents a contiguous subsequence of digits of 1’s in N𝑁N. For example, if N𝑁N is 101100111, then the ranges are  ,[ref]5 , 025688 ,[ref]5 , . After N𝑁N is incremented by one, N𝑁N becomes 101101000, and the ranges become  ,[ref]5 , 335688 ,[ref]5 , . Therefore, based on the first two ranges in the range sequence,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
