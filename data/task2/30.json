      "content": "Paper Title: 2PS: High-Quality Edge Partitioning with Two-Phase Streaming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData Sets. We perform a set of performance evaluations on real-world graphs (cf. Table¬†1) of different scales and origin. TW666https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitter-2010.html¬†  and FR777https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Friendster.html¬†  are social networks; IT888http://law.di.unimi.it/webdata/it-2004/¬†  , UK999http://law.di.unimi.it/webdata/uk-2007-05/¬†  , GSH101010http://law.di.unimi.it/webdata/gsh-2015/¬†   and WDC111111http://webdatacommons.org/hyperlinkgraph/ are web graphs. Baselines. From the group of streaming partitioners, we compare to HDRF¬†, DBH¬†1 and SNE (a streaming version of the random-access partitioning algorithm NE¬†3). We chose these baselines for the following reasons. HDRF delivers low replication factor at modest run-time and memory overhead. DBH is based on hashing and is the fastest streaming partitioner with the lowest memory overhead. Finally, SNE delivers a lower replication factor than HDRF, albeit at a significantly higher run-time and memory overhead. Other streaming partitioners (Greedy¬†) are outperformed by our chosen baseline partitioners, or they are too slow to partition large graphs in a reasonable time (ADWISE¬†). While random-access partitioners generally induce a large memory overhead, they are a challenging baseline in terms of replication factor and run-time. From the group of random-access partitioners, we compare to NE¬†3 and DNE¬†. These are currently the partitioners that achieve the lowest replication factor (NE) and the best scalability (DNE). Other random-access partitioners take too much memory or run-time to partition the real-world graphs on our evaluation platform (KaHiP¬†[ref]34) or they are outperformed by DNE in terms of replication factor and run-time (Spinner¬†[ref]26, ParMetis¬†, XtraPulp¬†, Sheep¬†). For a fair comparison, we re-implemented the HDRF algorithm in C++ and use the same implementation of HDRF also for edge partitioning in the second phase of 2PS. We also re-implemented DBH, using the same framework that we developed for HDRF and 2PS. For NE, SNE and DNE, we use the reference implementation of the respective authors. All implementations that we use, except for DNE, ingest the graph in the same binary input format (i.e., binary edge list with 32-bit vertex ids). DNE ingests an ASCII edge list‚Äîthere is no option for binary input provided in the reference implementation of DNE. Evaluation Platform. We perform all experiments on a server with 4 x 16 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-4650 0@2.70GHz, 503 GiB of main memory and 1 x 4.4 TB HDD disk. The operating system is Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS. Experimental Settings. We used the following settings throughout all experiments. The balancing constraint Œ±ùõº\\alpha was set to 1.05. Further, we configured the system parameters of the baseline partitioner according to the authors‚Äô recommendations as follows. We configured HDRF with a setting of Œª=1.1ùúÜ1.1\\lambda=1.1. For SNE, we used a cache size of 2‚àó|V|2ùëâ2*|V|. For DNE, we set an expansion ratio of 0.1. For each experiment, we re-compiled the partitioners with optimal settings, as far as compilation flags were offered. For 2PS, HDRF and DNE, we set the maximum number of partitions to the numbers used in the corresponding experiment. Further, we compiled DNE with 32-bit vertex ids. This way, the memory overhead of the partitioners was minimized as far as possible. Finally, for DNE, we adapted the number of threads per process as follows. In DNE, for each partition, a separate process is spawned. As our evaluation machine offers 64 hardware threads, we tried to reach a total number of 64 threads, if possible. This means that each process gets ‚åà64k‚åâ64ùëò\\lceil\\frac{64}{k}\\rceil threads.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: lowest replication factor (NE) and the best scalability (DNE).
