Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Blind Face Restoration via Deep Multi-scale Component Dictionaries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the performance of reference-based methods are usually superior to other single image or face restoration methods , in this paper, we mainly compare our DFDNet with reference-based (i.e., GFRNet , GWAINet [ref]7) and face prior-based methods (i.e., Shen et al. [ref]33, Kim et al. ). We also report the results of single natural image (i.e., RCAN [ref]46, ESRGAN ) and face (i.e., WaveletSR ) super-resolution methods.\nAmong these methods, Shen et al. [ref]33 and Kim et al.  can only handle 128×128128128128\\times 128 images,\nwhile others can restore 256×256256256256\\times 256 images. For fair comparisons, our DFDNet is trained on these two sizes (termed as DFDNet128 and DFDNet256). RCAN [ref]46 and ESRGAN  were originally trained on the natural images, thus we retrain them using our training data for further fair comparison (termed as *RCAN and *ESRGAN). WaveletSR  was also retrained by using our training data with their released training code (termed as *WaveletSR). Following , PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS  are reported on the super-resolution task (×4absent4\\times 4 and ×8absent8\\times 8) which also has the random injection of Gaussian noise and blur operation for quantitatively evaluating on the blind restoration task. In terms of qualitative comparison, we demonstrate the comparisons on the synthetic and real-world low-quality images. More visual results including high resolution restoration performance (i.e., 512×512512512512\\times 512) can be found in our supplemental materials.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: of reference-based methods are usually superior to other single image or face restoration methods , in this paper, we mainly compare our DFDNet with reference-based (i.e., GFRNet , GWAINet [ref]7) and face prior-based methods (i.e., Shen et al. [ref]33, Kim et al. ). We also report the results of single natural image (i.e., RCAN [ref]46, ESRGAN ) and face (i.e., WaveletSR )\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
