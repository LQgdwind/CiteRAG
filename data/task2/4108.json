      "content": "Paper Title: E2PN: Efficient SE(3)-Equivariant Point Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur major baseline to compare with is EPN [ref]2, a state-of-the-art group convolution network, as we are similar in several ways. Both are KPConv-style convolutions with SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3)-equivariance. Both use the icosahedral rotation group ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} to discretize SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3). However, EPN has features defined on ℐ×ℝ3ℐsuperscriptℝ3\\mathcal{I}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{3}, compared with S2×′ℝ3S^{2}{{}^{\\prime}}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{3} in our method. Two datasets, ModelNet40 [ref]44 and 3DMatch [ref]47, are used in the experiments. ModelNet40 is composed of 3D CAD models of 40 categories of objects. 3DMatch is a real-scan dataset of indoor scenes. For the ModelNet40 dataset, we conduct the classification and pose estimation tasks. For the 3DMatch dataset, we conduct the keypoint matching task. These tasks are also studied in EPN [ref]2. In Tab. 1, we list the GPU memory consumption and running speed of our method and EPN [ref]2 in the three tasks. The comparisons are under the same input size, number of feature channels, and number of network layers. The separable convolutions on SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3) and ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3} in EPN are together considered as one layer.\nThe numbers are not comparable between training and inference because the batch size could be different (see the appendix). The specific configurations in each experiment are introduced later. All experiments are run on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. Our network with quotient space convolutions is much smaller and runs much faster in all three tasks,\nindicating the potential value for real applications.\nWe boost efficiency without sacrificing performance, as is shown later.\n Ablation study: \nWe list two rows of our results in Tab. 1 to show the effect of efficient feature gathering enabled by the symmetric kernels. The results of without symmetric kernels are generated using the same kernel points as with symmetric kernels, but ignoring the fact that they are symmetric to rotations and gathering features at |S2|′|ℝ3|′|S^{2}{{}^{\\prime}}||\\mathbb{R}^{3}{{}^{\\prime}}| locations, instead of at |ℝ3|′|\\mathbb{R}^{3}{{}^{\\prime}}| locations and permuting them. The efficient feature gathering brings further efficiency improvements, especially in terms of computational speed.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Our major baseline to compare with is EPN [ref]2, a state-of-the-art group convolution network, as we are similar in several ways.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
