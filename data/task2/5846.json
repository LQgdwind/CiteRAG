      "content": "Paper Title: OTAvatar:One-shot Talking Face Avatar with Controllable Tri-plane Rendering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTri-plane volume representation. The output of the 3D animator network G​(⋅,⋅;Θ)G⋅⋅Θ\\emph{G}(\\cdot,\\cdot;\\Theta) in Eqn. 1 is a tri-plane volume representation, which is composed of three feature planes: where 𝐅x​ysubscript𝐅𝑥𝑦\\mathbf{F}_{xy}, 𝐅x​zsubscript𝐅𝑥𝑧\\mathbf{F}_{xz}, and 𝐅y​zsubscript𝐅𝑦𝑧\\mathbf{F}_{yz} are three axis-aligned orthogonal feature maps in the 3D space, implicitly forming the volume 𝐕t​r​isubscript𝐕𝑡𝑟𝑖\\mathbf{V}_{tri}. When performing volume rendering, for each queried point (x,y,z)𝑥𝑦𝑧(x,y,z), we project it onto each of three feature maps and retrieve the corresponding features (𝐅x​y​(x,y),𝐅x​z​(x,z),𝐅y​z​(y,z))subscript𝐅𝑥𝑦𝑥𝑦subscript𝐅𝑥𝑧𝑥𝑧subscript𝐅𝑦𝑧𝑦𝑧(\\mathbf{F}_{xy}(x,y),\\mathbf{F}_{xz}(x,z),\\mathbf{F}_{yz}(y,z)). The summation of features is sent to a lightweight MLP to decode color and opacity. Compared to fully implicit MLP architectures[ref]15 [ref]46 [ref]4 or volume representation, we can efficiently regress the three 2D feature maps through a CNN architecture. In our implementation,\nG is a deconvolutional network  that outputs three 256×256×3225625632256\\times 256\\times 32 feature maps. Animator structure. Towards animating the face avatar of a given portrait, an intuitive solution is representing 𝐰i​dsubscript𝐰𝑖𝑑\\mathbf{w}_{id} with a pre-defined feature and training G​(⋅)G⋅\\emph{G}(\\cdot) from scratch. However, we find that the model does not work well due to the sub-optimal 𝐰i​dsubscript𝐰𝑖𝑑\\mathbf{w}_{id}. For example, when employing 3DMM shape coefficients  and face recognition features, the identity information is not preserved in the rendering results because 𝐰i​dsubscript𝐰𝑖𝑑\\mathbf{w}_{id} does not encode face appearances well. These models are trained on cropped facial images which contain no torso and hairstyle. Therefore, 𝐰i​dsubscript𝐰𝑖𝑑\\mathbf{w}_{id} losses such information that is necessary when animating portraits. The network even collapses if we make 𝐰i​dsubscript𝐰𝑖𝑑\\mathbf{w}_{id} learnable. In this work, we employ a two-phase strategy to achieve one-shot avatar reconstruction: 1) building a 3D face generator, and 2) making the generator controllable.\nWe build our 3D face generator on a pre-trained EG3D network, which incorporates tri-plane representation for efficient 3D face generation: where 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} is an uninterpretable latent code drawn from the latent space of the generator Ge​gsubscriptG𝑒𝑔\\emph{G}_{eg}. The latent space is determined by the generator weight Θe​gsubscriptΘ𝑒𝑔\\Theta_{eg}.\nTo control the latent code 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} by the given identity represented by 𝐰i​dsubscript𝐰𝑖𝑑\\mathbf{w}_{id} and motion signal 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, we propose a motion controller module C parameterized by ΘcsubscriptΘ𝑐\\Theta_{c}, which maps motion signal 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} to the motion code 𝐰xsubscript𝐰𝑥\\mathbf{w}_{x}, such that: Injecting Eqn. 4 to Eqn. 3 , we have the structure of the 3D animator: In our implementation, the motion signal 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is constructed by 3DMM pose and expression coefficients , which are more flexible compared with image-based driving signals 1 2 6, especially in cross-identity driving. Controller structure. We use the concatenation of 3DMM pose and expression coefficients to represent motion 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}. Practically, we use the adjacent coefficients of pose and expression within a particular radius to represent the motion signal of the current frame, firstly the weighted summation of the coefficients across the temporal dimension is conducted to avoid noises, which is achieved by three 1D convolution layers ; secondly, a five-layer MLP is employed to transform the weighted summation into a motion feature; finally, a codebook with learnable orthogonal bases 6 is built, on which each motion feature is projected to get the final motion code 𝐰xsubscript𝐰𝑥\\mathbf{w}_{x}. The aforementioned operation is summarized as follows: where FTsubscriptF𝑇\\emph{F}_{T} parameterized by ΘTsubscriptΘ𝑇\\Theta_{T} is the temporal smoothing network of 1D convolution layers, FMsubscriptF𝑀\\emph{F}_{M} parameterized by ΘMsubscriptΘ𝑀\\Theta_{M} is the five-layer MLP which projects motion to the magnitudes of bases contained in the codebook 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D}. It can be seen that the magnitude projection parameters, temporal smoothing weights, and the codebook are the parameters of the controller C to be trained, that is:\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: The summation of features is sent to a lightweight MLP to decode color and opacity.
