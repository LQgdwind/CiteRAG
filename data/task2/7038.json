We argue that this limitation to a single utility function is not realistic. Moreover, it requires complete non-causal information about the MCS system. Following a game theory approach, the authors in  investigate an optimal incentive mechanism for the MCS using a two-stage Stackelberg game. Their goal is to efficiently recruit MUs to perform the available sensing tasks while assuming payments to be fixed in advance.\nIn[ref]7, the MU’s effort is assumed to depend on its location.\nThe authors propose a privacy-preserving approach to obtain information about the MU’s location and thus, estimate the MU’s efforts.\nThe authors in  use matching theory to balance the preferences of the MCSP and the MUs while assuming the payments by the MCSP are fixed in advance.\nSimilarly, assuming known preferences for the MCSP and the MUs, the authors in  formulate a two-stage matching problem to maximize the coverage in a MCS system.\nFollowing a social welfare maximization approach, the authors in  propose an auction-based method to balance the MCSP and MU’s interests when assigning the sensing tasks. The use of these game-theory-based approaches allows the consideration of the conflicting goals of the MCSP and MUs. However, similar to the optimization approaches  and , the game theory approaches  [ref]7 and    are subjected to the strict requirement that information about the MUs’ costs and/or payment requests is known in advance.\nThis requirement makes these approaches infeasible in practical systems, as the tasks’ characteristics and the effort to complete tasks are not known a priori and may change over time. The problem of task assignment under unknown MU efforts is investigated in     .\nIn , the authors propose a location-prediction-based online task assignment strategy in which the MU’s effort depends on its location in a mobile social network.\nIn , Lyapunov optimization is used to derive a task assignment policy that maximizes the gain of the MCSP.\nThe authors in  propose prediction methods to estimate the MU’s effort at the MCSP.\nThe task pricing problem in a point-to-point MCS system is considered in , where a two-stage mean field approximation Stackelberg differential game is used to model the MCSP-MU interaction.\nCombinatorial multi-armed bandits are considered in  to maximize the expected quality of the data received at the MSCP.\nEven though the solutions in      overcome the requirement of complete non-causal information about the MCS, they are limited to a single utility function, i.e., they only consider either the MCSP’s or the MUs’ perspective when the MU’s efforts are unknown. Clearly, as discussed, the prior art is limited in several ways.\nThe conflicting interests of the MCSP and MUs under realistic conditions, i.e., when the MU’s efforts are not known in advance, have not been considered yet.\nFurthermore, the prior art does not consider the problem of collision in the online learning scenario.\nCollisions may significantly reduce the overall performance and therefore need to be avoided.\nThis open problem of online learning for the task assignment can be cast as a multi-player multi-armed bandit problem [ref]20.\nIn the learning literature, multi-player multi-armed bandits have been investigated under some simplifying assumptions.\nFor example, assuming that there are no individual preferences, the authors in [ref]21 propose to divide the reward among colliding agents to improve the learning speed.\nIn , a multi-armed bandit with a collision-avoidance mechanism is proposed. The authors assume that there are no individual costs or payments associated to the decisions in order to allow each player to learn its own preferences while avoiding collisions with competitors. Centralized and decentralized learning strategies are compared in , where the effect of sharing the learned preferences is analyzed.\nThis work assumes a cooperative setting, in which all agents communicate their decisions with all other agents.\nDespite considering multi-agent multi-armed bandits, the solutions in [ref]20 [ref]21   cannot be applied to the task allocation problem in MCS. Their simplifying assumptions clash with the requirements of MCS. Specifically, the MCSP and the MUs have individual preferences according to their capabilities and conditions. Moreover, the allocation of task implies an effort for the MUs and a payment for the MCSP, and the strict privacy constraints and communication overhead requirements limit the communication between the agents.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Prior works  [ref]7  and           that attempted to address the aforementioned challenges related to MCS task assignment can be categorized into three directions:\ni) Optimization approaches, such as in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
