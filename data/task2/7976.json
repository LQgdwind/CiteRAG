For future work, one goal is to formalise the proofs in the appendices using a proof assistant.\nAnother avenue for future work is extending our formulae to cover a wider range of completeness criteria and properties. We suggest some potential extensions here. One of our contributions is the identification of a shared common structure underlying justness, weak fairness and weak hyperfairness: they are finitely realisable path predicates.\nOur formula for such predicates can be adapted to arbitrary feasible finitely realisable path predicates.\nWhile we do not have such a generic formula for other completeness criteria, our characterisation of (œÅ,Œ±f,Œ±e)ùúåsubscriptùõºùëìsubscriptùõºùëí(\\rho,\\alpha_{\\mathit{f}},\\alpha_{\\mathit{e}})-violating paths can be used as a basis to express the non-existence of complete paths violating many common properties for different notions of completeness as well, as we demonstrate with strong fairness and strong hyperfairness.\nWe are especially interested in extending our formulae to allow fairness over sets of actions, rather than individual actions, similar to the task-based definitions from [ref]25. In terms of properties, we can look at proposed extensions of PSP, such as those suggested in . There is also the constrained chain behaviour, which is a modification of precedence chain and response chain given in .\nThere are extensions of PSP to real-time   and probabilistic  contexts as well.\nFinally, in  the formula from  that formed the basis of Formula¬†2 is extended to also include state information. There are therefore many potentially useful extensions of the formulae presented in this paper. However, the presented template formulae already cover many completeness criteria and liveness properties, making them useful for model checking in practice.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: and strong hyperfairness.\nWe are especially interested in extending our formulae to allow fairness over sets of actions, rather than individual actions, similar to the task-based definitions from [ref]25.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
