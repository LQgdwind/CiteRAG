      "content": "Paper Title: A Complete Quantitative Axiomatisation of Behavioural Distance of Regular Expressions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransition systems have been widely employed to model computational phenomena. In theoretical computer science, it is customary to model computations as transition systems and subsequently reason about their equivalence or similarity.\nClassical examples include checking language equivalence of deterministic finite automata using Hopcroft and Karp’s algorithm  or constructing bisimulations between labelled transition systems . Throughout the years, especially in the concurrency theory community, researchers have studied a plethora of different notions of behavioural equivalences and preorders one could impose on a transition system . However, in many practical applications, especially when dealing with probabilistic or quantitative transition systems, asking about such classical notions of equivalence (or similarity) could be too strict, and it might be more reasonable to ask quantitative questions about how far apart the behaviour of the two states is. A growing line of work on behavioural distances  [ref]5    answers this problem by equipping state-spaces of transition systems with (pseudo)metric structures quantifying the dissimilarity of states. In such a setting, states at distance zero are not necessarily the same, but rather equivalent with respect to some classical notion of behavioural equivalence. In a nutshell, equipping transition systems with such a notion of distance crucially relies on the possibility of lifting the distance between the states to the distance on the observable behaviour of the transition system. Behavioural distances were originally studied in the context of probabilistic transition systems  , where observable behaviour is in the form of probability distribution among possible transitions. In such a case, the necessary lifting of distances between states to distances between probability distributions of possible outcomes relies on the famous Kantorovich/Wasserstein liftings, studied traditionally in transportation theory 1. In general, transition systems can be viewed more abstractly through a well-established category-theoretic framework of coalgebras for an endofunctor . Recent work [ref]5 generalised the Kantorovich/Wassertstein lifting to lifting endofunctors (modelling one-step behaviour of transition systems) from the category of sets and functions to the category of (pseudo)metric spaces and nonexpansive functions, thus allowing equipping a multitude of different kinds of transition systems with a sensible notion of behavioural distance. Traditionally, besides looking at behavioural equivalence/similarity purely from the algorithmic point of view, one can look at those problems axiomatically, by describing behaviours of transition systems as expressions and by providing formal systems based on (in)equational logic for reasoning about equivalence/similarity of the transition systems described by the expressions. Classic examples include reasoning about language equivalence of Kleene’s regular expressions representing deterministic finite automata using inference systems of Salomaa  or Kozen , or reasoning about bisimilarity of finite-state labelled transition systems through Milner’s calculus of finite-state behaviours . In this paper, we are interested in a similar axiomatic point of view, but in the case of behavioural distances. Unfortunately, the classical (in)equational logic cannot be applied here, as it has no way of talking about approximate equivalence. Instead, we rely on the quantitative analogue of equational logic , which deals with the statements of the form e≡εfsubscript𝜀𝑒𝑓e\\equiv_{\\varepsilon}f, intuitively meaning term e𝑒e is within the distance of at most ε∈ℚ+𝜀superscriptℚ\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{+} from the term f𝑓f. While the existing work    looked at quantitative axiomatisations of behavioural distance for probabilistic transition systems calculated through the Kantorovich/Wasserstein lifting, which can be thought of as a special case of the abstract coalgebraic framework relying on lifting endofunctors to the category of pseudometric spaces, the notions of behavioural distance for other kinds of transition systems have not been axiomatised before. It turns out that the approach to completeness used in  relies on properties which are not unique to distances obtained through the Kantorovich/Wasserstein lifting and can be employed to give complete axiomatisations of behavioural distances for other kinds of transition systems obtained through the coalgebraic framework [ref]5. In this paper, as a starting point, we look at one of the simplest instantiations of that abstract framework in the case of deterministic automata, yielding shortest-distinguishing-word distance. To illustrate that notion of distance, consider the following three deterministic finite automata: Neither of the above automata are language equivalent. Their languages are respectively (from the left) {ϵ,a,a​a,a​a​a,…}italic-ϵ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎…\\{\\epsilon,a,aa,aaa,\\dots\\}, {ϵ,a}italic-ϵ𝑎\\{\\epsilon,a\\} and ∅\\emptyset. However, one could argue that the behaviour of the middle automaton is closer to the one on the left rather than the one on the right. In particular, languages of the left and middle automaton agree on all of the words of length less than two, while the left and right one disagree on all words.\nOne can make this idea precise, by providing 111-bounded metric dℒ:𝒫​(A∗)×𝒫​(A∗)→ :subscript𝑑ℒ→𝒫superscript𝐴𝒫superscript𝐴01d_{\\mathcal{L}}:\\mathcal{P}(A^{*})\\times\\mathcal{P}(A^{*})\\to  on the set of all formal languages over some fixed alphabet A𝐴A given by the following formula, where λ∈]0,1[\\lambda\\in]0,1[ and L,M⊆A∗𝐿𝑀superscript𝐴L,M\\subseteq A^{*}: If we set λ=12𝜆12\\lambda=\\frac{1}{2}, then dℒ​({ϵ,a,a​a,a​a​a,…},{ϵ,a})=14subscript𝑑ℒitalic-ϵ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎…italic-ϵ𝑎14d_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\{\\epsilon,a,aa,aaa,\\dots\\},\\{\\epsilon,a\\})=\\frac{1}{4} and dℒ​({ϵ,a,a​a,a​a​a,…},∅)=1subscript𝑑ℒitalic-ϵ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎…1d_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\{\\epsilon,a,aa,aaa,\\dots\\},\\emptyset)=1, which allows to formally state that the behaviour of the middle automaton is a better approximation of the left one, rather than the right one. Observe, that we excluded λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0 and λ=1𝜆1\\lambda=1, as in both cases dℒsubscript𝑑ℒd_{\\mathcal{L}} would become a pseudometric setting all languages to be at distance zero or one. Automata in the example above correspond to the regular expressions a∗superscript𝑎a^{*}, a+1𝑎1a+1 and 00 respectively. In order to determine the distance between arbitrary regular expressions e𝑒e and f𝑓f one would have to construct corresponding deterministic finite automata and calculate (or approximate) the distance between their languages. Instead, as a main contribution of this paper, we present a sound and complete quantitative inference system for reasoning about the shortest-distinguishing-word distance of languages denoted by regular expressions in question. Formally speaking, if ⟦−⟧:𝖤𝗑𝗉→𝒫(A∗)\\llbracket-\\rrbracket:\\mathsf{Exp}\\to\\mathcal{P}(A^{*}) is a function taking regular expressions to their languages, then our inference system satisfies the following: Although much of our development is grounded in category theory and coalgebra, we spell out all the definitions and results concretely, without the need for specialised language. We organise the paper as follows: In Section 2 we review basic definitions from automata theory and recall the semantics of regular expressions through Brzozowski derivatives 0. Then, in order to talk about distances, we state basic definitions and properties surrounding (pseudo)metric spaces. In Section 3 we instantiate the framework of coalgebraic behavioural metrics [ref]5 to the concrete case of deterministic automata. We recall the abstract results from [ref]5 in simple automata-theoretic terms. In Section 4 we start by recalling the definitions surrounding the quantitative equational theories  from the literature. We then present the axioms of our inference system for the shortest-distinguishing-word distance of regular expressions, give soundness result and provide a discussion about the axioms. The interesting insight is that when relying on quantitative equational theories which contain an infinitary rule capturing the notion of convergence, there is no need for any fixpoint introduction rule. We illustrate this by axiomatically deriving Salomaa’s fixpoint rule for regular expressions . The key result of our paper is contained in Section 5, where we prove completeness of our inference system. The heart of the argument relies on showing that the behavioural distance of regular expressions can be approximated from above using Kleene’s fixpoint theorem, which can be then mimicked through the means of axiomatic reasoning. This part of the paper makes heavy use of the order-theoretic and Banach space structures carried by the sets of pseudometrics over a given set. We conclude in Section 6, review related literature, and sketch directions for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: could be too strict, and it might be more reasonable to ask quantitative questions about how far apart the behaviour of the two states is.
