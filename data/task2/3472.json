      "content": "Paper Title: Grammar-Based Grounded Lexicon Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first evaluate G2L2 on the visual reasoning tasks in the CLEVR domain , where the task is to reason and answer questions about images. In our study, we use a subset of CLEVR dataset, which does not include sentences that involve coreference resolution, and words with multiple meanings in different contexts. We add additional information on how we filter the dataset in the supplementary. Setup. Instead of using manually defined heuristics for curriculum learning or self-paced learning as in previous works [ref]30 , we employ a curriculum learning setup that is simply based on sentence length: we gradually add longer sentences into the training set. This helps the model to learn basic words from very short sentences (6 words), and use the acquired lexicon to facilitate learning longer sentences (20 words). Since CLEVR does not provide test set annotations, for all models, we held out 10% of the training data for model development and test them on the CLEVR validation split. Baselines. We compare G2L2 with 4 baselines. (1) MAC  is an end-to-end approach based on attention. (2) TbD-Net  uses a pre-trained semantic parser to parse the question into a symbolic program, and executes the program with a neural module network [ref]5. (3) Similarly, NS-VQA  also parses the question into a symbolic program. It also extracts an abstract scene representation with pre-trained neural recognition models [ref]19. It executes the program based on the abstract scene representation. Both of the approaches require additional supervision for training the semantic parser, and NS-VQA requires additional annotation for training the visual recognition model. (4) NS-CL [ref]30 jointly learns a neural semantic parser and concept embeddings by looking at images and reading paired questions and answers. It requires the annotation for all concepts in the domain (e.g., colors and shapes). In contrast, G2L2 can automatically discover visual concepts from texts. Results.\nTable 1 summarizes the results. We consider any model that performs in the 95–100 range to have more or less solved the task. Small differences in numeric scores in this range, such as the fact that NS-CL outperforms our model on the “purple” generalization task by 0.2%, are less important than the fact that our model far outperforms all competitors on “count” compositional generalization and the “depth” generalization task, both of which all competitor models are far from solving. We first compare different models on the standard training-testing split. We train different models with either 10% or 100% of the training data and evaluate them on the validation set. Our model achieves a comparable performance in terms of its accuracy and data efficiency. Next, we systematically build three compositional generalization test splits: purple, right of, and count. The detailed setups and examples for these splits are provided in the supplementary. Essentially, we remove  90% of the sentences containing the word purple, the phrase right, and counting operations, such as how many …? and what number of …?. We only keep sentences up to a certain length (6 for purple, 11 for right, and 8 for count). We make sure that each use case of these words appear in training questions. After training, we test these models on the validation set with questions containing these words. Overall, our model G2L2 outperforms all baselines on all three generalization splits. In particular, it significantly outperforms other methods on the count split. The count split is hard for other method because it requires model to generalize to sentences with deeper structures, for example, from “how many red objects are there?” to “how many red objects are right of the cube?” Note that, during training, all models have seen example use of similar structures such as “what’s the shape of the red object” and “what’s the shape of the red object right of the cube?” Finally, we test generalization to sentences with deeper structures (depth). Specifically, we define the “hop number” of a question as the number of intermediate objects being referred to in order to locate the target object. For example, the “hop number” of the question “how many red objects are right of the cube?” is 1. We train different models on 0-hop and 1-hop questions and test them on 2-hop questions. Our model strongly outperforms all baselines. The results on the compositional generalization and depth splits yield two conclusions. First, disentangling grounded concept learning (associating words onto visual appearances) and reasoning (e.g., filtering or counting subsets of objects in a given scene) improves data efficiency and generalization. On CLEVR, neuro-symbolic approaches that separately identify concepts and perform explicit reasoning (NS-VQA, NS-CL and G2L2) consistently generalize better than approaches that do not (MAC, TbD). The comparison between TbD and NS-VQA is informative: TbD fails on the “right of” task even in the case where the semantic parser is providing correct programs, while NS-VQA, which uses the same parser but explicitly represents compositional symbolic concepts for reasoning, succeeds in this task. Crucially, of the three neuro-symbolic methods, G2L2 achieves strong performance with less domain-specific knowledge than other methods: NS-VQA needs groundtruth programs; NS-CL needs the concept vocabulary; G2L2 requires neither. Second, our model is the only one to perform well on the hardest “out-of-sample” generalization tests: holding out “count” and generalizing to deeper embeddings. The other, easier generalization tests all have close neighbors in the training set, differing by just one word. In contrast, the length, depth and “count” tests require generalizing to sentences that differ in multiple words from any training example. They appear to require – or at least benefit especially well from – G2L2 ’s lexical-grammatical approach to capturing meaning of complex utterances, with explicit constituent-level (as opposed to simply word-level) composition. We also provide in-depth analysis for the behavior of different semantic parsing models in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: add additional information on how we filter the dataset in the supplementary.
