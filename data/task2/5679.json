      "content": "Paper Title: Taming Contrast Maximization for Learning Sequential, Low-latency, Event-based Optical Flow\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvaluation on DSEC-Flow: Quantitative results of our evaluation on DSEC-Flow are presented in Table¬†1, and are supported by the qualitative comparison in Fig.¬†7. For this experiment, we trained multiple models with the same dt=input{}_{\\text{input}}= 0.01s (i.e., √ó\\times10 faster than DSEC‚Äôs ground truth) but different lengths of the training partition, and with and without the multi-timescale approach. Multiple conclusions can be derived from the reported results. Firstly, our best performing model (i.e., RùëÖR == 101010, SùëÜS == 111) achieves the best accuracy of all contrast-maximization-based approaches on this dataset according to the EPE and the percentage of outliers.\nSpecifically, it outperforms the baselines with an improvement in the EPE in the 33%‚ÄÖ‚Äì‚ÄÖ45% range, only being outperformed by SL methods trained with ground truth on the same dataset  [ref]43  [ref]9 . This confirms that (i) the timestamp-based loss function in Section¬†3.1 allows us to learn accurate event-based optical flow (contrary to the findings of ); and that (ii) our augmentations\nto the sequential pipeline in [ref]19 lead to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the model (i.e., 45% improvement in the EPE). Secondly, these results also confirm our hypothesis that, for each training dataset, there is an optimal length for the training partition RùëÖR in terms of the EPE. According to Table¬†1, the optimal RùëÖR for this dataset, our model architecture, and our dtinputinput{}_{\\text{input}} is 10 (i.e., 0.1s of event data), with the EPE increasing if the training partition is made shorter or longer. However, as also shown in this table, we can relax the strong dependency of the contrast maximization framework on this parameter through the proposed multi-timescale approach. Our SùëÜS >> 1 models converged to solutions that slightly underperform our best performing single-scale model (EPE went up by 17%‚ÄÖ‚Äì‚ÄÖ21%), but were trained without the need to fine-tune the length of the training partition. Note that, despite this slight drop in accuracy, these multi-timescale solutions still outperform the other non-SL baselines. To further support these results, a visualization of the distribution of the EPE of our models as a function of the ground truth magnitude is provided in the supplementary material. Lastly, Table¬†1 also allow us to conclude that deblurring quality metrics FWL  and RSAT [ref]19 are not reliable indicators of the quality of the estimated optical flow. The reason for this is their inability to capture ‚Äúevent collapse‚Äù issues (as described in ), and would give favorable scores to undesirable solutions that warp all the events into a few pixels. According to our results, the FWL metric, being the spatial variance of the IWE relative to that of the identity warp, suffers more from this issue: the best FWL value is obtained with a model with 9.66 EPE. Regarding qualitative results, Fig.¬†7 shows a comparison of our best performing model with the state-of-the-art E-RAFT architecture  and the contrast-maximization-based approach from Shiba et al.¬† on multiple sequences from the test partition of DSEC-Flow (i.e., ground truth is unavailable). These results confirm that our models are able to estimate high quality event-based optical flow despite not having access to ground-truth data during training, and also show the superiority of our method over the current best contrast-maximization-based approach . Two limit cases in which our models provide suboptimal solutions are also shown in this figure: (i) sequences recorded at night (e.g., zurich_city_12_a) due to the presence of large amounts of events triggered by flashing lights and not by motion; and (ii) the car hood, which is also problematic for E-RAFT (i.e., does not capture it) and for .\nNote that, in our case, (ii) is an artifact of the pixel displacements reconstructed from multiple optical flow estimates, and could be mitigated by having an occlusion handling mechanism in this reconstruction process. In addition to the evaluation in Table¬†1 and Fig.¬†7, we also conducted an experiment in which we trained multiple models with different dtinputinput{}_{\\text{input}} (ranging from 0.1s to 0.002s) but with the same amount of information in the training partition: 0.1s of event data. Results in Table¬†2 show that our sequential pipeline\nleads to an improvement in the accuracy of the predicted optical flow maps with respect to the stateless EV-FlowNet, which processes the 0.1s of event data at once. This improvement is due to the fact that the complexity of dealing with large pixel displacements gets reduced when processing the input data sequentially using shorter input windows. In addition to this, Table¬†2 also shows that the accuracy of our models is not compromised when estimating optical flow at higher frequencies, despite the high sparsity levels in the input data at those rates. Evaluation on MVSEC: Quantitative results of our evaluation on the oudoor_day1 sequence from MVSEC are presented in Table¬†3, and are supported by the qualitative comparison in the supplementary material. For this experiment, since (i) there is no consensus in the literature with respect to the training dataset     [ref]19  , and (ii) the outdoor_day2 sequence (i.e., the other daylight, automotive sequence) is only 9 minutes of duration during which the event camera is subject to high frequency vibrations , we decided to transfer one of our models trained on DSEC-Flow to MVSEC. More specifically, we chose the model trained with dtinputinput{}_{\\text{input}} == 0.0050.0050.005s and RùëÖR == 202020\nfrom Table¬†2, as a model trained with a short input window on DSEC-Flow is expected to be robust to the slow motion statistics of MVSEC . We deployed the model at the same frequency as the temporally-upsampled ground truth (i.e., 45 Hz). Results in Table¬†3 show that, by doing this, our model outperforms the great majority of methods in terms of the EPE (even some SL methods trained on this dataset), and is only surpassed by the current state-of-the-art E-RAFT  and TMA  architectures. Besides reaffirming the high quality of the produced optical flow estimates, these results also confirm the generalizability of our method. For completeness, the results on the indoor evaluation sequences from MVSEC are provided in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: of outliers.\nSpecifically, it outperforms the baselines with an improvement in the EPE in the 33%‚ÄÖ‚Äì‚ÄÖ45% range, only being outperformed by SL methods trained with ground truth on the same dataset  [ref]43  [ref]9 .
