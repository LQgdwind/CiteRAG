      "content": "Paper Title: Non-Deterministic Approximation Fixpoint Theory and Its Application in Disjunctive Logic Programming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now recall basic notions from approximation fixpoint theory (AFT), as described by Denecker, Marek and Truszczyński .\nAs we have already noted, AFT introduces constructive techniques for approximating the fixpoints of an operator O𝑂O over a lattice L=⟨ℒ,≤⟩𝐿ℒL={\\langle{\\cal L},\\leq\\rangle}.\nThis is particularly useful when O𝑂O is non-monotonic (as is often the case in logic programming, default logic and abstract argumentation, and other disciplines\nfor non-monotonic reasoning in AI), in which case such operators are not guaranteed to even have a fixpoint, or a unique least fixpoint that can be constructively obtained.\nAFT generalizes the principles for the construction of fixpoints to the non-monotonic setting, by working with approximations of such operators on a bilattice [ref]4     , constructed on the basis of L𝐿L. Given a lattice L=⟨ℒ,≤⟩𝐿ℒL={\\langle{\\cal L},\\leq\\rangle}, a bilattice is the structure L2=⟨ℒ2,≤i,≤t⟩superscript𝐿2superscriptℒ2subscript𝑖subscript𝑡L^{2}={\\langle{\\cal L}^{2},\\leq_{i},\\leq_{t}\\rangle}, in which\nℒ2=ℒ×ℒsuperscriptℒ2ℒℒ{\\cal L}^{2}={\\cal L}\\times{\\cal L}, and for every x1,y1,x2,y2∈ℒsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2ℒx_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2}\\in{\\cal L}, \n∙∙\\bullet (x1,y1)≤i(x2,y2)subscript𝑖subscript𝑥1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2(x_{1},y_{1})\\leq_{i}(x_{2},y_{2}) if x1≤x2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2x_{1}\\leq x_{2} and y1≥y2subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2y_{1}\\geq y_{2}, \n∙∙\\bullet (x1,y1)≤t(x2,y2)subscript𝑡subscript𝑥1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2(x_{1},y_{1})\\leq_{t}(x_{2},y_{2}) if x1≤x2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2x_{1}\\leq x_{2} and y1≤y2subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2y_{1}\\leq y_{2}.777Recall that we use small letters to denote elements of lattice, capital letters to denote\nsets of elements, and capital calligraphic letters to denote sets of sets of elements (Table 1). Bilattices of the form L2superscript𝐿2L^{2} are used for defining operators that approximate operators on L𝐿L. An approximating operator 𝒪:ℒ2→ℒ2:𝒪→superscriptℒ2superscriptℒ2{\\cal O}:{\\cal L}^{2}\\rightarrow{\\cal L}^{2} of an operator O:ℒ→ℒ:𝑂→ℒℒO:{\\cal L}\\rightarrow{\\cal L} is an operator that maps every\napproximation (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) of an element z𝑧z to an approximation (x′,y′)superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}) of another element O​(z)𝑂𝑧O(z), thus approximating the behavior of the approximated operator O𝑂O.\nApproximation operators may be viewed as combinations of two operators: (𝒪(.,.))1({\\cal O}(.,.))_{1} and (𝒪(.,.))2({\\cal O}(.,.))_{2} which calculate, respectively, a lower and\nan upper bounds for the value of O𝑂O (where, as usual, (x,y)1subscript𝑥𝑦1(x,y)_{1} respectively (x,y)2subscript𝑥𝑦2(x,y)_{2} represents the first respectively second component of (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y)).\nTo avoid clutter, we will also denote (𝒪​(x,y))1subscript𝒪𝑥𝑦1({\\cal O}(x,y))_{1} by 𝒪l​(x,y)subscript𝒪𝑙𝑥𝑦{\\cal O}_{l}(x,y) and (𝒪​(x,y))2subscript𝒪𝑥𝑦2({\\cal O}(x,y))_{2} by 𝒪u​(x,y)subscript𝒪𝑢𝑥𝑦{\\cal O}_{u}(x,y). Two fundamental requirements on approximating operators are the following: ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-monotonicity: the values of an approximating operator should be more precise as its arguments are more precise, and exactness: exact arguments are mapped\nto exact values. These requirements result in the following definition: Let O:ℒ→ℒ:𝑂→ℒℒO:{\\cal L}\\rightarrow{\\cal L} and 𝒪:ℒ2→ℒ2:𝒪→superscriptℒ2superscriptℒ2{\\cal O}:{\\cal L}^{2}\\rightarrow{\\cal L}^{2}. 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} is ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-monotonic, if when (x1,y1)≤i(x2,y2)subscript𝑖subscript𝑥1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2(x_{1},y_{1})\\leq_{i}(x_{2},y_{2}), also 𝒪​(x1,y1)≤i𝒪​(x2,y2)subscript𝑖𝒪subscript𝑥1subscript𝑦1𝒪subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2{\\cal O}(x_{1},y_{1})\\leq_{i}{\\cal O}(x_{2},y_{2});\n𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} is approximating, if it is ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-monotonic and for any x∈ℒ𝑥ℒx\\in{\\cal L}, 𝒪l​(x,x)=𝒪u​(x,x)subscript𝒪𝑙𝑥𝑥subscript𝒪𝑢𝑥𝑥{\\cal O}_{l}(x,x)={\\cal O}_{u}(x,x).888In some papers (e.g., ), an approximation operator is defined as a symmetric ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-monotonic operator,\ni.e. a ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-monotonic operator s.t. for every x,y∈ℒ𝑥𝑦ℒx,y\\in{\\cal L}, 𝒪​(x,y)=(𝒪l​(x,y),𝒪l​(y,x))𝒪𝑥𝑦subscript𝒪𝑙𝑥𝑦subscript𝒪𝑙𝑦𝑥{\\cal O}(x,y)=({\\cal O}_{l}(x,y),{\\cal O}_{l}(y,x)) for some\n𝒪l:ℒ2→ℒ:subscript𝒪𝑙→superscriptℒ2ℒ{\\cal O}_{l}:{\\cal L}^{2}\\rightarrow{\\cal L}. However, the weaker condition we take here (taken from ) is actually\nsufficient for most results on AFT.   𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} is an approximation of O𝑂O, if it is ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-monotonic and\n𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} extends O𝑂O, that is: 𝒪​(x,x)=(O​(x),O​(x))𝒪𝑥𝑥𝑂𝑥𝑂𝑥{\\cal O}(x,x)=(O(x),O(x)) (for every x∈ℒ𝑥ℒx\\in{\\cal L}). One can define an approximating operator 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} without having to specify which operator O𝑂O\nit approximates, and indeed it will often be convenient to study approximating operators without having to refer to the approximated operator.\nHowever, one can easily obtain the operator O𝑂O that 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} approximates by\nletting: O​(x)=𝒪l​(x,x)𝑂𝑥subscript𝒪𝑙𝑥𝑥O(x)={\\cal O}_{l}(x,x). Another operator that has a central role in AFT and which is used for expressing the semantics of many non-monotonic formalisms is the\nstable operator, defined next. For a complete lattice L=⟨ℒ,≤⟩𝐿ℒL={\\langle{\\cal L},\\leq\\rangle}, let 𝒪:ℒ2→ℒ2:𝒪→superscriptℒ2superscriptℒ2{\\cal O}:{\\cal L}^{2}\\rightarrow{\\cal L}^{2} be an approximating operator.\nWe denote: 𝒪l​(⋅,y)=λ​x.𝒪l​(x,y)formulae-sequencesubscript𝒪𝑙⋅𝑦𝜆𝑥subscript𝒪𝑙𝑥𝑦{\\cal O}_{l}(\\cdot,y)=\\lambda x.{\\cal O}_{l}(x,y) and 𝒪u​(x,⋅)=λ​y.𝒪u​(x,y)formulae-sequencesubscript𝒪𝑢𝑥⋅𝜆𝑦subscript𝒪𝑢𝑥𝑦{\\cal O}_{u}(x,\\cdot)=\\lambda y.{\\cal O}_{u}(x,y),\ni.e.: 𝒪l​(⋅,y)​(x)=𝒪l​(x,y)subscript𝒪𝑙⋅𝑦𝑥subscript𝒪𝑙𝑥𝑦{\\cal O}_{l}(\\cdot,y)(x)={\\cal O}_{l}(x,y) and 𝒪u​(x,⋅)​(y)=𝒪u​(x,y)subscript𝒪𝑢𝑥⋅𝑦subscript𝒪𝑢𝑥𝑦{\\cal O}_{u}(x,\\cdot)(y)={\\cal O}_{u}(x,y).\nThe stable operator for 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} is: S(𝒪)(x,y)=(𝑙𝑓𝑝(𝒪l(.,y)),𝑙𝑓𝑝(𝒪u(x,.))S({\\cal O})(x,y)=(\\mathit{lfp}({\\cal O}_{l}(.,y)),\\mathit{lfp}({\\cal O}_{u}(x,.)). Stable operators capture the idea of minimizing truth, since for any ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-monotonic operator 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} on ℒ2superscriptℒ2{\\cal L}^{2},\nthe fixpoints of the stable operator S​(𝒪)𝑆𝒪S({\\cal O}) are ≤tsubscript𝑡\\leq_{t}-minimal fixpoints of 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} [22, Theorem 4].\nAltogether, the following semantic notions are obtained: Given a complete lattice L=⟨ℒ,≤⟩𝐿ℒL={\\langle{\\cal L},\\leq\\rangle}, let 𝒪:ℒ2→ℒ2:𝒪→superscriptℒ2superscriptℒ2{\\cal O}:{\\cal L}^{2}\\rightarrow{\\cal L}^{2} be an approximating operator. Then: (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) is a Kripke-Kleene fixpoint of 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} if (x,y)=lfp≤i⁡(𝒪​(x,y))𝑥𝑦subscriptlfpsubscript𝑖𝒪𝑥𝑦(x,y)=\\operatorname{lfp}_{\\leq_{i}}({\\cal O}(x,y)). (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) is a three-valued stable fixpoint of 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} if (x,y)=S​(𝒪)​(x,y)𝑥𝑦𝑆𝒪𝑥𝑦(x,y)=S({\\cal O})(x,y). (x,x)𝑥𝑥(x,x) is a two-valued stable fixpoints of 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} if (x,x)=S​(𝒪)​(x,x)𝑥𝑥𝑆𝒪𝑥𝑥(x,x)=S({\\cal O})(x,x). (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) is the well-founded fixpoint of 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O} if it is the ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-minimal (3-valued) stable fixpoint of 𝒪𝒪{\\cal O}. Denecker, Marek and Truszscyński  show that every approximation operator admits a unique ≤isubscript𝑖\\leq_{i}-minimal stable fixpoint.\nPelov, Denecker and Bruynooghe  show that for normal logic programs, the fixpoints based on the four-valued immediate consequence operator\nfor a logic program give rise to the following correspondences: the three-valued stable models coincides with the three-valued semantics as defined by Przymusinski ,\nthe well-founded model coincides with the homonymous semantics  , and the two-valued stable models coincide with the two-valued\n(or total) stable models of a logic program. For a normal logic program 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P}, an approximation of the operator 𝐼𝐶𝒫subscript𝐼𝐶𝒫\\mathit{IC}_{\\cal P}  can be obtained by first constructing a lower bound operator\nas follows:999Notice that the lattice under consideration is ⟨2𝒜𝒫,⊆⟩superscript2subscript𝒜𝒫\\langle 2^{{\\cal A}_{\\cal P}},\\subseteq\\rangle, i.e., elements of the lattice are sets of atoms. and then defining: Notice that the upper bound ℐ​𝒞𝒫u​(y,x)ℐsuperscriptsubscript𝒞𝒫𝑢𝑦𝑥{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P}^{u}(y,x) is defined as ℐ​𝒞𝒫l​(y,x)ℐsuperscriptsubscript𝒞𝒫𝑙𝑦𝑥{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P}^{l}(y,x), i.e. ℐ​𝒞𝒫ℐsubscript𝒞𝒫{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P} is a symmetric operator (see also\nFootnote 8). Pelov, Denecker and Bruynooghe  have shown that this operator approximates 𝐼𝐶𝒫subscript𝐼𝐶𝒫\\mathit{IC}_{\\cal P} for normal logic\nprograms 𝒫𝒫{\\cal P}. We now illustrate the behaviour of this operator with the following logic program: 𝐼𝐶𝒫subscript𝐼𝐶𝒫\\mathit{IC}_{\\cal P} is thus an operator over the lattice ⟨2{p,q,r},⊆⟩superscript2𝑝𝑞𝑟\\langle 2^{\\{p,q,r\\}},\\subseteq\\rangle. Now, Concerning the approximation ℐ​𝒞𝒫ℐsubscript𝒞𝒫{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P} of 𝐼𝐶𝒫subscript𝐼𝐶𝒫\\mathit{IC}_{\\cal P}, it holds, e.g., that: ℐ​𝒞𝒫l​(∅,{p,q,r})=∅​ as ​(∅,{p,q,r})​(¬q)=(∅,{p,q,r})​(¬p)=(∅,{p,q,r})​(r)=𝖴ℐsubscriptsuperscript𝒞𝑙𝒫𝑝𝑞𝑟 as 𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑞𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑟𝖴{\\cal IC}^{l}_{\\cal P}(\\emptyset,\\{p,q,r\\})=\\emptyset\\mbox{ as }(\\emptyset,\\{p,q,r\\})(\\lnot q)=(\\emptyset,\\{p,q,r\\})(\\lnot p)=(\\emptyset,\\{p,q,r\\})(r)={\\sf U}. ℐ​𝒞𝒫l​({p,q,r},∅)={p,q,r}​ as ​({p,q,r},∅)​(¬q)=({p,q,r},∅)​(¬p)=({p,q,r},∅)​(r)=𝖢ℐsubscriptsuperscript𝒞𝑙𝒫𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑝𝑞𝑟 as 𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑞𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑟𝖢{\\cal IC}^{l}_{\\cal P}(\\{p,q,r\\},\\emptyset)=\\{p,q,r\\}\\mbox{ as }(\\{p,q,r\\},\\emptyset)(\\lnot q)=(\\{p,q,r\\},\\emptyset)(\\lnot p)=(\\{p,q,r\\},\\emptyset)(r)={\\sf C}. We now illustrate the stable operator. It holds that lfp(ℐ𝒞𝒫(.,{p})={p}\\operatorname{lfp}({\\cal IC}_{\\cal P}(.,\\{p\\})=\\{p\\}, and therefore S​(ℐ​𝒞𝒫l)​({p})={p}𝑆ℐsubscriptsuperscript𝒞𝑙𝒫𝑝𝑝S({\\cal IC}^{l}_{\\cal P})(\\{p\\})=\\{p\\}. By symmetry of ℐ​𝒞𝒫ℐsubscript𝒞𝒫{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P}, ({p},{p})𝑝𝑝(\\{p\\},\\{p\\}) is a stable fixpoint of ℐ​𝒞𝒫ℐsubscript𝒞𝒫{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P}. Likewise, it can be observed that (∅,{p,q})𝑝𝑞(\\emptyset,\\{p,q\\}) and ({q},{q})𝑞𝑞(\\{q\\},\\{q\\}) are stable fixpoints of ℐ​𝒞𝒫ℐsubscript𝒞𝒫{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P}. It follows that (∅,{p,q})𝑝𝑞(\\emptyset,\\{p,q\\}) is the well-founded fixpoint of ℐ​𝒞𝒫ℐsubscript𝒞𝒫{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P}. We shall generalize this operator to the disjunctive case in Section 3.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: that can be constructively obtained.\nAFT generalizes the principles for the construction of fixpoints to the non-monotonic setting, by working with approximations of such operators on a bilattice [ref]4     , constructed on the basis of L𝐿L.
