      "content": "Paper Title: FE^\"ANN\" ‚Äì An efficient data-driven multiscale approach based on physics-constrained neural networks and automated data mining\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWithin this contribution, an efficient data-driven multiscale approach called FEANNANN{}^{\\textit{ANN}}, which makes use of physics-constrained ANNs as a macroscopic surrogate model, is presented. The approach allows to consider materials with complex microstructures leading to an overall anisotropic behavior, whereby a restriction to hyperelastic solids is made for now. The ANN-based surrogate model automatically fulfills several physical principles, e.‚Äâg., objectivity, material symmetry, compatibility with the balance of angular momentum and the thermodynamic consistency. This is done by using a set of problem specific invariants IksubscriptùêºùëòI_{k} as the input of the network and the Helmholtz free energy density œàùúì\\psi as the output, cf. Linka¬†et¬†al.¬†[ref]36, Klein¬†et¬†al.¬†[ref]37 or Linden¬†et¬†al.¬†, among others.\nThe data which are used to train the ANN are collected via computational homogenization of an RVE representing the material‚Äôs microstructure. Thereby, in contrast to most of the data-driven multiscale approaches from the literature, it is not necessary to explore all required macroscopic states of deformation which occur in the macroscopic simulation in advance. Instead, the required data, i.‚Äâe., effective deformations and corresponding stresses, are determined by homogenization in a fully autonomous way within the framework by collecting the relevant deformations from the macroscopic FE simulation. This procedure is similar to the approach presented by Korzeniowski¬†and¬†Weinberg¬†[ref]62 which is based on the data-driven mechanics approach .\nHere, in addition, the macroscopic deformations are mapped into an invariant space associated to the symmetry group of the considered material. In this space, the selection of relevant states is done so that the number of time-consuming microscale simulations can be reduced to a minimum. Moreover, it is not necessary to perform a rough scan of the relevant deformation area in advance here.\nThe proposed framework is exemplarily applied to several descriptive examples, where a fiber reinforced composite with a highly nonlinear behavior of the individual components is considered. The organization of the paper is as follows: In Sect. 2, the basic equations of the finite strain continuum solid mechanics theory as well as basic principles of hyperelastic models are given.\nAfter this, the proposed data-driven multiscale framework is described in Sect. 3. This approach is exemplarily applied within several numerical examples in Sect. 4. After a discussion of the results, the paper is closed by concluding remarks and an outlook to necessary future work in Sect. 5.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: consistency.
