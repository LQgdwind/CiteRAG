      "content": "Paper Title: Diversity Enhanced Active Learning with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassification has extensive uses and deep learning has substantially\nimproved its performance,\nbut a major hurdle for its use is the paucity of labelled or annotated data.\nThe data labelling process performed by domain experts is expensive and tedious to produce,\nespecially in the medical field,\nwhere due to lack of expertise and privacy issues, annotation costs are time-consuming and expensive 1.\nActive Learning (AL) is an approach to speeding up learning by\njudiciously selecting data to be annotated .\nAL is perhaps the simplest of all human-in-the-loop\nlearning approaches,\nbecause the only interaction is the (expert) human providing a class label,\nyet for even in the simplest of tasks,\nclassification, a general theory of AL is not agreed on. Moreover, in practical situations, one needs to consider many issues when designing an AL system with deep learning:\nthe expense to retrain deep neural networks and\nthe use of validation data for training [ref]31,\ntransformer language models 6, batch mode AL with diversity ,\nand consideration of expert capabilities and costs  .\nAlso important in experimental work is the need for\nrealistic labelling sizes,\nwith practitioners we work with saying expert annotation\nmay allow a budget of up to 1000\ndata points, rarely more.\nUsing large batch sizes (e.g., 1000 in  ) can thus be impractical. Our fundamental research contribution is to suggest\nwhat makes a good acquisition function for the uncertainty component, without any batching.\nWhile there are many recent methods looking at the uncertainty diversity trade-off for\nbatch AL , few recently have focused on understanding the uncertainty side alone.\nA substantial advance is a recent theoretical framework, Mean Objective Cost of Uncertainty (MOCU)  that provides a convergence proof.\nAs our first contribution, we convert their expected loss reduction framework\nto an AL model using strictly proper scoring rules or Bregman divergences \ninstead of classification errors. MOCU required manipulations of the expected error,\nresulting in weighted-MOCU (WMOCU), in order to achieve convergence and avoid\ngetting stuck in error bands. Strictly proper scoring rules naturally\navoid this problem by generalising expected errors to expected scores.\nUsing strictly proper scoring rules means better calibrated classifiers are rewarded.\nThe scoring rules go beyond simple minimum errors of WMOCU and can be adapted to different kinds of inference tasks (e.g., different utilities, precision-recall trade-offs, etc.).\nThis property is preferable and beneficial for applications such as medical domains where actual errors become less relevant for an inference task. In order to evaluate the new acquisition functions we use text classification,\nwhich is our target application domain.\nFor realistic evaluation, we want to use near state of the art systems,\nwhich means using pretrained language models with validation sets ,\nand neural network ensembles 3.\nEnsembling also doubles as a heuristic\ntechnique to yield estimates of model uncertainty and posterior probabilities.\nComing up with a simple approach to combine ensembling and validations sets is our second research contribution.\nThe importance of these combinations for AL has been noted  .\nFor further batch comparisons,\nwe then bring back diversity into the research,\nsuggesting a way to naturally complement our new family of acquisition functions with a method to achieve diversity, our third research contribution.\nExtensive experiments with a comprehensive set of ablation studies\non four text classification datasets show that\nour BEMPS-based AL model consistently outperforms recent techniques like WMOCU and BADGE,\nalthough we explicitly exclude recent semi-supervised AL methods because they represent an unfair comparison against strictly supervised learning.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: in practical situations, one needs to consider many issues when designing an AL system with deep learning:\nthe expense to retrain deep neural networks and\nthe use of validation data for training [ref]31,\ntransformer language models 6, batch mode AL with diversity ,\nand consideration of expert capabilities and costs  .\nAlso important in experimental work is the need for\nrealistic labelling\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
