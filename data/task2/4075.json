      "content": "Paper Title: FuSS: Fusing Superpixels for Improved Segmentation Consistency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs stated by Scheirer et al. [ref]30 an open set scenario happens when unknown samples can appear in the prediction phase, meaning that at training time not all possible classes are known. This definition can be applied for each pixel in an image, extending the traditional semantic segmentation to OSS. OSS has only a handful of published works that use neural networks. The first attempts to do open set recognition from a neural network were proposed by Bendale and Boult [ref]31 the first natural approach was to apply a threshold on the final output probability, identifying low probabilities as unknown. The experiments showed that this strategy was weak and not enough to deal the task. The second approach was a method called OpenMax, which presented a new model layer to replace the traditional softmax. Assuming Cùê∂C classes trained on the closed set task, OpenMax adds an Unknown output class and estimates the probability of the input images to each of the C+1ùê∂1C+1 classes. Based on OpenMax [ref]31, OpenPixel was proposed by Silva et al. . It uses a patch-wise strategy to classify the central pixel. In practice, each patch only classifies the central pixel, thus the network needs one patch per pixel to segment the whole image. OpenPixel is, therefore, extremely inefficient mainly during the test phase, as each pixel in an image generates a patch to be fed to the network, with surrounding pixels being forwarded multiple times through the backbone. The fully convolutional counterpart to OpenPixel, named OpenFCN, was proposed by Oliveira et al. . OpenMax-based methods proved to have their efficacy severely limited in segmentation settings, resulting in false positive OOD pixel predictions mainly in the borders of objects, where the activations of the last layers are considerably affected by the presence of surrounding objects with different classes. Given the limitations of OpenPixel and OpenFCN caused by last layers‚Äô activations, Oliveira et al.  proposed the use of intermediate multiscale features from the closed set FCNs paired with low-dimensional principal component scoring for OSS. The method, named Open Principal Component Scoring (OpenPCS), achieved consistently better results than the OpenMax-based approaches in multiple scenarios and unknown class configurations on the Vaihingen, Potsdam and GRSS 2018 Data Fusion Challenge  datasets. Chamorro et al.  built upon OpenPCS, including a whitening operation to better generalize to a wide range of imbalanced classes. OpenPCS++ was tested on multi-temporal SAR images from the LEM222http://www.lvc.ele.puc-rio.br/LEM_benchmark/ and CV333https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/campo-verde-database datasets in the task of segmenting OOD crops among known crop species. Cui et al.  proposed a nonparametric statistical OSS method that employs the Mann-Whitney U test on a closed set segmentation output to determine the existence of unknown classes in each image. Furthermore, it uses an adaptive threshold that identify which pixels are unknown. Nunes et al.  proposed a fully convolutional end-to-end Conditional Reconstruction Open Set Segmentation (CoReSeg) that tackles the OSS using two network branches: a traditional closed set segmentation branch and a class conditional reconstruction of the input images according to their pixelwise mask, together the branches merges into a single open set segmentation. The traditional segmentation branch produces a standard closed set segmentation and the reconstruction error from the conditional reconstruction branch identifies which pixels are OOD. Proposed by Cen et al. [ref]36 an open world semantic segmentation system used prototypes for the known classes and a Deep Metric Learning Network (DML-Net) as a feature extractor. The final classifier is replaced by a representation of the Euclidean distance of the input image to all prototypes. Low probability classes are set to unknown with the use of a Euclidean distance-based probability loss. The Generalized Open-set Semantic Segmentation (GOSS) method was proposed by Hong et al. . The authors were inspired by the human capacity of recognizing the previously known classes, while simultaneously identifying and grouping the unknown objects into different categories, even without previous knowledge about them. The method employs two network branches trained together in parallel: the first branch performs a SSeg for KKCs and identifies unknown pixels using Deep Metric Learning (DML) [ref]36the second branch is a pixel clustering one that ignores the KKCs and generates a new segmentation mask to the image. At last, the fusion phase uses the pixels defined as unknown and the clustering to identify different objects in the unknown areas.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: As stated by Scheirer et al.
