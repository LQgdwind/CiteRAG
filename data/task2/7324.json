      "content": "Paper Title: On the Separability Problem of VASS Reachability Languages\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe VASS reachability problem takes as input an initialized VASS 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} and asks whether 𝖠𝖼𝖼ℕ,≤ω​(𝒱)≠∅subscript𝖠𝖼𝖼ℕsubscript𝜔𝒱\\mathsf{Acc}_{\\mathbb{N},\\leq_{\\omega}}(\\mathcal{V})\\neq\\emptyset.\nThe decision procedure is an abstraction-refinement algorithm that computes a sequence  Each over-approximation Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} is a finite set of ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} and, as agreed, we use 𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤ,≤ω​(Si)subscript𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤsubscript𝜔subscript𝑆𝑖\\mathsf{Acc}_{\\mathbb{Z},\\leq_{\\omega}}(S_{i}) for ⋃𝒲∈Si𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤ,≤ω​(𝒲)subscript𝒲subscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤsubscript𝜔𝒲\\bigcup_{\\mathcal{W}\\in S_{i}}\\mathsf{Acc}_{\\mathbb{Z},\\leq_{\\omega}}(\\mathcal{W}).\nDetails on the shape of 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} will follow in a moment. At each step, the algorithm picks an element 𝒲∈Si𝒲subscript𝑆𝑖\\mathcal{W}\\in S_{i} and checks reachability.\nIf reachability does not hold, 𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤ,≤ω​(𝒲)=∅subscript𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤsubscript𝜔𝒲\\mathsf{Acc}_{\\mathbb{Z},\\leq_{\\omega}}(\\mathcal{W})=\\emptyset,\nthen the element will not be considered in the future, Si+1=Si∖{𝒲}subscript𝑆𝑖1subscript𝑆𝑖𝒲S_{i+1}=S_{i}\\setminus\\{\\mathcal{W}\\}.\nIf reachability holds, the algorithm checks whether 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} is perfect, a property that we discuss below. If so, the algorithm concludes that the ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-run it has just found can be turned into an ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}-run, and terminates with the verdict reachable.\nIf 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} is not perfect, there is a guarantee that 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} can be refined.\nFollowing Leroux and Schmitz [ref]23, the refinement is called KLMST decomposition after the inventors Kosaraju , Lambert [ref]18, Mayr , as well as Sacerdote and Tenney . The decomposition computes from 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} a new and again finite set S​(𝒲)𝑆𝒲S(\\mathcal{W}) of ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS that replace 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} in the approximation, meaning we have Si+1=(Si∖{𝒲})∪S​(𝒲)subscript𝑆𝑖1subscript𝑆𝑖𝒲𝑆𝒲S_{i+1}=(S_{i}\\setminus\\{\\mathcal{W}\\})\\cup S(\\mathcal{W}).\nThe decomposition guarantees 𝖠𝖼𝖼ℕ,≤ω​(𝒲)=𝖠𝖼𝖼ℕ,≤ω​(S​(𝒲))subscript𝖠𝖼𝖼ℕsubscript𝜔𝒲subscript𝖠𝖼𝖼ℕsubscript𝜔𝑆𝒲\\mathsf{Acc}_{\\mathbb{N},\\leq_{\\omega}}(\\mathcal{W})=\\mathsf{Acc}_{\\mathbb{N},\\leq_{\\omega}}(S(\\mathcal{W})) so that we do not lose ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}-runs but remain over-approximate.\nIf Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} is found to be empty, the algorithm terminates with the verdict unreachable. What makes the algorithm terminate is a progress guarantee:\neach ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS in the KLMST decomposition S​(𝒲)𝑆𝒲S(\\mathcal{W}) is guaranteed to be strictly smaller than 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} in a well-founded order.\nSince S​(𝒲)𝑆𝒲S(\\mathcal{W}) is finite, König’s lemma shows termination of the overall algorithm. We elaborate on the ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS used in the over-approximation.\nThere are two standard techniques to over-approximate reachability in VASS: characteristic equations   and coverablity graphs [ref]13.\nThe characteristic equations can track counter values precisely, but they cannot guarantee that intermediate values remain non-negative.\nCoverability graphs are the opposite, they can guarantee that intermediate values remain non-negative, but they cannot track counter values precisely.\nThe decision procedure combines the two.\nThe ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS are decorated by generalized ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}-counter valuations, like coverability graphs.\nIf a decoration is ω𝜔\\omega, and thus not precise enough for reachability, that counter is treated as a ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-counter and handled by the characteristic equations. For this combination to solve reachability, we have to be able to transfer the non-negativity guarantee given by coverability graphs to the characteristic equations.\nBehind the non-negativity guarantee given by coverability graphs\nis a translation: if we have a run in the coverability graph, we obtain an ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}-run in the underlying VASS by repeating intermediate transition sequences in order to pump counter values arbitrarily high.\nBy transferring the guarantee, we mean that also the characteristic equations should admit this pumping behavior: the counter as well as the repetition count for the edges on the pumping sequences should be unbounded in the solution space of the characteristic equations.\nIf this is the case, the coverability graph is called perfect. It is easy to check unboundedness in the solution space, and therefore also perfectness: we just have to find a solution to the homogeneous variant of the characteristic equations where the variable is positive.\nMore precisely, the characteristic equations will have the shape A​x=b∧x≥0𝐴𝑥𝑏𝑥0Ax=b\\wedge x\\geq 0.\nThe solutions s𝑠s can have arbitrarily high values s​[i]𝑠delimited-[]𝑖s[i] if and only if A​y=0∧y≥0𝐴𝑦0𝑦0Ay=0\\wedge y\\geq 0 has a solution s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} with s′​[i]>0superscript𝑠′delimited-[]𝑖0s^{\\prime}[i]>0. To see that homogeneous solutions are necessary, assume there are solutions with arbitrarily high values for a variable.\nThe well-quasi order of ℕksuperscriptℕ𝑘\\mathbb{N}^{k} will give us comparable solutions that we can subtract to solve the homogenous equations. The KLMST decomposition comes in when perfectness fails, but the ω𝜔\\omega-decorations and pumping sequences do not coincide with the unboundedness in the solution space.\nFor example, the decoration may suggest the counter value ω𝜔\\omega, but the counter is bounded in the solution space.\nThen the counter can only take finitely many values in runs that solve reachability.\nThe decomposition now replaces the ω𝜔\\omega-entry by each of these values.\nThe result is a potentially large but finite set of new ℤℤ\\mathbb{Z}-VASS.\nThe analysis also informs us about transitions that\ncan only be taken a bounded number of times in the solution space, but that lie on loops in the coverability graph.\nTo improve the precision, one unwinds the coverability graph so that the bounded transitions lie on an acyclic path.\nThis is the second form of decomposition.\nThe last decomposition has to do with the fact that we need pumping sequences that justify the existence of the ω𝜔\\omega-entries.\nWe make the ideas formal.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: be turned into an ℕℕ\\mathbb{N}-run, and terminates with the verdict reachable.\nIf 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} is not perfect, there is a guarantee that 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} can be refined.\nFollowing Leroux and Schmitz [ref]23, the refinement is called KLMST decomposition after the inventors Kosaraju , Lambert [ref]18, Mayr , as well as Sacerdote and Tenney .
