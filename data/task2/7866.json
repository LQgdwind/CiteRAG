      "content": "Paper Title: TR2MTL: LLM based framework for Metric Temporal Logic Formalization of Traffic Rules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelected traffic rules from VCoRT and StVO are manually formalized for intersection , interstate , safe distance , uncontrolled intersections , and overtaking situation . Motion planning algorithms also leverage traffic rules, usually in an implicit manner, for rule compliance. There are multiple ways to formalize traffic rules. Traffic rules are formalized in first-order logic . Zhao et al.  used ontology, and  used propositional logic as a representation choice for traffic rules. However, these representations do not directly use temporal aspects, but workarounds such as implicitly hiding time aspects in the predicate or atomic propositions are used. MTL ,  for a discrete time interval, signal temporal logic (STL) , [ref]14 for a continuous time interval of temporal operators, linear temporal logic  and Co-safe linear temporal logic (scLTL)  are different choices among the temporal logic. MTL is more appropriate for us, as it provides native support for temporal information and is decidable for finite trace length [ref]2. Among these options, LTL and scLTL are unsuitable for modeling the temporal operator’s duration. MTL and STL are good choices for modeling rules with temporal aspects, but here we focused on the MTL. However, our approach can be easily extended for STL. In this work, we kept focus on MTL due to our end goal of assisting the trajectory verification system in consideration, but our approach can be easily extended to STL. Furthermore, MTL is more suitable for verifying discrete signals, unlike STL, which works better with continuous signals  . Formalized rules can be utilized in trajectory monitoring , , trajectory planning , , and calculating reachable sets of autonomous vehicles based on rules. We develop an automated framework to formalize traffic rules, which can benefit various use cases such as trajectory monitoring, planning, and reachability analysis for AVs. This differs from previous work that relied on manually defined criteria, which were not flexible enough. LLMs have become a powerful tool for translation, mathematical problem-solving, and reasoning tasks and are used for reasoning and planning for autonomous agents , , . nl2ltl  is developed to translate text to the LTL formula based on the restricted template of the formula with limited capabilities. [ref]23 fine-tuned the LLM for text-to-LTL and FOL conversion with their dataset, whereas  trained model for STL formula generation from textual specification and lang2ltl  used the in-context learning to obtain the LTL specification for robotics but their methods lack the step-by-step reasoning required for complex rules such as in traffic rules. In contrast, our approach uses in-context learning with CoT prompting instead of classical prompting. This enables us to introduce in-depth reasoning capability for automated MTL formalization of traffic rules. Additionally, the previous work did not work with legal traffic rules as specifications, where texts are unstructured, a lot of world knowledge is assumed, and fine-tuning the model or training from scratch is difficult without sufficient datasets. Previous works have a major focus on LTL, and first-order logic [ref]23 , having no time constraints over temporal operators or heavily processed.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: use temporal aspects, but workarounds such as implicitly hiding time aspects in the predicate or atomic propositions are used. MTL ,  for a discrete time interval, signal temporal logic (STL) , [ref]14 for a continuous time interval of temporal operators, linear temporal logic  and Co-safe linear temporal logic (scLTL)  are different choices among the temporal logic. MTL is more appropriate\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
