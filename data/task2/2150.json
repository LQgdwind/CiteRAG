      "content": "Paper Title: G-TADOC: Enabling Efficient GPU-Based Text Analytics without Decompression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText analytics directly on compression (TADOC)   [ref]3  has proven to be a promising technology for big data analytics.\nSince TADOC processes compressed data without decompression,\na large amount of space can be saved.\nMeanwhile, TADOC reuses both data and intermediate computation results,\nwhich results in that the same contents in different parts of original files can be processed only once, thus saving significant computation time.\nRecent studies show that TADOC can save up to half of the processing time and 90.8% storage space  .\nOn the other hand, GPU as a heterogeneous processor shows promising performance in many real applications, such as artificial intelligence.\nIt is popular to use heterogeneous processors, such as GPU, to accelerate data analytics systems     .\nTherefore, it is essential to enable efficient data analytics on GPUs without decompression. Applying GPUs to accelerate TADOC brings three key benefits.\nFirst,\nGPU performance is much higher than CPU performance,\nso applying GPUs with proper designs can greatly accelerate TADOC performance,\nwhich means that users can feel no delay in data analytics towards massive data.\nSecond,\nprevious TADOC mainly focuses on distributed systems.\nIf we develop a GPU-based solution on a single HPC server while achieving higher performance,\ntremendous resources, including equipment cost and electricity cost, can be significantly saved.\nThird,\nmany data analytics applications, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) 0 and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) 1, have been ported to GPUs,\nwhile TADOC has proven to be suitable for these advanced data analytics applications.\nHence, providing a GPU solution would remove the last barrier to apply TADOC to a wide range of applications. Although it is both beneficial and essential to develop TADOC on GPUs,\nbuilding efficient GPU-based TADOC is very challenging.\nApplying GPUs to accelerate TADOC faces three challenges.\nFirst,\nTADOC organizes data into rules, which can further be represented as a DAG.\nUnfortunately, the amount of dependencies among the rule-structured DAG of TADOC is extremely large, which is unfriendly for GPU parallelism.\nFor example, in our experiments,\nthe generated DAG for each file has 450,704 dependent middle-layer nodes on average,\nwhich greatly limits its parallelism.\nEven worse,\na node in the DAG of TADOC can have multiple parents,\nwhich makes this problem more complicated.\nSecond, a large number of GPU threads writing to the same result buffer inevitably cause tremendous write conflicts.\nA straightforward solution is to lock the buffer for threads, but such atomicities lose partial performance.\nIn the worst case,\nthe parallel performance is lower than that of the CPU sequential TADOC.\nThird,\nmaintaining and utilizing the sequence information on GPUs is another difficulty:\nthe original TADOC adopts a recursive call to complete sequential traversal on compressed data,\nwhich is similar to a depth-first search (DFS) and is extremely hard to solve in parallel. Currently, none of the TADOC solutions can solve the challenges of enabling TADOC on GPUs mentioned above.\nZhang et al.  first proposed TADOC solution but it is designed in a sequential manner.\nAlthough TADOC can be applied in a distributed environment,\nTADOC adopts coarse-grained parallelism and the processing for each compressed unit is still sequential.\nZhang et al. next developed a domain specific language (DSL), called Zwift, to present TADOC ,\nand further realized random accesses on compressed data [ref]3.\nHowever, the parallelism problems still exist.\nZhang et al.  then provided a parallel TADOC design,\nwhich provides much better performance than the sequential TADOC.\nUnfortunately, such parallelism is still coarse-grained: it only divides the original file into several sub-files, processes different files separately, and then follows a merge process,\nwhich cannot be utilized by GPUs efficiently. We design G-TADOC, the first framework that provides\nGPU-based text analytics directly on compression, effectively enabling efficient text analytics on GPUs\nwithout decompressing input data.\nG-TADOC involves three novel features that can address the above three challenges.\nFirst,\nto utilize the GPU parallelism,\nwe develop a fine-grained thread-level workload scheduling strategy on GPUs,\nwhich allocates thread resources according to the load of different rules adaptively and uses masks to describe the relations between rules\n(Section IV-B).\nSecond,\nto solve the challenge of write conflict from multiple threads,\nwe enable G-TADOC to maintain its own memory pool and design thread-safe data structures.\nWe use a lock buffer when multiple threads update the global results simultaneously\n(Section IV-C).\nThird,\nto support sequence sensitive applications in G-TADOC,\nwe develop head and tail data structures in each rule to store the contents at the beginning and end of the rule,\nwhich requires a light-weight DAG traversal (detailed in Section IV-D). We evaluate G-TADOC on three GPU platforms, which involve three generations of Nvidia GPUs (Pascal, Volta, and Turing micro-architectures),\nand use five real-world datasets of varying lengths, structures, and content.\nCompared to TADOC on CPUs,\nG-TADOC achieves 31.1×\\times speedup.\nIn detail,\nTADOC can be divided into two phases:\ninitialization and DAG traversal.\nFor the initialization phase, G-TADOC achieves 76.5% time saving,\nwhile for the DAG traversal phase, G-TADOC achieves 82.2% time saving. As far as we know,\nthis is the first work enabling efficient text analytics on GPU without decompression.\nIn summary,\nwe have made the following contributions in this work. We present G-TADOC,\nwhich is the first framework enabling efficient GPU-based text analytics directly on compressed data. We unveil the challenges for developing TADOC on GPUs and provide a set of solutions to these challenges. We evaluate G-TADOC on three GPU platforms, and demonstrate its significant benefits compared to state-of-the-art TADOC.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Text analytics directly on compression (TADOC)   [ref]3  has proven to be a promising technology for big data analytics.\nSince TADOC processes compressed data without decompression,\na large amount of space can be saved.\nMeanwhile, TADOC reuses both\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
