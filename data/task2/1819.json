      "content": "Paper Title: Talk, Don’t Write: A Study of Direct Speech-Based Image Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly work on speech-image retrieval focused on single words  ; later work learned speech representations of full speech utterances with simple models  . More recent work suggests that this same architecture can be used for a many tasks. However, only a few have specifically focused on improving retrieval  [ref]9, and no one has systematically evaluated the effectiveness of different design choices on multiple datasets. Dual encoders are a natural approach for learning joint representations of multiple modalities: they perform well and are efficient to train and use for retrieval. In these, an encoder for each modality produces a fixed-length vector representation; the representations from each encoder are combined, often via dot product, and loss functions are defined to encourage positive pairs to have higher scores than negative pairs. We explore many modeling and optimization choices for dual encoders. It is an important approach: it directly benefits from improvements to each individual modality and supports highly scalable nearest neighbor search for retrieval. Early fusion models with interactions between modalities can more powerfully relate two inputs, but they must compute representations and scores for all pairs–which is inefficient for large-scale retrieval. Input speech representations: Prior work uses low-level features to represent audio: either Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC)  [ref]9 or frequency band spectrograms 7 2. Recently, self-supervised architectures trained with a contrastive loss showed improvements in English ASR 9 and multiple languages languages. We consider two of these: CPC-8k  trained on 8000 hours of multilingual speech, and wav2vec 9 trained on 960 hours of English read speech. Image encoders: Prior work has used various image encoders, including VGG16  2 , ResNet-152  [ref]9, ResNet50 [ref]27, and Inception ResNet-V2 . We select the newer EfficientNet , which achieves state-of-the-art on ImageNet. Specifically, we use the EfficientNet B4 variant, which has fewer parameters than the aforementioned encoders. Audio encoders: Harwath et al. in –one of the earliest studies of speech-image retrieval–uses a three-layer CNN, where the size of the receptive field of each convolution is set to capture phonemes, syllables and words. This architecture was extended with residual connections [ref]27 and using Inception ResNet-V2 . Recurrent networks, especially Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), have more generally been employed by NLP researchers    [ref]9. We use a ResNet50 CNN to encode, and compare it to a three-layer CNN . Pretraining strategy: Many have used ImageNet-pretraining  2  [ref]9 . Harwath et al. [ref]27 pretrain using AudioSet  and Flickr Natural Sounds . Ilharco et al.  use CSC to jointly pretrain a dual encoder. We start with an image tower pretrained on ImageNet and jointly pretrain the dual encoder on CSC. Batch Size: Prior work trained with different small batch sizes, e.g., 48 , 80 [ref]27, and 128 2. We increase batch size to 1024 with Tensor Processor Unit (TPU) V3 hardware. Training Strategy: The distance between paired inputs is commonly computed via dot product on the representations produced for each , typically with a triplet loss.\nIlharco et al. use a bidirectional in-batch sampled softmax loss using all in-batch negative samples . We use this loss without the margin.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: full speech utterances with simple models  .
