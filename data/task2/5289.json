      "content": "Paper Title: On Calibrating Semantic Segmentation Models: Analyses and An Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModels.\nWe consider five recent state-of-the-art segmentation models which cover CNN and ViT architectures. SegFormer[ref]49 is a ViT-based encoder-decoder model based upon lightweight multilayer perception (MLP) decoders with pyramid architecture. Segmenter is an encoder-decoder model based exclusively on Transformer. Knet  is a unified segmentation decoder module which includes two important variants, Knet-DeepLab and Knet-SWIN. Knet-DeepLab consists of ResNet-50  backbone and DeepLab-V3  decoder. Knet-SWIN is contructed with SWIN 3 backbone and UperNet [ref]48 decoder. ConvNeXt 4 is a CNN backbone, but shaped to ViT-like architecture for better scaling. We select ConvNeXt backbone with UperNet [ref]48 decoder. For ADE20K, all models except Knet-DeepLab are trained with 640×\\times640 crop size. For BDD100K and SYNTHIA, the crop size is 512×\\times1024. For other benchmarks, the crop size is 512×\\times512. The batch size is set to 8. Dataset. We examine existing calibration methods across six important benchmarks from various applications. Figure 3 illustrates the example images from benchmarks. Scene and stuff segmentation. We use ADE20K  and COCO-164K  as large-scale segmentation benchmark. ADE20K contains 150 object and stuff classes with 20,210/2,000 images in the training/validation set. COCO-164K, ∼∼\\thicksim164K images for 91 stuff and 80 thing classes, includes 118K/5K images in the training/validation set. Autonomous driving. We choose BDD-100K , a latest benchmark for urban driving scene segmentation. BDD-100K contains 7K/1K 1280×\\times720 images in 19 classes for training/validation set. We select the validation set of CityScapes [ref]4 as test set from target domain for domain-shift calibration assessment. CityScapes has 2975/500 1024×\\times2048 images for training/validation set. BDD-100K and CityScapes share the same label space. Video segmentation. We adopt DAVIS2016  to assess calibration on temporal domain shift problems. DAVIS2016 contains 50 object and 1 background classes. We select 480p resolution video sequences to prepare temporal domain shift dataset. The total of the frames in each sequence ranges from 24 to 103. Each frame is an image segmented with a single object and background. Remote sensing. We select SPACENET-7 (SN-7) , a binary small object identification benchmark, to examine spatial and temporal domain shift calibration. SN-7 consists of 1,408 1024×\\times1024 satellite images collected from monthly urban development across 101 cities. It contains 11,080,000 buildings over 41,000 km2 observation area. Due to the development, images vary temporally; due to planning difference, the objects like the building styles differ by locations. Medical imaging. We select BraTS2017 4, a popular brain tumor segmentation dataset. BraTS2017 contains multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 1,210 patients, which consists of 3D voxels with 155 layers from top to bottom. Each layer is equivalent to a 2D semantic segmentation image with 3 tumor feature classes. Simulation domain transfer. SYNTHIA  is a popular unban street synthetic image benchmark. We select its subset of RANDCITYSCAPES, which contains 9400 1280×\\times760 images with 22 classes, as source domain for model training. We select CityScapes [ref]4 as target domain for domain-shift calibration assessment. In-domain calibration.\nWe select the validation set of each benchmark for in-domain calibration study. For ADE20K, COCO-164K, and BDD100K, we select 100/100/1800 images, 250/250/4500 images, and 50/50/900 images for calibrator training/validation/testing. Domain-shift calibration. We select the validation sets of COCO-164K and CityScapes as testing sets of ADE20K and BDD100K. For taxonomy incompatibility over datasets, like ADE20K-COCO164K, we follow the convention in 2 to merge and split label classes. For DAVIS, we merge all training and validation sequences and resplit them in half by frame. The first half of frames are used for training with 1731 images and the second half are split for validation/testing with 100/1624 images. For SN-7, all training data are split into 1133/50/225 images for training/validation/testing set by location, and 698/50/660 images for training/validation/testing set by time. For BraTS, we select 800/50 images of 75th layer scan for training/validation and 360 images of 100th layer scan for testing. For SYNTHIA, we split training set into 9000/400 images for training/validation, and CityScapes’ validation set for testing. Calibration methods. We select aforementioned six existing calibration methods to compare selective scaling. For selective scaling, selective model is simplified with three-layer MLP due to training data restriction. The inputs are pixel-wise predictive probabilities and the labels are binary which indicate correct/incorrect prediction. Moreover, Meta-cal with miscoverage control yields severe model degradation. We implement our extension by replacing random prediction with large temperature scaling to retain accuracy. For ensembling, we achieve a three-member ensemble with comparable accuracy for fair comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: Models.\nWe consider five recent state-of-the-art segmentation models which cover CNN and ViT architectures.
