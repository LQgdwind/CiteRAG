      "content": "Paper Title: Non-Deterministic Approximation Fixpoint Theory and Its Application in Disjunctive Logic Programming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantics of various formalisms for knowledge representation can often be described by fixpoints of corresponding operators. For example, in many logics theories\nof a set of formulas can be seen as fixpoints of the underlying consequence operator¬†. Likewise, in logic programming, default logic or formal\nargumentation, all the major semantics can be formulated as different types of fixpoints of the same operator (see¬†). Such operators are usually non-monotonic,\nand so one cannot always be sure whether their fixpoints exist, and how they can be constructed. In order to deal with this ‚Äòillusive nature‚Äô of the fixpoints, Denecker, Marek and Truszczy≈Ñski¬† introduced a method for approximating\neach value zùëßz of the underlying operator by a pair of elements (x,y)ùë•ùë¶(x,y). These elements intuitively represent lower and upper bounds on zùëßz, and so a corresponding\napproximation operator for the original, non-monotonic operator, is constructed. If the approximating operator that is obtained is precision-monotonic, intuitively meaning\nthat more precise inputs of the operator give rise to more precise outputs, then by Tarski and Knaster‚Äôs Fixpoint Theorem the approximating operator has fixpoints that can be constructively\ncomputed, and which in turn approximate the fixpoints of the approximated operator, if such fixpoints exist. The usefulness of the algebraic theory that underlies the computation process described above was demonstrated on several knowledge representation formalisms, such as propositional\nlogic programming¬†, default logic¬†, autoepistemic logic¬†, abstract argumentation and abstract\ndialectical frameworks¬†, hybrid MKNF¬†, the graph description language SCHACL¬†, and active\nintegrity constraints¬†[ref]10, each one of which was shown to be an instantiation of this abstract theory of approximation. More precisely, it was shown that various\nsemantics of the formalisms mentioned above correspond to the various fixpoints defined in¬†. This means that approximation fixpoint theory\n(AFT, for short) captures the uniform principles underlying all these non-monotonic formalisms in a purely algebraic way. Besides its unifying capabilities, AFT also allows for a straightforward definition of semantics for new formalisms. Indeed, one merely has to define an approximation of the\noperator of interest, and AFT then automatically gives rise to a family of semantics with several desirable properties. This potential of AFT for a straightforward derivation\nof semantics was demonstrated in e.g.¬†logic programming, where it was used to define semantics for extensions of logic programs¬†  , in argumentation theory, where it was used to define semantics for weighted abstract dialectical\nframeworks (ADFs,¬†), in autoepistemic logic, where it was used for defining distributed variants that are suitable for studying access control\npolicies¬†5, and in second-order logic extended with non-monotone inductive definitions¬†. Another benefit of AFT is that, due to its generality, it has proven useful to develop central concepts, such as strong equivalence¬†,\ngroundedness¬†, safe inductions¬†, and stratification¬† for approximation operators in a purely algebraic way, which then allow to derive\nresults on these concepts for all the specific formalisms representable in AFT as straightforward corollaries. So far, AFT has mainly been applied to deterministic operators, i.e., operators which map single inputs to single outputs. This means that, while AFT is able to characterize\nsemantics for normal logic programs (i.e., programs consisting of rules with single atomic formulas as their head), disjunctive logic programs¬†\n(i.e., programs consisting of rules with disjunctions of atoms in their head) cannot be represented by it. The same holds for the representation of e.g.¬†default logic versus disjunctive default\nlogic¬†2, abstract argumentation versus set-based abstract argumentation¬† and the generalization of abstract dialectical\nframeworks to¬†conditional abstract dialectical frameworks¬†8. Extending AFT to handle disjunctive information is therefore a desirable goal, as the latter has a central role in systems for knowledge representation and reasoning, and since\ndisjunctive reasoning capabilities provide an additional way of expressing uncertainty and indeterminism to many formalisms for non-monotonic reasoning. However, the introduction of disjunctive reasoning often increases the computational complexity of formalisms and thus extends their modeling capabilities¬†.\nPerhaps due to this additional expressiveness, the integration of non-deterministic reasoning with non-monotonic reasoning (NMR) has often proven non-trivial, as witnessed e.g.¬†by the large body of literature on disjunctive logic programming¬† . The implementation of non-deterministic reasoning in NMR\nyielded the formulation of some (open) problems that are related to the combination of non-monotonic and disjunctive reasoning¬†  , or was restricted to limited semantics available for the core formalism, as is the case for\ne.g.¬†default logic¬†2. The goal of this work is to provide an adequate framework for modeling disjunctive reasoning in NMR. We do so by extending AFT to handle non-deterministic operators.\nThis idea was first introduced by Pelov and Truszczy≈Ñski in¬†, where some first results on two-valued semantics for disjunctive logic programs were\nprovided. In this paper, we further extend AFT for non-deterministic operators, which, among others, allows a generalization of the results of¬† to the\nthree-valued case. In particular, we define several interesting classes of approximating fixpoints and show their existence, constructability and consistency where it is possible.\nAn application of this theory is demonstrated in the context of disjunctive logic programming. Furthermore, we show that our theory is a conservative generalization of the work\nin¬† of AFT for deterministic operators, in the sense that all the concepts introduced in this paper coincide with the deterministic counterparts when the operator at hand happens to be deterministic. The outcome of this work is therefore a comprehensive study of semantics for non-monotonic formalisms incorporating non-determinism.\nIts application is demonstrated in this paper in the context of disjunctive logic programming. Specifically, the paper contains the following contributions: We define variants of both the Kripke-Kleene and the stable/ well-founded semantics, the interpretation or fixpoint semantics and state semantics.\nInterpretation semantics consist of single pairs of elements, and thus approximate of a single element. State semantics, on the other hand, consist of pairs of sets of elements, intuitively\nviewed as a convex set, which approximates a set of elements. We show that the Kripke-Kleene state and well-founded state (obtained as the least fixed point of the stable state operator) exist and are unique (Theorem 3 and\nTheorem¬†5). We show that the Kripke-Kleene state approximates any fixpoint of an approximation operator (Theorem¬†5),\nwhereas the well-founded state approximates any stable fixpoint of an approximation operator (Theorem¬†5).\nIn more detail, any fixpoint of an approximation operator respectively stable fixpoint of an approximation operator is an element of the convex set represented by the Kripke-Kleene state respectively the well-founded state. We show that when restricting attention to deterministic operators, the theory reduces to deterministic AFT¬† (Remark¬†5 and\nPropositions¬†2,¬†9 and¬†11). We show that, just like in deterministic AFT, stable fixpoints are fixpoints that are minimal with respect to the truth order (Proposition 14). We demonstrate the usefulness of our abstract framework by showing how all the major semantics for disjunctive logic programming can be characterized as fixpoints\nof an approximation operator for disjunctive logic programming. In more detail, the weakly supported models¬† are characterized as\nfixpoints of the operator ‚Ñê‚Äãùíûùí´‚Ñêsubscriptùíûùí´{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P} (Theorem¬†1), the stable models can be characterized as the stable fixpoints of\n‚Ñê‚Äãùíûùí´‚Ñêsubscriptùíûùí´{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P} (Theorem¬†4) and the well-founded semantics by Alc√¢ntara, Dam√°sio and\nPereira¬† is strongly related to the well-founded state of ‚Ñê‚Äãùíûùí´‚Ñêsubscriptùíûùí´{\\cal IC}_{\\cal P} (Theorem¬†7). This work extends and improves the work by Heyninck and Arieli 7. The theory has been simplified on several accounts, among others since: (1)¬†we no longer require minimality of the elements of the range of a non-deterministic (approximation)\noperator, which leads to a significant decrease in the number of lattice-constructions needed, (2)¬†the state operator is now more general and can\nbe defined on the basis of a non-deterministic approximation operator. Furthermore, intuitive explanations and illustrative examples are added throughout the paper.\nAs a by-product, the simplified framework allows us to identify and correct a faulty statement on the ‚â§isubscriptùëñ\\leq_{i}-monotonicity\nof the approximation operator for disjunctive logic programs, made by Heyninck and Arieli 7 (see Remark¬†7). Both this paper and the work of Heyninck and Arieli¬†7 were partially inspired by the work of Pelov and Truszczy≈Ñski¬† where,\nto the best of our knowledge, the idea of a non-deterministic operator was first introduced in approximation fixpoint theory. Pelov and Truszczy≈Ñski¬† studied only two-valued semantics, whereas\nwe study the full range of semantics for AFT. Furthermore, Pelov and Truszczy≈Ñski¬† required minimality of the codomain of non-deterministic operators, which we do not require here. This rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section¬†2 we recall the necessary background on disjunctive logic programming (Section¬†2.1)\nand approximation fixpoint theory (Section¬†2.2). In Section¬†3 we introduce non-deterministic operators and their approximation, and show some preliminary results\non approximations of non-deterministic operators. In Section¬†4 we study these non-deterministic approximation operators, showing their consistency and introducing and studying their fixpoint, Kripke-Kleene interpretation and the\nKripke-Kleene state semantics. In Section¬†5 we introduce and study the stable interpretation and state semantics, as well as the well-founded\nstate semantics.
