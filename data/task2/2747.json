      "content": "Paper Title: A multi-stage semi-supervised improved deep embedded clustering method for bearing fault diagnosis under the situation of insufficient labeled samples\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this study, the dimension of samples of bearing vibration acceleration data is set to 1024, and thus the dimension of the input data of the network obtained by the FFT is 512. Considering that the input data are one-dimensional signals in the frequency domain, one-dimentional CNN (1D-CNN) is selected as the basic network. In the first stage, the auto-encoder is pretrained. The encoder module contains three convolutional layers, the number of channels is 8, 16, and 32, the kernel size is set to 10, and the stride is set to 2. This architecture incorporates the guidelines proposed in references  [ref]47, and some adjustments based on exhaustive model exploration were made to provide superior results for semi-supervised and unsupervised tasks of bearing fault diagnosis in this study. After the convolutional layer, a flatten layer is set to fuse the local features into global features. After the flatten layer, the data are embedded into the low-dimensional feature space through a fully-connected layer with the number of Nr​e​psubscript𝑁𝑟𝑒𝑝N_{rep} neurons. The number of neurons in this layer is set to 32 in both weakly supervised and unsupervised tasks, and its effect on the model is investigated in Section 3.5. The decoder structure is similar with that of the encoder including three fully-connected layers that is inverse to that of the encoder and three deconvolution modules with channels of 32, 16, 8, the kernel size of 10, and the stride of 2. Owing to the skip-connection, each deconvolution module of the decoder contains two parts. The first part concatenates the high-level and low-level features in the channel dimension to obtain a new feature. The second part performs 1*1 convolution on concatenated features to ensure that the dimensions of the corresponding layer features of the decoder and encoder are consistent. Finally, a reconstructed sample is obtained through a fully-connected layer with the number of Ni​n​p​u​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡N_{input} neurons. In the third stage, the discriminative model is trained. The discriminative model consists of two parts: an encoder and a classifier. Fellowing , the encoder shares the weight with the encoder in the pre-trained auto-encoder network model. The classifier contains two convolutional layers, a flatten layer, and two fully-connected layers. The number of channels of the convolutional layer is 8 and 16, the kernel size is set to 3, and the stride is set to 1. The two fully-connected layers contain 128 and Nc​l​u​s​t​e​rsubscript𝑁𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟N_{cluster} neurons respectively. Those parameters were selected to handel the dataset used in the paper through exhaustive model exploration. Finally, the softmax function is used to classify the bearing health status. In the model training process, the Xavier normal initializer is used for parameter initialization. The convolutional layers are regularized by batch normalization (BN) , and Leaky Relu  is used as the activation function. All parameters are updated using the back-propagation algorithm, and adaptive moment estimation (Adam)  is used as the optimizer. These selections are based on experience and experimental validations.The maximum value of the pre-training epochs is set to 4000. In each training epoch, a mini-batch is used for gradient optimization, and the number of batches is set to 32 by default. The architecture of the network and parameters are determined based on validations in task C1 with ns​p=1subscript𝑛𝑠𝑝1n_{sp}=1 and nu​n=300subscript𝑛𝑢𝑛300n_{un}=300. The experimental results in this paper adopt the average value of 10 trials, and the default values of the main parameters are listed in Table 3.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: three convolutional layers, the number of channels is 8, 16, and 32, the kernel size is set to 10, and the stride is set to 2.
