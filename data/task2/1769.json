      "content": "Paper Title: The Gradient Convergence Bound of Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Efficient Communication\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, distributed IRL  has been frequently studied and applied in many practical applications  . However, due to the heterogeneity of independent learning environments, the performance of IRL agents may vary significantly, even though agents are deployed in the same global environment and face exactly the same facilities. Several studies    have shown that experiences from homogeneous independent learning agents in the same multi-agent system can be collected and sampled together to obtain a shared model efficiently. Besides, the recent studies    have combined distributed IRL with FL to improve the involved agents’ capability and collaboration efficiency. The combining of FL and DRL remains a hot research topic [ref]23  . For example,  adopts a decoupled setting to combine DRL and FL. Wherein,  uses a hierarchical nested personalized FL for stratified UAVs swarms, while leverages DRL for swarm trajectory and learning duration design. [ref]23 focuses on a digital-twin empowered industrial Internet-of-things (IoTs) scenario, and presents a single-agent DRL-based device selection for asynchronous FL. Contrary to these papers, our work is primarily oriented at the direct enhancement of decentralized multi-agent DRL by FL. Furthermore,  targets at the data heterogeneity issue of multi-agent DRL by imposing KL divergence-based penalty term. Instead, our work aims to solve learning inefficiency issue of multi-agent DRL by decay and consensus-based FL methods. Besides, we further quantify the effect of key parameters in FL on the convergence performance. An on-line federated transfer reinforcement learning framework is introduced in  based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)  algorithm for autonomous driving. However, this framework lacks the theoretical analysis for the performance of FL in DRL, while the interplay between deterministic actor network and the Q-function typically makes DDPG extremely difficult to stabilize and brittle to hyper-parameter settings . Meanwhile, a federated DRL-based cooperative edge caching (FADE) framework is proposed in  to optimize the edge caching schemes in IoTs services. However, this framework ignores that the frequent information exchange between base stations (BSs) and UEs may generate excessive communication overheads. Moreover, FADE utilizes a value-based DRL method (i.e., deep Q-learning network (DQN) ) and theoretically analyzes the model’s convergence in SGD based on some general classification loss functions. Nevertheless, the value-based DRL methods exhibit some instability issues in high-dimensional scenarios. Besides, the effect of deploying SGD in improving DRL under these functions is hard to characterize. Instead, this paper utilizes the periodic averaging method to further reduce the excessive communication overheads, and deploys the policy-based DRL method (i.e., PPO algorithm ) to effectively improve DRL by SGD . FL is a parallelly distributed machine learning paradigm, aiming to train specific model through the samples distributed across different agents. Due to the protection requirement for data privacy and the restriction from communication bandwidth or delay , FL allows distributed agents to calculate their models’ gradients locally, and then forward these gradients towards a central server to centrally update the model’s parameters. However, the naive FL may generate excessive communication overheads between distributed agents and the central server, especially when there are a large number of agents or iterations . Hence, the periodic averaging method has been proposed to make agents locally perform several updates to the model within a period before transmitting local gradients to the server    . Moreover, several quantization or sparsification methods have been also proposed to implement lossy compression for the model’s local gradients that need to be transmitted    . Furthermore, FL with flexible device participation has been considered in [ref]25, where devices (i.e., agents) are assumed to have different sample sizes during the training phase. However, [ref]25 is not designed for on-line training tasks. Instead, [ref]25 assumes devices already have available data points and could assign aggregation weights according to their sizes. On the contrary, in this paper, the learning paradigm is oriented to on-line DRL tasks, and the discrepancy of agents in terms of sample-collecting efficiency and computing capability is additionally considered. Specifically, we reflect this discrepancy on the numbers of agents’ local updates, and formulate our problem on the VPA method. The theoretical analyses about the error convergence bound under the periodic averaging method have been provided in . Moreover, to reduce this error convergence bound,  and [ref]25 have proposed to decrease the learning rate over epochs and optimize the aggregation weights for agents with different sample sizes, respectively. Differently, the decay-based method in this paper aims to decrease the weights of successive gradients over local updates within one period. Note that each epoch includes several periods. Moreover, we additionally provide a practical implementation of the decay-based method through an exponential function, in which the distribution of agents’ local updates is further considered. On the other hand, the consensus algorithm [ref]20 has been applied in many decentralized averaging methods   , which normally disable the central server’s functionality but allow agents to directly exchange and average their parameters with neighbors. However, decentralized averaging methods will slow the convergence rate as the size of agents’ network increases. A consensus-based FL algorithm has been proposed in  to obtain the training model in large-scale device-to-device (D2D)-enabled fog networks, and an upper bound of convergence with respect to the spectral radius (i.e., the largest eigenvalue of the built induced consensus matrix) of the network topology has been also derived. On the contrary, we derive the error convergence bound from the algebraic connectivity (i.e., the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix). Together with our previous work , this bound additionally reflects the effect of local interaction metric (i.e., step size ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon in the classical consensus algorithm [ref]20), which can be properly adjusted to guarantee the policy improvement of DRL. Finally, both the decay-based and consensus-based methods are oriented to on-line MARL tasks, where theoretical analyses about the error convergence bound are based on general assumptions for the VPA method.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Besides, the recent studies    have combined distributed IRL with FL to improve the involved agents’ capability and collaboration efficiency.
