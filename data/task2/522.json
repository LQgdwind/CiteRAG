      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse GPU Kernels for Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural network architectures are composed of large, dense matrices used in matrix multiplication and convolutions  . These matrices can be made sparse with little to no loss in model quality, leading to models that are more efficient in terms of both the floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameters required to achieve a given accuracy [ref]3   . The most common use of sparsity in deep neural networks is to accelerate inference. In addition to the standard training procedure, a sparsification algorithm is applied to produce a neural network where a high fraction of the weights are zero-valued  [ref]3  . The weight matrices can then be stored in a compressed format, and sparse linear algebra kernels can be used to accelerate computation. In the context of generative models, sparsity has been applied to reduce the computational requirements of self-attention in Transformer architectures  0 1. In addition to these applications, sparsity can be exploited to achieve higher predictive accuracy by training a larger, sparse model for a fixed computational cost 2 3 4. To make training large sparse models feasible, all computation during training needs to operate directly on the compressed sparse representation of the model’s weights. The potential applications of sparsity in deep learning are numerous. However, it is difficult to realize the benefits of sparsity in real applications due to the lack of efficient kernels for core sparse matrix computations like sparse matrix–matrix multiplication (SpMM) and sampled dense–dense matrix multiplication (SDDMM) on accelerators like GPUs. On parallel architectures, the performance of sparse linear algebra kernels can vary drastically with properties of the sparse matrix such as the topology of nonzero values and level of sparsity. Existing GPU kernels for sparse linear algebra are primarily optimized for scientific applications, where matrices are extremely (99%+) sparse. With the relatively moderate levels of sparsity found in deep neural networks, these kernels are not able to outperform their dense counterparts. To address this issue, structure can be enforced on the topology of nonzeros such that nonzero values are grouped into blocks 2 3 4. While this approach is able to recover much of the performance achieved by dense computation, the constraint on the location of nonzeros can significantly degrade model quality relative to unstructured sparsity 4 5 6. In this work, we develop an approach for computing SpMM and SDDMM on GPUs which is targeted specifically at deep learning applications. Our approach operates directly on the standard compressed sparse row (CSR) format and does not enforce any structure on the topology of nonzero values. We make the following specific contributions: We conduct a large-scale study of sparse matrices found in deep learning and identify favorable properties that can be exploited to accelerate sparse computation. We introduce a 1-dimensional tiling scheme for decomposing the computation across processing elements that facilitates reuse of operands and lends itself to an extensible implementation. We develop two techniques, subwarp tiling and reverse-offset memory alignment, that enable the use of vector memory instructions on misaligned memory addresses in sparse data structures. We introduce row swizzle load balancing, an approach for load balancing computation between processing elements that is decoupled from the parallelization scheme. On a large dataset of sparse matrices taken from state-of-the-art deep neural networks, we demonstrate geometric mean speedups of 3.58×\\times and 2.19×\\times over Nvidia cuSPARSE for SpMM and SDDMM respectively on Nvidia V100 GPUs. On the top performing problems, our kernels reach 27% of single-precision peak. Using our kernels, we demonstrate sparse Transformer and MobileNet models that achieve 1.2–2.1×\\times end-to-end speedups and 12.8×\\times reductions in memory usage while matching the accuracy of their dense counterparts.
