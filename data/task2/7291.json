      "content": "Paper Title: A review of Deep Learning Methods for Photoplethysmography Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHypertension, a highly prevalent cardiovascular ailment, poses a substantial threat to individuals’ well-being by causing damage to vital organs such as the heart, blood vessels, brain, and kidneys . Unfortunately, a significant portion of the population remains unaware of their abnormal BP, thereby increasing the risk of future health complications. Traditional methods of BP measurement, due to their invasive nature or reliance on discontinuous cuff-based devices, are not applicable to continuous BP monitoring in daily life. Research has demonstrated that PPG is a correlated signal with BP  . Consequently, current studies have integrated PPG with deep learning for precise classification and estimation of BP. In the realm of BP classification, the primary objective is to map a given segment of PPG to the corresponding BP category. For example, Wang et al.  proposed a CNN and LSTM-based architecture to categorize BP into five groups: hypotension, normotension, prehypertension, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension, employing the UCI machine learning blood pressure (UCI_BP) database 14, which encompasses 12,000 simultaneous PPG, ECG, and invasively measured ABP segments. Furthermore, given the heightened risk posed by hypertension, there are also studies specifically focusing on the precise classification and assessment of hypertension . Beyond BP classification, the majority of studies focus on non-invasive BP estimation, which can be broadly categorized into two main groups. One group aims at obtaining discrete BP values based on input PPG signals, such as systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP)    . The other group concentrates on reconstructing continuous BP waveforms  , which provide more comprehensive BP information. For instance, Kim et al.  devised \"DeepCNAP,\" a fusion of ResUNet  and self-attention, to extract continuous ABP waveforms, achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.40 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 4.36 mmHg for SBP, 1.75 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 2.25 mmHg for DBP, and 3.23 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 2.21 mmHg for the BP waveform on the MIMIC database (n = 942, recording time = 374.43 h). Observations have indicated that certain existing databases include synchronized ECG, PPG, and ABP signals, and multiple studies   have demonstrated a correlation between ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. Consequently, some researchers have integrated synchronized ECG and PPG signals as inputs for their models  , facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between these signals. PPG signals are useful in extracting information on the human cardiovascular system and have yielded promising results across various applications. For instance, they have been leveraged for the detection and classification of arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular contraction, premature atrial contraction, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and AF  [ref]97. Moreover, PPG signals have found utility in HR estimation  , assessment of peripheral arterial diseases , classification of ankle brachial index 18, evaluation of cardiovascular aging [ref]99 19, and heart rate variability calculation 20. The detection of AF, among various arrhythmias, merits particular attention. It can be approached as a binary classification task, distinguishing between AF and non-AF [ref]97, or as a multi-class classification task, categorizing sinus rhythm, AF, and other arrhythmias . HR estimation is also a significant area of focus. Traditional methods based on peak detection algorithms are susceptible to instability due to artifacts, leading to reduced reliability during physical activities such as biking and running. Consequently, deep learning approaches have been employed to leverage their capacity to extract robust and deep features, which have exhibited exceptional performance in both stationary states and activities . Sleep, an essential activity for living organisms, occupies almost one third of a human’s life. Poor or insufficient sleep, often caused by sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia, has been linked to a wide array of physiological dysfunctions, including those in the endocrine 21 and metabolic systems 22, as well as impairments in higher cortical function and neurological disorders 23. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard in sleep labs, is expensive, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and negatively impacts sleep quality 24. As a result, deep learning techniques based on PPG have recently received increasing attention in the field of sleep health. To streamline the manual sleep staging process, which is currently based on electroencephalogram (EEG) but is time-consuming due to the complexity of EEG setup and the extensive manual scoring involved  , a CRNN architecture (CNN-GRU) was designed in Ref.  to automatically identify sleep stages. This model utilized transmissive PPG signals from suspected OSA patients (n = 894) and was individually trained for three-stage (wake/NREM/REM), four-stage (wake/N1+N2/N3/REM), and five-stage (wake/N1/N2/N3/REM) classifications of sleep, achieving an epoch-by-epoch accuracy of 80.1% with Cohen’s κ𝜅\\kappa of 0.65, 68.5% (κ𝜅\\kappa = 0.54), and 64.1% (κ𝜅\\kappa = 0.51), respectively. In parallel with sleep stage identification   , there are also studies utilizing PPG signals in combination with deep learning for OSA detection. For instance, Ref.  demonstrated an automated method for estimating the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a key metric for assessing OSA severity. Test results using an independent set of 188 clinically heterogeneous recordings revealed strong agreement with the gold standard PSG reference (correlation = 0.61, estimation error = 3 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 10 events/h). Also, the estimated AHI exhibited reliable ability to assess OSA severity (weighted κ𝜅\\kappa = 0.51) and screen for OSA (AUC = 0.84/0.86/0.85 for mild/moderate/severe OSA). Recognizing emotional states is important for regulating stress levels and promoting mental well-being, as it provides an indication of human mental health 25. The influence of emotional states on physiological processes, such as heart rate (HR) and blood circulation, is manifested in PPG signals. Therefore, analyzing PPG signals allows for the detection of patterns associated with different emotional states, indicating the potential of PPG as a tool for emotion recognition. In deep learning-based PPG analysis, the classification criteria for emotional state recognition tasks are not fixed and can vary across different studies. For instance, Barki et al. 26 and Elzeiny et al. 27 divided human emotional states into binary classes: stressed and not-stressed. On the other hand, in Ref. 28 25, emotional state recognition was treated as a multi-class classification task. Overall, the majority of these studies focus on stress detection, considering stress as a potential risk factor for depression, anxiety, and various harmful diseases. Respiratory illnesses are prevalent conditions with a high morbidity rate, leading to significant distress for patients. Additionally, many diseases are associated with changes in a patient’s breathing, underscoring the importance and utility of extracting individual respiratory patterns. However, traditional methods for this rely on specialized equipment, such as capnography systems and nasal/oral pressure transducers 29, which are inconvenient for long-term measurements and out-of-clinical settings. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on PPG-based techniques for respiratory monitoring and analysis, particularly RR estimation and respiratory signal extraction. The majority of the papers we reviewed focused on estimating RR. In Ref. , the authors proposed an end-to-end deep learning approach based on ResNet to estimate RR using PPG data, achieving a MAE of 2.5 ±plus-or-minus\\pm 0.6 breaths per minute through 5-fold cross-validation on two widely used public PPG datasets: the CapnoBase dataset and the BIDMC dataset. Other approaches, such as Bi-LSTM with Bahdanau attention (using combined PPG and ECG)  and cycle GAN (using solely PPG) , were also explored and demonstrated reliable performance in estimating RR. PPG signals can also be used to extract and reconstruct respiratory waveforms. In Ref. , an encoder-decoder architecture called \"RespNet\", which utilized dilated residual inception blocks, was presented to extract and reconstruct respiratory waveforms from PPG signals. Similarly, in a recent study 30, a U-Net based architecture was employed to map the PPG signal to one of the gold standard respiratory references, capnography. The results demonstrated the capability to produce respiratory waveforms that closely resemble the gold standard. Furthermore, deep learning-based PPG signal analysis has also found applications in SpO22{2}-related events, including SpO22{2} estimation 31, as well as the detection and prediction of hypoxemia and its severity 32 33. The reason for this is that traditional SpO22{2} estimation using pulse oximetry requires dual-wavelength PPG, and the calculation formula of SpO22{2} is not precise enough. In contrast, deep learning methods for predicting SpO2 from PPG signals require only a single wavelength PPG and offer more robust and accurate predictions 31. Diabetes is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels with disturbances in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins due to a loss of insulin-producing cells, insufficient insulin action, or both 34. It has been reported that an estimated 4.2 million deaths among adults aged 20-79 are attributed to diabetes 35. Given the known discomfort associated with conventional invasive finger-prick blood glucose measurement methods 36 37, there is a strong demand for non-invasive and convenient approaches to assess blood glucose levels. Due to the impact of blood glucose levels on light absorption and reflection signals under specific wavelengths 38, PPG-based blood glucose assessment methods are theoretically feasible, and have been investigated in recent years. In the realm of diabetes detection, a CNN-based diabetes classifier was developed in Ref. . This model used a combined input of PPG signals, hypertension classification, age, and gender, achieving an accuracy of 76.34% and an AUC of 0.830 when tested on 224 patients from the MIMIC-III waveforms dataset. In addition to diabetes classification (blood glucose level estimation), research has also delved into blood glucose value estimation. For instance, in an effort to investigate the potential influence of medications on non-invasive blood glucose prediction accuracy, Chu et al. 39 partitioned the 2538 subjects recruited into two cohorts, with and without medication (comprising 1682 and 856 subjects, respectively), and employed a CNN-based architecture. Their findings revealed that training the model on subjects without any form of medication (including insulin injections, cardiovascular treatments, etc.) resulted in an enhancement of approximately 30% in prediction accuracy compared to those on medication. Additionally, the incorporation of glycohemoglobin values led to an improvement of approximately 10% in the prediction accuracy. In another study 40, deduction learning and an automatic screening algorithm for removing low-confidence outlier predictions were used. The results demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.81, an accuracy score of 93.5, a root mean squared error of 13.93 mg/dl, a MAE of 12.07 mg/dl, and 100% of predictions falling within zone A of the Clarke Error Grid. In addition to the aforementioned application scenarios, PPG signals in combination with deep learning have demonstrated utility in various other domains. For instance, in Ref. 06, PPG signals and an LSTM-based model were employed to diagnose the severity level of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, exhibiting promising potential in supporting severity grading of infectious diseases in low-resource settings. Furthermore, deep learning-enhanced PPG signals have also been utilized for pain level classification 07, sepsis detection 09, COVID-19 diagnosis 41, depth of anesthesia prediction 08, and assessment of teenagers’ physical fitness condition 42.\n\nReference markers found: [97]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]97: leveraged for the detection and classification of arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular contraction, premature atrial contraction, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and AF  [ref]97.
