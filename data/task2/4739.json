      "content": "Paper Title: Lazy Probabilistic Roadmaps Revisited\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe key algorithmic development leading to general, scalable algorithms for motion\nplanning was the invention of the Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM)\nalgorithm  [ref]22. As noted in\nthe Introduction, motion planning problems (3) cannot be solved\ndirectly, as it is necessary to identify a finite subset of the decision variables and\nconstraints. PRM decomposes (3) into two subproblems: a learning\nsubproblem, where a random geometric graph G𝐺G  meeting some\nrequirements is sought, and a combinatorial optimization problem whose solutions are\npaths p∈P​a​t​h​s​(G)𝑝𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝐺p\\in Paths(G) such that a certain objective function, typically the sum of lengths of the\nedges, is minimized .\nBefore discussing the PRM algorithm, which is given in Figure 2, we formalize the learning subproblem as\nthat of searching over an infinite set of geometric graphs 𝒢𝒢{\\cal G}, looking for those\nthat meet the following criteria Solutions or roadmaps, are random geometric graphs G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) required, via constraint (6b), to be such that the vertex set is a subset\nof topological space S𝑆S, and edges in E𝐸E correspond to functions λ∈Λ𝜆Λ\\lambda\\in\\Lambda, λ: →S:𝜆→01𝑆\\lambda: \\to S, or\nlocal plans. Solutions (graphs) G𝐺G are also required, via constraint (6c), to cover the initial\nstate q0subscript𝑞0q_{0} and the set of goal states F⋆subscript𝐹⋆F_{\\star}. As noted by Janson et al. [ref]23, ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-dispersion (1)\nfor vertex set V𝑉V describes how well the former covers the set S𝑆S, and therefore bounding how close any plan associated with\na path p∈P​a​t​h​s​(G)𝑝𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝐺p\\in Paths(G) can approximate the (unattainable) optimal cost for Problem (3).\nMany formulations of (6) exist in the\nliterature, with significantly different properties. In the original PRM paper ,\nS𝑆S == F𝐹F and ΛΛ\\Lambda == {ρ∈Π\\{\\rho\\in\\Pi ::: img(ρ)⊂F}\\mathrm{img}(\\rho)\\subset F\\}, so that paths p∈P​a​t​h​s​(G)𝑝𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝐺p\\in Paths(G) map directly onto solutions for Problem (3).\nIn contrast, Bohlin and Kavraki set S=C𝑆𝐶S=C and ΛΛ\\Lambda to be the set of local plans λ: →C:𝜆→01𝐶\\lambda: \\to C, so that paths p∈P​a​t​h​s​(G)𝑝𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝐺p\\in Paths(G)\nmay or not map onto solutions for Problem (3). We adapt the classic descriptions of PRM (Figure 2) in the literature to be an iterative algorithm, that generates\na sequence of geometric graphs Gksubscript𝐺𝑘G_{k}, k=0,1,…𝑘01…k=0,1,\\ldots. The initial graph G0subscript𝐺0G_{0} is given by the tuple ({q0,q⋆},∅)subscript𝑞0subscript𝑞⋆(\\{q_{0},q_{\\star}\\},\\emptyset),\nwhere q⋆subscript𝑞⋆q_{\\star} is a suitably chosen state in F⋆subscript𝐹⋆F_{\\star}. Each iteration Algorithm 2 chooses Gk+1subscript𝐺𝑘1G_{k+1}, a supergraph of Gksubscript𝐺𝑘G_{k}, by adding\na new vertex qk∈Ssubscript𝑞𝑘𝑆q_{k}\\in S and as many edges λ⊂Λ𝜆Λ\\lambda\\subset\\Lambda as possible that connect qksubscript𝑞𝑘q_{k} with points q′∈Vksuperscript𝑞′subscript𝑉𝑘q^{\\prime}\\in V_{k} in a suitably defined\nneighborhood centered at qksubscript𝑞𝑘q_{k}. Line 222 in Figure 2 initializes the iteration by sampling state qksubscript𝑞𝑘q_{k}\nfrom a sequence 𝒳≔X0​X1​…​Xk​…≔𝒳subscript𝑋0subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑘…{\\cal X}\\coloneqq X_{0}X_{1}\\ldots X_{k}\\ldots of random variables whose distribution\nsupport222We note that the support of a random variable X𝑋X taking values in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nis the set {x∈ℝn:PX​(ℬr​(x))>0,for all​r>0}conditional-set𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛formulae-sequencesubscript𝑃𝑋subscriptℬ𝑟𝑥0for all𝑟0\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\,:\\,P_{X}({\\cal B}_{r}(x))>0,\\,\\mbox{for all}\\,r>0\\}, and more generally, the smallest closed set such\nthat PX​(C)=1subscript𝑃𝑋𝐶1P_{X}(C)=1, where PX​(S)subscript𝑃𝑋𝑆P_{X}(S) is the probability of X𝑋X taking as a value an element of set S𝑆S. is S𝑆S.\nLine 333 enumerates the elements in the neighborhood of qksubscript𝑞𝑘q_{k}, which is defined by the set of existing vertices Vksubscript𝑉𝑘V_{k} and\na ball of radius rk>0subscript𝑟𝑘0r_{k}>0. This parameter, or connection radius, decreases monotonically as k𝑘k increases, ensuring\nthat as G𝐺G becomes bigger, ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-dispersion [ref]23 [ref]22 is reduced. Importantly,\nthe schedule for rksubscript𝑟𝑘r_{k} cannot be arbitrary as it greatly affects the convergence of Gksubscript𝐺𝑘G_{k} to a graph where q0subscript𝑞0q_{0} and\nsome vertices F⋆∩Vsubscript𝐹⋆𝑉F_{\\star}\\cap V belong to the same connected component [ref]22. Edges (local plans λ𝜆\\lambda)\nare added in lines 444 and 555 of Figure 2. Depending on the definition of ΛΛ\\Lambda (see above), no valid local plan may exist, and\nthen no edge is added.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: The key algorithmic development leading to general, scalable algorithms for motion\nplanning was the invention of the Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM)\nalgorithm  [ref]22.
