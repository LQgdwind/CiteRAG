      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Iterative Amortized Inference for Learning Symmetric and Disentangled Multi-Object Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has produced impressive results across multiple domains by taking advantage of enormous amounts of data and compute.\nHowever, it has become clear that the representations these models learn have fundamental limitations.\nConsider the problem of inferring a representation for a multi-object scene.\nMost humans can observe a scene and then manipulate the individual objects in their mind—perhaps imagining that a chair has suddenly flipped upside down.\nThis example illustrates that the common approach of summarizing an entire scene as a single distributed representation [ref]23 is likely insufficient.\nIt has been shown that this approach fails on simple generalization tasks such as processing novel numbers of objects   . Alternatively, a scene can be encoded as a set of distributed object-centric representations using\nobject detection  or instance segmentation .\nWhile sets can handle arbitrary numbers of objects, these methods require ground truth supervision which limits reusability and generalization.\nUnsupervised approaches bring the promise of better generalization at the expense of relying on inductive biases to implicitly define the scene representation.\nIn this paper, we aim to develop such a method that incorporates three key inductive biases that have been argued previously as being essential for object-centric reasoning and addressing the binding problem within deep neural networks   [ref]18 [ref]34  . Symmetry Multiple distributed representations are inferred for a single scene, each sharing a common format with the others [ref]18 [ref]34. This eases relational and compositional reasoning, e.g. for learning dynamics models  . Unordered Any latent representation can take responsibility for any single object [ref]18.\nTypically, a randomized iterative process is used to decide the assignment. Disentangled Manipulating one dimension of an object representation changes a single object property and leaves all else invariant   . Prior attempts to incorporate all three inductive biases have been unsuccessful for a variety of reasons.\nSome do not enforce symmetry to avoid solving for the assignment   while others learn symmetric yet entangled representations which circumvents the challenge of disentangling latent factors [ref]34.\nTo the best of our knowledge, IODINE [ref]18 is the only model that has all three inductive biases.\nHowever, IODINE has computational concerns due to its use of iterative amortized inference (IAI)  to implement the assignment of pixels to symmetric representations.\nThis translates to relatively long training times of over a week given a reasonable compute budget and slow test time inference. In this work, we show that IAI can be used to solve multi-object representation learning while being as efficient as competing approaches and without sacrificing representation quality.\nOur idea is to cast the iterative assignment of inputs to symmetric representations as bottom-up inference in a multi-layer hierarchical variational autoencoder (HVAE).\nA hierarchical prior regularizes the bottom-up posterior, disentangling the latent space.\nWe use a two-stage inference algorithm to obtain a scene representation; the first stage uses the HVAE, and the second stage uses IAI to simply refine the HVAE posterior.\nWe find this is crucial for the HVAE to achieve reliable convergence to good local minima, particularly early on during training.\nAt test time, IAI can optionally be discarded. Contributions: EfficientMORL, a framework for efficient multi-object representation learning consisting of a hierarchical VAE and a lightweight network for iterative refinement Our method learns both symmetric and disentangled representations while being comparably efficient to state-of-the-art methods whose representations miss on at least one of the key inductive biases An order of magnitude faster training and test time inference than the closest comparable method\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: in their mind—perhaps imagining that a chair has suddenly flipped upside down.\nThis example illustrates that the common approach of summarizing an entire scene as a single distributed representation [ref]23 is likely insufficient.\nIt has been shown that this approach fails on simple generalization tasks such as processing novel numbers of objects   .
