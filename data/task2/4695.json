      "content": "Paper Title: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes in Robotics: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned above, if the robots in the team can always communicate with each other, coordination can be reached by solving a multi-agent POMDP, see, e.g.,¬†      .\nThe solution methods do not differ from the single-robot case.\nTherefore, we focus here on two distinct approaches to planning in multi-robot coordination problems with limited communication.\nFirst, a Dec-POMDP can be solved offline to agree on a joint strategy before plan execution.\nThen, no communication at the time of policy execution is needed.\nThe Dec-POMDP is either solved directly, or it is decomposed into simpler single-agent planning problems solved locally.\nSecondly, methods that use local communication during plan execution can reach a consensus, e.g., on a shared belief state, and use this to coordinate actions online. A Dec-POMDP modeling a multi-robot task can be solved approximately¬† or exactly¬†[ref]86.\nIn¬†[ref]86, a multi-robot target tracking problem with a reward dependent on the robot team‚Äôs joint belief is considered.\nThe theoretical foundations of such multi-robot information gathering were investigated in¬†[ref]88 .\nDue to the computational complexity of Dec-POMDPs, these approaches are limited to small problems with a handful of agents, actions, and observations.\nAlternatively, the semi-Markov decision process setting allows temporal abstraction by modeling varying durations of actions¬†  .\nThis abstraction improves scalability by introducing additional levels of hierarchy through macro-actions composed of simpler closed-loop controllers, see Fig.¬†10 (bottom).\nEach high-level macro-action for a task executes lower-level closed loop controllers that transform an initial belief to a goal belief where the task is completed.\nIn¬†, Gaussian beliefs are used at the lowest level, allowing application of macro-actions in continuous problems.\nThe problem is solved by Monte Carlo and cross-entropy based algorithms.\nThe method is demonstrated in a package delivery domain with four quadrotor robots with no online communication.\nThe completion times of macro-actions such as ‚Äúgo to delivery location jùëój‚Äù are probabilistically modeled in the semi-Markov framework.\nThe MacDec-POMDP framework, see, e.g.,¬†, further removes the restriction that the completion time step of a macro action is determined before execution. Some works map the Dec-POMDP problem to a set of local single-agent problems that are easier to solve¬†2   , at the cost of losing optimality.\nIn¬†2, each agent plays one of several possible roles corresponding to a specific\nlocal reward function.\nAt run-time, each agent solves a multi-agent POMDP to compute the value of each potential role.\nAn auction algorithm allocates tasks to best-performing agents.\nThe auction requires communication between robots, but overall the method avoids the computational burden of solving a Dec-POMDP.\nThe method of¬†2 is demonstrated in robotic environmental monitoring and cooperative tracking.\nRole-based POMDP abstractions are also proposed in¬†, where agents leave clues that are observable to the other agents, allowing inference of the roles and future actions of others without direct communication.\nIn¬†, a homogeneous team of robots explores an environment. The discrete Dec-POMDP problem is approximated as a set of local MDPs.\nIf communication is not possible, a robot acts independently by solving its local MDP.\nRobots interact via communication with nearby other robots, affecting each others‚Äô local MDP value functions.\nIn¬†, multi-robot navigation and collision avoidance is cast as a set of POMDPs, one for each homogeneous robot in the team. A single shared policy is learned, which still induces individual behaviour as each agent conditions its actions on its individual observations. When robots communicate during policy execution they can reach a consensus, e.g., by communicating and updating local beliefs¬† 2 or observations¬† .\nIn case of communication breaks, missing data from other team members can be predicted based on the model parameters, see, e.g.,¬† 2.\nAlternatively, coordination is achieved in¬†[ref]19 by periodically communicating policies with other robots.\nNotably, no centralized planning phase is assumed, which makes the method fully distributed.\nEach robot locally plans a best response policy using MCTS, simulating other robots‚Äô actions according to the received policies.\nThe method of¬†[ref]19 was applied to agricultural multi-robot fruit detection in¬†.\nA limitation of this approach is that it searches for open loop policies, potentially with a lower performance compared to an optimal solution.\nThe approaches above allow a robot to continue executing its policy even if communication is interrupted.\n\nReference markers found: [86]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]86: plan execution can reach a consensus, e.g., on a shared belief state, and use this to coordinate actions online. A Dec-POMDP modeling a multi-robot task can be solved approximately¬† or exactly¬†[ref]86.\nIn¬†[ref]86, a multi-robot target tracking problem with a reward dependent on the robot team‚Äôs joint belief is considered.\nThe theoretical foundations of such multi-robot information\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
