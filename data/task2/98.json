      "content": "Paper Title: Work-efficient Batch-incremental Minimum Spanning Trees with Applications to the Sliding Window Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMSTs have a long and interesting history. The problem of dynamically maintaining the MST under modifications to the underlying graph has been well studied. Spira and Pan  were the first to tackle the dynamic problem, and give an O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) sequential algorithm for vertex insertion that is based on Boruvka’s algorithm. The first sublinear time algorithm for edge updates was given by Frederickson , who gave an O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(\\sqrt{m}) algorithm. A well-celebrated improvement to Frederickson’s algorithm was given by Eppstein et. al , who introduced the sparsification technique to reduce the cost to O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}). A great number of subsequent dynamic algorithms, including parallel ones, take advantage of Eppstein’s sparsification. The sequential incremental MST problem, i.e., the problem of maintaining the MST subject to new edge insertions but no deletions, can be solved in O​(lg⁡(n))𝑂lg𝑛O(\\lg(n)) time per update using dynamic trees   to find the heaviest weight edge on the cycle induced by the new edge and remove it. Holm et. al. gave the first polylogarithmic time algorithm for fully dynamic MST [ref]31, supporting updates in O​(lg4⁡(n))𝑂superscriptlg4𝑛O(\\lg^{4}(n)) amortized time per operation, and later improved by a lg⁡lg⁡nlglg𝑛\\lg\\lg n factor , still amortized and also in expectation. No worst case polylogarithmic time algorithm is known for the fully dynamic case. This paper is concerned with algorithms for MSTs that are both parallel and dynamic. We review a range of existing such algorithms below. Parallel single-update algorithms. Pawagi and Ramakrishnan  give a parallel algorithm for vertex insertion (with an arbitrary number of adjacent edges) and edge-weight updates in O​(lg⁡(n))𝑂lg𝑛O(\\lg(n)) span but O​(n2​lg⁡(n))𝑂superscript𝑛2lg𝑛O(n^{2}\\lg(n)) work. Varman and Doshi 2 3 improve this to O​(n​lg⁡(n))𝑂𝑛lg𝑛O(n\\lg(n)) work. Jung and Mehlhorn  give an algorithm for vertex insertion in O​(lg⁡(n))𝑂lg𝑛O(\\lg(n)) span, and O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) work. While this bound is optimal for dense insertions, i.e. inserting a vertex adjacent to Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) edges, it is inefficient for sparse graphs. Tsin 1 show how to extend the work of Pawagi and Ramakrishnan  to handle vertex deletions in the same time bounds, thus giving a fully-vertex-dynamic algorithm parallel algorithm in O​(lg⁡(n))𝑂lg𝑛O(\\lg(n)) span and O​(n2​lg⁡(n))𝑂superscript𝑛2lg𝑛O(n^{2}\\lg(n)) work. Das and Ferragina  give algorithms for inserting and deleting edges in O​(lg⁡(m/n)​lg⁡(n))𝑂lg𝑚𝑛lg𝑛O(\\lg(m/n)\\lg(n)) span and O​(n2/3​lg⁡(m/n))𝑂superscript𝑛23lg𝑚𝑛O(n^{2/3}\\lg(m/n)) work. Subsequent improvements by Ferragina  , and Das and Ferragina  improve the span bound to O​(lg⁡(n))𝑂lg𝑛O(\\lg(n)) with the same work bound. Parallel batch-dynamic algorithms. The above are all algorithms for single vertex or edge updates. To take better advantage of parallelism, some algorithms that process batch updates have been developed.\nPawagi  gives an algorithm for batch vertex insertion that inserts ℓℓ\\ell vertices in O​(lg⁡(n)​lg⁡(ℓ))𝑂lg𝑛lgℓO(\\lg(n)\\lg(\\ell)) span and O​(n​ℓ​lg⁡(n)​lg⁡(ℓ))𝑂𝑛ℓlg𝑛lgℓO(n\\ell\\lg(n)\\lg(\\ell)) work. Johnson and Metaxas  give an algorithm for the same problem with O​(lg⁡(n)​lg⁡(ℓ))𝑂lg𝑛lgℓO(\\lg(n)\\lg(\\ell)) span and O​(n​ℓ)𝑂𝑛ℓO(n\\ell) work. Pawagi and Kaser  were the first to give parallel batch-dynamic algorithms for fully-dynamic MSTs. For inserting ℓℓ\\ell independent vertices, inserting ℓℓ\\ell edges, or decreasing the cost of ℓℓ\\ell edges, their algorithms takes O​(lg⁡(n)​lg⁡(ℓ))𝑂lg𝑛lgℓO(\\lg(n)\\lg(\\ell)) span and O​(n​ℓ)𝑂𝑛ℓO(n\\ell) work. Their algorithms for increasing the cost of or deleting ℓℓ\\ell edges, or deleting a set of vertices with total degree ℓℓ\\ell take O​(lg⁡(n)+lg2⁡(ℓ))𝑂lg𝑛superscriptlg2ℓO(\\lg(n)+\\lg^{2}(\\ell)) span and O​(n2​(1+lg2⁡(ℓ)lg⁡(n)))𝑂superscript𝑛21superscriptlg2ℓlg𝑛O(n^{2}(1+\\frac{\\lg^{2}(\\ell)}{\\lg(n)})) work. Shen and Liang  give an algorithm that can insert ℓℓ\\ell edges, modify ℓℓ\\ell edges, or delete a vertex of degree ℓℓ\\ell in O​(lg⁡(n)​lg⁡(ℓ))𝑂lg𝑛lgℓO(\\lg(n)\\lg(\\ell)) span and O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) work. Ferragina and Luccio   give algorithms for handling ℓ=O​(n)ℓ𝑂𝑛\\ell=O(n) edge insertions in O​(lg⁡(n))𝑂lg𝑛O(\\lg(n)) span and O​(n​lg⁡lg⁡lg⁡(n)​lg⁡(m/n))𝑂𝑛lglglg𝑛lg𝑚𝑛O(n\\lg\\lg\\lg(n)\\lg(m/n)) work, and ℓℓ\\ell edge updates in O​(lg⁡(n)​lg⁡(m/n))𝑂lg𝑛lg𝑚𝑛O(\\lg(n)\\lg(m/n)) span and O​(ℓ​n​lg⁡lg⁡lg⁡(n)​lg⁡(m/n))𝑂ℓ𝑛lglglg𝑛lg𝑚𝑛O(\\ell n\\lg\\lg\\lg(n)\\lg(m/n)) work. Lastly, Das and Ferragina’s algorithm  can be extended to the batch case to handle ℓℓ\\ell edge insertions in O((ℓ+lg(m/n)lg(n))O((\\ell+\\lg(m/n)\\lg(n)) span and O​(n2/3​(ℓ+lg⁡(m/n)))𝑂superscript𝑛23ℓlg𝑚𝑛O(n^{2/3}(\\ell+\\lg(m/n))) work. For a thorough and well written survey on the techniques used in many of the above algorithms, see Das and Ferragina . Sliding window dynamic graphs. Dynamic graphs in the sliding window model were studied by Crouch et. al . In\nthe sliding window model, graphs consist of an infinite stream of edges ⟨e1,e2,…⟩subscript𝑒1subscript𝑒2…\\langle e_{1},e_{2},...\\rangle, and the goal of queries is to compute\nsome property of the graph over the edges ⟨et−L+1,et−L+2,…,et⟩subscript𝑒𝑡𝐿1subscript𝑒𝑡𝐿2…subscript𝑒𝑡\\langle e_{t-L+1},e_{t-L+2},\\dots,e_{t}\\rangle, where t𝑡t is the current time and and L𝐿L is the fixed length\nof the window. Crouch et. al showed that several problems, including\nk𝑘k-connectivity, bipartiteness, sparsifiers, spanners, MSFs, and matchings, can be efficiently computed in this model. In particular, several of these results used a data structure for incremental MSF as a key ingredient.\nAll of these results assumed a sequential model of computation.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: per update using dynamic trees   to find the heaviest weight edge on the cycle induced by the new edge and remove it.
