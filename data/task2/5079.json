      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Modal Adapter for Text-Video Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideos are playing an essential role in retaining and disseminating information.\nNowadays, on video platforms like YouTube, users search for the videos they are interested in through natural language queries.\nConsequently, how to return the most relevant videos for a given text query is becoming an increasingly popular research topic in both the industry and academia.\n In the field of text-video retrieval, an important category of the method is pre-training¬†    0  0 that aim at learning better transferable text-video representations.\nA representative work is the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model¬†0, i.e., CLIP, which exhibits great potential in handling this task.\nNumerous works¬†5   6    4 have focused on adapting the CLIP to the text-video retrieval domain.\nAlthough these methods achieve encouraging performance on multiple benchmarks¬†9 [ref]6   6, they need to fully fine-tune the CLIP model.\nAs the current trend of scaling up pre-trained models, this paradigm leads to two issues:\n(1) it has a high risk of overfitting on downstream datasets, and\n(2) it is costly to train and store an entirely new large model for each dataset in practice. An elegant solution to the above-mentioned problems is Adapter¬†, which has achieved great success in natural language processing.\nFor example, it attains comparable performance with fully fine-tuned methods by training only 3.6% parameters.\nIn the text-video retrieval task, there are two modalities and each with a feature encoder. Thus, a straightforward way is to design adapters separately for each encoder.\nHowever, this naive scheme forbids any early cross-modal interaction, and may lead to a sub-optimal solution.\nMeanwhile, introducing the early cross-modal interaction inside the CLIP‚Äôs encoders through adapters is non-trivial.\nSince it requires interactions between every pair of video and text query, this will change the computational complexity from O‚Äã(N)ùëÇùëÅO(N) to O‚Äã(N2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëÅ2O(N^{2}) where NùëÅN is the number of text-video pairs.\nSuch a computational cost is unaffordable in practical applications. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel method named Cross-Modal Adapter.\nThe key idea is to enable early cross-modal interactions by sharing adapters‚Äô weights between two modalities rather than introducing explicit feature-level interactions.\nBy adopting this weight-sharing mechanism, computational complexity can be kept as O‚Äã(N)ùëÇùëÅO(N), since each video or text feature can be obtained independently.\nFurthermore, such a scheme allows an implicit cross-modal interaction, which will facilitate the re-alignment of CLIP‚Äôs vision and language feature spaces for the text-video retrieval task. We conduct extensive experiments on five popular datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT¬†9 MSVD¬†[ref]6, VATEX¬†6, ActivityNet¬†, and DiDeMo ¬†, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nFirst, without bells and whistles, Cross-Modal Adapter attains comparable performance as the fully fine-tuned method¬†5 while optimizes much fewer parameters, e.g., 0.52M v.s. 123.52M on MSR-VTT.\nSecondly, our method saves approximately 30% of training costs.\nLast, our method outperforms prompt-based parameter-efficient methods¬†   by a large margin.\nIn summary, this paper makes three-fold contributions: We propose a parameter-efficient Cross-Modal Adapter for text-video retrieval task. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate adapter-based parameter-efficient transfer learning for the text-video retrieval domain. We propose a weight-sharing mechanism to enable early cross-modal interaction without introducing huge additional computations. Extensive experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce 99.6% of fine-tuned parameters without performance sacrifice compared to the fully fine-tuned method.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: in handling this task.\nNumerous works¬†5   6    4 have focused on adapting the CLIP to the text-video retrieval domain.\nAlthough these methods achieve encouraging performance on multiple benchmarks¬†9 [ref]6   6, they need to fully fine-tune the CLIP model.\nAs the current trend of scaling up pre-trained models, this paradigm leads to two issues:\n(1) it has a high risk of overfitting on downstream\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
