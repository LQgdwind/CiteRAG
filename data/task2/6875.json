      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Residual Classifier for Class Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets  ‚ÄÉImageNet1000¬† is a large-scale dataset with 1,000 classes that includes 1.28 million images for training and 50,000 images for validation. ImageNet100¬† is made up of 100 randomly selected classes from ImageNet1000. CIFAR100¬† consists of 100 classes and each class has 600 images, of which 500 are used as the training set and 100 are used as the test set. Protocols ‚ÄÉFor ImageNet100 and CIFAR100, we validate the proposed method in two widely used CIL protocols:\n(1) B0 (base 0)¬†[ref]37: In this protocol, a model is gradually trained on 5 steps (20 new classes per step), 10 steps (10 new classes per step) and 20 steps (5 new classes per step) with the fixed memory size of 2,000 exemplars.\n(2) B50 (base 50)¬†: A model is trained first on 50 classes. The remaining 50 classes are used for continual learning with 5, 10 classes per step. The memory size is fixed to 20 exemplars per class.\nFor ImageNet1000, we evaluate our method on the protocol¬†[ref]37 where a model is trained on all 1,000 classes with 100 classes per step (10 steps in total). The fixed memory size is 20,000 exemplars.\nWe also carried out the LT-CIL experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100 following the protocol¬†[ref]33.\nTwo classification accuracy are reported. ‚ÄùAvg‚Äù is the average accuracy over incremental steps. ‚ÄùLast‚Äù is the accuracy of the last step.\n Implementation Details ‚ÄÉOur method is implemented with PyTorch¬† and PyCIL¬†.\nThe standard 18-layer ResNet¬† is used as the backbone feature extractor for ImageNet. For CIFAR100, a modified 32-layer ResNet¬†[ref]37 is used instead.\nIn our experiments, the MDT setting follows¬†[ref]37, that of MEC is from¬†[ref]42, and the MAF one is based on¬† in all experiments.\nIntegrating the proposed DRC with the MAF pipeline results in our main method, MAFDRC.\nFor different CIL settings, similar optimization is used.\nIn model adaptation, the SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 is used for training 70 epochs in total. The initial learning rate is set to 0.1 and gradually reduces to zero with a cosine annealing scheduler. In model fusion, the above settings are followed, but training 130 epochs in total.\nFor data augmentation, we follow the practice222https://github.com/G-U-N/ECCV22-FOSTER. in FOSTER¬†[ref]42, where the AutoAugment¬† is used along with the common random cropping and horizontal flip.\nFor a fair comparison, the reported CIL results of all competitors in this work are reproduced with such an augmentation.333We also conduct experiments with conventional data augmentation and report such results in the Supplementary Material.\nIn the LT-CIL scenario, our experimental setting is exactly the same as in¬†[ref]33.\nThe balancing hyperparameters Œ±ùõº{\\alpha} and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta in Eq.¬†13 are set to 0.2 and 4 respectively via cross-validation.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: of which 500 are used as the training set and 100 are used as the test set.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
