      "content": "Paper Title: Combinatorial Gap Theorem and Reductions between Promise CSPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to state our main application of the Main Theorem (Theorem 8) we first give some background on the fixed template CSP (in this subsection) and fixed template Promise CSPs (in Section 1.3). Our contributions are then discussed in Section 1.4. The statements of theorems are informal in that we omit some obvious assumptions and we postpone some definitions to later sections. The fixed template finite domain CSP is a framework for expressing many computational problems such as various versions of logical satisfiability, graph\ncoloring, and systems of equations.\nA template can be specified as a relational structure 𝐀=(A;R1,…,Rl)𝐀𝐴subscript𝑅1…subscript𝑅𝑙{\\mathbf{A}}=(A;R_{1},\\dots,R_{l}), where A𝐴A is a finite set called the domain and each Rjsubscript𝑅𝑗R_{j} is a relation of some arity arjsubscriptar𝑗\\operatorname{ar}_{j}, i.e., a subset of Aar⁡jsuperscript𝐴ar𝑗A^{\\operatorname{ar}j}. The CSP over 𝐀𝐀{\\mathbf{A}}, denoted CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}), is (in its search version) the problem of finding an assignment V→A→𝑉𝐴V\\to A that satisfies given local constraints as above, with the restriction that each constraint is of the form {f∈AW:(f​(w1),f​(w2),…,f​(war⁡i))∈Ri}conditional-set𝑓superscript𝐴𝑊𝑓subscript𝑤1𝑓subscript𝑤2…𝑓subscript𝑤ar𝑖subscript𝑅𝑖\\{f\\in A^{W}:(f(w_{1}),f(w_{2}),\\dots,f(w_{\\operatorname{ar}i}))\\in R_{i}\\}, where 1≤i≤l1𝑖𝑙1\\leq i\\leq l and W={w1,…,war⁡i}⊆V𝑊subscript𝑤1…subscript𝑤ar𝑖𝑉W=\\{w_{1},\\dots,w_{\\operatorname{ar}i}\\}\\subseteq V. In the decision version of CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}) we only want to decide whether such an assignment exists. Our results work for both versions and we do not carefully distinguish between them in the introduction. Note that for 𝐀𝐀{\\mathbf{A}} consisting of all relations on A𝐴A of arity m𝑚m, the CSP over 𝐀𝐀{\\mathbf{A}} is exactly the m𝑚m-CSP over A𝐴A. By choosing appropriate structures with a two-element domain we obtain various versions of satisfiability, such as k𝑘k-SAT, HORN-k𝑘k-SAT, NAE-k𝑘k-SAT, etc. Important class of examples on larger domains is the CSP over 𝐊nsubscript𝐊𝑛{\\mathbf{K}}_{n}, the set [n]={1,…,n}delimited-[]𝑛1…𝑛[n]=\\{1,\\dots,n\\} together with the disequality relation, which is (essentially) the n𝑛n-coloring problem for graphs. More generally, the CSP over 𝐍𝐀𝐄nksuperscriptsubscript𝐍𝐀𝐄𝑛𝑘{\\mathbf{NAE}}_{n}^{k}, the set [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] together with the k𝑘k-ary not-all-equal relation, is the n𝑛n-coloring problem for k𝑘k-uniform hypergraphs. We refer to surveys in [ref]33 for more details and examples, as well as many variants of the fixed template CSP framework. In , Feder and Vardi conjectured that each CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}) is either solvable in polynomial time or NP-complete. Their conjecture inspired a very active research program in the last 20 years [ref]9 [ref]33, which culminated in a recent confirmation of the conjecture obtained independently by Bulatov [ref]17 and Zhuk  . A fundamental theorem, which initiated a rapid development of the subject, crystallized in the series of papers by Jeavons et al., e.g.  . It gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a polynomial-time reduction between two CSPs in terms of multivariate functions that preserve relations of the templates, called polymorphisms (see Section 4). Denoting Pol⁡(𝐀)Pol𝐀\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}) the set of all polymorphisms of 𝐀𝐀{\\mathbf{A}}, the theorem can be stated as follows. If Pol⁡(𝐀1)⊆Pol⁡(𝐀2)Polsubscript𝐀1Polsubscript𝐀2\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1})\\subseteq\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2}), then CSP⁡(𝐀2)CSPsubscript𝐀2\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2}) is reducible to CSP⁡(𝐀1)CSPsubscript𝐀1\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1}). This theorem was later made more applicable in  and then in  by replacing the inclusion by weaker requirements, thus providing more reductions. A modern formulation is in terms of minion homomorphisms (see Section 4) as follows. If Pol⁡(𝐀1)Polsubscript𝐀1\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1}) has a minion homomorphism to Pol⁡(𝐀2)Polsubscript𝐀2\\operatorname{Pol}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2}), then CSP⁡(𝐀2)CSPsubscript𝐀2\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{2}) is reducible to CSP⁡(𝐀1)CSPsubscript𝐀1\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}_{1}). This theorem has a quite simple proof but it is surprisingly powerful: it follows from Bulatov’s and Zhuk’s complexity classification [ref]17  that for any CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}) either CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}) is solvable in polynomial time for every 𝐁𝐁{\\mathbf{B}}, Theorem 5 provides a reduction from CSP⁡(𝐁)CSP𝐁\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{B}}) to CSP⁡(𝐀)CSP𝐀\\operatorname{CSP}({\\mathbf{A}}). In other words, NP-hard CSPs form the largest equivalence class of the preoder given by the reducibility implied by minion homomorphisms.\nIn this sense, Theorem 5 provides a single source of hardness and, in fact, the proof of this theorem gives a simple reduction from any CSP to any NP-hard CSP (assuming P ≠\\neq NP). The theorem is interesting (but substantially weaker) on the algorithmic side as well; for instance, it gives a reduction of any width 1 CSP  to HORN-3-SAT (see  ).\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: the set [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] together with the k𝑘k-ary not-all-equal relation, is the n𝑛n-coloring problem for k𝑘k-uniform hypergraphs.
