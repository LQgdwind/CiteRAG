      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks through Variance Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples  , which are indistinguishable from legitimate ones by adding small perturbations, but lead to incorrect model prediction. In recent years, it has garnered an increasing interest to craft adversarial examples    [ref]1 , because it not only can identify the model vulnerability  [ref]1, but also can help improve the model robustness   2 7.\nMoreover, adversarial examples also exhibit good transferability across the models  , \\iethe adversaries crafted for one model can still fool other models, which enables black-box attacks in the real-world applications without any knowledge of the target model. In the white-box setting that the attacker can access the architecture and parameters of the target model, existing adversarial attacks have exhibited great effectiveness   [ref]1 but with low transferability, especially for models equipped with defense mechanisms 2 4  . To address this issue, recent works focus on improving the transferability of adversarial examples by advanced gradient calculation (\\egMomentum, Nesterov’s accelerated gradient, \\etc) [ref]6 [ref]18,\nattacking multiple models , or adopting various input transformations (\\egrandom resizing and padding, translation, scale, admix, \\etc) 5  [ref]18 3. However, there still exists a big gap between white-box attacks and transfer-based black-box attacks with regard to attack performance. In this work, we propose a novel variance tuning iterative gradient-based method to enhance the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. Different from existing gradient-based methods that perturb the input in the gradient direction of the loss function, or momentum iterative gradient-based methods that accumulate a velocity vector in the gradient direction, at each iteration our method additionally tunes the current gradient with the gradient variance in the neighborhood of the previous data point. The key idea is to reduce the variance of the gradient at each iteration so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor local optima during the search process.\nEmpirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art momentum-based adversarial attacks [ref]6 [ref]18, the proposed method could achieve significantly higher success rates for black-box models, meanwhile maintain similar success rates for white-box models. For instance, the proposed method improves the success rates of the momentum based attack [ref]6 for more than 20%percent2020\\% using adversarial examples generated on the Inc-v3 model 0. The adversarial examples crafted by various attacks are illustrated in Figure 1. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we combine variance tuning with several gradient-based attacks for ensemble models  and integrate these attacks with various input transformations 5  [ref]18. Extensive experiments show that our integrated method could remarkably improve the attack transferability. In addition, we compare our attack method with the state-of-the-art attack methods [ref]6 5  [ref]18 against nine advanced defense methods  4 6     . Our integrated method yields an average success rate of 67.0%percent67.067.0\\%, which outperforms the baselines by a large margin of 17.5%percent17.517.5\\% in the single model setting, and an average success rate of 90.1%percent90.190.1\\%, which outperforms the baselines by a clear margin of 6.6%percent6.66.6\\% in the multi-model setting.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: indistinguishable from legitimate ones by adding small perturbations, but lead to incorrect model prediction.
