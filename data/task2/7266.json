Given a system G=(X,Σ,δ,X0)𝐺𝑋Σ𝛿subscript𝑋0G=(X,\\Sigma,\\delta,X_{0}), a projection map P𝑃P w.r.t. a set ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} of observable events, a set XS⊆Xsubscript𝑋𝑆𝑋X_{S}\\subseteq X of secret states, and a non-negative integer K𝐾K,\nG𝐺G is said to be strongly K𝐾K-step opaque (K𝐾K-SSO)333In this paper, the terminology “K𝐾K-SSO” is the acronym of both “strong K𝐾K-step opacity” and “strongly K𝐾K-step opaque”, which depends on the context. w.r.t.

In plain words, K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 1 implies that in the last at most K𝐾K observable steps, an intruder cannot make sure whether some secret states have been visited.\nNote that, the notion of K𝐾K-SSO studied in [ref]46 is equivalent to Definition 1 when system G𝐺G is deterministic.\nCurrently, the most efficient verification algorithm for K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 1 has been designed in our previous work [ref]17. Recently, in  we proposed another type of K𝐾K-SSO notion (see Definition 2.25 therein), which can be regarded as strengthening of SCSO notion (see Definition 5 below).\nNow we recall the notion of K𝐾K-SSO formulated by Definition 2.25 in . Given a system G=(X,Σ,δ,X0)𝐺𝑋Σ𝛿subscript𝑋0G=(X,\\Sigma,\\delta,X_{0}), a projection map P𝑃P w.r.t. a set ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} of observable events, a set XS⊆Xsubscript𝑋𝑆𝑋X_{S}\\subseteq X of secret states, and a non-negative integer K𝐾K,\nG𝐺G is said to be strongly K𝐾K-step opaque (K𝐾K-SSO) w.r.t. ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} and XSsubscript𝑋𝑆X_{S} if By Definitions 2 and 5, it is not difficult to see that K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 2 reduces to SCSO in Definition 5 when string t=ϵ𝑡italic-ϵt=\\epsilon.\nFurther, K𝐾K-SSO in Definition 2 can be directly checked using our concurrent-composition structure presented in , see the Theorem 2.152.152.15 of  for details. Next, in this subsection we propose another new notion of K𝐾K-SSO, which is weaker than both two notions of K𝐾K-SSO proposed in  and  but stronger than standard K𝐾K-SO. Given a system G=(X,Σ,δ,X0)𝐺𝑋Σ𝛿subscript𝑋0G=(X,\\Sigma,\\delta,X_{0}), a projection map P𝑃P w.r.t. a set ΣosubscriptΣ𝑜\\Sigma_{o} of observable events, a set XS⊆Xsubscript𝑋𝑆𝑋X_{S}\\subseteq X of secret states, and a non-negative integer K𝐾K,\nG𝐺G is said to be strongly K𝐾K-step opaque (K𝐾K-SSO) w.r.t.
