      "content": "Paper Title: Dataless Quadratic Neural Networks for the Maximum Independent Set Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n1) Exact and Heuristic Solvers: Exact approaches for 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-𝗁𝖺𝗋𝖽𝗁𝖺𝗋𝖽\\mathsf{hard} problems typically rely on branch-and-bound global optimization techniques. However, exact approaches suffer from poor scalability, which limits their uses in large MIS problems .\nThis limitation has spurred the development of efficient approximation algorithms and heuristics.\nFor instance, the well-known NetworkX library  implements a heuristic procedure for solving the MIS problem .\nThese polynomial-time heuristics often incorporate a mix of sub-procedures, including greedy algorithms, local search sub-routines, and genetic algorithms .\nHowever, such heuristics generally cannot theoretically guarantee that the resulting solution is within a small factor of optimality.\nIn fact, inapproximability results have been established for the MIS problem [ref]23. Among existing MIS heuristics, ReduMIS  has emerged as the leading approach.\nThe ReduMIS framework contains two primary components: (i) an iterative application of various graph reduction techniques (e.g., the linear programming (LP) reduction method in ) with a stopping rule based on the non-applicability of these techniques; and (ii) an evolutionary algorithm. The ReduMIS algorithm initiates with a pool of independent sets and evolves them through multiple rounds.\nIn each round, a selection procedure identifies favorable nodes by executing graph partitioning, which clusters the graph nodes into disjoint clusters and separators to enhance the solution.\nIn contrast, our 𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍\\mathsf{Quant}-𝖭𝖾𝗍𝖭𝖾𝗍\\mathsf{Net} approach does not require such complex algorithmic operations (e.g., solution combination operation, community detection, and local search algorithms for solution improvement) as used in ReduMIS. More importantly, ReduMIS and ILP solvers scale with the number of nodes and the number of edges (which constraints their application on highly dense graphs), whereas 𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍\\mathsf{Quant}-𝖭𝖾𝗍𝖭𝖾𝗍\\mathsf{Net} only scales w.r.t. the number nodes, as will be demonstrated in our experimental results. 2) Data-Driven Learning-Based Solvers:\nAs mentioned in Section 1, data-driven approaches for MIS problems can be classified into SL and RL methods.\nA notable SL method is proposed in , which combines several components including graph reductions , Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) , guided tree search, and a solution improvement local search algorithm [ref]26.\nThe GCN is trained on benchmark graphs using their solutions as ground truth labels, enabling the learning of probability maps for the inclusion of each vertex in the optimal solution. Then, a subset of ReduMIS subroutines is used to improve their solution.\nWhile the work in  reported on-par results to ReduMIS, it was later shown by [ref]12 that replacing the GCN output with random values performs similarly to using the trained GCN network.\nRecently, DIFUSCO was introduced in , an approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with diffusion models  to create a graph-based diffusion denoiser.\nDIFUSCO formulates the MIS problem in the discrete domain and trains a diffusion model to improve a single or a pool of solutions. On the other hand, RL-based methods have achieved more success in solving the MIS problem when compared to SL methods. In the work of , a Deep Q-Network (DQN) is combined with graph embeddings, facilitating the discrimination of vertices based on their influence on the solution and ensuring scalability to larger instances. Meanwhile, the study presented in  introduces the Learning What to Defer (LwD) method, an unsupervised deep RL solver resembling tree search, where vertices are iteratively assigned to the independent set. Their model is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) 0. The work in 1 introduces DIMES, which combines a compact continuous space to parameterize the distribution of potential solutions and a meta-learning framework to facilitate the effective initialization of model parameters during the fine-tuning stage that is required for each graph. It is worth noting that the majority of SL and RL methods are data-dependent in the sense that they require the training of a separate network for each dataset of graphs. These data-dependent methods exhibit limited generalization performance when applied to out-of-distribution graph data. This weak generalization stems from the need to train a different network for each graph dataset.\nIn contrast, our dQNN approach differs from SL- and RL-based methods in that it does not rely on any training datasets. Instead, our dQNN approach utilizes a simple yet effective graph-encoded continuous objective function, which is defined solely in terms of the connectivity of a given graph. 3) Dataless Differentiable Methods: The most related work to ours is 2, which introduces dataless neural networks (dNNs) tailored for the MIS problem.\nNotably, their method operates without the need for training data and relies on n𝑛n trainable parameters.\nTheir proposed methodology advocates using a ReLU-based continuous objective to solve the MIS problem. However, to scale up and improve their method, graph partitioning and local search algorithms were employed. 4) Discrete Sampling Solvers: In recent studies, researchers have explored the integration of energy-based models with parallel implementations of simulated annealing to address combinatorial optimization problems 3 without relying on any training data. For example, in tackling the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem, Sun et al. 4 proposed a solver that combines (i) Path Auxiliary Sampling 5 and (ii) the binary quadratic integer program in (2). However, unlike 𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍𝖰𝗎𝖺𝗇𝗍\\mathsf{Quant}-𝖭𝖾𝗍𝖭𝖾𝗍\\mathsf{Net}, these approaches entail prolonged sequential runtime and require fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters. Moreover, the energy models utilized in this method for addressing the MIS problem may generate binary vectors that violate the “no edges” constraint inherent to the MIS problem. Consequently, a post-processing procedure becomes necessary.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: heuristics generally cannot theoretically guarantee that the resulting solution is within a small factor of optimality.\nIn fact, inapproximability results have been established for the MIS problem [ref]23.
