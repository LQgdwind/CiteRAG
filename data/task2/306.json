      "content": "Paper Title: The Impact of Heterogeneity and Geometry on the Proof Complexity of Random SatisfiabilityThis work is partially funded by the project Scale-Free Satisfiability (project no. 416061626) of the German Research Foundation (DFG).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPropositional satisfiability (SAT) is arguably among the most-studied\nproblems for both theoretical and practical research. Nonetheless,\nthe gap between theory and practice is huge. In theory, SAT is the\nprototypical hard problem and hardness of other problems is shown via\nreductions from SAT. Achieving even a running time of O‚Äã(2c‚Äãn)ùëÇsuperscript2ùëêùëõO(2^{cn}) for\nany c<1ùëê1c<1 and nùëõn variables would be a major breakthrough and a\nsomewhat surprising one at that. On the contrary, reductions\nto SAT are used to solve various problems appearing in\npractice, as state-of-the-art SAT solvers can easily handle industrial\ninstances with millions of variables. This theory‚Äìpractice gap does not come from the lack of a sufficiently\nprecise theoretical analysis of modern SAT solvers. They are actually\nprovably slow on most instances, i.e., drawing an instance uniformly\nat random yields a hard instance with probability tending to¬†111 for\nn‚Üí‚àû‚Üíùëõn\\to\\infty, if the clause-variable ratio is not too low or way too\nhigh¬† . Instead, the discrepancy comes\nfrom the fact that industrial instances have properties that make them\neasier than worst-case instances. In 2014, Vardi [ref]59 wrote that\n‚Äúwe have no understanding of why the specific sets of\nheuristics employed by modern SAT solvers are so effective in\npractice‚Äù and that we need this understanding to successfully\nadvance SAT solving further. In recent years, scientists have been studying properties of\nindustrial SAT instances to gain this understanding. By modeling SAT\ninstances as graphs, e.g., with edges indicating inclusion of\nvariables in clauses, one can benefit from the extensive research\nconducted in the field of network science. Two properties commonly\nobserved in real-world networks are heterogeneity and locality.\nHeterogeneity refers to the degree distribution, meaning that\nvertices have strongly varying degrees. In fact, one usually observes\na heavy-tailed distribution with many vertices of low degree and few\nvertices of high degree. A common assumption is a power-law\ndistribution¬†, where the number of vertices of\ndegree kùëòk is roughly proportional to k‚àíŒ≤superscriptùëòùõΩk^{-\\beta}. The constant\nŒ≤ùõΩ\\beta is called the power-law exponent. Locality\nrefers to the fact that edges tend to connect vertices that are close\nin the sense that they remain well connected even when ignoring their\ndirect connection. This can also be seen as having strong community\nstructures, with high connectivity within communities and loose ties\nbetween communities. With respect to these two properties, industrial SAT instances are\nsimilar to real-world networks. In many cases, the variable\nfrequencies are heterogeneous¬† and there is a high\nlevel of locality¬†. The latter is often measured in\nterms of modularity. Inspired by network science, researchers have\nstudied models that resemble industrial instances with respect to\nthese properties. Particularly, Ans√≥tegui et al.¬†\nintroduced a power-law SAT model for heterogeneous instances, which\nhas been theoretically studied in terms of satisfiability\nthresholds¬†4 5 3.\nA different model with heterogeneous degree distributions has been\nstudied by Cooper et¬†al. 2, Ans√≥tegui et¬†al. , and Omelchenko and Bulatov .\nMoreover, Gir√°ldez-Cru and Levy 0 introduced a model in which variable\nweights lead to heterogeneity while an underlying geometry facilitates\nlocality. Comparing this to network models, the former\nmodel¬† is the SAT-variant of Chung-Lu\ngraphs¬†0 9. The latter¬†0\nis based on the popularity-similarity model¬†, which\nis closely related to hyperbolic random graphs¬†4 and\ngeometric inhomogeneous random graphs¬†8. Besides serving as somewhat realistic benchmarks for SAT\ncompetitions¬†9, these SAT models can be used to study\nsolver behavior depending on heterogeneity and locality. One can\nexperimentally observe that a high level of heterogeneity improves the\nperformance of SAT solvers that also perform well on industrial\ninstances¬† 3. Moreover, locality seems\nvery beneficial as solvers appear to implicitly use the locality of a\ngiven instance¬†0. This coincides with the findings of\nexperiments on actual industrial instances that show that the locality\n(measured using modularity) of an instance is a good predictor for\nsolver performance¬†  . Up to date, there are no theoretical results supporting these\nexperimental observations. On the contrary, it has been shown that\ninstances generated by the community attachment\nmodel¬†8, which enforces a community structure, are\nhard for modern SAT solvers¬†9. With this paper, we\nprovide a theoretical foundation that matches the observations in\npractice by studying the proof complexity of kùëòk-SAT instances (for\nconstant kùëòk) drawn from the power-law SAT model, and from a very\ngeneral model with underlying geometry.\nThe former was introduced by Ans√≥tegui et al.¬†,\nthe latter is a generalization of the geometric model by\nGir√°ldez-Cru and Levy 0 in the same way as geometric inhomogeneous random\ngraphs¬†8 are a generalization of hyperbolic random\ngraphs¬†4.\nOur findings are that heterogeneous instances are hard asymptotically\nalmost surely111Asymptotically almost surely (a.‚Äâa.‚Äâs.)\nrefers to a probability that tends to 111 for n‚Üí‚àû‚Üíùëõn\\to\\infty.\nWith high probability (w.‚Äâh.‚Äâp.) refers to the stronger\nrequirement that the probability is in 1‚àíO‚Äã(1/n)1ùëÇ1ùëõ1-O(1/n). Additionally, we say that an event holds with overwhelming probability, if for every c>0ùëê0c>0 it holds with\nprobability at least 1‚àíO‚Äã(n‚àíc)1ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùëê1-O(n^{-c}). in that modern\nSAT solvers require superpolynomial or even exponential running time\nto refute unsatisfiable instances. On the contrary, instances with a\nhigh level of locality facilitated by an underlying geometry are\na.‚Äâa.‚Äâs.¬†easy to solve. Our results focus on unsatisfiable instances,\ni.e., on the case where a solver has to prove that no satisfying\nassignment exists. This is typically much harder than finding a\nsatisfying assignment, making the unsatisfiable regime arguably more\nrelevant. Besides these results on SAT, we provide insights on the\ncomplexity of weighted higher-order Voronoi diagrams in higher\ndimensions, which is of independent interest. The power-law and geometric models both mimic specific properties\nobserved in industrial instances while trying to make as little\nadditional assumptions as possible. Though this makes the resulting\ninstances arguably more realistic than, e.g., instances drawn\nuniformly at random, we want to stress that even the geometric model\nis far from a perfect representation of industrial instances. Thus,\nour results do not claim to completely explain the efficiency of\nmodern SAT solvers on industrial instances. However, to the best of\nour knowledge, we provide the first theoretical result that links a\nhigh level of locality to provably more tractable instances, which we\nbelieve to be a first step towards closing the theory‚Äìpractice gap.\n\nReference markers found: [59]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]59: ratio is not too low or way too\nhigh¬† . Instead, the discrepancy comes\nfrom the fact that industrial instances have properties that make them\neasier than worst-case instances.
