      "content": "Paper Title: Sparsely Changing Latent States for Prediction and Planning in Partially Observable Domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen does the meeting start? Where are my car keys? Is the stove turned off?\nHumans memorize lots of information over extended periods of time.\nIn contrast, classical planning methods assume that the state of the environment is fully observable at every time step [ref]1.\nThis assumption does not hold for realistic applications, where generative processes are only indirectly observable or entities are occluded.\nPlanning in such Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) is a challenging problem, because suitably-structured memory is required for decision making. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are often used to deal with partial observability [ref]2  .\nThey encode past observations by maintaining latent states, which are iteratively updated.\nHowever, continuously updating the latent state causes past information to quickly ‚Äúwash out‚Äù.\nLong-Short Term Memory networks (LSTM, ) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU, ) deal with this problem by using internal gates.\nHowever, they cannot leave their latent states completely unchanged, because small amounts of information continuously leak through the sigmoidal gating functions.\nAdditionally, inputs typically need to pass through the latent state to affect the output, making it hard to disentangle observable from unobservable information within their latent states. Our hypothesis is that many generative latent factors in the physical world are constant over extended periods of time.\nThus, there might not be the need to update memory at every time step.\nFor example, consider dropping an object:\nIf the drop-off point as well as some latent generative factors, such as gravity and aerodynamic object properties, are known, iteratively predicting the fall can be reasonably accomplished by a non-recurrent process.\nSimilarly, when an agent picks up a key, it is sufficient to memorize that the key is inside their pocket.\nHowever, latent factors typically do change significantly and systematically at particular points in time.\nFor example, the aerodynamic properties of an object change drastically when the falling object shatters on the floor, and the location of the key changes systematically when the agent removes it from their pocket. These observations are related to assumptions used in causality research.\nA common assumption is that the generative process of a system is composed of autonomous mechanisms that describe causal relationships between the system‚Äôs variables  [ref]8 .\nWhen considering Markov Decision Processes, it has been proposed that these mechanisms tend to interact sparsely in time and locally in space  .\nCausal models aim at creating dependencies between variables only when there exists a causal relationship between them, in order to improve generalization [ref]8.\nUpdating the latent state of a model in every time step, on the other hand, induces the prior assumption that the generative latent state typically depends on all previous inputs.\nThus, by suitably segmenting the dependencies of the latent variables over time, one can expect improved generalization across spurious temporal dependencies. Very similar propositions have been made for human cognition.\nHumans tend to perceive their stream of sensory information in terms of events     .\nEvent Segmentation Theory (EST) \npostulates a set of active event models, which encode event-respective aspects over extended periods of time and switch individually at event transitions.\nTo learn about the transitions and consolidate associated latent event encodings, measurements of surprise and other significant changes in predictive model activities, as well as latent state stability assumptions, have been proposed as suitable inductive event segmentation biases       . Explicit relations to causality have been put forward in . In accordance to EST and our sparsely changing latent factor assumption, we introduce Gated L0subscriptùêø0L_{0} Regularized Dynamics (GateL0RD).\nGateL0RD applies L0subscriptùêø0L_{0}-regularized gates, inducing an inductive learning bias to encode piecewise constant latent state dynamics.\nGateL0RD thus becomes able to memorize task-relevant information over long periods of time.\nThe main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows.\n(i)¬†We introduce a stochastic, rectified gating function for controlling latent state updates, which we regularize towards sparse updates using the L0subscriptùêø0L_{0} norm.\n(ii)¬†We demonstrate that our network performs as good or better than state-of-the-art RNNs for prediction or control in various partially-observable problems with piecewise constant dynamics.\n(iii)¬†We also show that the inductive bias leads to better generalization under distributional shifts.\n(iv)¬†Lastly, we show that the latent states can be easily interpreted by humans.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: turned off?\nHumans memorize lots of information over extended periods of time.\nIn contrast, classical planning methods assume that the state of the environment is fully observable at every time step [ref]1.\nThis assumption does not hold for realistic applications, where generative processes are only indirectly observable or entities are occluded.\nPlanning in such Partially Observable Markov\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
