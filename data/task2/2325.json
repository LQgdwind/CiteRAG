      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Off-Policy Evaluation Approach for General Value Function\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe value function, which represents the expected accumulation of reward , serves as a reliable performance metric of policy in the reinforcement learning (RL) tasks  ,\nIn many RL applications, however, looking at only the value function is not enough. For example, in the risk-sensitive domains such as health care and financial assets, the variance of \"reward-to-go\" rather than the value function, i.e., the mean of \"reward-to-go\", is a more suitable performance metric. As another example, to obtain a variance-reduced or bias-reduced policy gradient estimator [ref]14 6 , in addition to the value function, the information of \"gradient of value function\" is also required. Moreover, in continuous control domain with differentiable and deterministic policy, the computation of policy gradient is only possible through \"action/state-value gradient\"   , etc. All the aforementioned metrics can be viewed as predicative knowledge of certain cumulative \"signals\" (possibly high-dimensional, e.g., the gradient of value function), and thus naturally fall into the framework of forward GVFs (refers to forward general value functions) 4  . One typical approach to evaluate GVFs, is to learn from samples that pre-collected from one or more behavior policies, which yields an off-policy method. In practice, multiple forward GVFs are usually evaluated jointly at the same time due to their interrelationships 4 . In contrast to forward GVFs defined based on predictive knowledge, the backward GVF represents retrospective knowledge, which captures the accumulation of signals from the past to the present time . Although the concept of the backward GVF has not been formally proposed until very recently , it is rooted in a number of important RL applications such as anomaly detection , emphatic weight learning   and evaluation of gradient of logarithmic stationary distribution  6 . Differently from the forward GVF, for which the Bellman operator can be defined independently from the sampling distribution   , the Bellman operator of the backward GVF is only valid if the sampling exactly follows the on-policy stationary distribution . Due to such a reason, off-policy evaluation of the backward GVF is much more challenging than that of the forward GVF. In previous studies, the gradient temporal difference (GTD) learning  , one of the most popular off-policy methods in value function evaluation, has been adopted to solve both the forward and backward GVF evaluation problems 4  . GTD adopts the mean squared projected Bellman error (MSPBE) as its optimization objective and takes the expectation over the behavior policy, which does not exactly reflect the desirable evaluation under the target policy. As a result, GTD can encounter serious issues in GVF evaluation problems. First, the optimal point to which GTD converges can be far away from the ground truth value of GVFs. It becomes worse when multiple GVFs are evaluated simultaneously, because the error of one GVF evaluation can be further amplified across other GVFs’ evaluation due to their inherent correlations.\nIn the literature, no provable bound has been established on such an error, which can, in fact, be unbounded for some cases (see [19, Example 1]). Second, for high-dimensional GVFs evaluations, the landscape geometry of the GTD objective function can be ill-conditioned , which could slow down the convergence of GTD significantly. As demonstrated by our empirical results in Section 5, GTD can suffer from both the large estimation error and the slow convergence rate, which further suggests that GTD may not be a good choice for GVFs evaluation tasks. This motivates our paper to address the following question:\n Can we design a new off-policy approach for multiple interrelated and high-dimensional GVFs evaluation problems, which is guaranteed to converge fast and converge to the ground truth GVFs? Our Contributions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of evaluating multiple interrelated GVFs jointly. Rather than studying different GVFs on a case-by-case basis, we explore the class of \"GVFs with causal filtering\", which captures a common structural feature shared by GVFs in a wide range of RL applications (see Appendix B). (a) We prove that both forward and backward GVFs with causal filtering are the unique fixed point of their corresponding general Bellman operator (GBO) (defined for multiple high-dimensional GVFs), which is shown to have a contraction property with respect to a properly constructed norm metric.\n(b) Based on such a property of GVFs, we propose a new algorithm GenTD to solve off-policy GVFs evaluation problem. GenTD introduces a density ratio to adjust the behavior distribution and further incorporates a policy-agnostic approach GenDICE/GradientDICE   for estimating the density ratio jointly with GVF evaluation. (c) In the linear function approximation setting, we show that GenTD converges to the globally optimal point at the rate of 𝒪​(1/T)𝒪1𝑇\\mathcal{O}(1/T), with conditional number independent from the dimension of GVFs. Such a result implies that GenTD learns multiple interrelated possibly high-dimensional GVFs as efficiently as TD learning for a single canonical scalar value function. (d) We further show that unlike GTD, GenTD are guaranteed to converge to the ground truth GVFs as long as the function expressive power is sufficiently large. To our best knowledge, GenTD is the first off-policy GVF evaluation algorithm that has gound truth guarantee. (e) Our experiments further demonstrate that GenTD converges much faster than GTD, and more importantly, converges to ground truth, whereas GTD can stay far way from the ground truth GVF value. Related Work. The forward GVF was first introduced in 4 to represent a set of accumulation of general signals with possibly time-varying discount factors. The forward GVF was later used to represent a set of interrelated predictions    . It has been observed that some RL metrics such as variance, gradient of value function, state/action value gradient can also be viewed as forward GVFs  [ref]14 6   4    . In previous works, both TD learning and GTD have been used to evaluate forward GVFs in the on- and off-policy settings 4 , respectively. A more comprehensive review of studies of forward GVFs has been provided in .\nThe backward GVF was formally defined in . Some previous works have also considered metrics that can be represented as accumulations of signals in the reverse time direction, such as emphatic weighting, page ranking cost, and derivative of logarithmic stationary distribution    8 . Another track of research has focused on evaluation of a general scalar function in the off-policy setting  9 , whereas the focus of this paper is on the evaluation of multiple high-dimensional GVFs. The theoretical studies of off-policy GVFs evaluation algorithms are rather limited. So far, only the asymptotic convergence guarantee (without the convergence rate characterization) of GTD has been established in both the forward and backward GVFs evaluation settings  . The convergence rate of GTD has only been established in 7    3  for the simple canonical value function evaluation setting, which is a special case of forward GVFs. However, as pointed out in   , the optimal point of GTD may suffer from possibly unbounded approximation error, which is not desirable in practice. In contrast, we propose a new off-policy GVFs evaluation algorithm, which can solve a wide range of forward and backward GVFs evaluation problems, with convergence rate characterization and guaranteed optimality with respect to the ground truth GVF value.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: rather than the value function, i.e., the mean of \"reward-to-go\", is a more suitable performance metric.
