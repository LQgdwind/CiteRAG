      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Periodic Averaging: A Practical Approach to Reducing Communication in Distributed Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nILSVRC 2012 (ImageNet) [ref]35 is a much larger dataset than CIFAR-10.\nThere are a total of 1,281,167 images in 1000 classes for training, and 50,000 images for validation.\nThe images vary in dimensions and resolution. The average resolution is 469x387 pixels.\nNormally the images are resized to 256x256 pixels for neural networks. We first train a ResNet50 [ref]36 on ILSVRC 2012.\nWe apply the linear scaling rule and the gradual warmup techniques proposed in\nliterature  for all versions of SGD in our experiments.\nSpecifically, the first 888 epochs are warmup – the learning rate is initialized to 0.10.10.1 and is\nincreased by 0.10.10.1 in each epoch until the epoch 888.\nStarting from the epoch 888, the learning rate is fixed at 0.80.80.8 until epoch 303030 when the learning rate is decreased to 0.080.080.08.\nAt epoch 606060, the learning rate is further decreased to 0.0080.0080.008.\nThe total number of epochs is 909090.\nFor ADPSGD and CPSGD, the periodic averaging is applied after the warmup phase (i.e., the first 888 epochs in ADPSGD and CPSGD are the same as in FULLSGD).\nFor ADPSGD, Algorithm 2 is applied with pi​n​i​t=4subscript𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡4p_{init}=4, Ks=0.2​Ksubscript𝐾𝑠0.2𝐾K_{s}=0.2K where K𝐾K is the total number of training iterations.\nFor QSGD, the gradient quantization is also started after the warmup phase. Figure 7 shows the training loss and the top-1 validation accuracy achieved by different versions. (We evaluate the accuracy on the validation data in ILSVRC 2012).\nThe validation images are resize to 256×256256256256\\times 256 in which the center 224×224224224224\\times 224 crop are used for validation. (This is the same as in the original ResNet paper [ref]36).\nWe can see that our ADPSGD achieves smaller training loss and higher validation accuracy than CPSGD with p=8𝑝8p=8.\nThe average averaging period in our ADPSGD is 10.5510.5510.55, which means that our ADPSGD achieves better convergence than CPSGD while requiring less communication.\nCompared with QSGD, our ADPSGD also achieves smaller training loss and higher validation accuracy while requiring less communication.\nCompared with FULLSGD, our ADSGD achieves slightly larger training loss but almost the same test accuracy.\nThe dashed line in Figure 7b is the accuracy achieved by small-batch SGD – we train ResNet50 with batch size 256256256 and initial learning rate 0.10.10.1, and the best accuracy we achieved is 75.458%percent75.45875.458\\%.\nThe validation error (i.e., 1−a​c​c​u​r​a​c​y1𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦1-accuracy) reported in the original ResNet paper [ref]36 is 24.7%percent24.724.7\\%, which is close to the accuracy we achieved, so we use 75.458%percent75.45875.458\\% as the baseline accuracy for comparison.\nWe can see in Figure 7b that the best accuracy achieved by our ADPSGD is quite close to the baseline. Figure 7c shows the execution time of different versions.\nAbout 25%percent2525\\% of total execution time of FULLSGD is spent on communication with 100Gbps connection, and the ratio increases to 56%percent5656\\% with 10Gbps connection.\nOur ADPSGD effectively reduces the communication overhead and achieves 1.27​x1.27𝑥1.27x and 1.951.951.95x speedups against\nFULLSGD with 100Gbps and 10Gbps connections, respectively.\nThe speedups of 16-node ADPSGD over single-node vanilla SGD are 15.7515.7515.75x and 14.9414.9414.94x with 100Gbps and 10Gbps connections respectively, indicating that our ADPSGD achieves linear speedup across 16 nodes. We also train an AlexNet [ref]38 on ILSVRC 2012.\nWe use the same warmup and learning rate schedule as for ResNet50 above.\nThe configurations for ADPSGD is also the same.\nFigure 8 shows the results of training AlexNet on ImageNet dataset.\nThe dashed line in Figure 8b shows the baseline top-1 accuracy (57.08%percent57.0857.08\\%) achieved by single-node training (i.e., with batch-size 128128128).\nThe accuracy is close to those reported in  and .\nThere is a gap between the accuracy achieved by large-batch SGD and the baseline accuracy. Hoffer et al.  attribute this gap to insufficient exploration of the parameter space and show that the gap will be reduced by training more iterations.\nWe do not increase the total number of iterations in our experiment for keeping fixed computation complexity.\nThe results confirm the advantage of our ADPSGD over FULLSGD and CPSGD as it consistently achieves higher accuracy than other versions.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: ILSVRC 2012 (ImageNet) [ref]35 is a much larger dataset than CIFAR-10.\nThere are a total of 1,281,167 images in 1000 classes for training, and 50,000 images for validation.\nThe images vary in dimensions and resolution.
