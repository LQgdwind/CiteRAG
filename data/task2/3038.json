      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Neural Network Training via Forward and Backward Propagation Sparsification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe research on sparse neural network training has emerged in the recent years. Different from the pruning methods, they can find sparse networks without pre-training a dense one. Existing works can be divided into four categories based on their granularity in pruning and whether the network structures are explicitly parameterized. To the best of our knowledge, no significant training speedups achieved in practice are reported in the literature. Table 1 summarizes some representative works. Weight-level non-parametric methods, e.g.,     , always adopt a two-stage training procedure that alternates between weight optimization and pruning. They differ in the schedules of tuning the prune ratio over training and layers.  prunes the weights with the magnitude below a certain threshold and   gradually increase the pruning rate during training.   automatically reallocate parameters across layers during training via controlling the global sparsity. Channel-level non-parametric methods   are proposed to achieve a practical acceleration in inference.  is a structured sparse learning method, which adds a group Lasso regularization into the objective function of DNNs with each group comprised of the weights in a filter.  proposes a soft filter pruning method. It zeroizes instead of hard pruning the filters with small ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norm, after which these filters are treated the same with other filters in training. It is obvious that these methods cannot achieve significant speedup in training since they need to calculate the full gradient in backward propagation although the forward propagation could be sparsified if implemented carefully. Parametric methods multiply each weight/channel with a binary [ref]50 [ref]47 [ref]40  or continuous     mask, which can be either deterministic   or stochastic [ref]50 [ref]47  [ref]40  . The mask is always parameterized via a continuous trainable variable, i.e., structure parameter. The sparsity is achieved by adding sparsity-inducing regularizers on the masks. The novelties of these methods lie in estimating the gradients w.r.t structure parameters in training. To be precise, Deterministic Binary Mask.  parameterizes its deterministic binary mask as a simple step function and estimates the gradients via sigmoid straight through estimator (STE) . Deterministic Continuous Mask.  uses the linear coefficients of batch normalization (BN) as a continuous mask and enforces most of them to 0 by penalizing the objective with ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} norm of the coefficients.  defines the mask as a soft threshold function with learnable threshold. These methods can estimate the gradients via standard backward propagation. Stochastic Binary Mask. [ref]47 [ref]40 model the mask as a bernoulli random variable and the gradients w.r.t. the parameters of bernoulli distributions are estimated via STE. [ref]50 estimates the gradients via Gumbel-Softmax trick , which is more accurate than STE. Stochastic Continuous Mask.   parameterize the mask as a continuous function g‚Äã(c,œµ)ùëîùëêitalic-œµg(c,\\epsilon), which is differentiable w.r.t. cùëêc, and œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon is a parameter free noise, e.g., Gaussian noise ùí©‚Äã(0,1)ùí©01\\mathcal{N}(0,1). In this way, the gradients can be calcuated via conventional backward propagation. Therefore, we can see that all of these parametric methods estimate the gradients of the structure parameters based on the chain rule in backward propagation. This makes the training iteration cannot be sparsified by exploiting the sparse network structure. For the details, please refer to Section 3.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: to calculate the full gradient in backward propagation although the forward propagation could be sparsified if implemented carefully.
