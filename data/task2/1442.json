Associate through Hungarian algorithm , all the proposed faces form candidate trajectories, which correspond to orange dash lines in Fig. 4. Generally, with false positives yielded by the\nproposal network, there is likely to have more than one candidate trajectories. Mark an observation of a raw trajectory as the sequence z={z1,z2,…,zm}𝑧subscript𝑧1subscript𝑧2…subscript𝑧𝑚z=\\{z_{1},z_{2},...,z_{m}\\}, and mark one of its possible candidate trajectories as the sequence z′={z1′,z,′2…,z}′m′(m′<m)z^{\\prime}=\\{z^{\\prime}_{1},z{{}^{\\prime}}_{2},...,z{{}^{\\prime}}_{m^{{}^{\\prime}}}\\}(m^{\\prime}<m). z𝑧z is yielded by MTCNN, and likewise, z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} is yielded by the foremost network in MTCNN. We use the second last layer’s output in the proposal network as the vectors of z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} and trace back the output of the same layer for z𝑧z. Thereby, as the last but one layer is the size of 1*1*32 in Fig. 3, z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} are 32∗m32𝑚32*m and 32∗m′32superscript𝑚′32*m^{\\prime} matrices. The expense of high recall rate is the massively generated false positives. A direct method to exclude these false positives and identify the rest is to re-train another face embedding network and feed the results to PIAP once again. Notwithstanding the above method might be theoretically capable, we cannot ensure the real-time efficiency since the number of proposed faces could be substantial. Furthermore, there is also no guarantee that the deep network will project false positives as outliers because the embedding network is mainly trained on the face dataset. Other than embedding networks, the Siamese net    might be applicable. Siamese net is designed to identify the slight differences between two similar inputs through a completely weight-sharing, dual structure. However, attribute to its shared weight structure as well, the Siamese net is extremely susceptible to noise. Therefore, it is incapable of sieving the lightly-occluded faces out of the proposed suspicious faces. In Fig. 4, the solid line corresponding to z𝑧z indicates the seamless trajectories after interpolation. Red areas on the solid line are the breaks recovered by interpolation. Under well-established face detection networks, for the correct or acceptable candidate trajectory z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime}, |z|>|z′|𝑧superscript𝑧′|z|>|z^{\\prime}| should hold. Meaning the number of miss-detected faces should be less than the number of detected faces in raw trajectories. If we put the detection network insufficiency aside, z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} are caused by objective factors including distortions, rotations, illumination changes, and so on. Therefore, we can infer that the original network could somehow detect the miss-detected faces after some reverse-transformation of distortions, rotations, illumination changes, and so on. Substantially, under ideal conditions, z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} is expected to be captured directly by the detection network; however, some noises εz′subscript𝜀superscript𝑧′\\varepsilon_{z^{{}^{\\prime}}} stop deep CNN from functioning. Detection under these noises requires the help of the proposal net. Hence, we can deduce the z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} from z𝑧z according to: where f𝑓f is the transformation function with the hyperparameter θ𝜃\\theta, and independent noise term εz′∼N​(0,σz′2​I)similar-tosubscript𝜀superscript𝑧′𝑁0superscriptsubscript𝜎superscript𝑧′2𝐼\\varepsilon_{z^{{}^{\\prime}}}\\sim N(0,\\sigma_{z^{{}^{\\prime}}}^{2}I). I𝐼I is the identity matrix. That is, as depicted in Fig. 4, the trajectories refinement is just like the process of linking dense dots (proposed faces) into dash lines (candidate trajectories) and then into a solid line (refined trajectories). Some state-of-the-art studies in MFT [ref]31 fields introduced a similar concept for trajectories optimization, but assume both z𝑧z & z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} comply with a Gaussian distribution. They assign f=fG𝑓subscript𝑓𝐺f=f_{G} where fGsubscript𝑓𝐺f_{G} is a Gaussian Process (GP) model and infers the correlation between tracklets through Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on θ𝜃\\theta. The GP model is sufficient in most offline tracking cases [ref]31   . However, in video live streaming, trajectories are refined on short video segments, containing only a small number of frames. Namely, we cannot impose f=fG𝑓subscript𝑓𝐺f=f_{G} because: (i) the amount of proposed faces within a segment is not significantly larger than the dimension number of the face vectors; (ii) the amount of proposed faces within a segment is insufficient in guaranteeing the proposed face sample complies with a Gaussian distribution. Inspired by , for better robustness and avoiding parametric-imposing, we propose a two-sample test to reject the proposed false positives based on empirical likelihood ratio (ELR) statistics. The goal of the two-sample test is to determine whether two distributions are different based on samples. In our case, we test whether the candidate trajectory and the corresponding raw face trajectory are two face samples that come from the same population (distribution). The statistical null hypothesis for the two-sample test is ℋ0:Pz=Pz′:subscriptℋ0subscript𝑃𝑧subscript𝑃superscript𝑧′\\mathcal{H}_{0}:P_{z}=P_{z^{\\prime}}. ℋ0subscriptℋ0\\mathcal{H}_{0} stands if and only if z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} are from the same distribution. Otherwise, z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} are different at a α𝛼\\alpha significance level, and we should reject ℋ0subscriptℋ0\\mathcal{H}_{0} and the corresponding candidate trajectory. Denote the domain of face vectors is a compact set defined in a Gaussian Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) H𝐻\\mathit{H} with reproducing kernel ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}. Following the common Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), we measure the distribution z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} by embedding them into such a Gaussian RKHS . Denote the mean embedding of distribution z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} in H𝐻\\mathit{H} as μ​z𝜇𝑧\\mu z and μ​z′𝜇superscript𝑧′\\mu z^{\\prime}, the question of finding optimal estimators of MMD in kernel-based two-sample tests is an estimate of statistically optimal estimators in the construction of these kernel-based tests. After the projection function f∈ℱ𝑓ℱf\\in\\mathcal{F}, MMD is represented by the supremum of the mean embedding of z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} : xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y_{j} are the elements in z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} after the projection. Referring  , ℋ0subscriptℋ0\\mathcal{H}_{0} can be written as: According to equation (11), the right side of (12) is: k​(xi,yj)𝑘subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑗k(x_{i},y_{j}) stands for the Gaussian kernel function of H𝐻\\mathit{H}. As m′<msuperscript𝑚′𝑚m^{\\prime}<m, if we pick the nearest (in time) m′superscript𝑚′m^{\\prime} face vectors in z𝑧z, and according to (13), set h​(z,z′)={1m​(m−1)​∑i≠jmk​(xi,xj)+1m′​(m′−1)​∑i≠jm′k​(yi,yj)−2m​m′​∑i,j=1m,m′k​(xi,yj)}ℎ𝑧superscript𝑧′1𝑚𝑚1superscriptsubscript𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑘subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗1superscript𝑚′superscript𝑚′1superscriptsubscript𝑖𝑗superscript𝑚′𝑘subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑦𝑗2𝑚superscript𝑚′superscriptsubscript𝑖𝑗1𝑚superscript𝑚′𝑘subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑗h(z,z^{\\prime})=\\{\\frac{1}{m(m-1)}\\sum_{i\\neq j}^{m}k(x_{i},x_{j})+\\frac{1}{m^{\\prime}(m^{\\prime}-1)}\\sum_{i\\neq j}^{m^{\\prime}}k(y_{i},y_{j})-\\frac{2}{mm^{\\prime}}\\sum_{i,j=1}^{m,m^{\\prime}}k(x_{i},y_{j})\\} for simplification, the linear time unbiased estimator of MMD is proposed in . The unbiased estimator M​M​Du​b𝑀𝑀subscript𝐷𝑢𝑏MMD_{ub} of z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} functions similarly as the MLE, but does not presume z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} are densely sampled under a multi-variant Gaussian Process. Denote hi=h​(z2​i−1,z2​i)subscriptℎ𝑖ℎsubscript𝑧2𝑖1subscript𝑧2𝑖h_{i}=h(z_{2i-1},z_{2i}) for further simplification. z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} are i.i.d, which implies hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i} are also i.i.d observations. i.e., h¯=0¯ℎ0\\bar{h}=0, where h¯¯ℎ\\bar{h} is the mean value. Hence, we introduce the empirical likelihood ratio (ELR) statistic   pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} to solve the two-sample test of ℋ0:h¯=0:subscriptℋ0¯ℎ0\\mathcal{H}_{0}:\\bar{h}=0 as: where pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} subjects to the normalization and h¯=0¯ℎ0\\bar{h}=0 constrains. ∑iNpi​hi=0superscriptsubscript𝑖𝑁subscript𝑝𝑖subscriptℎ𝑖0\\sum_{i}^{N}p_{i}h_{i}=0 ensures the empirical mean of hℎh equals zero. Therefore, any subtle difference between z𝑧z and z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} can be captured by the empirical likelihood ratio statistic pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} through the pairwise discrepancy M​M​Du​b𝑀𝑀subscript𝐷𝑢𝑏MMD_{ub}. The explicit solution of (15) is attained from a Lagrange multiplier argument λ𝜆\\lambda according to : Through (15) and (16), the supremum is transferred to the ELR test TE​L​Rsubscript𝑇𝐸𝐿𝑅T_{ELR} for statistic pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i}. If the null hypothesis ℋ0subscriptℋ0\\mathcal{H}_{0} holds, we have: where 𝒳12superscriptsubscript𝒳12\\mathcal{X}_{1}^{2} is the chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom according to Wilk’s Theorem, and TE​L​Rsubscript𝑇𝐸𝐿𝑅T_{ELR} converges in this distribution. Otherwise, we will reject the null hypothesis ℋ0subscriptℋ0\\mathcal{H}_{0} when TE​L​R≥𝒳α2subscript𝑇𝐸𝐿𝑅superscriptsubscript𝒳𝛼2T_{ELR}\\geq\\mathcal{X}_{\\alpha}^{2}, and 𝒳α2superscriptsubscript𝒳𝛼2\\mathcal{X}_{\\alpha}^{2} is the confidence interval: The rejection threshold of (18) could be computed through the off-the-shelf python package. Therefore, leveraging pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} as the new parametric feature to eliminate the false positives raised by the proposal network is extremely time-saving. The cost of getting pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is solely related to the computation of TE​L​Rsubscript𝑇𝐸𝐿𝑅T_{ELR}, and according to (13), this cost is linear to the sample size. Our two-sample test algorithm based on empirical likelihood ratio statistic achieves impressing results in real tests. With the efforts of (17) and (18), the received z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} is added to z𝑧z’s trajectory. Once again, fast interpolation applies to fill up the tiny breaks that still exist and then generate the refined trajectory.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: is just like the process of linking dense dots (proposed faces) into dash lines (candidate trajectories) and then into a solid line (refined trajectories).
