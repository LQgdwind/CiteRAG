      "content": "Paper Title: Gradient Masking and the Underestimated Robustness Threats of Differential Privacy in Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNN) are applied in an increasing number of sensitive domains.\nYet, they exhibit vulnerabilities against a broad range of attacks threatening privacy and security   .\nTo protect DNNs from such risks, in recent years, numerous defense strategies have been proposed. As for privacy protection, Differential Privacy (DP) [ref]4 has become a standard framework.\nBy providing strong mathematical guarantees on privacy disclosure, DP allows to conduct data analyses on a population while protecting individual privacy.\nWith the introduction of the differential private stochastic gradient descent algorithm (DP-SGD) , DP has been made available for numerous machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as DNNs.\nIt has been shown that training with DP can mitigate the risks of privacy threatening attacks .\nAt the same time, a large body of research has evolved around protecting DNNs against adversarial examples   .\nSuch data points contain small and human-imperceptible perturbations, forcing the attacked DNNs into misclassifications.\nThis poses a security threat for all neural network based architectures and depending on the use-case may lead to severe incidents.\nCurrently, adversarial retraining is considered the most effective method to protect against such attacks .\nDuring this computationally expensive process, adversarial examples are used to retrain the DNNs using their original labels . Even though the creation of models that are both private and secure at the same time poses a desirable goal, the majority of previous work focused on either one of the tasks 0.\nOnly recently has the intersection of the different research branches received more attention 1 2 3 4 5.\nThe interrelation between privacy and security can be approached from two sides: either by evaluating the privacy implications of making a model more robust, or by studying the influence of private training on model robustness.\nSo far, the former, namely the question of the influence of adversarial retraining on model privacy, has been investigated more thoroughly 6 7.\nIt was shown that adversarial retraining decreases the membership privacy of a model’s training data points. I.e.,\nfor an attacker, it becomes easier to determine whether a specific data point was used during training 0 8 9.\nRegarding the latter perspective, first results suggest that applying DP-SGD to train a DNN has negative impacts on the model’s robustness, even though there might potentially be privacy parameter combinations that are beneficial for both goals 0.\nHowever, the experiments conducted to evaluate robustness in 0 are limited to gradient-based adversarial attacks.\nHence, it remains unclear whether these findings can be generalized and whether the robustness can be confirmed for other adversarial attack methods. To further shed light on the intersection between models’ robustness and privacy, this work presents a comprehensive study building upon current findings.\nIn more detail, in addition to the previously evaluated robustness against gradient-based attacks  , the experiments include gradient-free 1 and optimization-based methods 2.\nFurthermore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work is the first one studying adversarial transferability  among models with different privacy settings, and between private and non-private models.\nFinally, it is also the first one analyzing DP models under the aspect of gradient masking 3 which might be the cause of a false sense of robustness. In summary, the presented work makes the following contributions: It experimentally evaluates the impact of DP-SGD training on adversarial robustness within a broad range of different privacy setups and parameters using various types of adversarial attacks.\nResults suggest that DP models may be more prone to adversarial attacks than non-private models and that with increasing privacy through higher noise levels (especially in combination with high clip norms), decreasing adversarial robustness can be found. To exclude the effect of gradient masking from the robustness analyses, transferability attacks between private and non-private models are conducted.\nTheir results suggest that adversarial examples transfer better from non-private models to private ones than the other way round.\nAdditionally, there seems to be a higher transferability among DP models than among private and non-private ones. To investigate why DP models might be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the gradients of the models are studied and compared with the gradients of non-private models. The work uncovers that in some settings, DP-SGD unintentionally causes gradient masking, which might explain the apparently increased robustness of certain settings reported in previous work 0.\nFurthermore, it presents parameter combinations which intentionally provoke this effect.\nThe findings are confirmed using a catalogue of criteria previously presented in literature 4 5.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: of attacks threatening privacy and security   .\nTo protect DNNs from such risks, in recent years, numerous defense strategies have been proposed.
