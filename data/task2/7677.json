      "content": "Paper Title: The ultrametric backbone is the union of all minimum spanning forests\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main result of this section is that the ultrametric backbone of a positively edge-weighted undirected graph is the union of all minimal spanning forests. This result follows immediately from the special case of connected graphs, which is formalized in Theorem 2.4. This theorem relies on a few Lemmas, the first of which is a well-known property of MSTs. Let G𝐺G be a connected, distance-weighted, undirected graph. For any cycle σ𝜎\\sigma in G𝐺G, if σ𝜎\\sigma has an edge di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} larger than all other edges in σ𝜎\\sigma, then di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} is not part of any MST of G𝐺G. Lemma 2.1 is a standard result in introductory graph theory. A simple proof by contradiction is given here. Assume, by way of contradiction, that a cycle σ𝜎\\sigma of edges in G=(X,D)𝐺𝑋𝐷G=(X,D) has an edge di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} larger than the weight of any other edge in σ𝜎\\sigma and that T=(X,DT)𝑇𝑋subscript𝐷𝑇T=(X,D_{T}) is an MST of G𝐺G in which the edge (dT)i,jsubscriptsubscript𝑑𝑇𝑖𝑗(d_{T})_{i,j} of T𝑇T corresponds to an edge di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j}. Removing di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} from T𝑇T yields two disconnected trees covering the node set X𝑋X: T1=(X1,D1)subscript𝑇1subscript𝑋1subscript𝐷1T_{1}=(X_{1},D_{1}) and T2=(X2,D2)subscript𝑇2subscript𝑋2subscript𝐷2T_{2}=(X_{2},D_{2}) with xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} in X1subscript𝑋1X_{1} and xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} in X2subscript𝑋2X_{2}. The path obtained from the cycle σ𝜎\\sigma by removing the edge di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} connects xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} in G𝐺G. Because this path connects xi∈X1subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑋1x_{i}\\in X_{1} and xj∈X2subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝑋2x_{j}\\in X_{2}, it must contain an edge dk.lsubscript𝑑formulae-sequence𝑘𝑙d_{k.l} that is strictly smaller than di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} (by the contradiction assumption) with xksubscript𝑥𝑘x_{k} in X1subscript𝑋1X_{1} and xlsubscript𝑥𝑙x_{l} in X2subscript𝑋2X_{2}. Therefore, the graph T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} on X𝑋X with edges (dT′)i,j=min⁡{(d1)i,j,(d2)i,j}subscriptsubscript𝑑superscript𝑇′𝑖𝑗subscriptsubscript𝑑1𝑖𝑗subscriptsubscript𝑑2𝑖𝑗(d_{T^{\\prime}})_{i,j}=\\min\\{(d_{1})_{i,j},(d_{2})_{i,j}\\} for (i,j)≠(k,l)𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑙(i,j)\\neq(k,l) and (dT′)k,l=dk,lsubscriptsubscript𝑑superscript𝑇′𝑘𝑙subscript𝑑𝑘𝑙(d_{T^{\\prime}})_{k,l}=d_{k,l} is a spanning tree of G𝐺G with weight strictly less than the weight of T𝑇T, contradicting the assumption that T𝑇T is an MST.\n∎ From this result and elementary facts about the ultrametric backbone, it follows that every MST is a subgraph of the ultrametric backbone, as stated in Lemma 2.2. Let G=(X,D)𝐺𝑋𝐷G=(X,D) be a connected, weighted, undirected graph with positive edge weights and ultrametric backbone U=(X,Bmax)𝑈𝑋superscript𝐵U=(X,B^{\\max}). Any MST T𝑇T is a subgraph of U𝑈U. It suffices to show that every edge removed in U𝑈U is also removed in any MST.\nConsider (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) such that di,j<∞subscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j}<\\infty is an edge (of G𝐺G), but bi,jmax=∞subscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b^{\\max}_{i,j}=\\infty is not an edge of U𝑈U (in the case G=U𝐺𝑈G=U, the result holds trivially).\nBecause bi,jmax=∞subscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b^{\\max}_{i,j}=\\infty, it follows immediately from Definition 1.1 that di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} belongs to a cycle in G𝐺G whose other edges are strictly smaller.\nBy Lemma 2.1 this edge does not belong to any MST.\n∎ The counterpart to Lemma 2.2 is Lemma 2.3, which states that every edge of the ultrametric backbone belongs to at least one MST. Essentially, the result follows from two facts. The first fact is that for any edge di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} belonging to the ultrametric backbone and any path π𝜋\\pi connecting xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} to xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} that does not contain di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j}, there is at least one edge dk,lsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑙d_{k,l} in π𝜋\\pi with di,j≤dk,lsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗subscript𝑑𝑘𝑙d_{i,j}\\leq d_{k,l}. The second fact is is that π𝜋\\pi and di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} together form a cycle, so replacing dk,lsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑙d_{k,l} with di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} results in an alternate path connecting the nodes in π𝜋\\pi (with an equal or lesser edge weight sum). Such an operation cannot introduce cycles if π𝜋\\pi is contained in an MST because removal of any edge participating in the introduced cycles would produce a strictly lower-weight connected graph. The formalization of this reasoning gives rise to the proof of Lemma 2.3. Let G=(X,D)𝐺𝑋𝐷G=(X,D) be a connected, weighted, undirected graph with positive edge weights and ultrametric backbone U=(X,Bmax)𝑈𝑋superscript𝐵U=(X,B^{\\max}). For any edge bi,jmaxsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b^{\\max}_{i,j} of the ultrametric backbone, there exists an MST of G𝐺G containing the corresponding edge di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j}. Consider an arbitrary MST T=(X,DT)𝑇𝑋subscript𝐷𝑇T=(X,D_{T}) of G𝐺G and an arbitrary edge bi,jmax<∞subscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b^{\\max}_{i,j}<\\infty of the ultrametric backbone U𝑈U of G𝐺G. If (dT)i,jsubscriptsubscript𝑑𝑇𝑖𝑗(d_{T})_{i,j} is an edge of T𝑇T, then the Lemma holds in this case. Otherwise, we seek to construct an alternate MST T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} that contains (dT′)i,jsubscriptsubscript𝑑superscript𝑇′𝑖𝑗(d_{T^{\\prime}})_{i,j} as an edge. In this case, xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} must be connected to xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} in T𝑇T via a path π𝜋\\pi that does not contain di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j}. Because bi,jmaxsubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b^{\\max}_{i,j} is an edge of U𝑈U, π𝜋\\pi must not be composed of edges whose weights are all strictly smaller than di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j}. That is, π𝜋\\pi contains an edge dk,lsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑙d_{k,l} with dk,l≥di,jsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑙subscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{k,l}\\geq d_{i,j}. We construct the graph T′≡(X,DT′)superscript𝑇′𝑋subscript𝐷superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime}\\equiv(X,D_{T^{\\prime}}) from T𝑇T by removing the edge between xksubscript𝑥𝑘x_{k} and xlsubscript𝑥𝑙x_{l} and inserting the edge between xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}. The altered graph T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} remains connected because the path π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} formed by replacing dk,lsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑙d_{k,l} by di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j} in π𝜋\\pi connects xksubscript𝑥𝑘x_{k} to xlsubscript𝑥𝑙x_{l} in T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime}. Furthermore, because dk,l≥di,jsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑙subscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{k,l}\\geq d_{i,j}, the weight of T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} is not larger than that of T𝑇T. From this fact and the connectedness of T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime}, it follows that T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} must be a tree of weight equal to the weight of T𝑇T (i.e., dk,l=di,jsubscript𝑑𝑘𝑙subscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{k,l}=d_{i,j}); otherwise T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} provides a counterexample to the assumption that T𝑇T is an MST. Therefore, either T𝑇T or T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} is an MST of G𝐺G with edge di,jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{i,j}.\n∎ The main result of this section, which follows immediately from Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3, is that the ultrametric backbone of a connected undirected graph with positive edge weights is the exactly equal to the (non-disjoint) union of that graph’s MSTs. This result is formally stated as Theorem 2.4. Let G=(X,D)𝐺𝑋𝐷G=(X,D) be a connected, weighted, undirected graph with positive edge weights and ultrametric backbone U=(X,Bmax)𝑈𝑋superscript𝐵U=(X,B^{\\max}), and let 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} be the set of all MSTs of G𝐺G. Then U=⋃T∈𝒯T𝑈subscript𝑇𝒯𝑇U=\\bigcup_{T\\in\\mathcal{T}}T is the (non-disjoint) graph union of all MSTs. Theorem 2.4 extends in a straightforward way to unconnected graphs by considering minimum spanning forests (a minimum spanning forest of a graph G𝐺G consists of one MST from each component of G𝐺G). Applying Theorem 2.4 to each component of a disconnected graph immediately gives rise to Corollary 2.4.1. Let G𝐺G be a weighted undirected graph with positive edge weights and ultrametric backbone U𝑈U, and let ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} be the set of all minimum spanning forests of G𝐺G. Then U=⋃F∈ℱF𝑈subscript𝐹ℱ𝐹U=\\bigcup_{F\\in\\mathcal{F}}F is the (non-disjoint) graph union of all minimum spanning forests.
