Designing appropriate contrasting views usually requires domain knowledge, intuition, trial-and-error and luck [ref]125. Existing studies   suggest that contrastive learning tends to generate sub-optimal representations in the presence of noisy views such as false positive pairs. This is because representations of these noisy views are forced to align with each other even if there is no apparent shared information. However, there is no guarantee that all task-relevant information is shared between views . Current contrastive learning approaches     commonly consider either the remaining data within the same batch or a large buffer as the default source of negative samples. However, samples with similar higher-level implicit semantics, are easily treated as negative ones   [ref]60. Recent studies has started to tackle this problem by incorporating the information of nearest-neighbors to enrich the set of semantic positives as they find that a generic query sample and its neighbors are likely to belong to the same class   . Note that, however, such binary instance labeling is insufficient to measure correlations between different samples, there still exist numerous promising avenues for exploring different approaches to measure the similarity of neighbors, offering greater semantic variations compared to pre-defined transformations . Negative sampling is also critical in constructing contrastive pairs, yet choosing the appropriate sampling method and number of negative samples can be challenging.\nThe presence of a collision-coverage trade-off indicates that the ideal number of negative examples should be scaled according to the number of underlying concepts present in the data  . The occurrence of false negatives adversely affects the discrimination of individual samples as they are erroneously pushed away [ref]60. One direction of exploration is to eliminate the need of negative samples . However, negative cancellation relies on a sufficient number of clearly distinguishable positive samples. If the positive samples lack clear separability or exhibit significant intra-class variations, the model may still encounter difficulties in discerning between positive and negative pairs, leading to sub-optimal performance. An alternative direction to enhance negative sampling is to employ filtering techniques. These techniques involve selecting negative samples that meet specific criteria, such as similarity or density thresholds, to help the model focus on more informative and diverse negatives. However, it is important to ensure that valuable negative samples are not inadvertently excluded, and that the selected negatives effectively challenge the discrimination ability of models. In addition, clustering techniques can also be employed to group similar negative samples together, reducing the chance of false negatives and promoting more effective discrimination [ref]60  .\n\nReference markers found: [114]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]114: The selection of appropriate augmentation transformations to form the positive pairs is a decisive aspect in contrastive learning [ref]114.
