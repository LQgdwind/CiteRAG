      "content": "Paper Title: DiffSHEG: A Diffusion-Based Approach for Real-Time Speech-driven Holistic 3D Expression and Gesture Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-verbal cues such as facial expressions, body language, and hand gestures play a vital role in effective communication alongside verbal language  3. Speech-driven gesture and expression generation has gained significant interest in applications like the metaverse, digital human development, gaming, and human-computer interaction. Generating synchronized and realistic gestures and expressions based on speech is key to bringing virtual agents and digital humans to life in virtual environments. Existing research on co-speech motion synthesis has focused on generating either expressions or gestures independently. Rule-based approaches    [ref]8 [ref]43 were prevalent initially, but recent advancements have leveraged data-driven techniques using deep neural networks. However, co-speech gesture generation poses a challenge due to its inherently many-to-many mapping. State-of-the-art methods have explored generative models such as normalizing flow models , VQ-VAE , GAN  and Diffusion models    .\nThese approaches have made progress in improving synchronization and diversifying generated gestures. However, none of them specifically target the co-speech generation of both expressions and gestures simultaneously. Recently, some works have aimed to generate co-speech holistic 3D expressions and gestures  . These methods either combine independent co-speech expression and gesture models  or formulate the problem as a multi-task learning one .\nHowever, these approaches separate the generation process of expressions and gestures, neglecting the potential relationship between them. This can lead to disharmony and deviation in the joint expression-gesture distribution. Additionally, deterministic CNN-based models  may not be well-suited for approximating the many-to-many mapping inherent in co-speech gesture generation. In this work, we propose DiffSHEG, a unified Diffusion-based Holistic Speech-driven Expression and Gesture generation framework.\nTo capture the joint distribution, DiffSHEG utilizes diffusion models 6 with a unified expression-gesture denoising network.\nAs shown in Figure 2, our denoising network consists of two modules, an audio encoder, and a Transformer-based Uni-direction Expression-Gesture (UniEG) generator, which has a unidirectional flow from expression to gesture. The proposed framework ensures a natural temporal alignment between speech and motion, leveraging the relationship between expressions and gestures. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast Out-Painting-based Partial Autoregressive Sampling (FOPPAS) method to synthesize arbitrary long sequences efficiently. FOPPAS enables real-time streaming sequence generation without conditioning on previous frames during training, providing more flexibility and efficiency. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n(1) We develop a unified diffusion-based approach for speech-driven holistic 3D expression and gesture generation framework: DiffSHEG. It is the first attempt to explicitly model the joint distribution of expression and gesture.\n(2) To better capture the expression-gesture joint distribution, we design a uni-directional expression-gesture (UniEG) Transformer generator, which enforces the uni-directional condition flow from expression to gesture generator.\n(3) We introduce FOPPAS, a fast out-painting-based partial autoregressive sampling method. FOPPAS enables real-time generation of arbitrary long smooth motion sequences using diffusion models. It achieves over 30 FPS on a single Nvidia 3090 GPU and can work with streaming audio.\n(4) We evaluate our method on two new public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance quantitatively and qualitatively. User studies validate the superiority of our method in terms of motion realism, synchronism, and diversity.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and digital humans to life in virtual environments.
