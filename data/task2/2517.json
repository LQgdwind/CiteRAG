      "content": "Paper Title: Artificial Intelligence-Driven Customized Manufacturing Factory: Key Technologies, Applications, and Challenges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite the progress made, manufacturing industry faces a number of challenges, some of which are: traditional mass-production is not able to adapt to the rapid production of personalized products; and resource limitations, environmental pollution, global warming, and an aging global population have become more prominent. Therefore, a new manufacturing paradigm to address these challenges is needed. The customer-to-manufacture concept reflects the characteristics of customized production where a manufacturing system directly interacts with a customer to meet his/her personalized needs. The goal is to realize the rapid customization of personalized products. The new generation of intelligent manufacturing technology offers improved flexibility, transparency, resource utilization, and efficiency of manufacturing processes. It has led to new programs, e.g., the Factory of the Future in Europe , Industry 4.0 in Germany , and Made in China 2025 . Moreover, the United States has accelerated research and development programs . Compared with mass production, the production organization of CM is more complex, quality control is more difficult, and the energy consumption needs attention. In classical automation, the production boundaries were rigid to ensure quality, cost, and efficiency. Compared with traditional production, CM has the following characteristics. Smart interconnectivity. Smart manufacturing embraces a cyber-physical environment, e.g., processing/detection/assembly equipment, and storage, all operating in a heterogeneous industrial network. The Industrial IoT has progressed from the original industrial sensor networks to the Narrow Band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT), LoRa WAN, and LTE Cat M1 with increased coverage at reduced power consumption . Edge computing units are deployed to improve system intelligence. Cognitive technology ensures the context awareness and semantic understanding of the industrial IoT . Intelligent industrial IoT as the key technologies is widely used for intelligent manufacturing. Dynamic reconfiguration. The concept of a smart factory aims at the rapid manufacturing of a variety of products in small batches. Since the product types may change dynamically, system resources need to be dynamically reorganized. A multi-agent system [ref]41 is introduced to negotiate a new system configuration. Massive volumes of data. An intelligent manufacturing system includes interconnected devices generating data such as device status and process parameters. Cloud computing and big data science make data analysis feasible in failure prediction, active preventive maintenance, and decision making. Deep integration. The underlying intelligent manufacturing entities, cloud platforms, edge servers, and upper monitoring terminals are closely connected. Data processing, control, and operations can be performed simultaneously in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where the information barriers are broken down, thereby realizing the deep integration of physical and information environments.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: aims at the rapid manufacturing of a variety of products in small batches.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
