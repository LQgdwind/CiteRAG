      "content": "Paper Title: SoftCLIP: Softer Cross-modal Alignment Makes CLIP Stronger\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArchitectures and Pre-training Datasets SoftCLIP accommodates three distinct model architectures, with the visual encoder compatible with ResNet50, ViT-B/32  and ViT-B/16 , while the language encoder utilizes Transformer following CLIP 8. The input resolution of image encoder is 224×\\times224 and the maximum context length of text encoder is 77. And SoftCLIP is pre-trained on three datasets, CC3M , CC12M 1 and YFCC15M-V2 [ref]17. Object-attribute Detector The object-attribute detector used to extract ROI features with tags is pre-trained by VinVL 8, adopting the framework of Faster R-CNN 9.\nThrough the detector, we take 10 objects with the highest confidence from each image to obtain the corresponding ROI features and category descriptions with attribute information. Each ROI feature is of 2052-dimension, concatenated by a 2048-dimensional appearance feature vector and 4-dimensional position vector (the coordinates of top-left and bottom-right corners of the object region). Implementation Details We train our SoftCLIP using an AdamW  optimizer and the cosine learning rate scheduler with a linear warm-up. Specifically, the learning rate linearly increases from 0 to the peak value within 10%percent1010\\% of the total steps, and then decreases with a cosine anneal strategy. The weight decay rate of AdamW is set to 0.2. To save GPU memory, automatic mixed-precision  is used. The models are trained from scratch for either 8 or 32 epochs in our experiments, i.e., 8 epochs for ablation and 32 epochs for comparison. We use 8 V100 GPUs for experiments, when training with ResNet50 and ViT-B/32 image encoder, the batch size is set to 2048, while with the image encoder ViT-B/16, the batch size is 1024. Downstream Tasks for Evaluation We validate the effectiveness of the proposed SoftCLIP on three downstream tasks: zero-shot image classification, zero-shot image-text retrieval and image retrieval. For zero-shot image classification, experiments are carried out on 7 datasets, such as ImageNet , Pets , Describable Textures , Food-101 , Flowers-102 2, SUN397 5 and Caltech-101 . For zero-shot image-text retrieval, experiments are conducted on Flickr30K  and MS-COCO . For image retrieval, two sub-tasks are included: instance retrieval task on Oxford 5 and Paris Buildings datasets 6, and copy detection task on the INRIA Copydays  dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: CLIP 8.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
