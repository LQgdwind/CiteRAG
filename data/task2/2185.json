      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Counterfactual Explanations Through the Lens of Adversarial Examples: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first describe the synthetic and real-world datasets used to study the connections between counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples, and then we outline our experimental setup. Synthetic Data. We generate 500050005000 samples from a mixture of Gaussians with pdfs ùí©‚Äã(Œº1=[1.0,1.0],Œ£1=I)ùí©formulae-sequencesubscriptùúá11.01.0subscriptŒ£1I\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1}{=}[1.0,1.0],\\Sigma_{1}{=}\\textbf{I}) and ùí©‚Äã(Œº2=[‚àí1.0,‚àí1.0],Œ£2=I)ùí©formulae-sequencesubscriptùúá21.01.0subscriptŒ£2I\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{2}{=}[-1.0,-1.0],\\Sigma_{2}{=}\\textbf{I}). Real-world Data. We use three datasets in our experiments. 1) The UCI Adult dataset  consisting of 488424884248842 individuals with demographic (e.g., age, race, and gender), education (degree), employment (occupation, hours-per-week), personal (marital status, relationship), and financial (capital gain/loss) features. The task is to predict whether an individual‚Äôs income exceeds $50‚ÄãKcurrency-dollar50K\\$50\\text{K} per year or not. 2) The COMPAS dataset [ref]25 comprising of 10000 individuals representing defendants released on bail. The task is to predict whether to release a defendant on bail or not using features, such as criminal history, jail, prison time, and defendant‚Äôs demographics. 3) The German Credit dataset from the UCI repository¬† consisting of demographic (age, gender), personal (marital status), and financial (income, credit duration) features from 100010001000 credit applications. The task is to predict whether an applicant qualifies for credit or not. Methods. Following our analysis in Sec.¬†4, we compare the following pair of methods: i) SCFE [ref]40 vs.¬†C&W [ref]8, ii) SCFE vs.¬†DeepFool , and iii) C-CHVAE  vs.¬†NAE . Prediction Models. For the synthetic dataset, we train a logistic regression model (LR) to learn the mixture component (samples and corresponding decision boundary shown in Fig.¬†1), whereas for real-world datasets, we obtain adversarial examples and counterfactuals using LR and artificial neural network (ANN) models. See Appendix¬†C for more details. Implementation Details\nFor all real-world data, adversarial examples and counterfactuals are generated so as to flip the target prediction label from unfavorable (y=0ùë¶0y{=}0) to favorable (y=1ùë¶1y{=}1). We use ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2}-norm as the distance function in all our experiments.\nWe partition the dataset into train-test splits where the training set is used to train the predictor models.\nAdversarial examples and counterfactuals are generated for the trained models using samples in the test splits. For counterfactual explanation methods applied to generate recourse, all features are assumed actionable for fair comparison with adversarial example generation methods.\nSee Appendix¬†C for more implementation details.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: relationship), and financial (capital gain/loss) features. The task is to predict whether an individual‚Äôs income exceeds $50‚ÄãKcurrency-dollar50K\\$50\\text{K} per year or not. 2) The COMPAS dataset [ref]25 comprising of 10000 individuals representing defendants released on bail. The task is to predict whether to release a defendant on bail or not using features, such as criminal history, jail,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
