      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Stage Fusion for One-Click Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nApproaches in the literature [ref]2  [ref]4 [ref]5 are typically evaluated by (1) the average number of clicks needed to reach the desired level of segmentation (@​85%@percent85@85\\% mIoU for PASCAL VOC 201220122012, MS COCO, @​90%@percent90@90\\% mIoU for the less challenging Grabcut and Berkeley) and (2) the average mIoU vs the number of clicks. The first criterion is primarily geared towards annotation tasks  [ref]4 where high-quality segments are desired for each instance in the scene; the fewer the number of clicks, the lower the annotation effort. In this work, we are concerned primarily with achieving high-quality segments for the object of interest given only a single click. Accordingly, given a single user click, we report the average mIoU across all instances for the GrabCut, Berkeley and the PASCAL VOC 201220122012 val dataset. For MS COCO object instances, following [ref]2, we split the dataset into the 202020 PASCAL VOC 201220122012 categories and the 606060 additional categories, and randomly sample 101010 images per category for evaluation. We also report the average mIoU across the sampled 800800800 MS COCO instances [ref]5. For training [ref]2 [ref]4 [ref]5, we use the ground truth masks of object instances from PASCAL VOC 201220122012  train set with additional masks from Semantic Boundaries Dataset (SBD)  resulting in 105821058210582 images. Note that unlike , we do not use the training instances from MS COCO. \n Ablation Study. We perform extensive ablation studies to thoroughly analyze the effectiveness of the individual components of our one-click segmentation framework. First, to validate our choice of guidance maps, we consider the user click transformations commonly used in existing interactive segmentation algorithms - Euclidean distance maps [ref]2 [ref]5, Gaussian distance maps  and disk . Fig. 4 shows examples of such guidance maps. For each kind of guidance map, we train separate networks to understand the impact of different user click transformations. For evaluation, we report the average mIoU over all instances in the dataset, given a single click (see Table 2). Next, we study the impact of our proposed late-fusion module (denoted by -multi in Table. 2); we observe an average mIoU improvement of around 1.8%percent1.81.8\\% across different datasets. \n One-click segmentation. We compare the segmentation performance of our method with existing interactive instance segmentation approaches (see Table 3). The approaches are grouped separately into 333 different categories - pre-deep learning approaches, deep learning-based interactive instance segmentation approaches and tap-and-shoot segmentation approaches. From Table. 3, we observe that our approach outperforms the classical interactive segmentation works by a significant margin reporting 40%percent4040\\% absolute improvement in average mIoU. We also outperform existing state-of-the-art interactive instance segmentation approaches [ref]4  by a considerable margin (>3%absentpercent3>3\\%). Additionally, we report an absolute mIoU improvement of 7.2%percent7.27.2\\% and 17%percent1717\\% on Grabcut and Berkeley over the tap-and-shoot segmentation framework of . We show qualitative results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm (see Fig. 5). The resulting segmentations demonstrate that our approach is highly effective for the one-click segmentation paradigm.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Approaches in the literature [ref]2  [ref]4 [ref]5 are typically evaluated by (1) the average number of clicks needed to reach the desired level of segmentation (@​85%@percent85@85\\% mIoU for PASCAL VOC 201220122012, MS COCO,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
