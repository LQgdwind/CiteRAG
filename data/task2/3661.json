      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Effective Clustered Federated Learning: A Peer-to-peer Framework with Adaptive Neighbor Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSynthetic Clustered Heterogeneity. We use three public benchmark datasets, MNIST , CIFAR10 [ref]37, and FMNIST (Fashion-MNIST) [ref]38. To synthesize clustered heterogeneity, we use rotation transformation and label-swapping, respectively; we note these two settings are commonly used in clustered FL (rotation [ref]33 , label-swapping ). All results are evaluated on each client’s local testset, and we keep the size of the local testset to 100 for all scenarios and present the averaged results among all clients. We then describe the details of clustered rotation transformation and label-swapping. Rotation Transformation: There are two settings for rotation transformation. First is rotation with two clusters ({0°, 180°}): clients in cluster 0 keep images without any transformation (0° rotation), while clients in cluster 1 rotate every image in the trainset and testset for 180°. The second is rotation with four clusters ({0°, 90°, 180°, 270°}): clients in cluster 0 keep images without any transformation (0° rotation), and clients in cluster 1 rotate every image in trainset and testset for 90°, clients in cluster 2 for 180°, and clients in cluster 3 for 270°. The labels of images remain unchanged, and each client’s class distributions are balanced. Swapping Labels: There are two settings for swapping labels. First is forming two clusters by swapping labels: for clients in cluster 0, images labeled as “0” are relabeled as “1” and images labeled as “1” are relabeled as “0”; while for clients in cluster 1, images labeled as “6” are relabeled as “7” and images labeled as “7” are relabeled as “6”. The second is forming four clusters by swapping labels: (1) for clients in cluster 0, images labeled as “0” and “1” are swapped by labels; (2) for clients in cluster 1, images labeled as “2” and “3” are swapped; (3) for clients in cluster 2, images labeled as “4” and “5” are swapped; (4) for clients in cluster 3, images labeled as “6” and “7” are swapped. Note that the class distributions in clients are balanced. Real-world Clustered Heterogeneity. We also use Digit-five    to validate the algorithms. Digit-five is a collection of five digital recognition datasets, namely handwritten digits (MNIST) , digits with colored backgrounds (MNIST-M) , street images of digits (SVHN) , synthetic digits (Synthetic Digits) , and digits from postal services (USPS) . These datasets are of different domains and modalities, and assigning these datasets to clients can inherently realize clustered heterogeneity. USPS is much smaller than others, so we exclude USPS and select 50000 samples from each of the other four domains as the FL trainset. As a result, there exist four clusters among clients. To enable the training under the same model architecture, we transform the images in different domains to the same size and number of channels.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Synthetic Clustered Heterogeneity.
