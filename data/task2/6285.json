      "content": "Paper Title: Permutation Equivariant Graph Framelets for Heterophilous Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conducted experiments on 9 datasets including 3 homophilous citation networks and 6 heterophilous datasets and followed the public data splits provided in .\nWe define the density of a graph as ‖𝑨‖0/n2subscriptnorm𝑨0superscript𝑛2\\|\\bm{A}\\|_{0}/n^{2}, which is the proportion between the number of non-zero terms in 𝑨𝑨\\bm{A} and the numbers of terms of 𝑨𝑨\\bm{A}. The statistics is summarized in the top rows of Table III.\nTo generate a series of partitions for each dataset, we applied sknetwork.hierarchy.Ward and sknetwork.hierarchy.cut_balanced from python package scikit-network111https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/v0.26.0/ to form intermediate clusters and control the hyperparameter hℎh in Theorem 3. hℎh is set to 444 and 888 and the values are indicated in Table III. Once new partition 𝒱′′superscript𝒱′′\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime\\prime} of clusters is formed from a graph G′=(𝒱′,𝑨′)superscript𝐺′superscript𝒱′superscript𝑨′G^{\\prime}=(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime},\\bm{A}^{\\prime}), we define as follows the new adjacency matrix 𝑨′′superscript𝑨′′\\bm{A}^{\\prime\\prime} to form the graph G′′=(𝒱′′,𝑨′′)superscript𝐺′′superscript𝒱′′superscript𝑨′′G^{\\prime\\prime}=(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime\\prime},\\bm{A}^{\\prime\\prime}) for next level clustering: where #​𝒱′=n′#superscript𝒱′superscript𝑛′\\#\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}=n^{\\prime}, #​𝒱′′=m′#superscript𝒱′′superscript𝑚′\\#\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime\\prime}=m^{\\prime}, I​D​(p),I​D​(q)𝐼𝐷𝑝𝐼𝐷𝑞ID(p),ID(q) are the indices of clusters that nodes p𝑝p and q𝑞q belong to and δ​(a,b)𝛿𝑎𝑏\\delta(a,b) takes 111 when a=b𝑎𝑏a=b. For heterophilous graphs, we iterate for a few steps until the final graph has less than h=4ℎ4h=4 or h=8ℎ8h=8 nodes. For Pubmed, when h=4ℎ4h=4 we constrained the number of steps of generating hierarchical clustering to be 6 so as to reduce input channels. As for the implementation of the neural network222https://github.com/zrgcityu/PEGFAN, we adopted the publicly released code of FSGNN333https://github.com/sunilkmaurya/FSGNN/ for integrating the graph framelet projections as detailed in our PEGFAN model. We use the same optimizer, hidden layer size, etc., as those in FSGNN, and hence the details are omitted. We noticed that the outcome of FSGNN was a bit different from those reported in [ref]39 when we tried to reproduce the results. Therefore we did a separate grid search for FSGNN and the results had slight changes. For our model, we set r𝑟r of input channels to 333. Results of other models (Mixhop[ref]38, GEOM-GCN, GCNII, H2GCN-1[ref]12, WRGAT, GPRGNN) are cited from [ref]39 and the results of some of the top rows are omitted, which are not among the models with relatively superior performance. All results are collected in Table III. As a brief comparison, Table IV summarizes the average, maximum, and minimum training time of our model and FSGNN on Chameleon and Squirrel over 108 sets of hyperparameters shown in Table VI of Section -C. Each training consists of 10 individual training, each of which is on a single data split. All experiments in this paper were conducted using an RTX 3090 graphics card.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: model.
