      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-scale Wasserstein Shortest-path Graph Kernels for Graph Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe run all the experiments on a server with a dual-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6226R CPU @ 2.90GHz, 256 GB memory, and Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS operating system. MWSP is written in Python. We make our code publicly available at Github222https://github.com/yeweiysh/MWSP. We compare MWSP with 8 state-of-the-art graph kernels, i.e., MLG , RetGK , PM , SP , WL , FWL , DGK [ref]39, and WWL . We set the parameters for our MWSP graph kernel as follows: The depth d𝑑d of the truncated BFS tree rooted at each node for constructing and limiting the maximal length of the shortest paths is chosen from {0, 1, 2, …, 6} and the depth k𝑘k of the truncated BFS tree for capturing the graph structure at multiple different scales around each node is chosen from {0, 1, 2, …, 6} as well. Both d𝑑d and k𝑘k are selected by cross-validation on the training data. The parameters of the comparison methods are set according to their original papers. We use the implementations of MLG, PM, and WL from the GraKeL 0 library. The implementations of other methods are obtained from their official websites. We use 10-fold cross-validation with a binary C𝐶C-SVM 1 (or a KSVM  in the case of MWSP and WWL) to test the classification accuracy of each method. The parameter C𝐶C for each fold is independently tuned from {10−3,10−2,…,103}superscript103superscript102…superscript103\\left\\{10^{-3},10^{-2},\\ldots,10^{3}\\right\\} using the training data from that fold. We also tune the parameter λ𝜆\\lambda from {10−4,10−3,…,101}superscript104superscript103…superscript101\\left\\{10^{-4},10^{-3},\\ldots,10^{1}\\right\\} for MWSP and WWL. We repeat the experiments 10 times and report the average classification accuracy and standard deviation. In order to test the performance of our graph kernel MWSP, we adopt 14 benchmark datasets whose statistics are given in Table I. All the datasets are downloaded from Kersting et al. 2. KKI 3 is a brain network constructed for the task of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) classification. Nodes represent the region of interest (ROI) and edges represent the correlation between two ROIs. Chemical compound datasets include MUTAG 4, DHFR_MD 5, NCI1 6, and NCI109 6. These chemical compounds are represented by graphs, of which edges represent the chemical bond types (single, double, triple, or aromatic), nodes represent atoms, and node labels indicate atom types. Molecular compound datasets contain PTC (male mice (MM), male rats (MR), female mice (FM) and female rats (FR)) 7, ENZYMES 8, PROTEINS 8, and DD 9. IMDB-BINARY [ref]39 is a movie collaboration dataset, which contains movies of different actors/actresses and genre information. Graphs represent the collaborations between different actors/actresses. For each actor/actress, a corresponding collaboration graph (ego network) is derived and labeled with its genre. Vertices represent actors/actresses and edges denote that two actors/actresses appear in the same movie. The collaboration graphs are generated on the Action and Romance genres. Cuneiform dataset 0 contains graphs representing 30 different Hittite cuneiform signs, each of which consists of tetrahedron-shaped markings called wedges. The visual appearance of wedges can be classified according to the stylus orientation into vertical, horizontal, and diagonal. Each type of wedge is represented by a graph consisting of four nodes, i.e., right node, left node, tail node, and depth node.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: in Python.
