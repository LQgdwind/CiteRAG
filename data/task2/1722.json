      "content": "Paper Title: Pairwise Symmetry Reasoning for Multi-Agent Path Finding Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSymmetry breaking has been shown to be a powerful and successful technique in the constraint programming community  . By adding symmetry-breaking constraints  or performing symmetry breaking during search , symmetry reasoning is able to eliminate symmetries and thus reduces the size of the search space exponentially. In pathfinding problems, symmetries have so far been studied only for single agents, e.g., by exploiting grid symmetries .\nThere is some prior work that is able to eliminate some symmetries in MAPF (but loses optimality and/or completeness guarantees) by preprocessing the input graphs. We introduce two of them below. We then introduce a recent technique that uses mutex propagation to detect and resolve some symmetries in MAPF. We further give\nan empirical comparison with this technique in Section 11.1. Ryan   proposes several graph decomposition approaches for solving MAPF. Like our work, he detects special graph structures, including stacks, cliques and halls. Unlike our work, he builds an abstract graph by replacing such sub-graphs with meta-vertices during preprocessing in order to reduce the search space. His work preserves completeness but not optimality. Our work, by comparison, focuses on exploiting the sub-graphs to break symmetries without preprocessing or sacrificing optimality. Cohen et al.  propose highways to reduce the number of corridor conflicts (defined in Section 8). They assign directions to some corridor vertices (resulting in one or more highways) and make moving against highways more expensive than other movements. They show that highways can speed up ECBS , a bounded-suboptimal variant of CBS. However, the utility of highways for optimal CBS is limited because they can then only be used to break ties among multiple shortest paths and are not guaranteed to resolve all corridor conflicts. Similar ideas of introducing directions to the graph edges are also explored in flow annotation replanning , direction maps [ref]45, and optimized directed roadmap graphs , all of which do not guarantee optimality. There is also recent work that identifies and resolves pairwise symmetries using mutex propagation  . MDDs essentially capture the reachability information for single agents, which resembles planning graphs in classical planning. Therefore, this work adds mutex propagation on top of MDDs to capture the reachability information for pairwise agents. Two MDD nodes for two agents are mutex iff any pair of their paths use the two MDD nodes are in conflict. So two agents have a cardinal (symmetric) conflict iff the goal nodes of their MDDs are mutex. Given two agents with a cardinal (symmetric) conflict, it finds two MDD node sets, each consisting of the MDD nodes of one agent that are mutex with the goal MDD node of the other agent, and uses them to generate two constraint sets for branching in CBS.\nTherefore, the mutex propagation technique is able to automatically identify all cardinal symmetric conflicts and resolve them. However, as we show in Section 11.1, our handcrafted symmetry reasoning techniques substantially outperform the mutex propagation technique in practice because (1) we can also identify semi- and non-cardinal symmetric conflicts, (2) we induce smaller runtime overhead, and (3) our symmetry-breaking constraints are more effective in some cases.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: shortest paths and are not guaranteed to resolve all corridor conflicts. Similar ideas of introducing directions to the graph edges are also explored in flow annotation replanning , direction maps [ref]45, and optimized directed roadmap graphs , all of which do not guarantee optimality.
