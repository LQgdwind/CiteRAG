      "content": "Paper Title: ImageCaptioner2: Image Captioner for Image Captioning Bias Amplification Assessment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur contribution draws success from several areas; image captioning, prompt-based learning, and bias metrics. Image Captioning.\n proposes the first deep neural language model for solving the image captioning task.\nSubsequently, RNN  based models, such as NIC and SAT, together with transformer based models, such as OSCAR, are widely accepted because of the impressive performance.\nHowever, image captioners tend to learn shortcuts based on correlation, therefore, researchers have made promising attempts[ref]16     to create unbiased image captioners.\nNevertheless, all these attempts measure the bias from the language stream only.\nTo fill this gap, we propose a new metric termed ImageCaptioner2, which can capture the bias from both visual and language streams. Prompt-Based Learning.\nPrompt-based methods   reformulate the input xùë•x of the downstream task to fit into the training objective of the pre-training phase.\nFor instance,    [ref]35 adapt the input xùë•x by adding a template TùëáT forming a new input xpsubscriptùë•ùëùx_{p}.\n tackles a wide range of NLP tasks in a Question-Answer (QA) fashion. For instance, to tackle the sentiment analysis task, the template TùëáT is stacked at the beginning of the input xùë•x, such as T=ùëáabsentT= \"Is this sentence positive or negative\", where x=ùë•absentx= \"I watched this movie ten times\".\nPET [ref]35 formulate the template as cloze-style phrases to help models understand a given task. Bias Metrics.\n[ref]16  define a list of protected attributes, e.g., age and gender, and evaluate the accuracy of predicting the specified attributes.\nThese methods suffer from many drawbacks; 1) They can‚Äôt handle paraphrasing. 2) Focusing only on the protected attributes and discarding the rest of the caption.\n[ref]52  tries to overcome these problems by incorporating the full caption by utilizing a sentence classifier.\nInstead of measuring the absolute bias, BA , DBA , and LIC  introduce bias amplification metrics, which measure the relative bias w.r.t the GT datasets.\nLIC  borrows ideas from  and [ref]52, where it relies on a text classifier to predict the protected attribute.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: such as OSCAR, are widely accepted because of the impressive performance.\nHowever, image captioners tend to learn shortcuts based on correlation, therefore, researchers have made promising attempts[ref]16     to create unbiased image captioners.\nNevertheless, all these attempts measure the bias from the language stream only.\nTo fill this gap, we propose a new metric termed ImageCaptioner2,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
