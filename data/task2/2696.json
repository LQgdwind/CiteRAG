      "content": "Paper Title: Image Captioning for Effective Use of Language Models in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Table 3, we show the results of various state-of-the-art models in three groups: 1) classification models based on multimodal transformers, which additionally include the usage of symbolic knowledge; 2) GPT-3 based generative models that use in-context learning; 3) our caption-based models. The state-of-the-art classification models like KRISP , MAVEx [ref]25 and RVL  show similar results on the implicit-only versions of their models, even though they are based on different multimodal transformers and pretraining tasks. Note that RVL has a contamination issue as images from OK-VQAâ€™s test split were used to train their multimodal transformer. We also observe that using symbolic knowledge improves the results around 2 points, the exception being MAVEx which combines knowledge found in ConceptNet [ref]5, Wikipedia and Google Images 222This result is obtained with an ensemble of 3 MAVEx models that share the same multimodal transformer. A unique MAVEx model achieves an accuracy of 40.3%.. PICa [ref]8 takes advantage of GPT-3  to define a new state-of-the-art in a generative manner using in-context learning. Its base results (PICa-Base) already surpass the ones seen before without any need of symbolic knowledge. An ensemble of 5 GPT-3 models and a clever selection of annotated examples from the training data to build the input prompt further improves its results (PICa-Full). Table 3 reports two results for each PICa model: the results using automatically generated captions alone (like us), and the results when also using object tags automatically obtained from the image, which slightly improve the results. Our CBMBERT system performs on par with the multimodal transformers, which is remarkable, since we do not use directly any visual features in our models and only use the caption. Note that all those systems have models of comparable size. When scaling up our generative models, we see that CBMT5-11B outperforms current multimodal models by a large margin and is on par with the results obtained by PICa-Full. Indeed, CBMT5-11B achieves slightly better results than the PICa version which uses captions alone, even if our model is 15 times smaller.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: include the usage of symbolic knowledge; 2) GPT-3 based generative models that use in-context learning; 3) our caption-based models.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
