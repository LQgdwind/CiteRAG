      "content": "Paper Title: Im2Hands: Learning Attentive Implicit Representation of Interacting Two-Hand Shapes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we evaluate Im2Hands on single-image two-hand reconstruction. To this end, we estimate two-hand shapes using 3D hand keypoints predicted from an input image via off-the-shelf two-hand keypoint estimation methods¬†[ref]24  and the proposed keypoint refinement module (ùí¶ùí¶\\mathcal{K}). Note that the goal of this experiment is to evaluate each method in a setting where no ground truth 3D hand keypoints are available. Thus, we disabled the rescaling of the reconstructed hand joints and shapes performed by some of the existing methods¬†[ref]24 [ref]44 using the scale ratio calculated from a subset of the ground truth 3D keypoints at the test time. For those methods¬†[ref]24 [ref]44 that require such rescaling, we use the mean scale of the hands in the training set of InterHand2.6M¬†[ref]29 to perform fair comparison. In Table¬†2, we first evaluate the effectiveness of our keypoint refinement module on noisy two-hand keypoints predicted by DIGIT  and IntagHand [ref]24. Our method is successful in alleviating input keypoint errors. Especially, it is shown to be effective when the degree of the input keypoint error is high. We now report our two-hand shape reconstruction results from single images. In Table¬†3, our method achieves the state-of-the-art results in image-based interacting two-hand reconstruction on InterHand2.6M¬†[ref]29. We would like to re-emphasize that the baselines originally designed for image-based two-hand reconstruction¬†[ref]24 [ref]44 (1) can produce only fixed-resolution meshes and (2) require dense vertex correspondences or statistical model parameter annotations for training, while our method outperforms them without such constraints. Also, note that most of the existing articulated implicit functions (e.g.,   ) are typically evaluated using noiseless keypoints or skeletons. In contrast, our method is experimentally demonstrated to achieve competitive results in a setting where no ground truth keypoints are available ‚Äì by leveraging the proposed\nkeypoint and two-hand shape refinement modules. Our qualitative comparison of image-based two-hand reconstruction is also shown in Figure¬†3. Note that HALO¬† produces non-smooth shapes due to the lack of shape or keypoint refinement steps given the noisy keypoint observation. IntagHand¬†[ref]24 does not properly model finger contacts (rows 1 and 3) or produces shape penetration (row 2). Our method generates more plausible two-hand shapes that also align well with the input image.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: on single-image two-hand reconstruction.
