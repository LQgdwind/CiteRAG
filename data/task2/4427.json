      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Generalizable Light Field Networks from Few Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNovel view synthesis is long-standing problem that spurred considerable work from the computer vision and graphics communities alike. While seminal work introduced various representations such as multi-plane images , depth layered images , light fields , depth based warping   etc., there has been a recent surge of particular interest in implicit neural shape and appearance representations (e.g. [ref]3     ) and neural rendering (e.g.    ). We discuss in this section existing work that we deemed most relevant to our contribution to few-shot novel view synthesis. Early deep learning based approaches to novel view from very sparse inputs used 2D convolutional encoder-decoder architectures mapping the input to the target image, conditioned on the target view. They either predicted colors directly   or 2D flow fields    applied subsequently to the input. These methods were outperformed by 3D aware convolutional approaches, which rely on encoding then rendering explicit 3D latent presentations, either through volumetric rendering [ref]32, resterization , or learnable neural rendering [ref]34 . The 3D latents take the form of intrinsic scene representations    or extrinsic volume grids [ref]34  [ref]32.\nAlthough many of these methods could learn to generate 360-degree views from very sparse inputs especially for synthetic central object data, most of them could not scale to high resolution images, complex scenes, and real data such as multi-view stereo datasets (DTU ). Some also required foreground segmentation masks at training (e.g. [ref]34). Implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) [ref]3 emerged later on as a powerful representation for novel view synthesis. It consists of an MLP mapping spatial points to volume density and view-dependant colors. Images are rendered through hierarchical volumetric rendering. It presented initially however a few limitations such as computational and time rendering complexity, requiring dense training views, lacking across-scene generalization, and requiring test-time optimization. Current research work is tackling each of these limitations (e.g.   0  1 2 3 4).\nIn particular, recent methods proposed to augment NeRFs with 2D  5 6 and 3D  convolutional features collected from the input images. Hence, they offer forward pass prediction models, i.e. test-time optimization free, while introducing generalization across scenes. However, they still need to evaluate hundreds of 3D query points per ray for inference similarly to NeRF, which makes them slow to render.\nFurthermore, methods such as 2 7\ntry to alleviate NeRFsâ€™ rendering complexity by learning view independent radiance features. In 7, the latter is combined with a single ray-dependant specular component, while Yu et al. 2 predict radiance spherical harmonic coefficients instead. Following , we explore here a tangent strategy, consisting in bypassing 3D implicit radiance modelling all together. Sitzmann et al.  introduced recently a new implicit representation for modelling multi-view appearance. A neural light field function maps rays i.e. target pixels directly to their colors without any need for physical rendering. However, this method was not demonstrated on real MVS data (e.g. DTU ). It was also implemented in the auto-decoding setup, which means it requires test time optimization. The method also uses a hypernetwork for conditioning which makes it expensive to scale to bigger images in compute and memory. Differently, We propose here a more efficient local conditioning mechanism for the light field network, which allows us to scale to real data and larger images, and offers optimization-free inference.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: images , depth layered images , light fields , depth based warping   etc., there has been a recent surge of particular interest in implicit neural shape and appearance representations (e.g. [ref]3     ) and neural rendering (e.g.    ).
