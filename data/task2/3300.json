      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Vision-based Robotics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs mentioned earlier, attention allows models to focus on\ntask-relevant aspects of the observations thereby providing robustness\nagainst distractions and increased learning efficiency\n . The use of\nattention mechanisms have been shown to improve the performance of\ndeep reinforcement learning algorithms\n. For instance, authors in\n have suggested several attention\nmechanisms to improve RL performance in solving Arcade video games.\nSimilarly, authors in 9 use attention layers\nalong with privileged information (environment states) to improve RL\nperformance. Authors in [ref]19 have used attention\nalong with an actor-critic model to solve a multi-agent RL problem. In this paper, we apply attention to two vision-based robotics\nproblems. Two types of attention mechanisms, namely, Bahdanau’s\nadditive type  and Luong’s dot product type\n[ref]29 are used in four different configuration as\nshown in Figure 3. The attention layers are used within a\nfeature network which is shared by both actor and critic models. An\noptional LSTM layer is also used along with the attention layer to\ncapture the temporal relationships between the frames. The effect of\nattention layers on learning performance of RL algorithms is discussed\nin the next section.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: to improve RL performance in solving Arcade video games.\nSimilarly, authors in 9 use attention layers\nalong with privileged information (environment states) to improve RL\nperformance. Authors in [ref]19 have used attention\nalong with an actor-critic model to solve a multi-agent RL problem. In this paper, we apply attention to two vision-based robotics\nproblems. Two types of attention\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
