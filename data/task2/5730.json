      "content": "Paper Title: SVDE: Scalable Value-Decomposition Exploration for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent work in MARL has shown a diversified development with the progress of deep learning, and has gradually moved from the tabular methods  to various deep neural networks .\nOur method is based on the cooperative value-decomposition algorithm, which is related to the recent advances in CTDE .\nSpecifically, our method takes advantage of the efficiency and scalability of CTDE to improve the performance of cooperative MARL in large-scale environments. In MARL, one challenge is to learn effective policies in a decentralized environment.\nPrior works have explored different approaches to this problem.\nOn the one hand, some methods directly learn decentralized value functions or policies, which are simple and intuitive.\nIndependent Q-learning (IQL)  [ref]30 integrates q-learning into multi-agent systems, learning a separate value function for each agent and enabling fully decentralized learning.\nHowever, these methods can suffer from environmental non-stationary problems during the training process, induced by the policy update and exploration of each agent simultaneously.\nStabilising experience replay  addresses learning stabilization under the decentralized paradigm, but still cannot completely solve this problem.\nOn the other hand, centralized methods can handle non-stationary problems at the cost of scalability.\nCoordinated reinforcement learning  exploits the conditional independence between agents to decompose the global reward into the sum of each agent’s local rewards.\nSparse cooperative Q-learning [ref]33 uses state sparsity to tabulate the state, allowing the use of tabular Q-learning.\nThese methods have shown promising results in various applications, but may have limitations in scalability or complexity. A common method is to balance the benefits of centralized and decentralized learning\nOne compromise is to use global information for centralized training and decentralized execution.\nCOMA  is a policy-based MARL algorithm in Counterfactual Multi-Agent Decision Making (CMDM) to estimate the counterfactual baseline through a centralized critic.\nSimilarly, MARS  is easier to scale to more agents but reduces the centralization advantage.\nHowever, these methods use on-policy policy gradient learning, which can be data-inefficient and prone to suboptimal results.\nExisting distributed reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks such as IMPALA  and SEED  only support SARL algorithms, while Ray , TLeague , and MAVA  not only have high requirements for computing resources but are not fully adapted to cooperative MARL. Recently, value-based methods that are intermediate between IQL and COMA have achieved great success in complex multi-agent tasks .\nThese methods decompose the joint action-value function into functions of independent action-value functions by satisfying the constraints of Individual-Global-Max (IGM) consistency [ref]22.\nVDN , QMIX , and WQMIX  enforce additivity, monotonicity, and weighted monotonicity constraints, respectively.\nQatten  uses both linearity and monotonicity constraints.\nQTRAN [ref]22 and Qplex  completely realize the expression ability of value-decomposition by converting IGM to optimization constraints and by duplex dueling architecture, respectively, but they are found to have high computational complexity in experiments.\nHowever, none of the above methods can help agents explore high-dimensional multi-agent systems efficiently, which limits their performance. While some works has been made in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) exploration, it is still in its early stages due to the difficulty of exploring the joint state-action space.\nSeveral methods have been proposed to address this issue.\nEUIR  introduces a centralized agent with intrinsic rewards to interact with the environment, and stores experience in a shared replay buffer to update policies.\nCEIR  defines several types of intrinsic rewards by combining the decentralized curiosity of each agent.\nLIIR  learns an additional proxy critic for each agent to learn the individual intrinsic reward and uses it to update the policy.\nHowever, these types of intrinsic rewards are domain-specific and cannot be extended to other scenarios.\nMAVEN  leverages a hierarchical policy to control shared latent variables as a signal for coordinated exploration patterns, but it still has limitations in some scenarios such as reward sparse environments. In this paper, we study how to solve the problems of low data-efficiency and insufficient exploration in the value-decomposition method.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: explored different approaches to this problem.\nOn the one hand, some methods directly learn decentralized value functions or policies, which are simple and intuitive.\nIndependent Q-learning (IQL)  [ref]30 integrates q-learning into multi-agent systems, learning a separate value function for each agent and enabling fully decentralized learning.\nHowever, these methods can suffer from\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
