      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer Based Deliberation for Two-Pass Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our transformer deliberation model has two main parts: A first-pass RNN-T model, and a second-pass transformer deliberation rescorer. The overall deliberation structure resembles that of  . The input of the RNN-T encoder are log-mel filterbank energies, 𝐗=(𝐱1,…,𝐱T)𝐗subscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑇\\mathbf{X}=(\\mathbf{x}_{1},...,\\mathbf{x}_{T}), where T𝑇T denotes the number of frames. The encoder output is then fed to an RNN-T decoder to produce first-pass decoding results 𝐘r=(𝐲r1,…,𝐲rB)subscript𝐘𝑟superscriptsubscript𝐲𝑟1…superscriptsubscript𝐲𝑟𝐵\\mathbf{Y}_{r}=(\\mathbf{y}_{r}^{1},...,\\mathbf{y}_{r}^{B}) in a streaming fashion, where B𝐵B is the beam search size. Note our RNN-T decoder is the same as [ref]7 which includes both the prediction and joint networks in . The second-pass model is a multi-source transformer rescorer. The general structure of the transformer rescorer is similar to [ref]22 and consists of N𝑁N transformer layers, each of which contains self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and a feed forward layer. Different from [ref]22, our “encoder-decoder” attention attends to two sources. One is the encoder outputs, which are optionally encoded by an additional encoder (dashed box in Fig. 1) to generate audio encoding 𝐄𝐄\\mathbf{E}, and the other is encoding of first-pass hypotheses. Note that to encode first-pass hypotheses 𝐘rsubscript𝐘𝑟\\mathbf{Y}_{r}, we still use a bidirectional LSTM since the focus of this work is on the decoder. We encode multiple hypotheses {𝐲ri}superscriptsubscript𝐲𝑟𝑖\\{\\mathbf{y}_{r}^{i}\\} separately using the same bidirectional encoder, where i=1,…,H𝑖1…𝐻i=1,...,H, and H≤B𝐻𝐵H\\leq B is the number of hypotheses used. Encoding of multiple hypotheses is then concatenated in time for attention computing. Our previous LSTM-based deliberation model  did not consider the order of n-best hypotheses during encoding. In this work, we propose to embed the hypothesis order (i.e. hypothesis rank in the n-best list) using a learned embedding  and add that to the embedding of each token in the hypothesis. We keep the additional encoder unidirectional due to latency considerations. The multi-source “encoder-decoder” attention generates two context vectors, and we use a merger layer to combine them. We tried multiple merging options such as concatenation, sum, attention, and gated average . In the attention case, we use the previous self-attention layer output as query and two source context vectors as key and values. For gated average, we take the concatenated source contexts as inputs and uses a softmax layer to predict weights for two sources. The output vector is then a weighted average of the two sources. For structural comparison, the proposed model uses a transformer-based multi-source decoder for rescoring, instead of a LSTM-based decoder . Compared to [ref]24, our model attends to both encoder outputs and first-pass hypothesis encoding, while [ref]24 only attends to encoder outputs for rescoring.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: in a streaming fashion, where B𝐵B is the beam search size.

The general structure of the transformer rescorer is similar to [ref]22\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
