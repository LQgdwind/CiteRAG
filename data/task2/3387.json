Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Grad2Task: Improved Few-shot Text Classification Using Gradients for Task Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable A2 shows the datasets we use for meta-training, which are the same with the datasets used by Bansal et al.  except for SST-2: Bansal et al.  used SST-2 as an entity typing task while we used it as a sentence-level sentiment classification task.\nWe use the average performance on the validation sets of all meta-training tasks for hyperparameter searching and early stopping. Table A3 lists the datasets we use for meta-testing.\nWe consider 4-shot, 8-shot and 16-shot for each task.\nFor each task with a certain number of shots, we train on 10 different training sets and test on the full testing set, and report the mean and standard deviation of the testing performance over the 10 runs.\nWe reuse most of the meta-testing datasets used by Bansal et al.  but remove all the datasets of which the average number of words per input sentence is larger than 100.\nIn addition, we add three new datasets to increase the diversity of the meta-testing tasks. Following Bansal et al. , we use several text classification datasets from crowdflower222https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/, including airline, disaster, emotion, political_audience, political_bias and political_message. We also use product rating dataset from the Amazon Reviews dataset [ref]9 but only keep rating_kitchen.\nWe add three different datasets to increase the diversity of the meta-testing tasks. We use a subset of the Yelp dataset 333https://www.yelp.com/dataset, named yelp in Table A3. We randomly sample 2000 examples for each class as the testing set. For training, similar with other tasks, we randomly sample 10 training sets for each number of shots.\nSNIPS [ref]12 is a commonly used benchmarking dataset for intent detection and slot filling tasks. We use the full test set of SNIPS and randomly sample few-shot datasets from its training set.\nThe HuffPost dataset [ref]27 is about classifying categories of news posted on HuffPost444https://www.huffpost.com/. The full dataset contains 41 categories, from which we randomly select 10 categories and 400 examples for each category as the testing set. We only considered the 12 datasets in the main table of  and removed the two entity typing tasks, because they are phrase-level classification tasks while we only focus on sentence-level classification tasks. And we removed the other 3 tasks because they contain many sentences that exceed the max sequence length of 128. Note that we use 128 as the max length for fair comparison with , since it had the same restriction.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: including airline, disaster, emotion, political_audience, political_bias and political_message. We also use product rating dataset from the Amazon Reviews dataset [ref]9 but only keep rating_kitchen.\nWe add three different datasets to increase the diversity of the meta-testing tasks. We use a subset of the Yelp dataset 333https://www.yelp.com/dataset, named\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.
