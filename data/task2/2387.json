      "content": "Paper Title: GGT: Graph-Guided Testing for Adversarial Sample Detection of Deep Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the real world, a lot of complex systems in biology, society, and technology can be described by graphs G𝐺G composed of a node set V𝑉V and an edge set E𝐸E . Typical examples are brain network , communication network , and worldwide web [ref]24, where each node represents a neuron, a person, or a web page, respectively, and the edges are the connections between each kind of these objects, which facilitate their information exchange. DNN consists of layers of neurons and the connections between them, with its structure naturally captured by a graph, where each neuron is connected with those in the former and the next layers, with the extracted feature transmitted through edges. DNN architecture and its performance are highly correlated, which is widely recognized in the ML community [ref]25 [ref]26. Recently, You et al.   established the relationship between DNN architecture and its performance using a relational graph. They argue that the directed data flow is too complex to model, and thus it is more reasonable to focus on the tractable message exchange. As shown in Fig. 1, a 3-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with fixed layer width can be represented by a 4-node relational graph. Assume that each node v𝑣v has a node feature xvsubscript𝑥𝑣x_{v}, the edges between node 1 on the previous layer and nodes 1 and 2 on the next layer mean there are message transmissions from the previous layer to the next layer, which is defined by a message function f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f(\\cdot). The input of a message function is the previous node feature and the output is the updated node feature. At the inference stage, MLP computes the input feature layer by layer. The corresponding process in the relational graph is that message functions transform node features, then their outputs are aggregated at each node by an aggregation function A​(⋅)𝐴⋅A(\\cdot). For an n𝑛n-layer MLP, the r𝑟r-th round message exchange can be described as where u𝑢u and v𝑣v reppresent two nodes in the relational graph, N​(v)𝑁𝑣N(v) is the neighborhood of v𝑣v, xu(r)superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑢𝑟x_{u}^{(r)} is the input node feature of u𝑢u, and xvr+1superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑣𝑟1x_{v}^{r+1} is the output node feature of v𝑣v. The relational graph can also be applied to more complex DNN architectures, including Convolution Neural Networks  (CNNs) and residual connections [ref]26.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: in biology, society, and technology can be described by graphs G𝐺G composed of a node set V𝑉V and an edge set E𝐸E .
