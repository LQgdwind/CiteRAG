      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Contrastive Learning Meets Graph Meta Learning: A Unified Method for Few-shot Node Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs)¬†[ref]1 [ref]2 have emerged as the predominant encoders for Graph Representation Learning (GRL) in recent studies, with node classification being a crucial area of investigation. Most researches focus on examining GNNs in supervised or semi-supervised settings¬†[ref]3 , which rely on many annotated data. Nevertheless, acquiring high-quality labels is challenging in many scenarios, leading to growing interest in exploring few-shot transductive node classification (FSNC), where only few labeled samples are provided for each class. The majority of current studies on FSNC¬†       follow the meta learning¬†  paradigm. Specifically, to tackle a few-shot problem with NùëÅN classes and kùëòk samples per class, meta learning gains knowledge through multiple training episodes with NùëÅN-way kùëòk-shot meta-tasks generated from training classes. Each meta-task consists of a support set and a query set, both sampled from nodes belonging to a fixed number (NùëÅN) of classes. The objective is to develop an algorithm that can perform well on the query set by training on only few support samples. This procedure enables the model to learn the latent distribution of tasks and thus can be easily transferred to tasks with unseen classes. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can also effectively handle downstream few-shot tasks outside graph learning domains like computer vision¬†  . Such capability demonstrates the importance of transferable and discriminative representations¬† in few-shot learning. Observing the success of SSL in other areas, a recent study¬† on few-shot node classification used pre-trained node embeddings learned from existing Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods¬†  to train a linear classifier for few-shot tasks. Even without label information, its best results significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised meta learning approaches. To understand the success behind contrastive learning (CL), we analyze and validate two critical factors contributing to contrastive learning‚Äôs exceptional performance through extensive experiments. The first factor is the use of data augmentation. It helps the model to learn discriminative embeddings with minimal redundant information from the graph, which is essential for few-shot tasks. Secondly, CL methods explicitly incorporate node embeddings from validation/test classes in contrastive loss, reducing the likelihood of model overfitting. In contrast, meta learning relies on node labels to construct meta-tasks, thus can only use nodes from training classes, losing much graph information. Hence, one natural question emerges: Can we leverage the advantages of contrastive learning to enhance the current meta learning framework? To address this question, we propose a new paradigm for few-shot node classification termed Contrastive Few-Shot Node Classification (COLA). Unlike original meta-tasks, which require nodes within the same class to construct support sets, COLA construct meta-tasks without labels. Specifically, the selection of support and query sets is the core of NùëÅN-way kùëòk-shot meta-tasks construction. We start by randomly sampling NùëÅN query nodes and regard them as NùëÅN different ways. The main challenge is how to find kùëòk semantically similar samples to each query node, without label information.\nWe first use GNNs as graph encoders to get node embeddings in three augmented graphs.\nLeveraging the idea that similar nodes should maintain semantic similarity in perturbed graphs, the nodes that have similar embeddings to the query node across different augmented graphs are selected to construct the support set. To train an effective graph encoder, we generate the query embeddings from one augmented graph using a trainable GNN and obtain the query embeddings from another augmented graph by a momentum GNN, whose weight is the moving average of the trainable GNN. Our framework has several advantages: (1) We utilize the invariant information among three augmented graphs to construct semantically correct meta-tasks without label information; (2) Data augmentation allows the generation of a diverse range of meta-tasks over episodes and helps the GNN encoder learn a discriminative data representation; (3) The construction of meta-tasks enables the utilization of all nodes in training, further incorporating more graph information; (4) We take a slowly updated encoder to create a more stable support set candidate pool, which is less prone to noise compared to a rapidly updated encoder. We conduct tests on six real-world datasets, examining the necessity of each framework component. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms SOTA approaches, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for application.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)¬†[ref]1 [ref]2 have emerged as the predominant encoders for Graph Representation Learning (GRL) in recent studies, with node classification being a crucial area of investigation.
