      "content": "Paper Title: Feature Activation Map: Visual Explanation of Deep Learning Models for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough deep learning models have achieved unprecedented success in a variety of computer vision tasks     , the mystery hidden in the internal mechanisms of CNN has been attracting the attention from the computer vision community. Researchers attempt to unlock the reason why a network makes specific decisions and to visualize what regions on images are utilized for decision-making so that its decisions become explainable and trustworthy. To satisfy the demand, the class activation map (CAM) based methods [ref]6    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 has been proposed. They are viewed as powerful interpretation tools to enable the decisions of deep neural networks to be more transparent. CAM-based methods aim to generate visual explanation maps by linearly combining feature importance coefficients with activation maps (the matrix of each channel in a feature map). Although different methods obtain feature importance coefficients in different ways, they all inevitably resort to the fully connected layer (FC layer) as a classifier [ref]6    0 1 2 3 4 5 6. The reason why the CAM-based approaches can correctly and effectively visualize the discriminative regions of the target objects is that they utilize the feature information of target category. The feature information is acquired through training data and stored in FC layers as a classifier 6. A FC layer, which plays the role of classification in deep neural network architecture, is also called as a linear classifier. Although various backbone networks (e.g., ResNet, VGG 7, InceptionNet 8, and Vision Transformer 9) perform as feature extractors, FC layers are commonly employed to identify a testing sample. It is worth noting that there are two constraints when FC layers are chosen as classifiers. First, FC layers need to be trained well before testing. Second, the training data and testing samples must have the same class domain. Many deep learning networks in performing computer vision tasks do not use FC layers. Classifying testing samples via similarity comparison is a classification paradigm that does not rely on FC layers 0 1 2. Because the paradigm gets rid of the two aforementioned restrictions, it can be broadly adopted for more diverse recognition tasks than FC layer-based paradigm, from unsupervised learning tasks  to train-test domain shift tasks (e.g., few-shot learning 1 2, and image retrieval 4 tasks). However, the existing CAM-based methods rely on FC layers as classifiers. They fail to function in theory and cannot be used for visualizing salient regions of deep learning models that use FC-free paradigm. For example, due to the constraint caused by FC layers, all CAM-based methods can only visualize salient regions of images from seen classes, they cannot be applied to visualizing explanation maps for unseen classes that are disjoint from training data in train-test domain shift tasks. In this work, we fill this critical gap by presenting a novel model-agnostic visual explanation algorithm named feature activation map (FAM), for visualizing which regions on images are utilized for decision-making by those deep learning networks without FC layers. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1. A novel visual explanation algorithm, feature activation map, is proposed that can, for the first time, visualize FC-free deep learning models in image classification. 2. FAM can provide saliency maps for any deep learning networks that use similarity comparison classification paradigm without the constraint to the model architecture. 3. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in explaining what regions are utilised for decision-making by various deep learning models for few-shot learning, contrastive learning and image retrieval tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: and to visualize what regions on images are utilized for decision-making so that its decisions become explainable and trustworthy.
