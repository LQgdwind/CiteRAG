      "content": "Paper Title: OpenHoldem: A Benchmark for Large-Scale Imperfect-Information Game Research\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe three agents, i.e., the rule-based AI 𝒜ℛsuperscript𝒜ℛ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{R}}, the CFR based static AI 𝒜𝒞superscript𝒜𝒞\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{C}}, and the DeepStack-like online AI 𝒜𝒟superscript𝒜𝒟\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{D}}, described in the previous sections are all based on improvements of existing techniques.\nThese AIs often rely on different kinds of NLTH domain knowledge, such as expert rules in 𝒜ℛsuperscript𝒜ℛ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{R}} and handcrafted abstraction algorithms in 𝒜𝒞superscript𝒜𝒞\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{C}}.\nBesides, there are also computational issues, i.e., in the inference stage of 𝒜𝒟superscript𝒜𝒟\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{D}}, the CFR iteration process consumes much computation.\nSpecifically, to ensure 𝒜𝒟superscript𝒜𝒟\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{D}}’s high-quality prediction, this iteration process often needs to be carried out for more than 1,000 times in practice. Based on the above considerations, in OpenHoldem, we further propose a high-performance and lightweight NLTH AI, i.e., 𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}}, obtained with an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework.\n𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}} adopts a pseudo-Siamese architecture to directly learn from the input state information to the output actions by competing the learned model with its different historical versions.\nThe main technical contributions of 𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}} include a novel state representation of card and betting information, a novel reinforcement learning loss function, and a new self-play procedure to generate the final model.\nWe finish the training of 𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}} in three days using only one single computing server of 8 GPUs and 64 CPU cores.\nDuring inference, 𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}} takes only 3.8×10−33.8superscript1033.8\\times 10^{-3} second for each decision in a single-core CPU of 2.00GHz.\n𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}} is the first AI that obtains competitive performance in NLTH solely through RL. 𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}} aims to remove the expensive computation of CFR iteration in both the training and testing stages of a NLTH AI while eliminating the need of domain knowledge.\nIt thus pursues an end-to-end learning framework to perform efficient and effective decision-making in imperfect-information games.\nHere end-to-end means that the framework directly accepts the game board information and outputs the actions without encoding handcrafted features as inputs or performing iterative reasoning in the decision process.\n𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}} adopts the RL framework to achieve this goal, and the only force to drive the model to learn is the reward. In NLTH, the game board information includes the current and historical card information and the player action information.\nThe agent chooses from a set of betting actions to play the game and try to win more rewards.\nTo capture the complex relationship among the game board information, the desired betting actions, and the game rewards, we design a pseudo-Siamese architecture equipped with the RL schema to learn the underlying relationships from end to end.\nWe illustrate the end-to-end learning architecture of 𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}} in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4, the input of the architecture is the game state representations of action and card information, which are respectively sent to the top and bottom streams of the Siamese architecture.\nSince the action and card representations provide different kinds of information to the learning architecture, we first isolate the parameter-sharing of the Siamese architecture to enable the two ConvNets to learn adaptive feature representations, which are then fused through fully connected layers to produce the desired actions.\nThis design is the reason why we call it pseudo-Siamese architecture.\nTo train 𝒜ℛ​ℒsuperscript𝒜ℛℒ\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathcal{RL}}, we present a novel Trinal-Clip loss function to update the model parameters using RL algorithms.\nWe obtain the final model through a new self-play procedure that plays the current model with a pool of its K𝐾K best historical versions to sample diverse training data from the huge game state space.\nWe believe these new techniques and underlying principles are helpful to develop general learning algorithms for more imperfect-information games. The existence of private information and flexibility of bet size cause the NLTH AI learning extremely challenging.\nTo obtain an effective and suitable feature representation for end-to-end learning from the game state directly to the desired action, we design a new multi-dimensional feature representation to encode both the current and historical card and bet information. In NLTH, the card and action information exhibit different characteristics.\nWe thus represent them as two separated three-dimension tensors and let the network learn to fuse them (Figure 4).\nWe design the card tensor in six channels to represent the agent’s two private cards, three flop cards, one turn card, one river card, all public cards, and all private and public cards.\nEach channel is a 4×134134\\times 13 sparse binary matrix, with 1 in each position denoting the corresponding card.\nFor the action tensor, since there are usually at most six sequential actions in each of the four rounds, we design it in 24 channels.\nEach channel is a 4×nb4subscript𝑛𝑏4\\times n_{b} sparse binary matrix, where nbsubscript𝑛𝑏n_{b} is the number of betting options, and the four dimensions correspond to the first player’s action, the second player’s action, the sum of two player’s action, and the legal actions.\nTo understand this representation, Figure 5 illustrates one example that a player in the small blind plays an action ‘bet pot’ after getting a hand ‘AsAc’. This representation has several advantages: 1) there is no abstraction of the card information thus reserves all the game information;\n2) the action representation is general and can denote different number of betting options (though nb=9subscript𝑛𝑏9n_{b}=9 produce satisfactory results in the experiment);\n3) all the historical information is encoded to aid reasoning with hidden information;\nand 4) the multi-dimensional tensor representation is very suitable for modern deep neural architectures like ResNet  to learn effective feature hierarchies, as verified in the AlphaGo AI training. With the multi-dimensional feature representation, a natural choice is to use the current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO [ref]45 to train the deep architecture.\nPPO is an actor-critic framework which trains a value function Vθ​(st)subscript𝑉𝜃subscript𝑠𝑡V_{\\theta}(s_{t}) and a policy πθ​(at|st)subscript𝜋𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t}).\nPPO defines a ratio function rt​(θ)=πθ​(at|st)πθ′​(at|st)subscript𝑟𝑡𝜃subscript𝜋𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝜋superscript𝜃′conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡r_{t}(\\theta)=\\tfrac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t})}{\\pi_{\\theta^{\\prime}}(a_{t}|s_{t})} as the ratio between the current policy πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} and the old policy πθ′subscript𝜋superscript𝜃′\\pi_{\\theta^{\\prime}}, and a policy loss function ℒpsuperscriptℒ𝑝\\mathcal{L}^{p} as: where At^^subscript𝐴𝑡\\hat{A_{t}} is the advantage function, clip⁡(rt​(θ),1−ϵ,1+ϵ)clipsubscript𝑟𝑡𝜃1italic-ϵ1italic-ϵ\\operatorname{clip}(r_{t}(\\theta),1-\\epsilon,1+\\epsilon) ensures rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t} lie in the interval (1−ϵ,1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ1italic-ϵ(1-\\epsilon,1+\\epsilon), and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is a clip ratio hyper-parameter with typical value 0.2.\nPPO’s value loss ℒvsuperscriptℒ𝑣\\mathcal{L}^{v} is defined as: in which Rtγsuperscriptsubscript𝑅𝑡𝛾R_{t}^{\\gamma} represents the traditional γ𝛾\\gamma-return . However, the above PPO loss function is difficult to converge for NLTH AI training.\nWe find two main reasons for this problem: 1) when πθ​(at|st)≫πθ′​(at|st)much-greater-thansubscript𝜋𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝜋superscript𝜃′conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t})\\gg\\pi_{\\theta^{{}^{\\prime}}}(a_{t}|s_{t}) and the advantage function At^<0^subscript𝐴𝑡0\\hat{A_{t}}\\textless 0, the policy loss ℒp​(θ)superscriptℒ𝑝𝜃\\mathcal{L}^{p}(\\theta) will introduce a large variance; 2) due to the strong randomness of NLTH, the value loss ℒv​(θ)superscriptℒ𝑣𝜃\\mathcal{L}^{v}(\\theta) is often too large.\nTo speed up and stabilize the training process, we design a Trinal-Clip PPO loss function.\nIt introduces one more clipping hyper-parameter δ1subscript𝛿1\\delta_{1} for the policy loss when At^<0^subscript𝐴𝑡0\\hat{A_{t}}\\textless 0, and two more clipping hyper-parameters δ2subscript𝛿2\\delta_{2} and δ3subscript𝛿3\\delta_{3} for the value loss.\nThe policy loss function ℒt​c​psuperscriptℒ𝑡𝑐𝑝\\mathcal{L}^{tcp} for Trinal-Clip PPO is defined as: where δ1>1+ϵsubscript𝛿11italic-ϵ\\delta_{1}>1+\\epsilon, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is the original clip in PPO.\nThe clipped value loss function ℒt​c​vsuperscriptℒ𝑡𝑐𝑣\\mathcal{L}^{tcv} for Trinal-Clip PPO is defined as: where δ2subscript𝛿2\\delta_{2} and δ3subscript𝛿3\\delta_{3} do not require manual tuning but represent the total number of chips the player and the opponent has placed, respectively.\n−δ2subscript𝛿2-\\delta_{2} represent the state value when the player folds, similarly, δ3subscript𝛿3\\delta_{3} is the state value when the opponent folds.\nThis value-clip loss significantly reduces the variance during the training process.\nOur proposed Trinal-Clip PPO loss function improves the learning effectiveness of the actor-critic framework, and we believe it is applicable for a wide range of RL applications with imperfect information. With the proposed Trinal-Clip PPO loss function, the most direct way is using the self-play algorithm [ref]50 to train the NLTH agent.\nHowever, due to the private information in NLTH, simple self-play learning designed for perfect information games   often causes the agent trapped in a local minimum and defeated by agents with counter-strategies.\nAlphaStar [ref]11 designs a population-based training (PBT) procedure to maintain multiple self-play agents and obtains excellent results in the real-time strategy game StarCraft II.\nHowever, the PBT procedure needs a tremendous computational resource to ensure good performance. To obtain a high-performance NLTH AI with both low computation cost and strong decision-making ability, we propose a new type of self-play algorithm which trains only one agent but learns strong and diverse policies.\nThe proposed algorithm maintains a pool of competing agents from the historical versions of the main agent.\nThen, by competing among different agents, the algorithm selects the K𝐾K best survivors from their ELO [ref]11 scores and generates training data simultaneously.\nThe main agent learns from the data and thus can compete with different opponents, maintaining a strong decision-making ability of high-flexible policies.\nSince the proposed algorithm performs self-play among the main agent and its K𝐾K best historical versions, we refer to it as K𝐾K-Best Self-Play.\nOur proposed K𝐾K-Best Self-Play inherits PBT’s merit of diverse policy styles while maintains computational efficiency of single-thread agent training, striking a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: as verified in the AlphaGo AI training.
