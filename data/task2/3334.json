      "content": "Paper Title: Representation Learning on Heterostructures via Heterogeneous Anonymous Walks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlmost all the existing algorithms of structural node embedding are designed for homogeneous networks  [ref]8. Usually, these work use a strategy of extracting structural properties such as extracting features , estimating wavelet distribution  and applying graph kernel method  before mapping them to vector space [ref]8. To transform captured structural traits into embeddings, the early studies such as RolX  and GLRD [ref]43 directly factorize processed structural feature matrix. Later a few works extend random walk-based methods (e.g., DeepWalk [ref]6). Struc2vec  achieves structural similar nodes tending to occur in the same walk by constructing a new random walk graph based on node degrees. RiWalk  make structural similar nodes have similar walks starting from themselves by proposing a new node labeling method. Recently, using deep learning to generate structural embeddings has\nattracted more attention. DRNE  captures regular equivalence by aggregating degrees of node neighbors with Long Short Term Memory . CNESE  applies variational auto-encoder  to learn stochastic equivalence by reconstructing the distributions of discrete graph curvature. GraLSP and GraphSTONE use anonymous walks to capture neighborhood structures and learn embeddings through graph neural network architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Almost all the existing algorithms of structural node embedding are designed for homogeneous networks  [ref]8.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
