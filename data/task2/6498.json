      "content": "Paper Title: S.T.A.R.-Track: Latent Motion Models for End-to-End 3D Object Tracking with Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Appearance Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset: \nAll experiments are performed on the large-scale nuScenes dataset  that consists of 1000 scenes with a length of 20 stimes20second20\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{s} with a frequency of 2 Hztimes2hertz2\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{Hz}.\nWe use the official training, validation and test set split and the seven object classes required for the tracking benchmark [ref]7. Metrics: \nWe report performance using the metrics as defined in the nuScenes benchmark [ref]7: These include the  average multi object tracking accuracy (AMOTA) as well as the  average multi object tracking precision (AMOTP). Additionally, we report the  number of identity switches (IDS),  number of track fragmentations (FRAG) and  number of mostly tracked trajectories (MT) as secondary metrics. For the full metric definitions and further details, we refer to [ref]7 . Training Configuration: \nTo increase comparability and reproducibility, we closely follow the settings proposed in MUTR3D [ref]12. Each training sample consists of three consecutive frames. The geometric and latent motion models assume a constant velocity and no turn-rate transformation for each object, as used in [ref]12. We leave the integration of more complex dynamics models to future work. As in previous works  [ref]12, bi-partite matching and the Hungarian algorithm are used to match tracked objects of the current frame with the ground truth. We use Focal-Loss [ref]31 as classification loss and L1-Loss for bounding box regression. In the training phase, previously matched track queries are always matched to their corresponding ground truth objects. As in  [ref]12, we drop tracked queries with a probability pd​r​o​p=0.1subscript𝑝𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝0.1p_{drop}=0.1 and spawn false positive tracks with a probability of pf​p=0.3subscript𝑝𝑓𝑝0.3p_{fp}=0.3. During inference, non-confirmed tracks are kept as inactive for five frames to handle full occlusions over multiple time steps. We train all models for 24 epochs with the same random seed on four NVIDIA-V100 GPUs using a batch size of four and a ResNet-101 backbone . As proposed in [ref]12, the transformer utilizes l=6𝑙6l=6 decoder layers, q=300𝑞300q=300 detection queries for each frame and a latent dimension of dl=256subscript𝑑𝑙256d_{l}=256 spread over h=8ℎ8h=8 heads of dimension dh=dl/h=32subscript𝑑ℎsubscript𝑑𝑙ℎ32d_{h}=d_{l}/h=32. This is also used as configuration of the proposed lmm. All experiments use the training schedule proposed in DETR3D  that utilizes a learning rate of 2​e−42superscript𝑒42e^{-4}, a cosine annealing learning rate schedule and AdamW . We initialize the model with an already trained MUTR3D checkpoint to avoid retraining and keep the image backbone and  feature pyramid network (FPN) fixed. To initialize the newly introduced lmm, we propose a simple yet effective pretraining scheme: For each sample in the dataset we store the tracking results, consisting of latent queries as well as decoded object proposals from MUTR3D [ref]12 and train the lmm to predict the state of the latent object query vectors of the next frame.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: with a frequency of 2 Hztimes2hertz2\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{Hz}.\nWe use the official training, validation and test set split and the seven object classes required for the tracking benchmark [ref]7.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
