      "content": "Paper Title: WEmbSim: A Simple yet Effective Metric for Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCaptioning Vs. Machine Translation: Caption generation has similarities to other natural language generation tasks, in particular machine translation and abstractive summarisation. Image captioning can be thought of as translating images into text. However, not all the contents of an image should be described in the caption: it is expected that the background for example would not be described except if it were particularly relevant to the main action occurring in the image. Given the similarities to machine translation and abstract summarisation, it is natural to expect that metrics for those tasks would be useful for the evaluation of captions. However, there are some important differences in the generated text.\nFirst, captions are normally short, single sentences; rather than paragraphs of complex sentences. Second, the possible text of captions is restricted by the domain of things that people photograph. While almost any idea can be put in text and translated; there are a wide range of subjects from intangible concepts to non-visually-interesting events, that will never be photographed, and thus never need captions generated for them. Automatic Evaluation Metrics: A number of automatic evaluation metrics have been proposed for captioning, which can be categorized into supervised [ref]15, , [ref]17 and unsupervised [ref]18, ,  methods. The work presented here, falls in the latter category. Textual Similarity-based Metrics:\nMajority of existing caption evaluation metrics capture the linguistic correspondence between the candidate and the reference captions to generate an assessment score. Metrics such as BLEU , METEOR  and CIDEr [ref]18 measure the n-gram overlap between the candidate and reference captions for evaluation. Such n-gram based metrics rely on word overlaps, therefore, their performance is dependent on the representativeness of the set of reference captions. However, exploiting linguistic information beyond the lexical level, i.e. using pre-trained embeddings helps remedy this issue by extending the reference lexicon. Thus, we believe that metrics which are based on distributed sentence representations are more promising for caption evaluation. SPICE , which is a sophisticated semantic metric, estimates the caption quality using a graph-based representation of captions. It relies on semantic parsers and completely ignores the syntactic quality of candidate captions. However, the competitive performance of SPICE shows that measuring the similarities between the semantic representation of captions is useful for caption evaluation. WMD , which is an embedding-based measure, was originally proposed to measure document similarity. It tends to overly penalize candidate captions which are shorter in length compared to the reference captions . Moreover, it is also computationally expensive compared to WEmbSim (Sec. III-C). Visual Content-based Metrics:\nTIGER  and VIFIDEL  are recently proposed metrics which use image content for caption evaluation. TIGEr uses a sophisticated pipeline to project the image (source) and text (target) into a common semantic space for quality assessment. VIFIDEL is an extension of WMD and uses word embedding’s as a bridge for matching content in images and textual descriptions. The performance of TIGEr and VIFIDEL is highly dependent on correct visual detections. VIFIDEL prefers systems that just spit out correct object detections. Thus blurring the line between a list of object detections and captions. Textual Vs. Visual Content-based Metrics:\nMajority of the caption evaluation measures rely on textual similarity to assess the caption quality, presuming that the reference caption sufficiently reflects the visual information. Thus, the quality of references play a crucial role in the case of text-similarity based measures. However, similar is the case with visual evaluation methods such as VIFIDEL which rely on visual detectors to accurately detect the objects. Moreover, comparing visual (source) and textual (target) information is not a straightforward task, and greatly adds to the complexity. Supervised Metrics:\nSupervised metrics such as NNEval [ref]15 and LCEval  combine existing metrics into a single unified measure, which has shown improvement in performance. However, the drawbacks of learned metrics are their high complexity and subjectivity to the training examples. Sums of Skip-gram-like Embeddings: The general idea of using sums of skip-gram-like embeddings to represent the meaning of phrases was presented in . FastText, GloVE and Word2vec are all skipgram-like, in that they have a linear relationship between the input embedding and the log of the probability of co-occurring words. Due to this linear-log relationship, a sum of embeddings has an approximately linear-log relationship with the probability of words co-occurring with all the words in the sum (i.e., the intersection of the individual concurrences). This is similar to what would be predicted by a skip-gram-like formulation if the phrase being embedded had been treated as a single token. Thus by the distributional hypothesis (‘Words that occur in the same context tend to have similar meaning’ ), such a sum of words is expected to characterize the sentence meaning. Authors in  considered a similar approach to measure the sentence similarity as part of their method for extractive summarisation. They found that using sums of embeddings, rather than more complex methods to generate sentence representations gave a superior performance. Authors in  and  found that the idea of using simple mean of embeddings shows strong performances in capturing sentence meaning. Cosine Similarity: The use of the cosine similarity as a measure of correspondence between natural language strings, dates back to the work of 0 on latent semantic indexing (LSI). This approach was used in information retrieval, to find the most similar documents, based on LSI matrix. LSI vectors are dimensionally reduced word-document occurrence matrices, which often use a weighting that is proportional to with point-wise mutual information (e.g., tdf-if). Skip-gram-like word embeddings are effectively dimensionally reduced word-word occurrence matrices, using a weighting that is proportional to the point-wise mutual information 1. The efficacy of sums of embeddings as sentence representations has been advocated in a number of research areas , ; and the cosine similarity has been very commonly used as a measure , 2. Despite the success of simple mean of embeddings-based measures in other related domains, their effectiveness for image caption evaluation has never been analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which evaluates the effectiveness of such a measure for captioning, across a number of benchmark datasets. An unpublished concurrent work 3 uses pre-trained BERT embeddings and token-level computations to evaluate the similarity between two captions. In contrast, our metric is based on sentence-level representations, and is comparatively simpler. We focus on using feature-based strategies for language representations such as ELMo and Word2vec to avoid the overhead of including the Transformer based encoder architecture, which is used by BERTScore. Moreover, what we are proposing is a framework, which is not confined to a particular embedding technique.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: and thus never need captions generated for them. Automatic Evaluation Metrics: A number of automatic evaluation metrics have been proposed for captioning, which can be categorized into supervised [ref]15, , [ref]17 and unsupervised [ref]18, ,  methods.
