      "content": "Paper Title: Embedded Graph Convolutional Networks for Real-Time Event Data Processing on SoC FPGAs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, the topic of hardware acceleration of graph neural networks for event data processing has not yet been addressed. Therefore, in this section, we present the two most closely related topics: selected works on general accelerators for graph networks on FPGAs, and point cloud data processing on FPGAs. Dedicated hardware accelerators for GNNs on FPGAs have been developed to improve the efficiency of graph processing. In [ref]31, a method was introduced for processing large, static graphs in smaller segments to overcome FPGA memory constraints.\nThe study  focused on developing a lightweight hardware accelerator for FPGAs. A co-designed software and hardware solution was proposed to address the challenges of irregular computation and memory access in GCNs. Other literature, such as the work [ref]33, discusses FPGA-based accelerators for binarised GCNs, describing various hardware optimisations to significantly reduce resource usage. In , an FPGA accelerator for Temporal GNNs was implemented. It updated temporal information about specific vertices and pruned vertices ‘distant’ in the context of time during the inference stage. Additionally, there have been efforts to create FPGA accelerators specifically for processing point-cloud data. In , the EdgeConv layer and KNN (k-nearest neighbour) method were employed to process point clouds by finding neighbours and connecting them with edges, enabling full-fledged graph processing. A similar approach was adopted in , which utilised an FPGA platform for the KNN construction part of a GCN network.  introduces an extremely tiny framework of point cloud processing utilising pillar encoders. The work  presented a hardware implementation of the PointNet architecture, achieving a processing time of 19.8 ms for 4096 points from LiDAR on the AMD Xilinx’s ZCU104 platform. Similarly, [ref]39 implemented the PointNet architecture on an FPGA for pathfinding and obstacle avoidance in a cloud of 1400 points. However, both works processed data without creating a graph; neither vertices were interconnected by edges nor their relationships were defined. A critical observation among these studies is the lack of focus on dynamic graph updates. Works utilising GCNs present data processing solutions where the point cloud and vertices are predetermined. In contrast, works focusing on processing data with LiDAR process the data without considering edges between vertices, which does not meet the definition of a graph and limits the relative position information between vertices. In the case of event data, it is crucial to process events asynchronously, dynamically generate the graph and utilise the relationships between vertices. The static nature of graphs and the lack of edge consideration in the current hardware acceleration approaches represent a gap that we address in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: for graph networks on FPGAs, and point cloud data processing on FPGAs.
