      "content": "Paper Title: Combinatorial Pure Exploration of Causal Bandits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) is a classical framework in sequential decision making  .\nIn each round, a learner selects one arm based on the reward feedback from the previous rounds, and receives a random reward of the selected arm sampled from an unknown distribution,\nwith the goal of accumulating as much rewards as possible over T𝑇T rounds.\nThis framework models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in sequential decision making —\nwhether one should select the best arm so far based on the past observations or one should try some arms that have not been played much.\nPure exploration is an important variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, where the goal of the learner is not to accumulate reward but\nto identify the best arm through possibly adaptive explorations of arms.\nPure exploration of MAB typically corresponds to a testing phase where we do not need to pay penalty for exploration, and it has wide applications in\nonline recommendation, advertising, drug testing, etc. Causal bandits, first introduced by [ref]19, integrates causal inference 1 with multi-armed bandits.\nIn causal bandits, we have a causal graph structure G=(𝑿∪{Y}∪𝑼,E)𝐺𝑿𝑌𝑼𝐸G=(\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\}\\cup\\boldsymbol{U},E), where 𝑿∪{Y}𝑿𝑌\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\} are observable causal variables with Y𝑌Y being a special reward variable, 𝑼𝑼\\boldsymbol{U} are unobserved hidden variables, and E𝐸E\nis the set of causal edges between pairs of variables.\nFor simplicity, we consider binary variables in this paper.\nThe arms are the interventions on variables 𝑺⊆𝑿𝑺𝑿\\boldsymbol{S}\\subseteq\\boldsymbol{X} together with the choice of null intervention (natural observation), i.e.\nthe arm (action) set is A⊆{a=d​o​(𝑺=𝒔)∣𝑺⊆𝑿,𝒔∈{0,1}|𝑺|}𝐴conditional-set𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑺𝒔formulae-sequence𝑺𝑿𝒔superscript01𝑺A\\subseteq\\{a=do(\\boldsymbol{S}=\\boldsymbol{s})\\mid\\boldsymbol{S}\\subseteq\\boldsymbol{X},\\boldsymbol{s}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{|\\boldsymbol{S}|}\\} with d​o​()∈A𝑑𝑜𝐴do()\\in A,\nwhere d​o​(𝑺=𝒔)𝑑𝑜𝑺𝒔do(\\boldsymbol{S}=\\boldsymbol{s}) is the standard notation for intervening the causal graph by setting 𝑺𝑺\\boldsymbol{S} to 𝒔𝒔\\boldsymbol{s} 1, and d​o​()𝑑𝑜do() means null intervention.\nThe reward of an action a𝑎a is the random outcome of Y𝑌Y when we intervene with action a𝑎a, and thus the expected reward is 𝔼​[Y∣a=d​o​(𝑺=𝒔)]𝔼delimited-[]conditional𝑌𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑺𝒔\\mathbb{E}[Y\\mid a=do(\\boldsymbol{S}=\\boldsymbol{s})].\nIn each round, one action in A𝐴A is played, and the random outcomes of all variables in 𝑿∪{Y}𝑿𝑌\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\} are observed.\nGiven the causal graph G𝐺G, but without knowing its causal inference distributions among nodes, the task of combinatorial pure exploration (CPE) of causal bandits is to (adaptively) select\nactions in each round,\nobserve the feedback from all observable random variables, so that in the end the learner can identify the best or nearly best actions. Causal bandits are useful in many real scenarios. In drug testing, the physicians wants to adjust the dosage of some particular drugs to treat the patient. In policy design, the policy-makers select different actions to reduce the spread of disease. Existing studies on CPE of causal bandits either requires the knowledge of P​(𝑷𝒂​(Y)∣a)𝑃conditional𝑷𝒂𝑌𝑎P(\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(Y)\\mid a) for all action a𝑎a or only consider causal graphs without hidden variables, and the algorithms proposed are not fully adaptive to reward gaps\n[ref]19 5. In this paper, we study fully adaptive pure exploration algorithms and analyze their gap-dependent sample complexity bounds in the fixed-confidence setting.\nMore specifically, given a confidence bound δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1) and an error bound ε𝜀\\varepsilon, we aim at designing adaptive algorithms that output an action such that\nwith probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, the expected reward difference between the output and the optimal action is at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nThe algorithms should be fully adaptive in the follow two senses.\nFirst, it should adapt to the reward gaps between suboptimal and optimal actions similar to existing adaptive pure exploration bandit algorithms, such that actions with larger gaps should be explored less.\nSecond, it should adapt to the observational data from causal bandit feedback, such that actions with enough observations already do not need further interventional rounds for exploration, similar to\nexisting causal bandit algorithms.\nWe are able to integrate both types of adaptivity into one algorithmic framework, and with interaction between the two aspects, we achieve better adaptivity than either of them alone.\n First we introduce a particular term named gap-dependent observation threshold, which is a non-trivial gap-dependent extension for a similar term in [ref]19.\nThen we provide two algorithms, one for the binary generalized linear model (BGLM) and one for the general model with hidden variables.\nThe sample complexity of both algorithms contains the gap-dependent observation threshold that we introduced, which shows significant improvement comparing to the prior work.\nIn particular, our algorithm for BGLM achieves a sample complexity polynomial to the graph size, while all prior algorithms for general graphs have exponential sample complexity;\nand our algorithm for general graphs match a lower bound we prove in the paper.\nTo our best knowledge, our paper is the first work considering a CPE algorithm specifically designed for BGLM, and the first work considering CPE on graphs with hidden variables, while\nall prior studies either assume no hidden variables or assume knowing distribution P​(𝑷𝒂​(Y)∣a)𝑃conditional𝑷𝒂𝑌𝑎P(\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(Y)\\mid a) for parent of reward variable 𝑷𝒂​(Y)𝑷𝒂𝑌\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(Y) and all action a𝑎a, which is not a reasonable assumption. To summarize, our contribution is to propose the first set of CPE algorithms on causal graphs with hidden variables\nand fully adaptive to both the reward gaps and the observational causal data.\nThe algorithm on BGLM\nis the first to achieve a gap-dependent sample complexity polynomial to the graph size, while the algorithm for general graphs improves significantly on sample complexity and matches\na lower bound.\nDue to the space constraint, further materials including experimental results, an algorithm for the fixed-budget setting, and all proofs are moved to the supplementary material. Related Work.  \nCausal bandit is proposed by [ref]19, who discuss the simple regret for parallel graphs and general graphs with known probability distributions\nP​(𝑷𝒂​(Y)∣a)𝑃conditional𝑷𝒂𝑌𝑎P(\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(Y)\\mid a).\n9 extend algorithms on parallel graphs to graphs without back-door paths, and  extend the results to the general graphs. All of them are either regard P​(𝑷𝒂​(Y)∣a)𝑃conditional𝑷𝒂𝑌𝑎P(\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(Y)\\mid a) as prior knowledge, or consider only atomic intervention.\nThe study by 5 is the only one considering the general graphs with combinatorial action set, but their algorithm cannot work on causal graphs with hidden variables.\nAll the above pure exploration studies consider simple regret criteria that is not gap-dependent.\nCumulative regret is considered in 9  .\nTo our best knowledge, 3 is the only one discussing gap-dependent bound for pure exploration of causal bandits for the fixed-budget setting,\nbut it only considers the soft interventions (changing conditional distribution P​(X|𝑷𝒂​(X))𝑃conditional𝑋𝑷𝒂𝑋P(X|\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(X))) on one single node, which is different from causal bandits defined in [ref]19. Pure exploration of multi-armed bandit has been extensively studied in the fixed-confidence or fixed-budget setting     .\nPAC pure exploration is a generalized setting aiming to find the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-optimal arm instead of exactly optimal arm  7 .\nIn this paper, we utilize the adaptive LUCB algorithm in .\nCPE has also been studied for multi-armed bandits and linear bandits, etc.(,,), but the feedback model in these studies either have feedback at the base arm level or have full or partial bandit feedback,\nwhich are all very different from the causal bandit feedback considered in this paper. The binary generalized linear model (BGLM) is studied in 2  for cumulative regret MAB problems.\nWe borrow the maximum likelihood estimation method and its result in 2  for our BGLM part,\nbut its integration with our adaptive sampling algorithm for the pure exploration setting is new.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: to a testing phase where we do not need to pay penalty for exploration, and it has wide applications in\nonline recommendation, advertising, drug testing, etc. Causal bandits, first introduced by [ref]19, integrates causal inference 1 with multi-armed bandits.\nIn causal bandits, we have a causal graph structure G=(𝑿∪{Y}∪𝑼,E)𝐺𝑿𝑌𝑼𝐸G=(\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\}\\cup\\boldsymbol{U},E), where\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
