SIXO-q uses a parameterless quadrature twist, so we skip twist optimization and use biased reparameterization gradients of the SIXO bound to fit the model and proposal. For the quadrature twist we use Gauss-Hermite quadrature with degree five. For SIXO-DRE, we model the twist using the backwards RNN method introduced in Section 3.2. The twist is parameterized with a one-layer RNN with 128 hidden units and a one-layer MLP with 128 hidden units. The twist is learned using the alternating DRE method described in Section 3.2. We generate a batch of 32,000 synthetic trajectories from the current model, and perform minibatch stochastic gradient descent using the ADAM optimizer  with a learning rate of 3×10−33superscript1033\\times 10^{-3} and a minibatch size of 64. We apply 1,000 twist updates (corresponding to two epochs) and then apply 1,000 updates to the model and proposal. The model and proposal parameters are updated using the ADAM optimizer  with a learning rate of 1×10−41superscript1041\\times 10^{-4}. We use four particles per SMC sweep, and average across four datasets per model and proposal update. Individual FIVO and SIXO-q seeds for each experiment were run using four CPU cores, 24Gb of memory, and had a wallclock time of no longer than twenty four hours. SIXO-DRE had a longer runtime of five days, however, competitive results were achieved within two days. We compare three methods: FIVO (learning 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta}), SIXO-q (learning 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta} with a quadrature twist) and SIXO-DRE (learning 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta} and 𝝍𝝍\\bm{\\psi} using a DRE twist). All methods use the biased score-function gradients of (18). We show the median and quartiles across five random seeds. Each μnsubscript𝜇𝑛\\mu_{n} is initialized from 𝒩​(0,0.3)𝒩00.3\\mathcal{N}(0,0.3) (with n∈1,…​22𝑛1…22n\\in 1,\\ldots 22). ϕnsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑛\\phi_{n} is learned in the unconstrained space ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}, and is transformed to   [ref]1 by passing the raw ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi through a hyperbolic tangent function. The unconstrained ϕnsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑛\\phi_{n}’s are initialized from 𝒩​(arctanh​(0.1),0.3)𝒩arctanh0.10.3\\mathcal{N}(\\mathrm{arctanh}(0.1),0.3), and log⁡βnsubscript𝛽𝑛\\log\\beta_{n} is initialized from 𝒩​(log⁡1.0,0.3)𝒩1.00.3\\mathcal{N}(\\log 1.0,0.3). Finally, log⁡Qnsubscript𝑄𝑛\\log Q_{n} is initialized from 𝒩​(log⁡1.0,0.3)𝒩1.00.3\\mathcal{N}(\\log 1.0,0.3). The train bound value we report is taken as the average train bound once converged. We also report ℒBPF2048superscriptsubscriptℒBPF2048\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{BPF}}^{2048} as the bound evaluated using a BPF with 2,048 particles. This tests the performance of the learned model opposed to inference performance. A one-way ANOVA  rejected the null hypothesis that the mean train bounds are equal (p<0.0001𝑝0.0001p<0.0001), and a post-hoc Dunnett T3 test  found the mean SIXO-DRE bound to be the highest (p<0.01𝑝0.01p<0.01 for all pairs). For the ℒBPF2048superscriptsubscriptℒBPF2048\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{BPF}}^{2048} values, a one-way ANOVA failed to reject the null hypothesis that the train bounds are equal (p=0.25>0.05𝑝0.250.05p=0.25>0.05), so all entries are bolded. This methodology was recommended in Sauder and DeMars . We also report the performance on a held-out dataset constructed from the new data since Naesseth et al.  was published. The test ℒBPF2048superscriptsubscriptℒBPF2048\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{BPF}}^{2048} we report is the bound evaluated using a BPF with 2,048 particles, averaged across all checkpoints after 75%percent7575\\% of training.
