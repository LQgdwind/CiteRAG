      "content": "Paper Title: Individual Fairness under Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is recent concern that we are in the midst of a discrimination crisis within the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)¬† [ref]50  [ref]48 . Rightfully, the AI/ML community has conducted vast research to study the quantification and mitigation of algorithmic bias, which is critical for the use of algorithmic decision-making systems in domains of high societal impact such as criminal justice¬†, healthcare¬†, predictive policing¬†, and employment¬†. Thus far, most studies\ntackle the problem by proposing fairness constraints via regularizers/optimizations at the group level: first identify a sensitive attribute, e.g., race or gender, as a potential source of bias among the collection of high-level groups; then achieve parity for some fairness statistics of the classifier, e.g. the prediction accuracy and true positive rate, across the predefined groups¬†. These group fairness approaches, however, are inapplicable when class label uncertainty is present¬†. Additionally, while group fairness enjoys the merit of easy operationalization, its aggregative characteristic makes it easy to fail¬†. In contrast, the individual fairness approach alleviates these drawbacks by evaluating a finer granularity of fairness at individual level.\nThe compelling notion of individual fairness is proposed in the seminal work of¬†[ref]14, which requires similarly situated individuals to receive similar probability distributions over class labels to prevent inequitable treatment. Individual fairness, without the need to explicitly identify sensitive attributes, is much less restrictive than group fairness. However, the Lipschitz condition required in existing individual fairness literature is a nontrivial task to satisfy, as 1. the Lipschitz constant specification is hard due to the difference in distance metrics between the input and outcome spaces;\n2. distance calibration is required as the absolute distance comparison in the Lipschitz condition tends to fail in calibrating differences among different individuals¬†.\nSuch difficulty was also pointed out in  but only resulted in additional efforts of metric learning, whereas our rank-based method removes the need of the Lipschitz constant and distance calibration by avoiding the absolute distance value comparison. Another major obstacle in the real-world applicability of individual (and also group) fairness is the assumption of full class label availability, which fails when there is uncertainty in class labels due to censoring, a phenomenon where the information about the event of interest is partially known¬† 6   .\nConsidering an example from a clinical prediction task (Figure¬†1), for censored individuals d2subscriptùëë2d_{2} and d4subscriptùëë4d_{4}, the true time to relapse or hospital discharge is unknown, causing the uncertainty in class labels. Due to the inability to handle censorship information, existing fairness studies quantify and mitigate bias by focusing on the proportion of data with assured class label, thus either dropping observations with uncertain class labels¬†   or omitting the censorship information¬†  . However, removing them would bias the results towards the individuals with known class labels¬†  . In summary, there is a need for an algorithm that addresses individual fairness in ML under uncertainty, an under-explored area of research, with two requirements: i) Free from the Lipschitz condition resulting from the principle of individual fairness. Without this, the algorithm may have limited use cases due to the metric calibration between the input and output spaces. ii) Quantifying and mitigating bias under uncertainty. The algorithm should not ignore the uncertainty in censored data or the censorship information to avoid bias. To tackle the aforementioned issues, this paper conducts an initial investigation of individual fairness under uncertainty for a fairness guarantee more in line with realistic assumptions across individuals and free from the Lipschitz condition. Our individual fairness measure, named Fair Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (FNDCG), is motivated by the same individual fairness principle¬†[ref]14 that similar individuals should be treated similarly, while formulated as the correlation of similarities in the feature and risk spaces respectively, establishing a new fairness measure usable on censored data. Along with FNDCG, we also propose a corresponding algorithm to address discrimination involving censored individuals. Our method, named fairIndvCox, augments the standard model of survival analysis, the Cox proportional hazard model, by being aware of individual fairness while learning the parameters of risk prediction. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to quantify and mitigate bias under the individual fairness principle, but from a ranking perspective, with uncertainty present, and free of the Lipschitz condition. Our major contributions are summarized as follows: We formulate a new research problem of individual fairness guarantee in learning with uncertainty. We devise FNDCG, a new notion of individual fairness to measure bias on censored data. Defined with the correlation of similarity in the feature space and the one in the risk prediction space, FNDCG does not require Lipschitz condition and complete class labels. We propose a debiasing algorithm named fairIndvCox for bias mitigation in censorship settings, by incorporating our individual fairness measure into the standard model of survival analysis. We evaluate our debiasing algorithm on four real-world datasets with censorship, comparing it with four survival analysis algorithms and its Lipschitz variant. This confirms the utility of the proposed approach in practice. Further analysis also illustrates the trade-off between individual fairness and predictive performance. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section¬†2, we describe related work in fair machine learning and learning with uncertainty, followed by the preliminaries of survival analysis and the problem definition in Section¬†3. In Section¬†4, we propose our notion of individual fairness under uncertainty and corresponding survival model with an individual fairness specification. In Section¬†5, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our learning algorithm on real-world survival analysis datasets and provide qualitative analysis on the effect of the hyper-parameters on the model. Finally, we conclude and provide future directions in Section¬†6.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: There is recent concern that we are in the midst of a discrimination crisis within the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)¬† [ref]50  [ref]48 .
