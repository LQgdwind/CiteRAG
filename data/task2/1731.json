      "content": "Paper Title: A Whole Brain Probabilistic Generative Model: Toward Realizing Cognitive Architectures for Developmental Robots\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInfants acquire a wide range of cognitive capabilities through daily physical and social interactions with their environment. Through this developmental process, they acquire basic physical skills (e.g., reaching and grasping), perceptual skills (e.g., object recognition and phoneme recognition), and social skills (e.g., linguistic communication and intention estimation) 2.\nThis open-ended learning process involving many types of modalities, tasks, and interactions is often referred to as lifelong learning  .\nThe central question in next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) and developmental robotics is how to build an integrative cognitive system capable of lifelong learning and human-like behavior in various environments such as homes, offices, and outdoors. In this paper, inspired by the whole brain architecture (WBA) approach, using a whole brain probabilistic generative model (WB-PGM), we introduce the idea of building an integrative cognitive system that can alternatively be referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI) . A cognitive architecture is a hypothesis about the mechanisms of human intelligence underlying our behaviors .\nThe study of cognitive architecture involves developing a presumably standard model of the human mind [ref]88.\nIt integrates a wide range of cognitive capabilities: representation and memory, problem-solving and planning, learning, reflection, interaction, and the social aspects of cognition.\nNotably, interaction includes perception, motor control, and the use of language.\nSocial aspects of cognition include intention sharing, emotional expression, collaborative control, and language use for communication and collaboration.\nIn the literature on cognitive and developmental robotics, a robot is required to integrate a wide range of sensor information and perform a variety of cognitive tasks to explore environments, grasp and handle objects, and interact with people  74  . In such contexts, a cognitive architecture is required to integrate various elemental cognitive modules. To build a cognitive architecture that addresses the functions of the entire brain, it is desirable to describe the computation of the entire brain with as few types of theoretical and computational elements (primitive structures, circuits, computational nodes, and so on) as possible (ideally, one type). The probabilistic generative model (PGM) is a strong candidate for a computational model for this purpose. A PGM is a probabilistic description of how causes generate sensations, that is, observed data. That is, PGM is a statistical model of the joint probability distribution on observable data .\nPGMs learn to predict these observations.\nThis is also often referred to as predictive coding and the free energy principle (FEP). FEP is a powerful idea for explaining the human brain.\nIt is a normative framework for Bayesian inference and learning of the human brain and is based on a PGM  .\nAccording to the FEP, perception and action can be modeled as self-evidencing (as described in Section 4.1).\nMany types of elemental cognitive modules have been developed based on PGMs; including hidden Markov models (HMMs), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), variational autoencoder (VAE), and partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)     5 as described in Section 3. Most PGMs can be represented using probabilistic graphical models.\nFor a human-like developmental cognitive system, unsupervised (or self-supervised) learning is required. PGMs are known to be suitable for unsupervised learning.\nSupervised learning using human-annotated training data, on which most current AI systems, such as image recognition and machine translation systems (i.e, single-purpose cognitive modules), depend is not a suitable approach to achieve lifelong learning   . Using human-annotated training data is impractical for lifelong learning conducted by autonomous agents.\nIn addition to being capable of unsupervised learning, PGMs representing elemental cognitive functions can be integrated to learn together (as described in Section 4). Owing to these features, we construct a cognitive architecture based on PGMs. Developing a cognitive architecture by integrating elemental cognitive modules provide us with a large degree of freedom with combinatorial complexity.\nWe can reduce the design space of the integrative cognitive system using the human or animal brain architectures as a reference model.\nIn the rapidly advancing field of neuroscience, researchers are beginning to have some comprehensive knowledge of the human and animal brain architectures and their anatomy, as well as the various neural activities that take place in it.\nHowever, such knowledge is not organized in a way that is suitable for effectively constraining the design space of cognitive architectures.\nTherefore, using the WBA approach, we define a data format called the brain reference architecture (BRA), which is a reference model of the brain, and describe knowledge in the field of neuroscience in a standardized way suitable for that application . Adjacent research areas include biologically inspired cognitive architectures    and cognitive computational neuroscience , which is an interdisciplinary field of cognitive science and computational neuroscience. However, compared to the BRA, these fields have not made progress in accumulating design data in a standardized manner. In neuroinformatics  25 , which develops data and knowledge bases for neuroscience, progress has been made in experimental data on anatomical structures  and physiological phenomena 24. However, no progress has been made in accumulating data such that it can be used to design cognitive and behavioral functions, as in the BRA-driven development. However, even when we seek to build an AGI based on human-brain architectures, that is, using the WBA approach and having a reference model for the architecture, two challenges must be overcome.\nFirst, there are numerous alternative machine learning approaches to choose from to develop and integrate elemental models into a cognitive architecture. Nevertheless, if each elemental cognitive module is developed based on random machine learning approach, it will become difficult to integrate them in a coherent framework. Second, developmental cognitive architectures should be able to make all cognitive modules learn together based on the real-world sensory-motor information obtained by a robot.\nThis is crucial for achieving lifelong learning. However, most elemental cognitive modules, that is, AI functions, have been developed independently under different design principles.\nTo overcome this problem, a PGM-based approach is proposed in this paper to create cognitive architectures for developmental robots.\nWe propose that developing elemental cognitive modules and integrating them based on the theory of PGMs, specifically, the SERKET framework, can solve the above-mentioned problems  11 1 (as described in Section 4.2). Inspired by the human brain architecture, we propose an approach wherein a cognitive architecture is built by integrating PGM-based cognitive modules to fully mimic the human cognitive system. The framework for the integrative model is called WB-PGM.\nThis perspective paper describes the approach and the rationale, the current status, and the future challenges of WB-PGM.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 describes the rationale and design principle for our approach including its background. Section 3 reviews the relevant literature on elemental cognitive modules that can constitute the WB-PGM.\nSection 4 describes the PGM-based cognitive system integrating multimodal information (i.e., the world model) and the SERKET framework, which enables the efficient integration of PGM-based elemental cognitive modules.\nSection 5 describes a possible example of a WB-PGM and the future path of the development, interdisciplinary communication, and collaboration, specifically the fusion of AI and brain science. Section 6 summarizes the conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [88]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]88: is a hypothesis about the mechanisms of human intelligence underlying our behaviors .\nThe study of cognitive architecture involves developing a presumably standard model of the human mind [ref]88.\nIt integrates a wide range of cognitive capabilities: representation and memory, problem-solving and planning, learning, reflection, interaction, and the social aspects of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
