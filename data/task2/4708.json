      "content": "Paper Title: High-order Multi-view Clustering for Generic Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerally, multi-view clustering (MVC) methods focus on the global\nconsensus and complementary information carried by multiple views to improve the\nperformance  . Traditional MVC methods mainly focus on non-graph data and obtain the clustering results based on attributed features.   focus on handle incomplete multi-view clustering via learned common representations with semantic consistency from different views. And graph-based methods, like   , aim to learn a consensus graph which used to obtain the clustering results from multiple attributes of data.\n is a parameter-free auto-weighted multiple graph learning framework. Subspace-based methods find clusters via mapping the high-dimensional data points to several low-dimensional linear subspaces [ref]20.  learns a joint subspace representation across all views and performs spectral clustering on the learned representation.\nMoreover,   propose mul-ti-view spectral clustering based on adaptive learning mechanism.\nAttributed graph data contain both attributes and topological structures, and plentiful attributed graph MVC methods have been proposed to cluster graph nodes.  focuses on large-scale multi-view data and bipartite\ngraph is imposed to approximate the similarity graph.  proposes a multi-view network embedding method that learns multiple relations by a unified network embedding framework.\n is a robust multi-view spectral clustering method and uses a shared low-rank transition probability matrix derived from each single view as input to standard Markov chain method for clustering.\n develops two methods that learn a shared graph from multiple graphs by using two weighting strategies.  proposes multi-view graph clustering method based on graph auto-encoder and takes into account the informative view selected by modularity.  is an attributed graph clustering method that exploits graph filtering and high-order neighborhood information.  is a GCN-based method and mainly solves graph structured data with multi-view attributes. [ref]30 and [ref]31 develop two methods based on contrastive learning: COMPLETER and MVGRL. COMPLETER performs data recovery and consistency learning of incomplete multi-view data simultaneously. MVGRL performs contrastive learning between two diffusion matrices transformed from the adjacency matrix to obtain clustering-favorable representation.\nWe can see that different methods are developed separately to tackle graph and feature data. In fact, feature and graph can complement each other. Therefore, we develop a generic framework, which can not only be applied on non-graph but also on attributed graph data through graph filtering. More importantly, our method can explore the interaction between feature and graph.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: is a parameter-free auto-weighted multiple graph learning framework.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
