Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Evolution of Out-of-Distribution Robustness Throughout Fine-Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct our experiments using a diverse set of model architectures and sizes to make sure the observed phenomenon are general and not tied to any particular choice. We study two groups of models. ImageNet pre-trained. The first group consists of AlexNet , ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-152 [ref]9, VGG11 BN [ref]37, and WideResNet-50-2 , where we use the PyTorch  implementation and weights coming from torchvision.models v0.8.2 where the models were pre-trained on ImageNet. When fine-tuning pre-trained ImageNet models on CIFAR-10, we always replace the original classification layer with a 10-class randomly initialized classification layer. Big Transfer (BiT). The second group of models consists of a series of models from Big Transfer (BiT) [ref]18. The BiT models all use a ResNet-v2 architecture , except that they replace all Batch Normalization  layers with Group Normalization  and use Weight Standardization  in all convolutional layers. Following [ref]18, we label the ResNet architectures by their depth and the widening factor for the hidden layers, for example R50x1, R101x3 and R152x4, which are the sizes we will consider in this work. The BiT model come in three different flavors: BiT-S, BiT-M and BiT-L, where S, M and L indicate if the pre-training was done on ILSVRC-2012 (which we denote as ImageNet-1k or just ImageNet) , ImageNet-21k  or JFT , respectively.\nIn addition, these models may be further fine-tuned, and \"1k\", \"21k\" or \"JFT\" indicates the dataset it was fine-tuned on. For example, BiT-M-R152x4-1k is the ResNet-152x4 model that was pre-trained on ImageNet-21k (\"M\") and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k (\"1k\"). We also consider a series of BiT models that were pre-trained by  on different random fractions of the JFT dataset with no additional fine-tuning in SectionÂ 5.3.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: the observed phenomenon are general and not tied to any particular choice.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
