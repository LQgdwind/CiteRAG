      "content": "Paper Title: LTC-SUM: Lightweight Client-driven Personalized Video Summarization Framework Using 2D CNN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main task of the thumbnail container analyzer is to detect the preferred events from T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums. Then, based on the selected T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums, generate a list of personalized S​e​g𝑆𝑒𝑔Seg and use them to produce a personalized summary. For this purpose, a lightweight 2D CNN model was designed to detect personalized events from each thumbnail. To detect the personalized thumbnail based on the preferred events of the user from each T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thum with high accuracy, the CNN model must be trained using thousands of images, which requires high processing GPU power. In this context, transfer learning  [ref]32 is useful, in which a pre-trained model is used for other purposes. This method was applied to train the EfficientNet-B0  , which was trained on a large-scale ImageNet  [ref]34 dataset to extract the frame-level spatial features of each thumbnail. Compared with other ConvNets, EfficientNet outperforms state-of-the-art architectures on ImageNet and has fewer parameters and FLOPS  . This makes EfficientNet   a suitable candidate for detecting personalized events from lightweight T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums. The backbone of the proposed network was based on EfficientNet-B0  . Figure 4 shows the proposed action recognition model used to process all the T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums and detect personalized events. An attention module derived from vortex pooling was used to improve the performance of the proposed network  . The attention module is more effective by using multibranch convolution with different dilation rates to aggregate contextual information. Different dilation rates can effectively improve the receptive field, consequently acquiring multilevel contextual information. The architecture of the vortex pooling used as an attention module is depicted in Figure 5. The proposed 2D CNN model was trained on the UCF101 dataset, which is a well-known action recognition dataset  . It consists of 133201332013320 videos taken from YouTube, which are divided into 101101101 action categories  . In the proposed approach, data augmentation is applied  [ref]37 to reduce overfitting; this method has been proven to be very effective. To train the model using the UCF101 dataset, each video was subsampled down to 40 frames. Before being provided as input to the network, all images were preprocessed by first cropping the center region, and then resizing them to 244×\\times244 pixels. A shear transformation was also performed at an angle of 20°, horizontal and vertical shift of 0.2, random rotation of 10°, and random horizontal flipping of images. The dataset is split into two subsets: training and testing – as suggested in  . The model is trained using a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9, and a learning rate of 0.01 – using the default weight decay value (SGDW)  . In the experiments, an early stopping mechanism was applied in the training process with a patience of ten epochs. The Keras toolbox was used for deep feature extraction, and a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU was used for implementation. The training data were fed in mini batches with a size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.001 for cost minimization, and there were one thousand iterations for learning the sequence patterns in the data. The action recognition accuracy analysis of the model is presented in Section 4.2. In the following section, the third component of the HLS client is described, which is the segments summarizer module.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: of the user from each T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thum with high accuracy, the CNN model must be trained using thousands of images, which requires high processing GPU power.
