      "content": "Paper Title: Branching Bisimilarity for Processes with Time-outs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStrong bisimilarity  is the default semantic equivalence on labelled transition systems (LTSs), modelling systems that move from state to state by performing discrete, uninterpreted actions. In [ref]11, it has been generalised, under the name strong reactive bisimilarity,\nto LTSs that feature, besides the hidden action τ𝜏\\tau , an unobservable time-out action tt{\\rm t} , modelling the end of a time-consuming activity from which we abstract. This addition significantly increases the expressiveness of the model [ref]10 [ref]11. Applied to the verification of realistic distributed systems, strong bisimilarity is too fine an equivalence, especially because it does not cater to abstraction from internal activity. Branching bisimilarity  is a variant that does abstract from internal activity, and lies at the basis of many verification toolsets  . The present paper generalises branching bisimilarity to LTSs with time-outs, thereby combining the virtues of [ref]11 and . It supports the resulting notion of branching reactive bisimilarity through a modal characterisation, congruence results for a standard process algebra with recursion, and a complete axiomatisation. The addition of the time-out action tt{\\rm t} aims at modelling the passage of time while staying in the realm of untimed process algebra. Here, “untimed” means that our framework does not facilitate measuring time, even though it models whether a system can pause in some state or not. We assume that the execution of any action is instantaneous; thus, time elapses in states only. The amount of time spent in a state is dictated by the interaction of the system with an external entity called its environment. We call a system reactive if it interacts with an environment able to allow or disallow visible actions. The environment represents a user or other systems, running in parallel, which has no control over τ𝜏\\tau or tt{\\rm t} actions. If X𝑋X is the set of visible actions currently allowed by the environment and the system can perform any transition labelled by an element of X∪{τ}fragmentsX{τ}X\\cup\\{\\tau\\} then it will perform one of those transitions immediately. When a visible action is performed, it triggers the environment to choose a new set of allowed actions. If the environment is allowing X𝑋X and the system cannot perform any transition labelled by τ𝜏\\tau or any allowed action, then the system is said to be idling. When the system idles, time-outs become executable, but the environment can also get impatient and choose a new X𝑋X before any time-out occurs. We have supposed that the environment cannot synchronise with the execution of a time-out, thus implying that, right after executing a time-out, the environment is still allowing the same set of allowed actions as before this execution. For example, the process a.P+t.(a.Q+τ.R)fragmentsa.Pt.(a.Qτ.R)a.P+{\\rm t}.(a.Q+\\tau.R) will never reach Q𝑄Q because, for the time-out to happen, the environment has to block a𝑎a and so a.Q+τ.Rfragmentsa.Qτ.Ra.Q+\\tau.R can only be reached when the environment blocks a𝑎a. In this case, the τ𝜏\\tau-transition is always executed before the environment can allow a𝑎a again. Similarly, strong and branching reactive bisimilarity satisfy the process algebraic law τ.P+t.Q=τ.Pfragmentsτ.Pt.Qτ.P\\tau.P+{\\rm t}.Q=\\tau.P, essentially giving τ𝜏\\tau priority over tt{\\rm t}. Whereas this could have been formalised through an operational semantics in which the process τ.P+t.Qfragmentsτ.Pt.Q\\tau.P+{\\rm t}.Q lacks an outgoing tt{\\rm t}-transition, here, and in [ref]11, we derive an LTS for a standard process algebra with time-outs in a way that treats tt{\\rm t} just like any other action. Instead, the priority of τ𝜏\\tau over tt{\\rm t} is implemented in the reactive bisimilarity: its says that even though the transition\nτ.P+t.Q→tQfragmentsτ.Pt.Qt→Q\\tau.P+{\\rm t}.Q\\xrightarrow{{\\rm t}}Q is present in our LTS, it will never be taken. This approach is not only simpler, it also generalises better to choices like b.P+t.Qfragmentsb.Pt.Qb.P+{\\rm t}.Q, where the priority of b𝑏b over tt{\\rm t} is conditional on the environment in which the system is placed, namely on whether or not this environment allows the b𝑏b-action to occur. From the system’s perspective, the environment can be in two kinds of states: either allowing a specific set of actions, or being triggered to change. Our model does not stipulate how much time the environment takes to choose a new set of allowed actions once triggered, or even if it will ever make such a choice. Thus, the system could perform some transitions while the environment is triggered, especially those labelled τ𝜏\\tau. In our view, the most natural way to see the environment is as another system executed in parallel, while enforcing synchronisation on all visible actions. This implies that the environment allows a set X𝑋X of actions when it idles in a state whose set of initial actions is X𝑋X, and the environment is triggered when it is not idling, especially when it can perform a τ𝜏\\tau-transition. In this paradigm, while the environment is triggered, any action can be allowed for a brief amount of time. However, there is no reason to believe that it will necessarily settle down on a specific set. For instance, this can happen if the environment reaches a divergence: an infinite sequence of τ𝜏\\tau-transitions. In [ref]7, seven (or nine) forms of branching bisimilarity are classified; they differ only in the treatment of divergence. In the present paper we are chiefly interested in divergence-free processes, on grounds that in the intuition of [ref]11 any sequence of τ𝜏\\tau-transitions could be executed in time zero; yet we do wish to allow infinite sequences of tt{\\rm t}-transitions.\nFor divergence-free process all these forms of branching bisimilarity coincide.\nNevertheless, we do not formally exclude divergences, and in their presence our branching reactive bisimilarity generalises the stability respecting branching bisimilarity of [ref]7, which differs from the default version from  through the presence of Clause 2.e of Definition 2.1. There does not exist a plausible reactive generalisation of the default version. Section 2 supplies the formal definition of branching reactive bisimilarity as well as its rooted version, which will be shown to be its congruence closure. It also provides equivalent definitions that reduce our bisimilarity to a non-reactive one and illustrate that branching reactive bisimilarity coincides with stability respecting branching bisimilarity in the absence of time-outs. Section 3 gives a modal characterisation of branching reactive bisimilarity and its rooted version on an extension of the Hennessy-Milner logic. Section 4 introduces the process algebra CCSPθtfragmentsCCSP𝜃𝑡\\mbox{CCSP}^{\\theta}_{t} along with an alternative characterisation of branching reactive bisimilarity that will be used to prove that rooted branching reactive bisimilarity is a full congruence for CCSPθtfragmentsCCSP𝜃𝑡\\mbox{CCSP}^{\\theta}_{t}. Section 5 displays a complete axiomatisation of our bisimilarity on different fragments of CCSPθtfragmentsCCSP𝜃𝑡\\mbox{CCSP}^{\\theta}_{t}. Most completeness proofs rely on standard techniques like equation merging, but the very last one uses a relatively new method called “canonical representatives”.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Strong bisimilarity  is the default semantic equivalence on labelled transition systems (LTSs), modelling systems that move from state to state by performing discrete, uninterpreted actions.
