      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Mixture Models with Expectation-Maximization for End-to-end Deep Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClustering a set of data points into several categories is generally done by learning a cluster representation, which acts as a basis to cluster the data points into homogeneous groups. The cluster representation is learned by following different approaches such as connectivity based , centroid based , distribution based , density modelling based  and subspace-based  methods. Mixture models fall under the distribution-based category, where a statistical distribution represents each cluster. GMM , in particular, maintains a Gaussian distribution for each cluster and updates those distributions and member assignment iteratively using the EM optimization . k-means  can also be thought of as a special case of GMM where the clusters are represented with untilted spheres. Since these traditional clustering algorithms are limited to hand-designed parameters hence limited representability, there have been efforts to incorporate neural networks to model advanced clusters  4 5 6 7 8. Notably, simple k-means is still being used in many deep clustering techniques [ref]3 5 9 [ref]20 . These work either synthesize k-means using NNs 9, or use k-means in latent abstract space [ref]3 5 [ref]20. Generally, the mapping to latent space is learned via a representation learning method such as autoencoding [ref]3 or self-supervised methods [ref]20. k-means is used to cluster the latent abstract vectors directly [ref]3 or to generate pseudo-labels to train the network 5. In contrast to these works, we let the neural network learn a direct mapping from the input space to class-assignment probabilities while modeling rich cluster distributions following the abstract intuition of mixture modeling. Although synthesizing k-means using a neural network has been studied before 9, realizing mixture modeling and EM for clustering with neural networks is rarely explored as per our knowledge. Neural Expectation-Maximization (N-EM)  introduces a differentiable clustering method utilizing the EM algorithm. N-EM’s objective is to learn the perceptual grouping of a given input by separately identifying the different conceptual entities in the input. N-EM uses neural networks to predict the statistical parameters of cluster distributions (e.g., a single probability for Bernoulli, mean, and variance for Gaussian) from object vectors. These statistical parameters are used to compute the corresponding cluster distribution manually, which is used in EM optimization, and the backpropagation updates the object vector and network parameters. In contrast, we intend to directly approximate the cluster distribution outputs from the final layer neurons of a network for the input data point to reflect the likelihoods of that data point in the corresponding clusters. Our solution is a better replacement for standard clustering objectives such as k-means or GMM. A successful deep image clustering method should learn general semantic information, which is essential for identifying abstract groups. Therefore, it is vital to enable a neural network to harvest rich features while optimizing the clustering objective. We identify two basic ways to enable such feature learning in the literature. The first one is learning a prior task that enables the network to extract important features  [ref]3 [ref]20  [ref]23 . The clustering is conducted in the learned abstract space partially or fully using standard algorithms [ref]3 [ref]20  or other clustering objectives as loss functions to train the network  8 [ref]23 . Learning a self-supervised pre-text task  [ref]20  [ref]23  often enables learning a rich semantic representation that acts as a solid prior for the clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering Based on Contractive Autoencoder (DECCA)  uses a two-phase approach of unsupervised feature learning and clustering the learned latent space. The unsupervised feature learning consists of reconstruction of input with a Contractive Autoencoder  and maintaining consistent model response to original and self-augmented inputs. The learned latent space is clustered during the second stage by minimizing the cumulative divergence between embeddings and cluster centers. Semantic Clustering by Adopting Nearest Neighbors (SCAN) [ref]23, among its multiple stages, first learns a pre-text task such as instance discrimination  with a NN. Then, it uses the learned embedding to identify semantically similar neighbors that mostly fall into the same class. Nevertheless, the performance gain of SCAN is mostly attributed to the pre-text task, which acts as a prior to clustering. These multi-stage frameworks often also use the third step to refine the clustered space further using self-labeled supervision [ref]23 . In contrast, our two-fold optimization performs feature learning and clustering concurrently, and our clustering optimization is a novel neural mixture modeling method. The second one is learning the general feature extraction and the clustering simultaneously as a single-stage task. These methods usually consists of heavy augmentation  7, multiple complex losses 4, or series of sub-steps 6 7. Invariant information clustering (IIC) , following the intuition of the consistency optimization, learns a latent mapping from the input by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the mappings of original and transformed images. MI maximization requires large batch sizes  and repeated sampling where each image is transformed multiple times. DCCM 7 builds on the same consistency optimization and uses pseudo-label and pseudo-graph supervision alongside triplet mutual information optimization. Associative Deep Clustering (ADC) 4 embeds an image and its transformed version through a CNN and jointly trains the network end-to-end along with another set of centroids. ADC minimizes a sum of multiple losses and requires additional hyper-parameter tuning of the loss weightings. Deep Adaptive Clustering (DAC) 6 recasts the clustering problem as a binary pairwise classification task. DAC generates the labels by leveraging the learned feature vectors for which constitutes a series of sequential stages. In contrast to these work, we propose mixture modeling with a neural network posing as the cluster distribution estimator and the network parameters posing as the cluster distribution parameters. Our framework is a single-stage end-to-end clustering framework. The proposed mixture-EM optimization is a better alternative for k-means and other standard clustering algorithms. In addition, our formulation can be used as the clustering objective along with other initialization methods such as pre-text task learning, consistency optimization, self-label based fine-tuning methods to build rather complex end-to-end multi-stage clustering solutions. This paper discovers only the fusion of consistency optimization to the mixture-EM optimization to cluster image data, resulting in a two-fold single-stage training process.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: limited representability, there have been efforts to incorporate neural networks to model advanced clusters  4 5 6 7 8.
