      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Entity Linking Features for Emerging Entities\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEntity linking (EL), the task of mapping entity mentions in text to their corresponding entities in a target knowledge base (KB), is a fundamental step for various knowledge based applications [ref]1 [ref]2    . In general, it is challenging mainly due to the universal many-to-many ambiguity between mentions and entities. On one hand, a named entity may have multiple names (e.g., full name, partial name, nickname, and abbreviation). For example, the named entity New York City has a nickname Big Apple and an abbreviation NYC. On the other hand, a name could possibly denote different named entities. For instance, the name Michael Jordan may refer to an NBA basketball player, a Berkeley machine learning professor, or many other named entities which could be referred to as Michael Jordan. In recent years, EL models based on deep neural networks have achieved great success [ref]2 . For example, DeepED [ref]7 is a remarkable work which embeds entities and words in a common vector space and leverages a neural attention mechanism over local context windows, while other architectures such as graph neural networks    and recurrent random walk networks  were investigated as well. Besides the choice of EL model, another key factor in EL systems is the way to obtain EL features of entities. As reviewed in [ref]1 [ref]2, EL features of entities commonly utilized by EL models to rank candidate entities are prior probability   [ref]7   , relatedness score      , and entity embedding [ref]2 [ref]7      .\nThese EL features of entities need to be estimated with the requirement of a labeled corpus where gold mention-entity pairs (i.e., pairs of mentions and their gold corresponding entities) are available [ref]2 [ref]1 [ref]7. This labeled corpus should cover the entities in the KB as many as possible. If some entities never show up in the labeled corpus, it is unable to estimate required EL features for those entities. In practice, Wikipedia, a large-scale encyclopedia which contains billions of hyperlinks in its articles that could be regarded as gold mention-entity pairs for millions of entities, is leveraged by most EL works as the best choice of the labeled corpus for estimating EL features of entities [ref]2 [ref]1 . However, it is observed that almost 50% of entities are first mentioned in news before they are included in Wikipedia, and the lags could be several months or even a year . That is to say, although these emerging entities (EEs) could be discovered from news and added to a KB with a unique identifier by hand or automatic methods like , they cannot be linked with accurately by EL models because Wikipedia cannot provide required EL features for these EEs.\nTo deal with this problem, in this paper we study a new task of learning EL features for emerging entities in a general way, which is illustrated in Figure 1. An intuitive idea to learn EL features for an EE is to collect some candidate documents where the EE may be mentioned from the Web, manually annotate them, and then estimate required EL features for the EE on these labeled data. However, this process is non-trivial in practice because manually annotating a large number of candidate documents for each EE is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Additionally, a prior work  proposed a retrieval-based approach to extract keyphrase descriptions for EEs. However, keyphrase description is not a strong EL feature, and their approach cannot be extended to other commonly used EL features (e.g., prior probability, relatedness score, and entity embedding). It is also noted that zero-shot learning  has already been considered in the field of entity linking. In the setting of zero-shot EL  0 , the entity being linked with has not been seen during training and is defined by a textual entity description from its corresponding Wikipedia page. Zero-shot EL models rely on language understanding of the given textual entity description to perform entity linking. However, this setting makes these zero-shot EL models unable to deal with our problem in this paper, as the EE has not been included in Wikipedia yet and does not have the textual entity description accordingly. Overall, our goal is to learn high-quality EL features for the EE automatically.\nThe proposed approach is expected to be applicable for any numerical EL feature (e.g., prior probability, relatedness score, and entity embedding) rather than a specific one, as long as the EL feature could be automatically estimated given a labeled corpus.\nIt is also noted that this new task is defined as an orthogonal effort to the task of developing an EL model that most previous EL works focus on.\nThis makes the proposed approach flexibly integrated with any state-of-the-art EL models such as DeepED [ref]7 and Yamada et al. , while the prior work  is restricted to keyphrase-based EL models  only. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called STAMO (Self-Training As Multiple Optimizations) satisfying all the above requirements. STAMO is mainly based on self-training, a classic branch of semi-supervised learning. In general case, self-training iteratively assigns pseudo labels to the unlabeled data by a classification model and updates this classification model on both real labeled and pseudo labeled data. While in our case, the pseudo label means the entity that a mention refers to, the classification model is an EL model, and the target to update is the EL features of EEs (rather than the EL model) based on both labeled and unlabeled candidate documents collected from the Web, as shown in Figure 1. STAMO needs just a small number of labeled documents for each EE, as it could further leverage the knowledge hidden in the unlabeled data. In addition, STAMO learns EL features for EEs incrementally. That is to say, given some non-emerging entities (NEEs) whose EL features have been estimated from Wikipedia and a trained EL model, we do not need to update the EL features of NEEs and the EL model every time when an EE is discovered. The main advantage of self-training is that it is a wrapper method, which makes STAMO flexibly integrated with any numerical EL feature or EL model. On the other hand, the major drawback of self-training is that the errors introduced by the mislabeled data may be reinforced gradually 1. In our task, we found that the vanilla self-training method collapses quickly after a few slots111In this paper, we will also call an iteration in self-training as a slot., i.e., the quality of EEs’ EL features becomes worse after update. To alleviate this problem, a common assumption is that high confident predictions tend to be correct 2, and only a few unlabeled instances with the most confident predictions will be combined with the labeled data in the iterative process of self-training. However, the prediction score output by some EL models (e.g., DeepED [ref]7 and Yamada et al. ) does not act as a competent measure of confidence, which is possibly caused by the use of max-margin loss. At the same time, the selection of instances may introduce additional bias, which would significantly affect the quality of some statistics-based features (e.g., prior probability). Therefore, common strategies based on this assumption are unsuitable for our task, and we keep all unlabeled data in all slots as suggested in 1 to update the EL features. In STAMO, we creatively regard self-training as a multiple optimization process with respect to the EL features of EEs, which could alleviate the error reinforcement problem caused by the mislabeled data implicitly, rather than throw the mislabeled data away explicitly. Specifically, we propose both intra-slot optimization and inter-slot optimization. In intra-slot optimization, we regard the EL features of EEs estimated over the mix of the real labeled and pseudo labeled data as an initial guess instead of the final result, and consider that the EL features of EEs should also minimize the objective function which is used to train the given EL model only based on the real labeled data. In inter-slot optimization, we propose a hypothetical optimization process which makes a direct connection between the EL features of EEs in the current slot and the historical slots, and this novel perspective enables us to leverage the information provided by the historical slots to improve the future learning process. Contributions. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the task of learning EL features for EEs in a general way, an orthogonal effort to the task of developing an EL model that most previous EL works focus on. We propose a novel approach STAMO based on self-training, which makes it flexibly integrated with any numerical EL feature or EL model. We regard self-training as a multiple optimization process, and propose both intra-slot and inter-slot optimizations to alleviate the error reinforcement problem implicitly. In inter-slot optimization, we propose a novel hypothetical optimization process, which enables us to leverage the information provided by the historical slots to improve the future learning process. We construct two EL datasets to evaluate the quality of the obtained EL features for EEs, and the experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods of learning EL features.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Entity linking (EL), the task of mapping entity mentions in text to their corresponding entities in a target knowledge base (KB), is a fundamental step for various knowledge based applications [ref]1 [ref]2    .
