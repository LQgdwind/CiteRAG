Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task Learning with Attention for End-to-end Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the field of computer vision, attention has been a key idea to\nimprove performance of CNNs in various tasks such as classification\n [ref]29, object detection [ref]11,\nimage tracking [ref]9,\nand captioning .\nKatharopoulos and Fleuret  proposed\nan attention-sampling approach to process megapixel images .\nLiu et al..  presented the Multi-Task Attention Network\n(MTAN) that has a feature-level attention mechanism to select task-specific\nfeatures for multi-task learning.\nUsually, incorporating an attention mechanism requires a unique architectural\ndesign like the abovementioned ones. In contrast, module-based attention\napproaches   [ref]29 are another\ntrend that can simply be attached to existing CNNs\n  \nand improves performances.\nConvolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) [ref]29 is\na representative of them, where attention is learnable end-to-end\nwithout requiring additional labels.\nA few approaches have also introduced attention in the autonomous driving context.\nMori et al. used Attention Branched Network\n to develop a visually interpretable model.\nSimilarly, Kim and Canny  visualized\nsaliency part to predict steering by decoding attention heat maps. An approach similar to ours by Cultrera et al.\nsplits features into multi-scale grids and weighs with softmax scores to\ndrop out irrelevant regions.\nIn comparison, our approach uses CBAM specialized for one particular task\nin multi-task architecture to emphasize features over the channel and\nspatial dimensions separately and refines specifically to the task.\nAlso, our attention mechanism is based on MTAN ,\nwhich originally handles dense estimation tasks only such as\nsemantic segmentation and depth estimation, while we design it to fit into\nthe CIL framework  and our model performs control prediction\nin an end-to-end manner as well.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: In the field of computer vision, attention has been a key idea to\nimprove performance of CNNs in various tasks such as classification\n [ref]29, object detection [ref]11,\nimage tracking [ref]9,\nand captioning .\nKatharopoulos and Fleuret  proposed\nan attention-sampling approach to process megapixel images .\nLiu et al..  presented the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
