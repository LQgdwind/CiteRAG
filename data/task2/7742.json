Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Context-Free Languages of String Diagrams\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe representation of context-free grammars as certain morphisms of multigraphs was introduced by Walters in a short paper . A similar type-theoretical version of this idea was also introduced by De Groote . As discussed more extensively above, this idea was taken up and substantially refined by Melliès and Zeilberger, first in a conference paper [ref]33 and later in an extended version . A different notion of context-free families of string diagrams has been introduced by Zamdzhiev . There, string diagrams are defined combinatorially as string graphs, and context-free families are then generated by B-edNCE graph grammars . Though similar, the resulting notion is not directly comparable to ours.\nHere, we use the native algebra of monoidal categories and their multicategories of contexts to define and investigate languages. Finally, Heindel’s abstract  claims a proof of a Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem for morphisms in symmetric monoidal categories, but the work described in this abstract was never published. Our development is quite different from that outlined in Heindel’s abstract. We prove a stronger representation theorem that does not require an intersection of languages; we work without the assumption of symmetry; and we generalize the categorical machinery of Melliès and Zeilberger.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: version of this idea was also introduced by De Groote .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
