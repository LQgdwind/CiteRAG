      "content": "Paper Title: Influential Simplices Mining via Simplicial Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning methods are used in many tasks due to their outperforming expressive.\nAmong them, graph neural networks (GNNs) can exploit node features and the graph topology simultaneously, thereby triggering a wide-spreading research interest and endeavor in various graph learning tasks such as vital node mining [ref]14.\nSpatial-based and spectral-based GNNs are the two primary categories of GNNs.\nSpectral GNNs extend the application of convolutional neural network (CNN) to the graph domain, which is based on the graph Fourier transform  and employs the graph Laplacian eigenbasis as an analogy to the Fourier transform.\nSCNN  replaces the convolution kernel with a learnable diagonal matrix in the spectral domain.\nChebNet  replaces the convolution kernel in the spectral domain with Chebyshev polynomials.\nGCN  further simplifies ChebNet by considering only the first-order Chebyshev inequality and only one parameter per convolution kernel. Recently, GNNs have achieved some remarkable success in vital node mining.\nZhao et al.  transform the influential nodes identification task into a classification problem.\nThey first solve vital node mining by using GNN and proposed the InfGCN algorithm, in which the BFS algorithm is leveraged to sample the neighbor network for each node. The degree centralities, betweenness centralities, and clustering coefficients of the nodes are used to construct the input of GCN. Then, the output of the GCN is used as the input of a fully connected neural network to predict the label of each node.\nBesides, Yu et al. [ref]29 transform the node identification problem into a regression problem inspired by GCN. Specifically, it calculates the adjacency matrix of the ℓℓ\\ell-hop subgraph as the original feature and trains them by CNN with the label, which is the ranking calculated by the SIR epidemic spreading range. The RCNN algorithm learns structural information on a train network and uses the optimal model to test other networks. This algorithm has strong universality.\nKumar et al. [ref]14 also consider the influence maximization question as a regression question.\nThey propose SGNN for finding the most influential nodes of the whole network by using struc2vec.\nThe whole algorithm learns structural information on a train network by GNN and uses the optimal model to test other networks.\nILGR  is designed for the fast identification of critical nodes and links in large complex networks, which employs the GraphSAGE model and attention mechanism to learn node embeddings. Besides, there are also some deep-learning methods in vital node mining.\nOu et al.  propose the M-RCNN algorithm by using the multi-level structural attributes based on the RCNN.\nSame as RCNN, it gets node labels by the SIR epidemic spreading model.\nThe algorithm uses micro, community, and macro information as origin features, and uses CNN to train traditional BA networks to get the optimal model. Then the optimal training model is used to test other networks.\nHowever, empirical methods neglect the multi-order message of the graph and just take neighbors’ features into consideration.\nM-RCNN just calculates the centrality metrics for different order messages but overlooks the message passing by higher-order structures.\nMoreover, Synthetic graphs such as RCNN and M-RCNN are employed to train the model. However, there may be considerable topological differences between synthetic and empirical networks. It is more appropriate to use a subset of nodes to train and validate the model.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: (GNNs) can exploit node features and the graph topology simultaneously, thereby triggering a wide-spreading research interest and endeavor in various graph learning tasks such as vital node mining [ref]14.\nSpatial-based and spectral-based GNNs are the two primary categories of GNNs.\nSpectral GNNs extend the application of convolutional neural network (CNN) to the graph domain, which is based\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
