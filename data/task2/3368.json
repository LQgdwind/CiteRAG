      "content": "Paper Title: Almost Optimal Variance-Constrained Best Arm Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the variance-constrained BAI problem under the fixed confidence setting, i.e., we wish to identify the arm which satisfies a certain variance constraint and has the largest expectation w.h.p. Different from , we aim to identify the best arm strictly satisfying the risk constraint without any slack or suboptimality. We discuss more differences of our setting and our algorithm vis-√†-vis  in Section¬†(IV-C). We design VA-LUCB(œÉ¬Ø2,Œ¥)superscript¬Øùúé2ùõø(\\bar{\\sigma}^{2},\\delta) and derive an upper bound on its time or sample complexity. VA-LUCB is an LUCB-based¬†[ref]9 algorithm that is generally better than UCB-based algorithms for BAI problems 2. It particularizes to LUCB when the constraint is inactive. A hardness parameter HVAsubscriptùêªVAH_{\\mathrm{VA}} is identified as a fundamental limit; HVAsubscriptùêªVAH_{\\mathrm{VA}} also reduces to H1subscriptùêª1H_{1}  when the constraint is inactive. Furthermore, the framework and analysis of VA-LUCB can be extended to other risk measures as long as there are appropriate concentration bounds, e.g., Bhat and Prashanth¬†[ref]37 or Chang and Tan¬† enables us to use CVaR or certain continuous functions as risk measures within the generic VA-LUCB framework. Different from the work of  which addresses a similar problem, our algorithm is completely parameter free, in the sense that Algorithm¬†(1) can output the best feasible arm i‚ãÜsuperscriptùëñ‚ãÜi^{\\star} without knowledge of any parameters that define the instance (e.g., the suboptimality gaps). To assess the optimality of VA-LUCB, we prove an accompanying information-theoretic lower bound on the optimal expected sample complexity of any variance-constrained BAI algorithm. We show that VA-LUCB‚Äôs sample complexity is optimal up to a logarithmic factor in HVAsubscriptùêªVAH_{\\mathrm{VA}}. Lastly, we present extensive experiments in which we examine the effect of each term in HVAsubscriptùêªVAH_{\\mathrm{VA}}. We compare VA-LUCB to a na√Øve algorithm based on uniform sampling and a variant of the algorithm in David et al.¬† which can only be applied if some unknown parameters (such as the suboptimality gaps) are known (see App.¬†(B)). Our experiments suggest that VA-LUCB is the gold standard for this class of constrained BAI problems, reducing the sample complexity significantly, especially for the riskiest instances.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: and our algorithm vis-√†-vis  in Section¬†(IV-C).
