      "content": "Paper Title: Data-iterative Optimization Score Model for Stable Ultra-Sparse-View CT Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEq. (15) demonstrates the VE-SDE prior is posed on the n𝑛n images rather than a single image 𝒙tnsuperscriptsubscript𝒙𝑡𝑛\\bm{x}_{t}^{n}. As evident from our observations, Eq. (15) unmistakably brings to light the inherent nexus between data consistency and the diffusion generative model. A viable avenue for resolution emerges with the introduction of an additional fidelity term aimed at solidifying the alignment between these two pivotal terminologies. In this pursuit, we introduce utnsuperscriptsubscript𝑢𝑡𝑛u_{t}^{n} as a substitution for xtnsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑛x_{t}^{n}, which is treated as a bridge to connect 𝒙0^^subscript𝒙0\\hat{\\bm{x}_{0}} and M​(𝒙t)𝑀subscript𝒙𝑡M\\left(\\bm{x}_{t}\\right). Actually, we can simply the Eq. (15) into a series of separable optimization problems. Consequently, the manifestation of Eq. (15) takes on a transformed disposition, evolving into an intricately formulated optimization challenge characterized by the subsequent expression: Eq. (16) poses a problem constrained by the requirement 𝒙tn=𝒖tnsuperscriptsubscript𝒙𝑡𝑛superscriptsubscript𝒖𝑡𝑛\\bm{x}_{t}^{n}=\\bm{u}_{t}^{n}, and under certain circumstances, it can be transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem as below where βt>0subscript𝛽𝑡0\\beta_{t}>0 is a factor. It’s evident from Eq. (17) that the inclusion of 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t} serves a dual purpose. On one hand, it enforces the reconstructed outcomes to align reasonably well with the measurements; on the other hand, it imposes a constraint to confine the divergence between the reconstruction outcomes and their generative counterparts within specific bounds. Notably, the term βt2​‖𝒙t−𝒖t‖22subscript𝛽𝑡2superscriptsubscriptnormsubscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒖𝑡22\\frac{\\beta_{t}}{2}||\\bm{x}_{t}-\\bm{u}_{t}||_{2}^{2} constitutes a vital component of data consistency. Consequently, the optimization of Eq. (16) can be viewed as a process bifurcated into two distinct steps: Regarding Eq. (18), which introduces a new term to ensure data consistency. Several iterative methods are available for achieving the best solution. However, ensuring convergence is difficult while determining the appropriate iterative step length presents a practical hindrance to optimization efforts. The gradient-based descent technique is a popular solution avenue, commonly embraced in recent diffusion models [ref]22 . However, these approaches often demonstrate susceptibility to noise and perturbations, which is a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. Thus, we have chosen to employ an advanced optimization strategy for enhancing the performance of Eq. (18). Note that the update of 𝒙t−1subscript𝒙𝑡1\\bm{x}_{t-1} comes from n images, we can treat 𝒙t−1=∑n=1Nwtn​𝒙tnsubscript𝒙𝑡1superscriptsubscript𝑛1𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑛superscriptsubscript𝒙𝑡𝑛\\bm{x}_{t-1}=\\sum_{n=1}^{N}{w_{t}^{n}\\bm{x}_{t}^{n}} and obtain: By incorporating the wisdom of simultaneous iteration reconstruction technique , in respect to the Eq. (LABEL:eqIII10) step, we can update it with: Here, D𝐷D and E𝐸E are diagonal matrices encompassing the reciprocal of the column and row sums of the system matrix. Specifically, dj​jsubscript𝑑𝑗𝑗d_{jj} corresponds to one divided by the sum of elements in row i𝑖i, i.e., dj​j=1/∑ihi​jsubscript𝑑𝑗𝑗1subscript𝑖subscriptℎ𝑖𝑗d_{jj}=1/{\\sum_{i}h_{ij}}, and similarly, ej​jsubscript𝑒𝑗𝑗e_{jj} equals one divided by the sum of elements in row j𝑗j, i.e., ej​j=1/∑jhi​jsubscript𝑒𝑗𝑗1subscript𝑗subscriptℎ𝑖𝑗e_{jj}=1/{\\sum_{j}h_{ij}}. These matrices serve to balance the impact of rays hitting individual pixels and pixels intersected by each ray. The transpose of the matrix, denoted as 𝑨Tsuperscript𝑨𝑇\\bm{A}^{T}, facilitates the back-projection of projection images onto the reconstruction area. It delineates the pixels influenced by a particular ray’s trajectory. This mechanism enables the derivation of the updated 𝒙t−1nsuperscriptsubscript𝒙𝑡1𝑛\\bm{x}_{t-1}^{n} from the previously updated 𝒙t−1/2nsuperscriptsubscript𝒙𝑡12𝑛\\bm{x}_{t-1/2}^{n}, thus allowing for the subsequent progression of the process. If all the reconstruction procedure is finished, the estimated 𝒙0^=∑n=1Nw0n​𝒙0n^subscript𝒙0superscriptsubscript𝑛1𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑤0𝑛superscriptsubscript𝒙0𝑛\\hat{\\bm{x}_{0}}=\\sum_{n=1}^{N}w_{0}^{n}\\bm{x}_{0}^{n}. Regarding the second step of Eq. (14), it outlines the diffusion model’s advancement process, utilizing the VE-SDE approach for updates. Initially, the generation procedure for the diffusion model is a generalized numerical solution derived from the inverse SDE. In contrast to generating samples using the numerical SDE solver, we opt for the Predictor-Corrector (PC) sampler [ref]15. This choice is driven by its superior performance when dealing with VE-SDEs. In the context of PC samplers, the predictor entails a numerical solver for the reverse-time SDE, while the corrector encompasses any Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique reliant solely on the scores. As previously mentioned, the SDE update procedure is partitioned into predictor and corrector updates. Concerning the predictor update, we can perform enhancements to refine the estimation of the model parameters. where the parameter σt>0subscript𝜎𝑡0\\sigma_{t}>0 embodies a monotonically rising function in relation to time t𝑡t, as stipulated by [ref]15. z​N​(0,1)𝑧𝑁01z~{}N\\left(0,1\\right) is random noise that follows a Gaussian distribution, which is added by [ref]15 and can prevent the model from reaching the local optimization solution. Regarding the corrector step, the update adheres to the subsequent formulation: where ϵt−1subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡1\\epsilon_{t-1} is the step size of at time t−1𝑡1t-1.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: iterative step length presents a practical hindrance to optimization efforts.
