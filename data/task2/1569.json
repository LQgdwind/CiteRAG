The (still open) Erdős-Hajnal conjecture  states that every graph H𝐻H satisfies the Erdős-Hajnal property. As reported by Chudnovsky , the Erdős-Hajnal conjecture has been verified for only a small number of graphs,\nnamely all graphs on at most four vertices, the bull (i.e., the graph obtained by adding a pendant vertex to two different vertices of a triangle), the complete graphs, and every graph that can be constructed from them using the so-called substitution operation , which we define later. Since our goal is to use the Erdős-Hajnal property in order to obtain kernels for Maximum Minimal Vertex Cover, we need an algorithmic version of it. As defined by Bonnet et al. [ref]17, for a constant δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, a graph H𝐻H is said to satisfy the constructive Erdős-Hajnal property with constant δ𝛿\\delta if there exists an algorithm that takes as input an H𝐻H-free graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices, and outputs in polynomial-time a clique or an independent set of G𝐺G of size at least nδsuperscript𝑛𝛿n^{\\delta}. Fortunately for our purposes, all the graphs H𝐻H shown to satisfy\nthe Erdős-Hajnal property so far, also satisfy its constructive version [ref]17. In the following simple lemma we show that, if H𝐻H is a graph satisfying the constructive Erdős-Hajnal property, then the vertex set of an H𝐻H-free graph can be partitioned in polynomial time into “few” cliques or independent sets. This partition will then be used to obtain subquadratic kernels on H𝐻H-free graphs for several graphs H𝐻H. Let H𝐻H be a graph satisfying the constructive Erdős-Hajnal property with constant δ𝛿\\delta. The vertex set of any H𝐻H-free graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices can be partitioned in polynomial time into a collection of cliques 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} and a collection of independent sets ℐℐ{\\cal I} such that\n|𝒞|+|ℐ|≤(12(1−δ)−1)⋅n1−δ𝒞ℐ⋅1superscript21𝛿1superscript𝑛1𝛿|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|\\leq\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{(1-\\delta)}-1}\\right)\\cdot n^{1-\\delta}. Let G𝐺G be an H𝐻H-free graph on n𝑛n vertices. We initialize X0=V​(G),𝒞=ℐ=∅formulae-sequencesubscript𝑋0𝑉𝐺𝒞ℐX_{0}=V(G),{\\cal C}={\\cal I}=\\emptyset, and we run the following procedure as far as |X0|≥1subscript𝑋01|X_{0}|\\geq 1: Find in polynomial time a clique or an independent set Y𝑌Y in G​[X0]𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑋0G[X_{0}] with |Y|≥|X0|δ𝑌superscriptsubscript𝑋0𝛿|Y|\\geq|X_{0}|^{\\delta}. Note that this is possible since G​[X0]𝐺delimited-[]subscript𝑋0G[X_{0}] is an H𝐻H-free graph for any X0⊆V​(G)subscript𝑋0𝑉𝐺X_{0}\\subseteq V(G). Add Y𝑌Y to 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} or to ℐℐ{\\cal I} depending on whether Y𝑌Y is a clique or an independent set, respectively (if |Y|=1𝑌1|Y|=1, choose 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} or ℐℐ{\\cal I} arbitrarily).\nUpdate X0←X0∖Y←subscript𝑋0subscript𝑋0𝑌X_{0}\\leftarrow X_{0}\\setminus Y. Clearly, the above algorithm terminates in polynomial time.\nIt remains to bound |𝒞|+|ℐ|𝒞ℐ|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|, which is equal to the number of iterations of the algorithm.\nTo this end, for a positive integer i𝑖i, we say that an iteration belongs to step i𝑖i of the algorithm if the current set X0subscript𝑋0X_{0} at the start of the iteration satisfies n2i<|X0|≤n2i−1𝑛superscript2𝑖subscript𝑋0𝑛superscript2𝑖1\\frac{n}{2^{i}}<|X_{0}|\\leq\\frac{n}{2^{i-1}}.\nWe denote by tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} the number of iterations of the algorithm within step i𝑖i.\nBy definition, |𝒞|+|ℐ|=∑i=1∞ti𝒞ℐsuperscriptsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑡𝑖|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}t_{i}.\nLet Y𝑌Y be a clique or an independent set found by the algorithm within step i𝑖i.\nSince the current set X0subscript𝑋0X_{0} satisfies |X0|>n2isubscript𝑋0𝑛superscript2𝑖|X_{0}|>\\frac{n}{2^{i}}, we have that |Y|>(n2i)δ𝑌superscript𝑛superscript2𝑖𝛿|Y|>\\left(\\frac{n}{2^{i}}\\right)^{\\delta}. And since the sum of the sizes of the sets found before the last iteration of step i𝑖i is at most n2i𝑛superscript2𝑖\\frac{n}{2^{i}}, it follows that ti≤(n2i)1−δsubscript𝑡𝑖superscript𝑛superscript2𝑖1𝛿t_{i}\\leq\\left(\\frac{n}{2^{i}}\\right)^{1-\\delta}.\nNote that, in particular, ti=0subscript𝑡𝑖0t_{i}=0 for i>⌈log⁡n⌉𝑖𝑛i>\\lceil\\log n\\rceil. Therefore, we conclude that and the lemma follows. We are now ready to present the subquadratic kernel on bull-free graphs. Note that, since bipartite graphs are bull-free, MMVC restricted to bull-free graphs is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard by  (or by Theorem 8.1). In the kernels presented in this section, since we can easily obtain explicit constants, we decided not to use the big-O notation. The Maximum Minimal Vertex Cover problem parameterized by k𝑘k restricted to bull-free graphs admits a kernel with at most c​(k−1)7/4+k−1𝑐superscript𝑘174𝑘1c(k-1)^{7/4}+k-1 vertices, where c=2234−1<3𝑐2superscript23413c=\\frac{2}{2^{\\frac{3}{4}}-1}<3. Let (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) be an instance of the Maximum Minimal Vertex Cover problem, where G𝐺G is a bull-free graph. Recall that by 2.1 we can assume that the maximum degree of G𝐺G is at most k−1𝑘1k-1. We start by finding greedily, starting from V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G), a minimal vertex cover X𝑋X of G𝐺G. Note that X𝑋X can be easily found in polynomial time by section 2. If |X|≥k𝑋𝑘|X|\\geq k, we conclude that (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) is a yes-instance, so we can assume that |X|≤k−1𝑋𝑘1|X|\\leq k-1. Let S=V​(G)∖X𝑆𝑉𝐺𝑋S=V(G)\\setminus X and note that S𝑆S is an independent set. Since the bull satisfies the constructive Erdős-Hajnal property with constant δ=14𝛿14\\delta=\\frac{1}{4}  [ref]17, we can apply 7.1 to the bull-free graph G​[X]𝐺delimited-[]𝑋G[X] and obtain in polynomial time a partition of X𝑋X into a collection of cliques 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C} and a collection of independent sets ℐℐ{\\cal I} such that |𝒞|+|ℐ|≤d⋅|X|3/4≤d⋅(k−1)3/4𝒞ℐ⋅𝑑superscript𝑋34⋅𝑑superscript𝑘134|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|\\leq d\\cdot|X|^{3/4}\\leq d\\cdot(k-1)^{3/4}, where d=1234−1<1.47𝑑1superscript23411.47d=\\frac{1}{2^{\\frac{3}{4}}-1}<1.47. Since we can assume that G𝐺G has no isolated vertices, as they can be safely removed without affecting the type of the instance, it follows that Hence, our objective is to bound |NS​(Y)|subscript𝑁𝑆𝑌|N_{S}(Y)| for every Y∈𝒞∪ℐ𝑌𝒞ℐY\\in{\\cal C}\\cup{\\cal I}. Suppose first that I∈ℐ𝐼ℐI\\in{\\cal I} is an independent set. From 2.1, if |NS​(I)|≥ksubscript𝑁𝑆𝐼𝑘|N_{S}(I)|\\geq k we can conclude that (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) is a yes-instance, so we can assume henceforth that Suppose now that C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in{\\cal C} is a clique. We partition NS​(C)=SC1⊎SC2subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶⊎superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2N_{S}(C)=S_{C}^{1}\\uplus S_{C}^{2} as follows. Let SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} be an inclusion-wise maximal set of vertices in NS​(C)subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶N_{S}(C) such that for any two (not necessarily distinct) vertices x,y∈SC1𝑥𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1x,y\\in S_{C}^{1}, |NC​(x)∪NC​(y)|≤|C|−1subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦𝐶1|N_{C}(x)\\cup N_{C}(y)|\\leq|C|-1. That is, SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} is a maximal set in NS​(C)subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶N_{S}(C) such that the neighborhoods of its vertices pairwise do not cover the whole clique C𝐶C. We let SC2=NS​(C)∖SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{2}=N_{S}(C)\\setminus S_{C}^{1}. The following is the crucial property of the set SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1}. The vertices in SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} can be ordered x1,…,xpsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑝x_{1},\\ldots,x_{p} so that NC​(xi)⊆NC​(xj)subscript𝑁𝐶subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑁𝐶subscript𝑥𝑗N_{C}(x_{i})\\subseteq N_{C}(x_{j}) whenever i≤j𝑖𝑗i\\leq j. In order to prove the claim, it is sufficient to prove that, for any two vertices x,y∈SC1𝑥𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1x,y\\in S_{C}^{1}, either NC​(x)⊆NC​(y)subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦N_{C}(x)\\subseteq N_{C}(y) or NC​(y)⊆NC​(x)subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥N_{C}(y)\\subseteq N_{C}(x). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exist two vertices u∈NC​(x)∖NC​(y)𝑢subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦u\\in N_{C}(x)\\setminus N_{C}(y) and v∈NC​(y)∖NC​(x)𝑣subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥v\\in N_{C}(y)\\setminus N_{C}(x). By definition of the set SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1}, there exists a vertex w∈C∖(NC​(x)∪NC​(y))𝑤𝐶subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦w\\in C\\setminus(N_{C}(x)\\cup N_{C}(y)). But then the vertices x,y,u,v,w𝑥𝑦𝑢𝑣𝑤x,y,u,v,w induce a bull as illustrated in Figure 1, contradicting the hypothesis that G𝐺G is bull-free. 1 implies in particular that, unless SC1=∅superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1}=\\emptyset, there exists a vertex u∈⋂x∈SC1NC​(x)𝑢subscript𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥u\\in\\bigcap_{x\\in S_{C}^{1}}N_{C}(x). Since u𝑢u has degree at most k−1𝑘1k-1 in G𝐺G, and each vertex x∈SC1𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1x\\in S_{C}^{1} is adjacent to u𝑢u, it follows that |SC1|≤k−1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1𝑘1|S_{C}^{1}|\\leq k-1. Let us now focus on the set SC2superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2S_{C}^{2}. The definition of the set SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} together with 1 imply that\nthere exists a vertex\nz∈C∖⋃y∈SC1NC​(y)𝑧𝐶subscript𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦z\\in C\\setminus\\bigcup_{y\\in S_{C}^{1}}N_{C}(y). Consider now an arbitrary vertex x∈SC2𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2x\\in S_{C}^{2}. Since x𝑥x could not be added to SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1}, there exists a vertex y∈SC1𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1y\\in S_{C}^{1} such that NC​(x)∪NC​(y)=Csubscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦𝐶N_{C}(x)\\cup N_{C}(y)=C. But since z∈C∖⋃y∈SC1NC​(y)𝑧𝐶subscript𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦z\\in C\\setminus\\bigcup_{y\\in S_{C}^{1}}N_{C}(y), necessarily z∈NC​(x)𝑧subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥z\\in N_{C}(x). It follows that z∈⋂x∈SC2NC​(x)𝑧subscript𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥z\\in\\bigcap_{x\\in S_{C}^{2}}N_{C}(x) (see Figure 1). Using again the fact that z𝑧z has degree at most k−1𝑘1k-1 in G𝐺G, we obtain that |SC2|≤k−1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2𝑘1|S_{C}^{2}|\\leq k-1. Summarizing, we have that Putting all pieces together, Equations (1), (2), and (3) and the fact that |X|≤k−1𝑋𝑘1|X|\\leq k-1 and |𝒞|+|ℐ|≤d⋅|X|3/4𝒞ℐ⋅𝑑superscript𝑋34|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|\\leq d\\cdot|X|^{3/4} imply that, unless we have already concluded that (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) is a yes-instance, we have that and the theorem follows. It is easy to prove that, for every integer t≥2𝑡2t\\geq 2, every Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices has an independent set of size n1t−1superscript𝑛1𝑡1n^{\\frac{1}{t-1}}, by induction on t𝑡t: for t=2𝑡2t=2 the statement is trivial, and if t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, then either Δ​(G)<nt−2t−1Δ𝐺superscript𝑛𝑡2𝑡1\\Delta(G)<n^{\\frac{t-2}{t-1}}, and an independent set of size n1t−1superscript𝑛1𝑡1n^{\\frac{1}{t-1}} can be found greedily by adding any vertex to it and deleting its neighborhood, or there exists a vertex v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G) of degree at least nt−2t−1superscript𝑛𝑡2𝑡1n^{\\frac{t-2}{t-1}}, in which case an independent set of size n1t−1superscript𝑛1𝑡1n^{\\frac{1}{t-1}} can be found applying the inductive hypothesis to the Kt−1subscript𝐾𝑡1K_{t-1}-free graph G​[N​(v)]𝐺delimited-[]𝑁𝑣G[N(v)]. Clearly, this proof can be translated to a polynomial-time algorithm to find an independent set of the appropriate size. Therefore, for any integer t≥2𝑡2t\\geq 2, Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t} satisfies the constructive Erdős-Hajnal property with constant δ=1t−1𝛿1𝑡1\\delta=\\frac{1}{t-1}. The proof of the following theorem is a simplified version of that of Theorem 7.3. Note that, since bipartite graphs are Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free for every t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, MMVC is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard on Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graphs . For every integer t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, the Maximum Minimal Vertex Cover problem parameterized by k𝑘k restricted to Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graphs admits a kernel with at most ct​(k−1)2​t−3t−1+k−1subscript𝑐𝑡superscript𝑘12𝑡3𝑡1𝑘1c_{t}(k-1)^{\\frac{2t-3}{t-1}}+k-1 vertices, where ct=t−12t−2t−1−1subscript𝑐𝑡𝑡1superscript2𝑡2𝑡11c_{t}=\\frac{t-1}{2^{\\frac{t-2}{t-1}}-1}. As in the proof of Theorem 7.3, given an instance (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) of\nMaximum Minimal Vertex Cover, where G𝐺G is a Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graph, we partition V​(G)=X⊎S𝑉𝐺⊎𝑋𝑆V(G)=X\\uplus S, where X𝑋X is a minimal vertex cover of G𝐺G with |X|≤k−1𝑋𝑘1|X|\\leq k-1, and we use 7.1 to partition X𝑋X into two collections 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} and ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} of cliques and independent sets, respectively, with |𝒞|+|ℐ|≤dt⋅|X|t−2t−1𝒞ℐ⋅subscript𝑑𝑡superscript𝑋𝑡2𝑡1|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|\\leq d_{t}\\cdot|X|^{\\frac{t-2}{t-1}}, where dt=12t−2t−1−1subscript𝑑𝑡1superscript2𝑡2𝑡11d_{t}=\\frac{1}{2^{\\frac{t-2}{t-1}}-1}. Equations (1) and (2) still hold, but now we have a much simpler version of Equation (3): if C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in{\\cal C} is a clique then, since G𝐺G is Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free, necessarily |C|≤t−1𝐶𝑡1|C|\\leq t-1, which together with the fact that Δ​(G)≤k−1Δ𝐺𝑘1\\Delta(G)\\leq k-1 yield Combining Equations (1), (2), and (4) we get and the theorem follows. We now extend the results of Theorem 7.3 and Theorem 7.6 to more general excluded induced graphs H𝐻H, by making use of the aforementioned substitution operation.\nAs defined by Alon et al. , for two graphs H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2} on disjoint vertex sets, we say that H𝐻H is obtained from H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} by substituting H2subscript𝐻2H_{2} for v∈V​(H1)𝑣𝑉subscript𝐻1v\\in V(H_{1}) (or just obtained from H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} by substituting H2subscript𝐻2H_{2} if the vertex v𝑣v in question is not important) if V​(H)=(V​(H)∖{v})∪V​(H2)𝑉𝐻𝑉𝐻𝑣𝑉subscript𝐻2V(H)=(V(H)\\setminus\\{v\\})\\cup V(H_{2}), H​[V​(H2)]=H2𝐻delimited-[]𝑉subscript𝐻2subscript𝐻2H[V(H_{2})]=H_{2}, H​[V​(H1)∖{v}]=H1∖v𝐻delimited-[]𝑉subscript𝐻1𝑣subscript𝐻1𝑣H[V(H_{1})\\setminus\\{v\\}]=H_{1}\\setminus v, and u∈V​(H1)𝑢𝑉subscript𝐻1u\\in V(H_{1}) is adjacent in H𝐻H to w∈V​(H2)𝑤𝑉subscript𝐻2w\\in V(H_{2}) if and only if u𝑢u is adjacent in H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} to v𝑣v. Alon et al.  proved that if two graphs H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2} satisfy Erdős-Hajnal property and H𝐻H is obtained from H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} by substituting H2subscript𝐻2H_{2}, then H𝐻H satisfies the Erdős-Hajnal property as well. More precisely, by following the details in the proof of [3, Theorem 2.1], we can derive that if H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H2subscript𝐻2H_{2} satisfy Erdős-Hajnal property with constants δ1subscript𝛿1\\delta_{1} and δ2subscript𝛿2\\delta_{2}, respectively, then H𝐻H satisfies the Erdős-Hajnal property with constant δ=δ2δ1+|V​(H1)|⋅δ2𝛿subscript𝛿2subscript𝛿1⋅𝑉subscript𝐻1subscript𝛿2\\delta=\\frac{\\delta_{2}}{\\delta_{1}+|V(H_{1})|\\cdot\\delta_{2}}. The same applies to the constructive version of the Erdős-Hajnal property. For an integer t≥2𝑡2t\\geq 2, we define the t𝑡t-bull as the graph obtained from Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t} by adding a pendant vertex to two different vertices of the clique. Note that the 2-bull is equal to P4subscript𝑃4P_{4} and that the 3-bull is equal to the bull. Note also that, for every t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, the t𝑡t-bull is obtained from the bull by substituting Kt−2subscript𝐾𝑡2K_{t-2} for the vertex of degree two of the bull. Therefore, by the discussion in the above paragraph, since the bull and Kt−2subscript𝐾𝑡2K_{t-2} satisfy the constructive Erdős-Hajnal property with constants 1414\\frac{1}{4} and 1t−31𝑡3\\frac{1}{t-3}, respectively, it follows that, for every t≥4𝑡4t\\geq 4, the t𝑡t-bull satisfies the constructive Erdős-Hajnal property with constant The proof of the next theorem follows again (and generalizes) that of Theorem 7.3.\nNote that Theorem 7.8 corresponds to the particular case t=3𝑡3t=3 of Theorem 7.6. Note also that bipartite graphs are t𝑡t-bull-free for t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, hence MMVC is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard on t𝑡t-bull-free graphs for t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3 .\nOn the other hand, 222-bull-free graphs are exactly P4subscript𝑃4P_{4}-free graphs, also called cographs, which have cliquewidth at most two, hence by 7.17 (proved later in subsection 7.2) MMVC can be solved in polynomial time on this class. For every integer t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, the Maximum Minimal Vertex Cover problem parameterized by k𝑘k restricted to t𝑡t-bull-free graphs admits a kernel with at most ct​(k−1)2−δt+k−1subscript𝑐𝑡superscript𝑘12subscript𝛿𝑡𝑘1c_{t}(k-1)^{2-\\delta_{t}}+k-1 vertices, where δ3=14subscript𝛿314\\delta_{3}=\\frac{1}{4} and δt=4t+17subscript𝛿𝑡4𝑡17\\delta_{t}=\\frac{4}{t+17} for t≥4𝑡4t\\geq 4, and ct=t−12(1−δt)−1subscript𝑐𝑡𝑡1superscript21subscript𝛿𝑡1c_{t}=\\frac{t-1}{2^{(1-\\delta_{t})}-1}. As in the proof of Theorem 7.3, given an instance (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) of\nMaximum Minimal Vertex Cover, where G𝐺G is a t𝑡t-bull-free graph, we partition V​(G)=X⊎S𝑉𝐺⊎𝑋𝑆V(G)=X\\uplus S, where X𝑋X is a minimal vertex cover of G𝐺G with |X|≤k−1𝑋𝑘1|X|\\leq k-1, and we use 7.1 to partition X𝑋X into two collections 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} and ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} of cliques and independent sets, respectively, with |𝒞|+|ℐ|≤dt⋅|X|1−δt𝒞ℐ⋅subscript𝑑𝑡superscript𝑋1subscript𝛿𝑡|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|\\leq d_{t}\\cdot|X|^{1-\\delta_{t}}, where δ3=14subscript𝛿314\\delta_{3}=\\frac{1}{4} and δt=4t+17subscript𝛿𝑡4𝑡17\\delta_{t}=\\frac{4}{t+17} for t≥4𝑡4t\\geq 4, and dt=12(1−δt)−1subscript𝑑𝑡1superscript21subscript𝛿𝑡1d_{t}=\\frac{1}{2^{(1-\\delta_{t})}-1} for every t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3. Equations (1) and (2) still hold for every integer t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, but now we need slightly more involved arguments to obtain an appropriate version of Equation (3) for every t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3. To this end, suppose that C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in{\\cal C} is a clique. We partition NS​(C)=SC1⊎SC2subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶⊎superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2N_{S}(C)=S_{C}^{1}\\uplus S_{C}^{2} as follows. Let SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} be an inclusion-wise maximal set of vertices in NS​(C)subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶N_{S}(C) such that for any two (not necessarily distinct) vertices x,y∈SC1𝑥𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1x,y\\in S_{C}^{1}, |NC​(x)∪NC​(y)|≤|C|−(t−2)subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦𝐶𝑡2|N_{C}(x)\\cup N_{C}(y)|\\leq|C|-(t-2). That is, SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} is a maximal set in NS​(C)subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶N_{S}(C) such that the neighborhoods of its vertices pairwise leave at least t−2𝑡2t-2 uncovered vertices in the clique C𝐶C. We let SC2=NS​(C)∖SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{2}=N_{S}(C)\\setminus S_{C}^{1}. The set SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} satisfies exactly the same crucial property as for the case t=3𝑡3t=3 (see 1). For every integer t≥3𝑡3t\\geq 3, the vertices in SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} can be ordered x1,…,xpsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑝x_{1},\\ldots,x_{p} so that NC​(xi)⊆NC​(xj)subscript𝑁𝐶subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑁𝐶subscript𝑥𝑗N_{C}(x_{i})\\subseteq N_{C}(x_{j}) whenever i≤j𝑖𝑗i\\leq j. In order to prove the claim, it is sufficient to prove that, for any two vertices x,y∈SC1𝑥𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1x,y\\in S_{C}^{1}, either NC​(x)⊆NC​(y)subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦N_{C}(x)\\subseteq N_{C}(y) or NC​(y)⊆NC​(x)subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥N_{C}(y)\\subseteq N_{C}(x). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exist two vertices u∈NC​(x)∖NC​(y)𝑢subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦u\\in N_{C}(x)\\setminus N_{C}(y) and w∈NC​(y)∖NC​(x)𝑤subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥w\\in N_{C}(y)\\setminus N_{C}(x). By definition of the set SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1}, there exist t−2𝑡2t-2 vertices w1,…,wt−2∈C∖(NC​(x)∪NC​(y))subscript𝑤1…subscript𝑤𝑡2𝐶subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦w_{1},\\ldots,w_{t-2}\\in C\\setminus(N_{C}(x)\\cup N_{C}(y)). But then the vertices x,y,u,v,w1,…,wt−2𝑥𝑦𝑢𝑣subscript𝑤1…subscript𝑤𝑡2x,y,u,v,w_{1},\\ldots,w_{t-2} induce a t𝑡t-bull, contradicting the hypothesis that G𝐺G is t𝑡t-bull-free. 2 implies in particular that, unless SC1=∅superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1}=\\emptyset, there exists a vertex u∈⋂x∈SC1NC​(x)𝑢subscript𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥u\\in\\bigcap_{x\\in S_{C}^{1}}N_{C}(x). Since u𝑢u has degree at most k−1𝑘1k-1 in G𝐺G, and each vertex x∈SC1𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1x\\in S_{C}^{1} is adjacent to u𝑢u, it follows that |SC1|≤k−1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1𝑘1|S_{C}^{1}|\\leq k-1. Let us now focus on the set SC2superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2S_{C}^{2}. The definition of the set SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1} together with 2 imply that\nthere exist at least t−2𝑡2t-2\nvertices z1,…,zt−2∈C∖⋃y∈SC1NC​(y)subscript𝑧1…subscript𝑧𝑡2𝐶subscript𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦z_{1},\\ldots,z_{t-2}\\in C\\setminus\\bigcup_{y\\in S_{C}^{1}}N_{C}(y). Consider now an arbitrary vertex x∈SC2𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2x\\in S_{C}^{2}. Since x𝑥x could not be added to SC1superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1S_{C}^{1}, there exists a vertex y∈SC1𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1y\\in S_{C}^{1} such that |NC​(x)∪NC​(y)|≥|C|−(t−1)subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦𝐶𝑡1|N_{C}(x)\\cup N_{C}(y)|\\geq|C|-(t-1). But since z1,…,zt−2∈C∖⋃y∈SC1NC​(y)subscript𝑧1…subscript𝑧𝑡2𝐶subscript𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶1subscript𝑁𝐶𝑦z_{1},\\ldots,z_{t-2}\\in C\\setminus\\bigcup_{y\\in S_{C}^{1}}N_{C}(y), there exists an index j∈[t−2]𝑗delimited-[]𝑡2j\\in[t-2] such that zj∈NC​(x)subscript𝑧𝑗subscript𝑁𝐶𝑥z_{j}\\in N_{C}(x). That is, every vertex x∈SC2𝑥superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2x\\in S_{C}^{2} is adjacent to at least one of the vertices\nz1,…,zt−2subscript𝑧1…subscript𝑧𝑡2z_{1},\\ldots,z_{t-2}. Using again the fact that each of the vertices z1,…,zt−2subscript𝑧1…subscript𝑧𝑡2z_{1},\\ldots,z_{t-2} has degree at most k−1𝑘1k-1 in G𝐺G, we obtain that |SC2|≤(t−2)​(k−1)superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐶2𝑡2𝑘1|S_{C}^{2}|\\leq(t-2)(k-1). Summarizing, we have that Putting all pieces together, Equations (1), (2), and (5) and the fact that |X|≤k−1𝑋𝑘1|X|\\leq k-1 and |𝒞|+|ℐ|≤dt⋅|X|1−δt𝒞ℐ⋅subscript𝑑𝑡superscript𝑋1subscript𝛿𝑡|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|\\leq d_{t}\\cdot|X|^{1-\\delta_{t}} imply that, unless we have already concluded that (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) is a yes-instance, we have that and the theorem follows. Let the paw be the graph obtained from a triangle by adding a pendant edge.\nGyárfás  showed that the paw satisfies the constructive Erdős-Hajnal property with constant δ=13𝛿13\\delta=\\frac{1}{3}.\nNote that bipartite graphs are paw-free, hence MMVC is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard on paw-free graphs . The Maximum Minimal Vertex Cover problem parameterized by k𝑘k restricted to paw-free graphs admits a kernel with at most c​(k−1)5/3+k−1𝑐superscript𝑘153𝑘1c(k-1)^{5/3}+k-1 vertices, where c=222/3−1<3.41𝑐2superscript22313.41c=\\frac{2}{2^{2/3}-1}<3.41. Given an instance (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) of\nMaximum Minimal Vertex Cover, where G𝐺G is a paw-free graph, we again partition V​(G)=X⊎S𝑉𝐺⊎𝑋𝑆V(G)=X\\uplus S, where X𝑋X is a minimal vertex cover of G𝐺G with |X|≤k−1𝑋𝑘1|X|\\leq k-1,\nand we use 7.1 to partition X𝑋X into two collections 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} and ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} of cliques and independent sets, respectively, with |𝒞|+|ℐ|≤d⋅|X|2/3𝒞ℐ⋅𝑑superscript𝑋23|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|\\leq d\\cdot|X|^{2/3}, where d=122/3−1𝑑1superscript2231d=\\frac{1}{2^{2/3}-1}.\nEquations (1) and (2) still hold, and we can again obtain in a simpler way an appropriate version of Equation (3). Indeed, let C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in{\\cal C} be a clique, and our goal is to bound |NS​(C)|subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶|N_{S}(C)|. If |C|=1𝐶1|C|=1 then by the fact that Δ​(G)≤k−1Δ𝐺𝑘1\\Delta(G)\\leq k-1 we get that |NS​(C)|≤k−1subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶𝑘1|N_{S}(C)|\\leq k-1, so assume that |C|≥2𝐶2|C|\\geq 2. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists a vertex v∈NS​(C)𝑣subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶v\\in N_{S}(C) such that |NC​(v)|≤|C|−2subscript𝑁𝐶𝑣𝐶2|N_{C}(v)|\\leq|C|-2. Let w∈NC​(v)𝑤subscript𝑁𝐶𝑣w\\in N_{C}(v) and let z1,z2subscript𝑧1subscript𝑧2z_{1},z_{2} be two vertices in C∖NC​(v)𝐶subscript𝑁𝐶𝑣C\\setminus N_{C}(v). Then the vertices v,w,z1,z2𝑣𝑤subscript𝑧1subscript𝑧2v,w,z_{1},z_{2} induce a paw, contradicting the hypothesis that G𝐺G is paw-free. Therefore, for every vertex v∈NS​(C)𝑣subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶v\\in N_{S}(C) it holds that |NC​(v)|≥|C|−1subscript𝑁𝐶𝑣𝐶1|N_{C}(v)|\\geq|C|-1. Hence, the number of edges in G𝐺G between C𝐶C and NS​(C)subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶N_{S}(C) is at least |NS​(C)|⋅(|C|−1)⋅subscript𝑁𝑆𝐶𝐶1|N_{S}(C)|\\cdot(|C|-1) and, since Δ​(G)≤k−1Δ𝐺𝑘1\\Delta(G)\\leq k-1, at most |C|⋅(k−1)⋅𝐶𝑘1|C|\\cdot(k-1). Using that |C|≥2𝐶2|C|\\geq 2, it follows that Putting all pieces together, Equations (1), (2), and (6) and the fact that |X|≤k−1𝑋𝑘1|X|\\leq k-1 and |𝒞|+|ℐ|≤d⋅|X|2/3𝒞ℐ⋅𝑑superscript𝑋23|{\\cal C}|+|{\\cal I}|\\leq d\\cdot|X|^{2/3} imply that, unless we have already concluded that (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) is a yes-instance, we have that and the theorem follows.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: we define later.
