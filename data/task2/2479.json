      "content": "Paper Title: MFAGAN: A Compression Framework for Memory-Efficient On-Device Super-Resolution GAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, a series of efficient networks with parameters in the range of 10M have been proposed for the efficient SR task 9. We call these kinds of networks efficient super-resolution networks. They can be approximately divided into two classes: handcrafted architectures and model compression-based methods. A surge of handcrafted architectures have been designed for the efficient SR task, ranging from post-upsampling operators , group convolutions [ref]19, residual blocks [ref]42, recursive structures , cascaded architectures , inverse sub-pixel convolution 1, attention mechanisms , to information multi-distillation block (IMDB) . Besides, model compression techniques such as knowledge distillation, channel pruning, and binary quantization have also been used to speed up the SR networks. Specifically, RFDN  applied channel pruning along with residual feature aggregation module to improve the IMDB efficiency, which is the winner solution of the AIM 2020 Challenge on Efficient Super-Resolution 9. However, these methods aim to maximize PSNR between SR and HR, which tend to generate blurry results without high-frequency details. Efficient super-resolution networks cannot be directly used as the generator of GAN-based SR.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: architectures and model compression-based methods. A surge of handcrafted architectures have been designed for the efficient SR task, ranging from post-upsampling operators , group convolutions [ref]19, residual blocks [ref]42, recursive structures , cascaded architectures , inverse sub-pixel convolution 1, attention mechanisms , to information multi-distillation block (IMDB) . Besides,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
