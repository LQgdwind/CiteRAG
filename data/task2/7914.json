      "content": "Paper Title: Network Representation and Modular Decomposition of Combinatorial Structures: A Galled-Tree Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the main features of the modular decomposition tree (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) of a strudigram 𝒮=(𝒳,Υ,σ)𝒮𝒳script-Υ𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\Upsilon,\\sigma) is that, in the absence of prime modules, (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) explains 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}.\nHowever, the information about σ​(x,y)𝜎𝑥𝑦\\sigma(x,y) is hidden if τ​(lca𝒯⁡(x,y))=Prime𝜏subscriptlca𝒯𝑥𝑦Prime\\tau(\\operatorname{lca}_{\\mathscr{T}}(x,y))=\\textsc{Prime}. To\nprovide the missing structural information of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}, we aim to locally replace the prime vertices in\n(𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) to obtain networks that capture full information about 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}. This idea has already\nbeen fruitfully applied by replacing prime vertices with\nso-called 0/1010/1-labeled galls to obtain networks explaining restricted “binary” strudigrams\n(X,{0,1},σ)𝑋01𝜎(X,\\{0,1\\},\\sigma) [ref]32, or with so-called labeled halfgrids to obtain networks that explain\narbitrary strudigrams . These constructions, involving the replacement of prime\nvertices by other networks, have been studied for rather restricted types of networks only. Here, we\naim to generalize this concept to make the ”prime-vertex replacement” applicable in a more general\nsetting. There are several motivations to consider such networks. On the one hand, structural properties of\n(N,t)𝑁𝑡(N,t) can provide deep structural insights into the strudigrams they explain. For example,\nstrudigrams 𝒮=(𝒳,{0,1},σ)𝒮𝒳01𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\{0,1\\},\\sigma) that can be explained by so-called labeled galled trees (also\nknown as GaTEx graphs) are closely related to weakly-chordal, perfect graphs with perfect order,\ncomparability, and permutation graphs . These results are based on a characterization of\nsuch GaTEx graphs in terms of 25 forbidden induced subgraphs, a result established by leveraging\nthe structure of the network that explains 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}. In addition, such networks (N,t)𝑁𝑡(N,t) can guide algorithms to solve many NP-hard problems in polynomial\ntime for restricted strudigrams. For example, in the absence of prime modules in 𝒮=(𝒳,{0,1},σ)𝒮𝒳01𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\{0,1\\},\\sigma), the graph representation G𝐺G of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S} is a cograph. In this case, the modular\ndecomposition tree (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) has been shown to be a vital tool to prove that many NP-hard\nproblems such as finding optimal colorings, clique detection, Hamiltonicity, and cluster-deletion\ncan be solved in linear time on cographs   . Similarly, if (N,t)𝑁𝑡(N,t) is a\nso-called 0/1010/1-labeled galled tree, the resulting strudigram 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S} is equivalent to GaTEx graphs, and it has\nbeen shown in [ref]33 [ref]35 that NP-hard problems such as finding\nperfect orderings, maximum cliques or independent sets, and minimum colorings can be solved in\nlinear time. Again, (N,t)𝑁𝑡(N,t) serves as a guide for these algorithms to find the optimal solutions. Modular decomposition has many important applications, e.g., in community detection in complex\nnetworks , in evolutionary biology and orthology detection\n  , in structure recognition of\nprotein-interaction networks  , pattern detection in diagnostic data\n, graph drawing , automata theory\n, and many more. However, graphs or, more generally, strudigrams that arise\nfrom real-world data, particularly in evolutionary biology, are often better represented by a\nnetwork rather than a tree to accommodate evolutionary events such as hybridization or horizontal\ngene transfer. One way to address this problem is, again, the local replacement of prime\nvertices in (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) by small labeled networks. We start here by providing the general concept of prime-vertex replacement (pvr) networks.\nLater, in Section 6, we will focus on a particular type of DAGs used to replace prime vertices\nand provide a characterization of strudigrams that can be explained by such types of networks. In what follows, we say that two networks N𝑁N and N′superscript𝑁′N^{\\prime} are internal vertex-disjoint, if (V0​(N)∖{ρN})∩(V0​(N′)∖{ρN′})=∅superscript𝑉0𝑁subscript𝜌𝑁superscript𝑉0superscript𝑁′subscript𝜌superscript𝑁′(V^{0}(N)\\setminus\\{\\rho_{N}\\})\\cap(V^{0}(N^{\\prime})\\setminus\\{\\rho_{N^{\\prime}}\\})=\\emptyset. Let 𝒮=(𝒳,Υ,σ)𝒮𝒳script-Υ𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\Upsilon,\\sigma) be a strudigram and 𝒫⊆𝕄str​(𝒮)𝒫subscript𝕄str𝒮\\mathcal{P}\\subseteq\\mathbb{M}_{\\mathrm{str}}(\\mathpzc{S}) be the set of all of its prime modules and\n(𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) be its modular decomposition tree. A prime-explaining family (of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}) is a set\nℱ​(𝒮)={(𝒩ℳ,𝓉ℳ)∣ℳ∈𝒫}ℱ𝒮conditional-setsubscript𝒩ℳsubscript𝓉ℳℳ𝒫\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S})=\\{(N_{M},t_{M})\\mid M\\in\\mathcal{P}\\} of pairwise internal vertex-disjoint labeled networks such\nthat, for each M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P}, the network (NM,tM)subscript𝑁𝑀subscript𝑡𝑀(N_{M},t_{M}) explains the strudigram 𝒮​[ℳ]/𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])𝒮delimited-[]ℳsubscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳ\\mathpzc{S}[M]/\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M]). As we shall see, the modular decomposition tree (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) of each strudigram 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S} can be\nmodified by locally replacing prime vertices M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P} by (NM,tM)∈ℱ​(𝒮)subscript𝑁𝑀subscript𝑡𝑀ℱ𝒮(N_{M},t_{M})\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) to obtain\na labeled network that explains 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}. This idea is made precise in the following Let 𝒮=(𝒳,Υ,σ)𝒮𝒳script-Υ𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\Upsilon,\\sigma) be a strudigram and 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} be the set of all prime vertices in\nits modular decomposition tree (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau).\nLet ℱ​(𝒮)ℱ𝒮\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) be a prime-explaining family of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}.\nA prime-vertex replacement (pvr) network pvr⁡(𝒮,ℱ​(𝒮))pvr𝒮ℱ𝒮\\operatorname{pvr}(\\mathpzc{S},\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S})) of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S} is the directed, labeled graph (N,t)𝑁𝑡(N,t) obtained by the following procedure: For each M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P}, remove all edges (M,M′)𝑀superscript𝑀′(M,M^{\\prime}) with\nM′∈child𝒯⁡(M)superscript𝑀′subscriptchild𝒯𝑀M^{\\prime}\\in\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M) from 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} to obtain the directed graph\nT′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime}. Construct a directed graph N𝑁N by adding, for each M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P}, NMsubscript𝑁𝑀N_{M} to T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} by identifying the root\nof NMsubscript𝑁𝑀N_{M} with M𝑀M in T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} and each leaf M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime} of NMsubscript𝑁𝑀N_{M} with the\ncorresponding child M′∈child𝒯⁡(M)superscript𝑀′subscriptchild𝒯𝑀M^{\\prime}\\in\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M). Define the labeling t:V0​(N)→Υ:𝑡→superscript𝑉0𝑁Υt\\colon V^{0}(N)\\to\\Upsilon by putting, for\nall w∈V0​(N)𝑤superscript𝑉0𝑁w\\in V^{0}(N), Replace every singleton module {x}∈V​(N)𝑥𝑉𝑁\\{x\\}\\in V(N) in N𝑁N by x𝑥x. The resulting labeled directed graph (N,t)𝑁𝑡(N,t) is called pvr-network (of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}) and denoted by pvr⁡(𝒮,ℱ​(𝒮))pvr𝒮ℱ𝒮\\operatorname{pvr}(\\mathpzc{S},\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S})). Step 4 of Definition 5.2 is a necessary\ntechnicality brought by the fact that the leaves of the modular decomposition tree consists of the\nsingletons {x}𝑥\\{x\\} for x∈V​(𝒮)𝑥𝑉𝒮x\\in V(\\mathpzc{S}), rather than the set V​(𝒮)𝑉𝒮V(\\mathpzc{S}) itself.\nWe emphasize that the networks used in ℱ​(𝒮)ℱ𝒮\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) are not required to be leaf-separated.\nSee Figure 4 and 8 for illustrative examples. Let 𝒮=(𝒳,Υ,σ)𝒮𝒳script-Υ𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\Upsilon,\\sigma) be a strudigram, 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} be the set of all prime vertices in\nits modular decomposition tree (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) and\nℱ​(𝒮)ℱ𝒮\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) be a prime-explaining family of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}.\nThen, pvr⁡(𝒮,ℱ​(𝒮))pvr𝒮ℱ𝒮\\operatorname{pvr}(\\mathpzc{S},\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S})) is a labeled network on X𝑋X. In particular, V0​(𝒯)∪X⊆V​(N)superscript𝑉0𝒯𝑋𝑉𝑁V^{0}(\\mathscr{T})\\cup X\\subseteq V(N). Moreover, all u,v∈V​(𝒯)𝑢𝑣𝑉𝒯u,v\\in V(\\mathscr{T}) with v⪯𝒯usubscriptprecedes-or-equals𝒯𝑣𝑢v\\preceq_{\\mathscr{T}}u satisfy v⪯Nusubscriptprecedes-or-equals𝑁𝑣𝑢v\\preceq_{N}u, and\nevery vertex along the (unique) directed u​v𝑢𝑣uv-path in 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} is contained in every directed u​v𝑢𝑣uv-path in N𝑁N. Let (N,t)≔pvr⁡(𝒮,ℱ​(𝒮))≔𝑁𝑡pvr𝒮ℱ𝒮(N,t)\\coloneqq\\operatorname{pvr}(\\mathpzc{S},\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S})). We first verify that N𝑁N is a well-defined network on\nX𝑋X. By construction, we have V​(N)=V0​(𝒯)∪X∪(⋃M∈𝒫V0​(NM))𝑉𝑁superscript𝑉0𝒯𝑋subscript𝑀𝒫superscript𝑉0subscript𝑁𝑀V(N)=V^{0}(\\mathscr{T})\\cup X\\cup\\left(\\bigcup_{M\\in\\mathcal{P}}V^{0}(N_{M})\\right). Note that\neach M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P} is a vertex in V0​(𝒯)superscript𝑉0𝒯V^{0}(\\mathscr{T}) and thus, the identification of the root ρNMsubscript𝜌subscript𝑁𝑀\\rho_{N_{M}} of\nNMsubscript𝑁𝑀N_{M} with the vertex M𝑀M in 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} in Def. 5.2(2) is well-defined.\nFurthermore, by definition of MDTs, child𝒯⁡(M)=𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])subscriptchild𝒯𝑀subscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳ\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M)=\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M]) for all strong modules M𝑀M of\n𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}. Moreover, the quotient strudigram 𝒮ℳ≔𝒮​[ℳ]/𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])≔subscript𝒮ℳ𝒮delimited-[]ℳsubscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳ\\mathpzc{S}_{M}\\coloneqq\\mathpzc{S}[M]/\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M]) has vertex set\n𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])subscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳ\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M]) and, by definition of ℱ​(𝒮)ℱ𝒮\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}), the rooted network (NM,tM)∈ℱ​(𝒮)subscript𝑁𝑀subscript𝑡𝑀ℱ𝒮(N_{M},t_{M})\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S})\nexplains 𝒮ℳsubscript𝒮ℳ\\mathpzc{S}_{M} and must, therefore, satisfy L​(NM)=V​(𝒮ℳ)=𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])=child𝒯⁡(ℳ)𝐿subscript𝑁𝑀𝑉subscript𝒮ℳsubscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳsubscriptchild𝒯ℳL(N_{M})=V(\\mathpzc{S}_{M})=\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M])=\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M).\nHence there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the leaves of NMsubscript𝑁𝑀N_{M} and the elements of\nchild𝒯⁡(M)subscriptchild𝒯𝑀\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M), and the identification of vertices in Def. 5.2(2) is\nwell-defined. Moreover, the only edges removed from 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} while constructing N𝑁N are edges (M,M′)𝑀superscript𝑀′(M,M^{\\prime}) for which M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P} and M′∈child𝒯⁡(M)superscript𝑀′subscriptchild𝒯𝑀M^{\\prime}\\in\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M), and every edge of NMsubscript𝑁𝑀N_{M} with M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P} appears\nin N𝑁N. Since NMsubscript𝑁𝑀N_{M} is a network on 𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])subscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳ\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M]), there is a directed path from ρNMsubscript𝜌subscript𝑁𝑀\\rho_{N_{M}} to each\nelement in 𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])=child𝒯⁡(ℳ)subscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳsubscriptchild𝒯ℳ\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M])=\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M) and these paths remain in N𝑁N. Hence,\nany v,u∈V0​(NM)𝑣𝑢superscript𝑉0subscript𝑁𝑀v,u\\in V^{0}(N_{M}) with v⪯NMusubscriptprecedes-or-equalssubscript𝑁𝑀𝑣𝑢v\\preceq_{N_{M}}u satisfy v⪯Nusubscriptprecedes-or-equals𝑁𝑣𝑢v\\preceq_{N}u. It is now a straightforward\ntask to verify that the latter argument together with the construction of N𝑁N immediately implies\nthat, for any v,u∈V​(𝒯)𝑣𝑢𝑉𝒯v,u\\in V(\\mathscr{T}) with v⪯𝒯usubscriptprecedes-or-equals𝒯𝑣𝑢v\\preceq_{\\mathscr{T}}u, there is a directed path u​v𝑢𝑣uv-path in N𝑁N,\nno directed path v​u𝑣𝑢vu-path in N𝑁N and every vertex along the (unique)\ndirected u​v𝑢𝑣uv-path in 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} is contained in every directed u​v𝑢𝑣uv-path in N𝑁N. Consequently, N𝑁N\nis a well-defined DAG. Moreover, it is an easy task to verify that the module X𝑋X remains, by\nconstruction, the unique root of N𝑁N. In addition, {x}∉𝒫𝑥𝒫\\{x\\}\\notin\\mathcal{P} for all x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X and by\nDef. 5.2(4) each x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X is a vertex in N𝑁N. Taken the latter\ntwo arguments together, N𝑁N is a well-defined network on X𝑋X. By construction all vertices in V0​(𝒯)superscript𝑉0𝒯V^{0}(\\mathscr{T}) remain vertices in N𝑁N and thus, V0​(𝒯)∪X⊆V​(N)superscript𝑉0𝒯𝑋𝑉𝑁V^{0}(\\mathscr{T})\\cup X\\subseteq V(N).\nNote that each vertex w∈V0​(N)𝑤superscript𝑉0𝑁w\\in V^{0}(N) is either a vertex in V0​(𝒯)superscript𝑉0𝒯V^{0}(\\mathscr{T}) or a vertex contained in V0​(NM)superscript𝑉0subscript𝑁𝑀V^{0}(N_{M}) for some M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P}\nand each such vertex obtained either some color τ​(w)𝜏𝑤\\tau(w) or tM​(w)subscript𝑡𝑀𝑤t_{M}(w) according to Def. 5.2(3).\nConsequently,\nthe labeling t𝑡t as specified in Def. 5.2(3) is well-defined.\nHence, (N,t)=pvr⁡(𝒮,ℱ​(𝒮))𝑁𝑡pvr𝒮ℱ𝒮(N,t)=\\operatorname{pvr}(\\mathpzc{S},\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S})) is a labeled network on X𝑋X.\n∎ The important property of a pvr-network is that it can be used to explain strudigrams, ensured by the following two results. Let 𝒮=(𝒳,Υ,σ)𝒮𝒳script-Υ𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\Upsilon,\\sigma) be a strudigram, 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} be the set of all prime vertices in\nits modular decomposition tree (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) and ℱ​(𝒮)ℱ𝒮\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) be a prime-explaining family of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}.\nPut (N,t)≔pvr⁡(𝒮,ℱ)≔𝑁𝑡pvr𝒮ℱ(N,t)\\coloneqq\\operatorname{pvr}(\\mathpzc{S},\\mathcal{F}) and v˙≔{v}≔˙𝑣𝑣\\dot{v}\\coloneqq\\{v\\}.\nThen, N𝑁N has the 2−lca⁡l​c​a2lca𝑙𝑐𝑎\\operatorname{\\textit{2}-lca}lca-property and, for all distinct x,y∈L​(N)𝑥𝑦𝐿𝑁x,y\\in L(N), it holds that Moreover, if every (NM,tM)∈ℱ​(𝒮)subscript𝑁𝑀subscript𝑡𝑀ℱ𝒮(N_{M},t_{M})\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) has the k−lcaklca\\operatorname{\\textit{k}-lca}-property for some k≤|X|𝑘𝑋k\\leq|X|,\nthen (N,t)𝑁𝑡(N,t) has the k−lcaklca\\operatorname{\\textit{k}-lca}-property. Let 𝒮=(𝒳,Υ,σ)𝒮𝒳script-Υ𝜎\\mathpzc{S}=(X,\\Upsilon,\\sigma) be a strudigram, 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} be the set of all prime vertices in\nits modular decomposition tree (𝒯,τ)𝒯𝜏(\\mathscr{T},\\tau) and ℱ​(𝒮)ℱ𝒮\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) be a prime-explaining family of 𝒮𝒮\\mathpzc{S}.\nPut (N,t)≔pvr⁡(𝒮,ℱ)≔𝑁𝑡pvr𝒮ℱ(N,t)\\coloneqq\\operatorname{pvr}(\\mathpzc{S},\\mathcal{F}).\nNote that every (NM,tM)∈ℱ​(𝒮)subscript𝑁𝑀subscript𝑡𝑀ℱ𝒮(N_{M},t_{M})\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) has the 2−lca⁡l​c​a2lca𝑙𝑐𝑎\\operatorname{\\textit{2}-lca}lca-property.\nAssume now that that every (NM,tM)∈ℱ​(𝒮)subscript𝑁𝑀subscript𝑡𝑀ℱ𝒮(N_{M},t_{M})\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\mathpzc{S}) has the k−lcaklca\\operatorname{\\textit{k}-lca}-property for some k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2.\nLet A⊆X𝐴𝑋A\\subseteq X with |A|≤k𝐴𝑘|A|\\leq k.\nSince 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} is a tree, it is an lca-network and, therefore, M≔lca𝒯⁡(A)≔𝑀subscriptlca𝒯𝐴M\\coloneqq\\operatorname{lca}_{\\mathscr{T}}(A)\nis well-defined. As already argued in the proof of Lemma 5.3, L​(NM)=𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])=child𝒯⁡(ℳ)𝐿subscript𝑁𝑀subscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳsubscriptchild𝒯ℳL(N_{M})=\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M])=\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M), for all M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P}.\nLet M1,…,Mℓ∈child𝒯⁡(M)subscript𝑀1…subscript𝑀ℓsubscriptchild𝒯𝑀M_{1},\\dots,M_{\\ell}\\in\\operatorname{child}_{\\mathscr{T}}(M) be all children of M𝑀M for which A∩Mi≠∅𝐴subscript𝑀𝑖A\\cap M_{i}\\neq\\emptyset.\nSince M1,…,Mℓ∈𝕄max​(𝒮​[ℳ])subscript𝑀1…subscript𝑀ℓsubscript𝕄𝒮delimited-[]ℳM_{1},\\dots,M_{\\ell}\\in\\mathbb{M}_{\\max}(\\mathpzc{S}[M]), we have Mi∩Mj=∅subscript𝑀𝑖subscript𝑀𝑗M_{i}\\cap M_{j}=\\emptyset, 1≤i<j≤ℓ1𝑖𝑗ℓ1\\leq i<j\\leq\\ell.\nIn particular, ℓ≤kℓ𝑘\\ell\\leq k must hold. Moreover,\nM𝑀M is the unique inclusion-minimal cluster in 𝒯𝒯\\mathscr{T} that contains B≔∪i=1ℓMi≔𝐵superscriptsubscript𝑖1ℓsubscript𝑀𝑖B\\coloneqq\\cup_{i=1}^{\\ell}M_{i}.

Aided by Lemma 5.4, we consider two cases:\nM∉𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\notin\\mathcal{P}, respectively M∈𝒫𝑀𝒫M\\in\\mathcal{P}.
