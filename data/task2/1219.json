      "content": "Paper Title: SurFree: a fast surrogate-free black-box attack\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper operates in a black box setup;\nwhite box attacks [ref]2 [ref]26  are considered out of its scope. There has been a huge improvement on the amount of queries of score-based black box attacks.\nOn ImageNet, the order of magnitudes of the first attacks were of some hundreds of thousands queries for one image with a reported runtime of 20 minutes in¬†.\nNowadays state-of-the-art attacks make less than one thousand calls to the classifier, thanks to advanced gradient estimators¬† and Zero Order Optimization techniques¬†  . The decision-based attacks followed the same trend but with a factor of ten.\nBrendel et al.report in the order of one million of queries for one image in one of the first black-box decision based paper¬†[1, Fig.¬†6].\nThen, the order of magnitude went down to tens of thousands¬†[3, Fig.¬†4] [14, Fig.¬†5] and even some thousands in¬†[23, Fig.¬†2].\nNo decision-based paper reports results with less than one thousand of calls on ImageNet.\nThis paper explores this range of query budget. The main engine of the decision-based attacks iterates the three following steps:\ni) the surjection (find a point on the boundary),\nii) the estimation of the gradient (\\iethe normal vector of the tangent hyperplane),\niii) the update of the adversarial example.\nStep ii) proceeds by bombarding the model with small perturbations around the boundary point.\nThe main problems are the trade-off between the number of queries devoted to this task and the accuracy of the gradient estimate (see¬†[3, Th.¬†2], [23, Lemma¬†2], [14, Th.¬†1])\nand the impact of this accuracy on the convergence of the attack (see¬†[23, Th.¬†2]). In the end, [ref]23 recommends that step ii) consumes a number of queries following a geometric sequence w.r.t. the iteration number, whereas  makes it proportional to the square root of the iteration number.\nThis paper follows the opposite strategy: no query is spent for a gradient estimate. A second track of improvement is dimension reduction restricting the perturbation to a low dimension subspace.\nThis a priori increases of distortion at convergence since the attacker has fewer degrees of freedom, but it indeed facilitates the estimation of the projected gradient.\nThe latter is more important for low query budget.\nThe choice of the subspace incorporates prior information: it usually corresponds to a low-frequency band (of the full ùô≥ùô≤ùöÉùô≥ùô≤ùöÉ\\mathtt{DCT} transform [ref]23 ) containing most critical information about the visual content of the image.\nThis paper shows that the block ùô≥ùô≤ùöÉùô≥ùô≤ùöÉ\\mathtt{DCT} yields better results.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: This paper operates in a black box setup;\nwhite box attacks [ref]2 [ref]26  are considered out of its scope.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
