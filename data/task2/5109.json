      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion Denoising Process for Perceptron Bias in Out-of-distribution Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Table 1, we choose six representative baselines, which do not adjust the discriminator model similar to our method. ODIN [ref]11 uses temperature scaling and gradient-based input perturbation. EBO [ref]36 uses an energy-based function. ReAct [ref]37 uses rectified activation. MLS  uses maximum logit scores. VIM  combines the information of feature space and logic space. KNN  uses the nearest neighbor in the feature space. Our method surpasses all these methods in five out of ten cases and achieves comparable results in the remaining cases. In Table 2, we find that our method performs better than the other methods in two out of five cases and achieves comparable results in the remaining cases. This shows the effectiveness of our method on datasets of varying sizes. Moreover, our method has low standard variance across different OOD datasets, indicating its excellent generalization ability. FPR@95 results can be found in Appendix A.6. OOD detection is widely used in scenarios with high-security requirements. It is also imperative to identify any misclassified data from the InD dataset. Thus, we treat the misclassified data of the pre-trained ResNet18 as a new form of OOD data. ResNet18 has an accuracy of only 78% on CIFAR100, making it an appropriate candidate for demonstrating the impact of misclassified data. Our method achieves SOTA results in distinguishing between correctly and incorrectly classified data in the training datasets. Under this setting, MLS and VIM outperform us on only one OOD dataset, respectively, and the gap is small. On all other datasets, our method is substantially ahead of all other methods. By comparing the results in the corresponding positions in Table 1 and 3, we find that after removing the misclassified data from InD, the OOD detection results of all methods are improved, with our method having the biggest improvement. This means that all methods tend to treat misclassified data as OOD data. The detection results of misclassified data and classical OOD data are mixed, which limits the classical OOD detection results.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: In Table 1, we choose six representative baselines, which do not adjust the discriminator model similar to our method.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
