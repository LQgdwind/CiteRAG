Standard diffusion samplers like¬†(2)\noperate in the same space that the diffusion model was trained. While samplers can be modified to solve many image-to-image tasks in zero-shot such as colorization and inpainting¬† [ref]39, until recently, pretrained image diffusion models could only generate rasterized images. In contrast, image encoders like VGG16 trained on ImageNet and CLIP (Contrastive Language‚ÄìImage Pre-training)¬† have been transferred to many modalities like mesh texture generation¬†[ref]23, 3D neural fields¬† , and vector graphics¬† . Even though encoders are not generative, they can generate data with test time optimization: a loss function in the encoder‚Äôs feature space is backpropagated to a learned image or function outputting images. DreamFusion¬†[ref]26 proposed an approach to use a pretrained pixel-space text-to-image diffusion model as a loss function. Their proposed Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss provides a way to assess the similarity between an image and a caption: pœïsubscriptùëùitalic-œïp_{\\phi} is the distribution learned by the frozen, pretrained diffusion model. qùëûq is a unimodal Gaussian distribution centered at a learned mean image g‚Äã(Œ∏)ùëîùúÉg(\\theta).\nIn this manner, SDS turned sampling into an optimization problem: an image or a differentiable image parameterization (DIP)¬†[ref]23 can be optimized with ‚ÑíSDSsubscript‚ÑíSDS\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SDS}} to bring it toward the conditional distribution of the teacher. This is inspired by probability density distillation¬†1. Critically, SDS only needs access to a pixel-space prior pœïsubscriptùëùitalic-œïp_{\\phi}, parameterized with the denoising autoencoder œµ^œïsubscript^italic-œµitalic-œï\\hat{\\epsilon}_{\\phi}. It does not require access to a prior over the parameter space Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta. DreamFusion¬†[ref]26 used SDS with the Imagen pixel space diffusion model to learn the parameters of a 3D Neural Radiance Field¬†. In practice, SDS gives access to loss gradients, not a scalar loss:\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: samplers like¬†(2)\noperate in the same space that the diffusion model was trained.
