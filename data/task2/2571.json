      "content": "Paper Title: Attribute-based Explanation of Non-Linear Embeddings of High-Dimensional Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmbeddings of high-dimensional data are widely used to explore data, to verify analysis results, and to communicate information. Their explanation, in particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With linear projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With non-linear projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies such as attribute-based color coding are required. In this paper, we review existing augmentation techniques and discuss their limitations. We present the Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges (complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in thermodynamics.

Color-based augmentation helps relate structures in the embedded point cloud to input attributes (bottom, continuous variables) and domain knowledge (top, categorical variables). Our new approach enabled domain scientists detect previously unrecognizable patterns and outliers in their data. Introduction High-dimensional data is omnipresent in the form of tabular data. It occurs in economy, biology, chemistry, political science, astronomy, and physics to only name a few  . For such data a large variety of analysis techniques is offered in modern data analysis libraries ranging from cluster analysis, to regression, to outlier detection, and dimensionality reduction .\nThe exploratory data analysis principles requests for such techniques to show for each drawn conclusion a raw data plot that convincingly shows such . In many applications this raw data plot is an embedding of the high-dimensional data using methods like linear projections (e.g. PCA) or non-linear techniques like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Linear techniques have the advantage that the resulting axes still have meaning, but often they cannot uncover complex structures in high-dimensional space. Non-linear projections often nicely reveal complex structure in high-dimensional space, but no longer offer direct annotation of the projected space. Hence, it is paramount to equip these widely used techniques with mechanisms that help users properly read the projected data and relate original data attributes to the computed features. Going through examples in high-dimensional data analysis libraries  and recent papers , we observed that the gold standard for this task is still color-coding glyphs and 2D interpolation-based scalarfield reconstruction  as is also confirmed by the survey by Nonato et al. . Fig. 1 compares these standard techniques for an MDS embedding of the wine dataset   augmented with the alcohol levels of each sample point. Color-coding assigns each projected data point a color using one of the original attributes (Fig. 1(b)). This technique is easy to implement and to comprehend, but suffers from occlusion and visual clutter and makes outlier detection difficult [ref]37.\nScalarfield reconstruction techniques  reconstruct a 2D scalar function for a given attribute, which serves as input to a spatial color-coding (Fig. 1(d) + 1(e)).\nThis results in readily visible spatial patterns, but cannot account\nfor the fact that data points with different attribute values are projected onto the same position in 2D space.\nIn our new technique, we combine the strengths of these two directions.\nOur goals are to design a technique and system that are easy to use and comprehend, that are applicable to all types of embedding techniques, that can be directly integrated into existing analysis pipelines, and that enable the user to quickly and correctly understand attribute value distributions in the embedded data.\nWe also remark that the goal of this paper is not to explain the projection, i.e., the precise nature of the data transformation from high-dimensional to 2D space, as is done for example in  6  who visually encode least-varying dimensions, but only the final outcome, i.e., the embedding of the data points in the plane. In this paper, we present NoLiES, an interactive system that enables the user to explore linear and non-linear embeddings with respect to the original attributes. The code is open source111https://github.com/leitte/NoLiES and a live demo is provided via MyBinder222https://bndr.it/2m8ns.\nNoLiES inherently relies on a novel augmentation technique for multidimensional projections, which we call rangesets. Rangesets, as presented in Fig. 1(c), visually group datapoints with similar attribute values into non-convex α𝛼\\alpha-hulls. The method allows for outlier filtering and user defined adjustments which is explained in detail in Sect. 3.\nTo answer questions relating to multiple attributes, an interactive analytics system is required, which will be presented in Sect. 4. Several use cases, a real-world application problem of machine learning (ML) in thermodynamics (Sect. 5), and feedback from an informal expert user study (Sect. 6) are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the novel technique. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We review the state-of-the-art of direct augmentation techniques for multivariate projections and highlight strengths and interpretation challenges with these techniques. We detail a novel visualization technique (rangesets) to augment embeddings. We detail the connection of rangesets to algebraic topology and provide first steps on how this theory can be used to further improve augmentations of embeddings. We present an interactive analysis system and detail the analysis workflow to interpret linear and non-linear embeddings, along with several case studies using examples from ML data bases and real world applications.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: a color using one of the original attributes (Fig. 1(b)).
