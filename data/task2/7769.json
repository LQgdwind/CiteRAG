In this section, we show how a similar preprocessing can be done for general PQ-representations. Each PQ-representation also has an equivalent ILP and solving a relaxation of this ILP allows us to remove the dependency on the right-hand-side (e.g. u𝑢u in the case of P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}}): Given a PQ-representation (P,Q,m)fragments(P,Q,m)(P,Q,m) with P={x∈ℝ≥0N|A(P)x=b(P)}fragmentsP{xRfragments0𝑁|Afragments(P)xbfragments(P)}P=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{N}\\,|\\,A^{(P)}x=b^{(P)}\\} and Q={x∈ℝ≥0N|A(Q)x=b(Q)}fragmentsQ{xRfragments0𝑁|Afragments(Q)xbfragments(Q)}Q=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{N}\\,|\\,A^{(Q)}x=b^{(Q)}\\}, the points y∈int.cone(P∩ℤN)∩Qfragmentsyint.cone(PZ𝑁)Qy\\in\\text{int.cone}(P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N})\\cap Q have a one-to-one correspondence to the solutions of the following ILP, projected to block m+1fragmentsm1m+1 and the other blocks correspond to vectors y(1),…,y(m)∈P∩ℤNfragmentsyfragments(1),…,yfragments(m)PZ𝑁y^{(1)},\\ldots,y^{(m)}\\in P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N} such that y=y(1)+…+y(m)fragmentsyyfragments(1)…yfragments(m)y=y^{(1)}+\\ldots+y^{(m)}: Suppose we are given a point y=y(1)+…+y(m)∈int.cone(P∩ℤN)∩Qfragmentsyyfragments(1)…yfragments(m)int.cone(PZ𝑁)Qy=y^{(1)}+\\ldots+y^{(m)}\\in\\text{int.cone}(P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N})\\cap Q such that for all i∈[m]fragmentsi[m]i\\in[m], y(i)∈P∩ℤNfragmentsyfragments(i)PZ𝑁y^{(i)}\\in P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N}. Then x:=(y(1)…y(m)y)Tfragmentsxassignmatrixfragmentsyfragments(1)…fragmentsyfragments(m)𝑦𝑇x:=\\begin{pmatrix}y^{(1)}&\\ldots&y^{(m)}&y\\end{pmatrix}^{T} is a solution of the above ILP.\nNow suppose we have a solution x=(y(1)…y(m)y)Tfragmentsxmatrixfragmentsyfragments(1)…fragmentsyfragments(m)𝑦𝑇x=\\begin{pmatrix}y^{(1)}&\\ldots&y^{(m)}&y\\end{pmatrix}^{T}. Then by the local, non-negativity and integrality constraints, we have y(i)∈P∩ℤNfragmentsyfragments(i)PZ𝑁y^{(i)}\\in P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N} for all i∈[m]fragmentsi[m]i\\in[m]. By the first set of constraints, we have y∈QfragmentsyQy\\in Q and by the second set of constraints, we have y=y(1)+…+y(m)fragmentsyyfragments(1)…yfragments(m)y=y^{(1)}+\\ldots+y^{(m)}. Hence, y∈int.cone(P∩ℤN)∩Qfragmentsyint.cone(PZ𝑁)Qy\\in\\text{int.cone}(P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N})\\cap Q. The ILP in 4.1 has a so-called n𝑛n-fold structure, as indicated by the framing (see e.g. [ref]13).\nWe use a proximity result by Clsovjecsek et al.  to bound the vectors in P𝑃P, which allows us to reduce the coefficients in the right-hand-side.444We cite the first version of their paper here, because it is much easier to see how the approach for solving the relaxation can be adapted to the case where many blocks are identical. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the ILP corresponding to the PQ-representation.\nIn general, this convexified relaxation of an n𝑛n-fold ILP looks like this: where the C(i)∈ℤr×tfragmentsCfragments(i)ZfragmentsrtC^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{r\\times t} are the blocks at the top, b(0)∈ℤrfragmentsbfragments(0)Z𝑟b^{(0)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{r} is the corresponding right-hand-side, the B(i)∈ℤs×tfragmentsBfragments(i)ZfragmentsstB^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{s\\times t} are the blocks on the diagonal, the b(i)∈ℤsfragmentsbfragments(i)Z𝑠b^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{s} are the corresponding right-hand-sides, the c(i)∈ℤtfragmentscfragments(i)Z𝑡c^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{t} are the parts of the objective function and u∈ℤtfragmentsuZ𝑡u\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{t} is an upper bound for the variables.\nCslovjecsek et al.  show that the Lagrangean dual (w.r.t. the first r𝑟r constraints) of this problem can be solved with at most rO(1)log2(ntK)fragmentsrfragmentsO(1)2(ntK)r^{O(1)}\\log^{2}(ntK) calls to a separation oracle, where K𝐾K is the largest number appearing in the objective function, matrix and right-hand-side.\nThe separation oracle has to solve for a given λ∈ℝrfragmentsλR𝑟\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r}. In general, this can be done by solving ILPs corresponding to the n𝑛n blocks Q(i)fragmentsQfragments(i)Q^{(i)} separately, which can be done in a total time ntO(t)(stlog(K))O(1)fragmentsntfragmentsO(t)(st(K))fragmentsO(1)nt^{O(t)}(st\\log(K))^{O(1)} using the algorithm by Kannan  n𝑛n times.555Cslovjecsek et al.  use the algorithm by Eisenbrand and Weismantel  instead, but here it makes more sense to use the algorithm by Kannan , as our running time will be exponential in t𝑡t anyway. However, note that if for two blocks i𝑖i and j𝑗j, we have c(i)=c(j)fragmentscfragments(i)cfragments(j)c^{(i)}=c^{(j)}, as well as B(i)=B(j)fragmentsBfragments(i)Bfragments(j)B^{(i)}=B^{(j)} and b(i)=b(j)fragmentsbfragments(i)bfragments(j)b^{(i)}=b^{(j)}, the ILP has the same optimal solution(s). When we have computed a solution of the Lagrangean dual, we still have to compute a solution of the primal, i.e., the convexified relaxation. This part is described in more detail in the second version of the paper by Cslovjecsek et al. : While solving the dual with the cutting plane algorithm, each call to the separation oracle yields an optimizer z(j)∈ℤntfragmentszfragments(j)Zfragmentsntz^{(j)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{nt} of the maximum in iteration j𝑗j. One then only has to find a vector x∗∈ℝntfragmentsxRfragmentsntx^{*}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{nt} in the convex hull of the z(j)fragmentszfragments(j)z^{(j)} that also fulfills the linking constraints ∑i=1nC(i)x(i)=b(0)fragmentsfragmentsi1𝑛Cfragments(i)xfragments(i)bfragments(0)\\sum_{i=1}^{n}C^{(i)}x^{(i)}=b^{(0)} and maximizes the objective max∑i=1n(c(i))Tx(i)fragmentsfragmentsi1𝑛(cfragments(i))𝑇xfragments(i)\\max\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(c^{(i)})^{T}x^{(i)}. This LP has many variables (equal to the number of calls to the separation oracle) but only r+1fragmentsr1r+1 constraints. So it can be solved e.g. with the algorithm by Megiddo  (applied to the dual of this LP; it also provides a primal solution) in a time that is polynomial in the number of oracle calls and 2O(r2)fragments2fragmentsO(r2)2^{O(r^{2})}.\nAltogether, for τ𝜏\\tau different blocks, this yields running time and we get the following result: Let τ𝜏\\tau be the number of different (c(i),B(i),b(i))fragments(cfragments(i),Bfragments(i),bfragments(i))(c^{(i)},B^{(i)},b^{(i)})-pairs, n𝑛n the number of blocks, r𝑟r, s𝑠s, t𝑡t the block dimensions and K𝐾K the largest number appearing in the objective function, matrix and right-hand-side. Then the convexified relaxation can be solved in time\nτtO(t)2O(r2)(srlog(Kn))O(1)fragmentsτtfragmentsO(t)2fragmentsO(r2)(sr(Kn))fragmentsO(1)\\tau t^{O(t)}2^{O(r^{2})}(sr\\log(Kn))^{O(1)}. Cslovjecsek et al.  show that the convexified relaxation has nice proximity properties, namely they show the following: For every solution x∗fragmentsxx^{*} of the convexified relaxation, there exists a solution z∗fragmentszz^{*} of the corresponding integer program such that ∥x∗−z∗∥1≤(rΔ(sΔ)O(s))O(r)fragments∥xz∥1(rΔ(sΔ)fragmentsO(s))fragmentsO(r)\\left\\lVert x^{*}-z^{*}\\right\\rVert_{1}\\leq(r\\Delta(s\\Delta)^{O(s)})^{O(r)}, where ΔΔ\\Delta is the largest absolute value in the matrix. By first solving the convexified relaxation using 4.3 and then applying the proximity bound from Theorem 4.4, we can bound the solutions of the ILP. Due to 4.1, this also bounds the points in P𝑃P and we obtain the following theorem (for a full proof, see LABEL:sect:omittedproofs): Consider a problem with a PQ-representation (P,Q,m)fragments(P,Q,m)(P,Q,m), where P={x∈ℝ≥0N|A(P)x=b(P)}fragmentsP{xRfragments0𝑁|Afragments(P)xbfragments(P)}P=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{N}\\,|\\,A^{(P)}x=b^{(P)}\\} with A(P)∈ℤM(P)×NfragmentsAfragments(P)ZfragmentsMfragments(P)NA^{(P)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(P)}\\times N} and Q={x∈ℝ≥0N|A(Q)x=b(Q)}fragmentsQ{xRfragments0𝑁|Afragments(Q)xbfragments(Q)}Q=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{N}\\,|\\,A^{(Q)}x=b^{(Q)}\\} with A(Q)∈ℤM(Q)×NfragmentsAfragments(Q)ZfragmentsMfragments(Q)NA^{(Q)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{M^{(Q)}\\times N}. Then by solving the convexified relaxation of the corresponding ILP in time 2O((M(Q)+N)2)(M(P)log(max{∥A(P)∥∞,∥A(Q)∥∞,∥b(P)∥∞,∥b(Q)∥∞}m))O(1)fragments2fragmentsO((Mfragments(Q)N)2)(Mfragments(P)({∥Afragments(P)∥,∥Afragments(Q)∥,∥bfragments(P)∥,∥bfragments(Q)∥}m))fragmentsO(1)2^{O((M^{(Q)}+N)^{2})}(M^{(P)}\\log(\\max\\{\\left\\lVert A^{(P)}\\right\\rVert_{\\infty},\\left\\lVert A^{(Q)}\\right\\rVert_{\\infty},\\left\\lVert b^{(P)}\\right\\rVert_{\\infty},\\left\\lVert b^{(Q)}\\right\\rVert_{\\infty}\\}m))^{O(1)} and modifying P𝑃P, we can assume that the points in P𝑃P have ℓ∞fragmentsℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-norm at most We now have all the tools to prove Theorem 1.5. The key idea is to combine Theorem 4.5 with the result by Frank and Tardos (2.2). This reduces the coefficients in the inequalities describing P𝑃P. In particular, it makes their size independent of the original right-hand-side. Again, for a full proof, we refer to LABEL:sect:omittedproofs.\nSee 1.5\nNote how this result also yields an algorithm for P||{Cmax,Cmin,Cenvy}fragmentsP||{C,C,Cenvy}{P||\\{C_{\\max},C_{\\min},C_{\\textup{envy}}\\}} with running time (log(pmax))2O(d)⟨I⟩O(1)fragments((p))fragments2fragmentsO(d)⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)(\\log(p_{\\max}))^{2^{O(d)}}\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)}, but with worse constants.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Hence, y∈int.cone(P∩ℤN)∩Qfragmentsyint.cone(PZ𝑁)Qy\\in\\text{int.cone}(P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N})\\cap Q.
