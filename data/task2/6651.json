      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Directly-Trained Spiking Neural Networks for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe training strategies for deep SNNs are mainly divided into ANN-SNN conversion and directly training SNNs. The essence of ANN-SNN conversion is to approximate the average firing rate of SNNs to the continuous activation value of ANNs that use ReLU as the nonlinearity [ref]5 [ref]11. The performance of the converted SNN relies on the original ANN, and it is tough to get high-performance SNNs with low time delay and suffers performance losses during conversion. Moreover, the converted SNNs cannot work well on the sparse event data which can be effectively combined with neuromorphic hardware. Inspired from the explosive development of ANNs, the researchers use the surrogate gradient to achieve directly training of SNNs. The mature back-propagation mechanism and diverse coding schemes   have enabled directly-trained SNNs to work well on short time steps while requiring low power consumption. Zheng et al. [ref]48 proposed the threshold-dependent batch normalization (TDBN) technique which could extend SNNs from a shallow structure (<10 layers) to a deeper structure (50 layers) based on the framework of STBP . Hu et al.  and Fang et al.  advanced the achievement of high performance on classification tasks. Currently, there is some work that uses deep directly training SNN for regression tasks like object tracking  , image reconstruction , while the object detection task has not yet been explored.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and directly training SNNs. The essence of ANN-SNN conversion is to approximate the average firing rate of SNNs to the continuous activation value of ANNs that use ReLU as the nonlinearity [ref]5 [ref]11. The performance of the converted SNN relies on the original ANN, and it is tough to get high-performance SNNs with low time delay and suffers performance losses during conversion.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
