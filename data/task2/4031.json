      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Improvement Heuristics for Graph Combinatorial Optimization Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCombinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) are present in a broad range of real-world applications, such as logistics, manufacturing or biology  . Due to the NP-hard nature of most COPs, finding the optimal solution applying exact methods becomes intractable as the size of the problem grows . As a result, in the last few decades, heuristic and meta-heuristic methods have arisen as an alternative to approximate hard COPs in a reasonable amount of time. Initial works in the field proposed constructive heuristic methods that iteratively build a candidate solution. In general, constructive methods are developed ad-hoc for the problem at hand, based on criteria and rules provided by expert knowledge. Later on, the constructive proposals were outperformed by meta-heuristic algorithms that introduced general purpose and easy-to-apply optimization paradigms. Although meta-heuristics have become the main tool to adopt, contrary to constructive heuristics, they are evaluation-intensive algorithms, i.e., they need to exhaustively evaluate thousands or even millions of candidate solutions before arriving at a decision, making them impractical for scenarios with limited budget or online-streaming optimization . Algorithms based on Neural Networks (NN) play a crucial role in this regard. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks, drawing the attention of researchers from diverse domains, including optimization. As outlined in different reviews [ref]5  [ref]7, DL-based approaches have been proposed as standalone solvers, parameter and/or operation selection methods, or as a component of more powerful hybrid algorithms.\nOur focus in this work is on standalone (end-to-end) models, highlighting their capabilities and the avenues for further research aimed at enhancing their performance. Once trained, these models can rapidly make decisions, such as determining the next change required.\nThe first works in the topic proposed models, known as constructive methods, which generate a unique solution incrementally by iteratively adding an item to a partial solution until it is completed  [ref]9 0. Conversely, later papers have introduced improvement methods that take a candidate solution and suggest a modification to improve it 1 2 3. In fact, this improvement process can be repeated iteratively, using the modified solution as the new input of the model. The reported results, although less competitive than state-of-the-art meta-heuristics for the most trending problems 4 5, have captured the attention of the optimization research community as they were unimaginable some years ago. In fact, many of these proposals have outperformed the classical constructive heuristics. However, looking at the progress of the research, we realize that the majority of the works have mainly illustrated their contributions on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) 8 and other similar routing problems. Particularly, most models work on the idea that, when considering the graph representation of the COPs, the information is embedded node-wise [ref]9 0. However, there are problems such as Preference Ranking Problem (PRP)  6 or Graph Partitioning Problem (GPP)  7, where the relevant information of the problem is edge-wise or even both node- and edge-wise. In these scenarios, node-wise proposals do not use all the available (and meaningful) information. In line with the idea that future generation algorithms will come from the combination of meta-heuristic algorithms alongside machine learning models [ref]7, we propose a new optimization framework which can replace and improve the traditional local-search-based methods by incorporating neural improvement models. Specifically, our contribution is twofold: (1) we present a neural improvement model to solve problems where the information is stored either in the nodes, in the edges, or in both of them, and (2) we show that the model can be used alone, or can be incorporated as a building block, for example for hill-climbing-based algorithms, to efficiently guide the selection of neighborhood operations. In order to demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of the proposed framework, we conducted experiments across various optimization problems, including PRP, TSP, and GPP. The NI model, trained on node- and edge-features, demonstrated outstanding performance across all three problems, with exceptional results for PRP. It consistently recommended the best or near-best neighbors for each problem, and outperformed traditional methods in all cases. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the most prominent works tackling the development of NN models for CO, both in a constructive and improvement manner. With illustrative purposes, we present the PRP in Section III, and propose a NI model in Section IV. A set of experiments is carried out in Section V and the generalization of the model to other problems is discussed in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: have exhibited remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks, drawing the attention of researchers from diverse domains, including optimization.
