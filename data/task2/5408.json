      "content": "Paper Title: Risk-Averse Model Uncertainty for Distributionally Robust Safe Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many real-world decision making applications, it is important to satisfy safety requirements while achieving a desired goal. In addition, real-world environments often involve uncertain or changing conditions. Therefore, in order to reliably deploy data-driven decision making methods such as deep reinforcement learning (RL) in these settings, they must deliver robust performance and safety even in the presence of uncertainty. Recently, techniques have been developed to handle safety constraints within the deep RL framework   [ref]47  [ref]44 5 , but these safe RL algorithms only focus on performance and safety in the training environment. They do not consider uncertainty about the true environment at deployment time due to unknown disturbances or irreducible modeling errors, which we refer to as model uncertainty. In this work, we introduce a framework that incorporates model uncertainty into safe RL. In order for our framework to be useful, we emphasize the importance of (i) an efficient deep RL implementation during training and (ii) robustness guarantees on performance and safety upon deployment. Existing robust RL methods address the issue of model uncertainty, but they can be difficult to implement and are not always suitable in real-world decision making settings. Robust RL focuses on worst-case environments in an uncertainty set, which requires solving complex minimax optimization problems throughout training. This is typically approximated in a deep RL setting through direct interventions with a learned adversary 8  , or through the use of parametric uncertainty with multiple simulated training environments 9 1 2. However, we do not always have access to fast, high-fidelity simulators for training  3 . In these cases, we must be able to incorporate robustness to model uncertainty without relying on multiple training environments or potentially dangerous adversarial interventions, as real-world data collection may be necessary. A more informative way to represent model uncertainty is to instead consider a distribution over potential environments. Domain randomization 7 collects training data from a range of environments by randomizing across parameter values in a simulator, and optimizes for average performance. This approach to model uncertainty avoids minimax formulations and works well in practice , but lacks robustness guarantees. In addition, domain randomization focuses on parametric uncertainty, which still requires detailed simulator access and domain knowledge to define the training distribution. In this work, we introduce a general approach to safe RL in the presence of model uncertainty that addresses the main shortcomings of existing methods. In particular, we consider a distribution over potential environments, and apply a risk-averse perspective towards model uncertainty. Through the use of coherent distortion risk measures, this leads to a safe RL framework with robustness guarantees that does not involve difficult minimax formulations. Using this framework, we show how we can learn safe policies that are robust to model uncertainty, without the need for detailed simulator access or adversarial interventions during training. Our main contributions are as follows: We reformulate the safe RL problem to incorporate a risk-averse perspective towards model uncertainty through the use of coherent distortion risk measures, and we introduce the corresponding Bellman operators. From a theoretical standpoint, we provide robustness guarantees for our framework by showing it is equivalent to a specific class of distributionally robust safe RL problems. We propose an efficient deep RL implementation that avoids the difficult minimax formulation present in robust RL and only uses data collected from a single training environment. We demonstrate the robust performance and safety of our framework through experiments on continuous control tasks with safety constraints in the Real-World RL Suite  .\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: settings, they must deliver robust performance and safety even in the presence of uncertainty.
