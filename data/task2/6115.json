      "content": "Paper Title: Rotation Synchronization via Deep Matrix Factorization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRotations have a rich structure that inspired a lot of research in synchronization methods over the years.\nEarly attempts include methods based on linear least squares, where rotations are represented either as unit quaternions  or rotations matrices [ref]28.\nThis approach was revisited in  [ref]1 by proposing a compact way to store all rotations simultaneously, and solving the resulting problem via eigendecomposition or semidefinite programming. A semidefinite formulation is also adopted in [ref]16   with a focus on global optimality.\nThe authors of  address rotation synchronization in an iterative fashion, where each absolute rotation is iteratively updated with the L1 average of its neighbors, computed with the Weiszfeld algorithm.\nAnother popular approach is Lie-group optimization , where the Lie-group structure of rotations is exploited and the problem is iteratively solved in the tangent space.\nOther methods include the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm , low-rank and sparse decomposition , Riemannian optimization , message passing  and maximum likelihood estimation .\nTheoretical aspects are also investigated in   2 0.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: of research in synchronization methods over the years.\nEarly attempts include methods based on linear least squares, where rotations are represented either as unit quaternions  or rotations matrices [ref]28.\nThis approach was revisited in  [ref]1 by proposing a compact way to store all rotations simultaneously, and solving the resulting problem via eigendecomposition or semidefinite programming.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
