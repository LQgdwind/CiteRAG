      "content": "Paper Title: LTC-SUM: Lightweight Client-driven Personalized Video Summarization Framework Using 2D CNN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection, the baseline approaches are described for comparison with the proposed thumbnail-based method. As explained in Section 2.1, well-known video summarization approaches process every frame of the corresponding video to generate a summary. Thus, some of the prominent SoA techniques were adopted as the baseline approaches in this study. To generate the summary using baseline methods, all videos in Table III were stored locally. However, the proposed LTC-SUM approach does not require the videos to be stored locally which brings an additional gain in storage efficiency. The baseline approaches were as follows: HECATE  [ref]7. It analyzes the aesthetic features from all temporarily extracted frames of the corresponding video. This method only supports fixed summary lengths, and a five-minute subset is generated for each video. DR-DSN  . It is trained based on the SumMe dataset   using the default parameters. Initially, this method extracts frames from the corresponding video and then analyzes the extracted frames to generate a video summary. Using DR-DSN with default parameters, the summarization duration generated for all corresponding videos was 22 seconds. VASNet  . Similar to DR-DSN  , it is trained based on the SumMe dataset   using default parameters. First, it extracts frames from the corresponding video and then analyzes extracted frames to generate a subset. For every corresponding video, a 24-second subset is generated using the default parameters of VASNet. AC-SUM-GAN  . Similar to the aforementioned baseline methods   , it first extracts frames from the corresponding video and then analyzes the extracted frames to generate a subset. It is trained based on the SumMe dataset  , and it generates at 19-second summary for every corresponding video with the default configuration. FB-SUM. This is the frame-based summarization (FB-SUM) baseline method that analyzes every frame of the corresponding video during the process. Initially, the video frames were extracted using FFmpeg   for each video. The rest of the summation process followed the same steps as the proposed LTC-SUM method. As highlighted before, there is a redundancy in frames while processing the entire video; thus, processing all frames of a video is not computationally efficient as it increases the processing time and wastes a significant portion of the limited computational resources. To validate the effectiveness, the computation time of the baseline approaches were compared with the proposed LTC-SUM approach in the following experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: However, the proposed LTC-SUM approach does not require the videos to be stored locally which brings an additional gain in storage efficiency.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
