      "content": "Paper Title: Distill Gold from Massive Ores: Efficient Dataset Distillation via Critical Samples Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Sec.¬†3.1 and Sec.¬†4.3 in the main paper, we extensively study the critical sample ratio by random or loss value.\nWe mainly follow the default experiment settings given by each algorithm.\nThe experiments are conducted on less than 4 TITAN Xp depending on the data size and IPC.\nWe list the experiment details involving Tab.¬†1-8 in the paper: For DC¬†[ref]40 and DSA¬†8, on all datasets, we run the distillation for 1000 iterations with SGD optimizer and momentum 0.5. The number of inner loop and outer loop are (1, 1) for IPC=1, (10, 50) for IPC=10, (50, 10) for IPC=50. The learning rate of synthetic image and network are 0.1 and 0.01. The batch size for each class is 256 and when the sample ratio is low, we half the batch size until it is less than twice the largest class size. We use color, crop, cutout, scale, rotate DSA augmentation on all datasets and additional flip on the non-digit datasets. By default, noise initialization is used. For DM¬†9, we run the distillation for 10000 iterations on TinyImageNet and 20000 iterations for the others with SGD optimizer and momentum 0.5. The learning rate of synthetic image and network are 1.0 and 0.01. The batch size for each class is 256 and when the sample ratio is low, we half the batch size until it is less than twice the largest class size. The same Siamese augmentation strategy is used as in the DSA experiments. By default, real initialization is used (the initial images are drawn after dropping). For MTT¬†, we drop the same data samples for buffering and distillation. The expert trajectories are trained for 50 epochs for 100 repeats and we run the distillation for 10000 iterations. We appreciate and follow the detailed hyper-parameters provided by the authors. For CAFE¬†5, as default, we run the distillation for 2000 iterations. The initial learning rate is 0.1 and decays by 0.5 at 1,200, 1,600, and 1,800 iterations. The weight of the inner layer matching loss is 0.01 and an additional loss weight of 0.1 is put on the matching loss of the third and fourth layers. Noise initialization is used. For LinBa¬†, we run distillation for 5000 iterations with SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9. The inner steps of BPTT are 150 and the number of bases is 16. The learning rate of synthetic image and network is 0.1 and 0.01. For IDC¬†, we use the ‚Äúreproduce‚Äù setting of the opened source code, which automatically sets up the tuned hyper-parameters. We use multi-formation factor 2. For KIP¬†, we test on the finite-width model (KIP-NN) and use label learning. We use longer training steps for converged results. For FRePo¬†, we use the official PyTorch implementation and the default parameters, except the learning rate of 0.001 and we run the distillation for 500,000 steps. For HaBa¬†, we follow the official instructions and adopt the parameters from MTT. And for the exclusive parameters for HaBa, we use the values given in the code. For RFAD¬†, we test on the finite-width model (ConvNet) and load the training hyperparameters for finite training results in the paper. The choice of label learning follows the remarks in the paper. For IDM¬†, we thank the authors and we directly adopt the official running commands. We try sample ratio of 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 8%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% to find the critical sample ratio. The removal of data samples is class-wise. Each experiment is repeated 5 times for mean Œºùúá\\mu and standard deviation œÉùúé\\sigma and we regard the experiment performance as comparable to the experiment on full data if its mean accuracy is within the [Œº‚àíœÉ,Œº+œÉ]ùúáùúéùúáùúé[\\mu-\\sigma,\\mu+\\sigma] of full data performance. Note that we do not present a finer-grained critical sample ratio since it requires too many computation resources (the bisection method is not applicable here) and our granularity is enough to demonstrate the data redundancy.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: settings given by each algorithm.\nThe experiments are conducted on less than 4 TITAN Xp depending on the data size and IPC.\nWe list the experiment details involving Tab.¬†1-8 in the paper: For DC¬†[ref]40 and DSA¬†8, on all datasets, we run the distillation for 1000 iterations with SGD optimizer and momentum 0.5.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.

Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
