      "content": "Paper Title: AgileWatts: An Energy-Efficient CPU Core Idle-State Architecture for Latency-Sensitive Server Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs discussed in Sec. 4.1, AW’s UFPG places the majority of the core units\nbehind power-gates that are similar to the ones used for the AVX units in recent Intel cores.\nAW uses power-gates for ∼70%similar-toabsentpercent70{\\sim}70\\% of the core area (measured on the die photo in Fig. 4). Power overhead.\nThe AVX power-gates and the new UFPG, shut-off all the units in the core front-end and execution domains; however,\npower-gates only eliminate 959595 – 97%percent9797\\% of the leakage power   , thus the UFPG domain has residual idle power while in C6A.\nUsing the Intel core-power-breakdown tool ,\nwe derive the leakage power contribution of the power-gated units starting from the leakage power of the entire core.444The leakage of the entire core is approximately equal to the C​1𝐶1C1 power (Table 1), which removes only dynamic power by applying clock-gating.\nOur estimation shows that the new power-gated units contribute to approximately 70%percent7070\\% of the core leakage (i.e., ∼70%similar-toabsentpercent70{\\sim}70\\% of C​1𝐶1C1 power).\nHence, the\npower overhead of UFPG (i.e., 333–5%percent55\\% of the gated leakage power) is ∼30similar-toabsent30{\\sim}30–50​m​W50𝑚𝑊50mW at base frequency (P1), or ∼18similar-toabsent18{\\sim}18–30​m​W30𝑚𝑊30mW at minimum frequency (Pn). The three UFPG techniques combined retain ∼8​K​Bsimilar-toabsent8𝐾𝐵{\\sim}8KB context  , which consume 0.2​m​W0.2𝑚𝑊0.2mW at retention voltage [ref]24.\nTo estimate the retention power at base (P1) and minimum (Pn) frequencies, we conservatively multiply the retention-level power by 10×10\\times and 5×5\\times, respectively.\nTherefore, our estimate for context retention power is ∼2similar-toabsent2{\\sim}2mW (P1) to ∼1similar-toabsent1{\\sim}1mW (Pn). Performance overhead.\nIn an active CPU core, simultaneous operations in memory or/and logic circuits demand high current flow, which creates fast transient voltage droops          .\nOne power-gating design challenge is the resistive voltage (IR) drop across a power gate, which exacerbates voltage droops      .\nThe worst-case voltage droop can limit the maximum attainable frequency at a given voltage since it requires additional voltage (droop) margin above the nominal voltage to enable the CPU core to run at the target frequency   . An x86 implementation of CPU core power-gate leads to <1%absentpercent1{<}1\\% frequency loss . Our AW analytical model (Sec. 6.2) assumes 1%percent11\\% frequency degradation due to the additional CPU core power-gates (i.e., due to UFPG). Area overhead.\nA power gate adds 222 – 6%percent66\\% extra area to the gated logic (i.e., UFPG, covering ∼70%similar-toabsentpercent70{\\sim}70\\% of core area). We conservatively use the wide overhead range (i.e., 222 – 6%percent66\\%) since\nthe exact overhead depends on the specific implementation, the exact size of the gated area, the number of required isolation-cells,555Isolation-cells isolate the always-on units from the floating values of the power-gated units. They are typically placed on the outputs of the power-gated domains during the physical placement stage . and technology    .\nThe area overhead for the in-place context retention techniques of the ∼8similar-toabsent8{\\sim}8kB core context   is as follows:\nFirst, moving the context of a unit to ungated-power typically requires <1%absentpercent1{<}1\\% of the context area, mainly due to the isolation cells .\nSecond, the use of SRPGs for components with too large or distributed context\nis a mature technique already used in products, e.g., the Intel Skylake .\nEfficient SRPG designs, which use selective context retention, require less than 1%percent11\\% additional area relative to the power-gated area they control   .\nFinally,\nincluding an SRAM into the ungated domain requires isolation cells that add overhead <1%absentpercent1{<}1\\% of the SRAM area .\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: at minimum frequency (Pn). The three UFPG techniques combined retain ∼8​K​Bsimilar-toabsent8𝐾𝐵{\\sim}8KB context  , which consume 0.2​m​W0.2𝑚𝑊0.2mW at retention voltage [ref]24.\nTo estimate the retention power at base (P1) and minimum (Pn) frequencies, we conservatively multiply the retention-level power by 10×10\\times and 5×5\\times, respectively.\nTherefore, our\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
