Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlgorithm 2 reflects the pseudo-code of the proposed partitioning strategy to check the satisfaction of a RA problem over a time horizon N𝑁N. Algorithm 2 uses square brackets to label the different s-zonotopes that arise after splitting. As an example, 𝒳|s​\\mathcal{X}_{|s} reads as the initial s-zonotope (i.e. 𝒳|s​=𝒳|s0\\mathcal{X}_{|s}=\\mathcal{X}_{|s}^{0}), which is split onto a second 𝒳|s​[ref]1\\mathcal{X}_{|s}[ref]1 and a third 𝒳|s​\\mathcal{X}_{|s} s-zonotopes (with 𝒳|ι​[ref]1∪𝒳|ι​=𝒳|ι​\\mathcal{X}_{|\\iota}[ref]1\\cup\\mathcal{X}_{|\\iota}=\\mathcal{X}_{|\\iota}). Besides, L𝐿L denotes a set of integer labels/indices (for the above example L={0,1,2}𝐿012L=\\{0,1,2\\}), and 𝒳|ι​[L]\\mathcal{X}_{|\\iota}[L] is a shorthand for the set of s-zonotopes {𝒳|s​[l]|l∈L}\\{\\mathcal{X}_{|s}[l]\\,|\\,l\\in L\\}. At each iteration, the routine reach runs a slightly modified version of Algorithm 1, that, in this case, returns the last time instant (and the corresponding s-zonotope) for which the RA problem is not satisfied. These times-to-last-error are managed by vector T𝑇T. The algorithm iteratively selects the label of the initial s-zonotope that yields the largest time-to-last-error (Step 14). The use of this backward management of the information that prioritizes to split\nuntil the RA constraints are satisfied at time t𝑡t, then at time t−1𝑡1t-1, etc., will be further discussed in the next paragraph. Once the l𝑙l-th (with l∈L𝑙𝐿l\\in L) s-zonotope has been selected, sym-select returns the initial symbol identifier i∈I𝑖𝐼i\\in I that has greater relative influence over the violated property. The symbol sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} of the l𝑙l-th set is split by the routine sym-split that returns two new initial subsets (Step 6). The times-to-last-error for the new s-zonotopes are computed and the set L𝐿L and vector T𝑇T updated (Steps 7-11). In particular, Algorithm 2 runs either until the RA problem is satisfied for the whole set L𝐿L, or until a maximum number nm​a​xsubscript𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥n_{max} of splits is reached. Input: same as Algorithm 1, nm​a​xsubscript𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥n_{max}\n Output: isRAok, set of s-zonotopes 𝒳|s​[L]\\mathcal{X}_{|s}[L] Algorithm 2 manages the information in a backward fashion, that is, it selects a s-zonotope with the higher time-to-last-error. This usually gives better results than working in a forward fashion (that is, selecting the s-zonotope with lower time-to-first-error) since it avoids to get stuck by exhaustively splitting up to the satisfaction of a constraint at time t𝑡t, which, then, may have a small impact on the constraint satisfaction at t+1𝑡1t+1. On this subject, the algorithm can be straightforwardly adapted to handle the forward case by directly using Algorithm 1 (instead of reach), using T​(l)←N+1←𝑇𝑙𝑁1T(l)\\leftarrow N+1 (instead of T​(l)←0←𝑇𝑙0T(l)\\leftarrow 0) in Step 13 and selecting the minimum (instead of the maximum) of vector T𝑇T.\nBesides, the reduction operation used in Algorithm 1 must not truncate the initial symbols even if their relevance decreases with time, so that the input-output mapping of the symbols identified by I𝐼I is preserved.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: s-zonotopes that arise after splitting.
