      "content": "Paper Title: MulBot: Unsupervised Bot Detection Based on Multivariate Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOnline Social Networks (OSN) have become pervasive in our society and an ever greater source of information for many people.\nDue to their strong impact, it is paramount to address crucial issues such as disinformation, polarization and hate speech. These concerns, also considered by the European Union111https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/online-disinformation, have a wide range of consequences, such as threatening our democracies, polarising debates, and putting the health, security, and environment of all the citizens at risk. In this scenario, social bots play an important role, especially in spreading misinformation [ref]1 . It was estimated that between 9% and 17% of Twitter accounts are bots who contribute on average between 16% and 56% of tweets  . On Facebook, bots were estimated to correspond to 11% of all accounts .\nTo make matters worse, many different types of bots exist with different characteristics, behaviors, and aims. For example, fake followers are the simplest kind of bots, exploited to increase the number of followers of a target account, make an account more trustworthy and influential, attracting genuine followers . We can find more complex behaviors in spambots, whose purpose is spreading (malicious) content, increasing the visibility of some public characters, and promoting a certain company’s product [ref]7. The wide presence of bots in OSNs brought to the application of many machine learning models, mainly based on supervised approaches. The most widely used supervised bot detector is Botometer222https://botometer.osome.iu.edu , which is also extensively used to label ground-truth datasets used to train other bot detectors .\nHowever, the dependency of other detectors on Botometer, which has been criticized as inaccurate , might propagate existing flaws, instead of fixing them. On the other hand, hand-labeling bot datasets does not appear to be a satisfactory solution either, given the existing biases in human labeling and the results showing that even the most experienced OSN users struggle to spot the latest generation of bots [ref]7. Moreover, one of the main characteristics of bots is that they evolve over time, changing their behavior to evade detection [ref]7. This is the reason why traditional detection methods based on profile features  , text content   , social relationships or interaction graphs    and posting patterns  become soon obsolete and new techniques must be developed. There is a struggle between developers of algorithms for bot detection and increasingly sophisticated bots. The demonstration is that from 2017 onwards, there has been an increase in bot detectors based on adversarial approaches  as they are suitable for managing this type of task. Novel and more sophisticated bots do not act anymore individually, but as coordinated groups , forming botnets to increase their impact 0, such as the Star Wars botnet 1 or the Bursty botnet 2. Supervised approaches classify individual users, thus failing to recognize coordinated bots. So, developers of bot detectors moved from supervised learning towards unsupervised models that analyze groups of accounts as a whole, rather than individual accounts, also solving the labeling issue . In this evolving scenario, tabular features extracted from the user profile proved insufficient to identify the new bots . Indeed, considering the whole timeline of posts of the users and the synchronicity between coordinated users was shown to bring a deeper knowledge of the users’ past behavior  3 4. Finally, different types of bots (e.g., spammers, fake followers) have different behavioral characteristics. Therefore supervised learning techniques suffer a decrease in performance when trying to detect previously unseen behaviors (i.e., they do not generalize well), as also demonstrated in 5. The Leave One Botnet Out (LOBO) test was recently proposed to assess the generalization capabilities of bot detectors 6. The test involves iteratively re-training bot detectors by excluding a specific botnet at each iteration and by evaluating the effectiveness at detecting bots of the excluded botnet. On the other hand, most unsupervised approaches rely on textual content analysis, which is now unreliable due to recent improvements in natural language generation 7 8. Moreover, the few models based on temporal features, which allow tracking the whole timeline of the users, typically exploit just one dimension at a time 4, discarding relevant information and overlooking much of the bots’ behavior.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: polarising debates, and putting the health, security, and environment of all the citizens at risk.
