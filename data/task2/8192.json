      "content": "Paper Title: Biases in gendered citation practices: an exploratory study and some reflections on the Matthew and Matilda effects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAcademic organizations usually assess each researcher based on the number of citations that the publications of that researcher yield . Hence, the number of citations allows estimating the impact that a given researcher has on a field . Thus, in many fields, the higher the number of citations, the higher the likelihood of securing a job or a promotion in an academic organization, or obtaining grant funding as well as prestigious awards  . In this regard, the reference lists of the papers we publish are powerful instruments since they have a major impact when it comes to determining who gets hired/promoted by an academic organization, who receives awards, who becomes famous in a field, etc. A citation bias occurs when the authors of a given paper decide to include or not to include in their reference list a given reference based on considerations that are not related to the reference relevance and its quality . Citation biases are detrimental to various socio-cultural groups, especially women and racialized researchers since their papers are usually under-cited  . For instance, in the most prolific countries, the papers in which women are the lead authors are usually less cited than the ones that have men as lead authors [ref]1. Thus, citation biases may aggravate gender disparities especially since citations are key in the assessment of researchers [ref]1. That gender disparity is very pervasive and translates in academia in terms of research performance, the recruitment of faculty members, the number of citations researchers receive, grant applications, determination of the positions of authors in a paper, and the choice of academic awardees, just to name a few . Besides, male researchers are more advantaged than female researchers when it comes to recruitment and promotion . Furthermore, male researchers are usually more credited than female researchers when it comes to the contributions they make to research  . This may give the false impression that female researchers are less capable than male researchers. This could notably be detrimental to the academic career of women  and to innovation, creativity, performance, and productivity in various scientific and/or technological projects  9 0 6 9 . That innovation is particularly key in the software engineering (SE) field since it drives technological advances, which influences various aspects of the society as a whole. Such aspects include the economy, the environment, as well as politics, just to name a few. The disparity of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines is well-established [ref]1  0 1 5 6 8   . That disparity is well-pronounced in the software industry and has been increasingly explored (e.g., 5 8      ). Still, when it comes to research in particular, the gap in citations that researchers belonging to some socio-cultural groups may experience and that may stem from citation biases remains understudied . Furthermore, the awareness about that topic remains low . This makes it difficult to devise novel solutions to mitigate citation biases and make sure the scientific papers we publish sufficiently reflect the intellectual diversity of the existing scientific contributions. Several bibliometric studies have analyzed biases in citation practices      3 [ref]1   9. These studies usually focus on STEM disciplines such as neuroscience, physics, economics, cognitive science, computer science, and biomedical sciences. Such studies mostly focus on the analysis of citation biases toward women and to some extend towards racialized researchers. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work specifically applies to the SE field. This makes it challenging to assess the fairness of the citation practices adopted in that field. This also hampers the assessment of the impact that such citation practices may have on the recruitment, career, persistence, and prestige of researchers specialized in computing fields such as SE. To tackle that issue, we carry out a study that relies on existing methods used in other disciplines (e.g., neuroscience, physics) to explore the fairness of gendered citation practices in the SE field.\nThe contributions of our paper are three-fold: Contribution 1: we create a large dataset consisting of SE journals references and use it to analyze the fairness of gendered citation practices in the SE field. Contribution 2: we report our experience in using a set of statistical methods together with a set of APIs to support that citation analysis Contribution 3: we provide key insights on the fairness of citation practices in the SE field. We further describe our work in the remainder of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: papers are usually under-cited  . For instance, in the most prolific countries, the papers in which women are the lead authors are usually less cited than the ones that have men as lead authors [ref]1. Thus, citation biases may aggravate gender disparities especially since citations are key in the assessment of researchers [ref]1. That gender disparity is very pervasive and translates in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
