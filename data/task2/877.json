Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many works in the literature that also approximate the transition function of environments, for instance by performing explicit latent-space planning computations [ref]7\n[ref]8 [ref]9    as part of learning and executing policies. Gelada et al.  train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to simultaneously predict rewards as well as future latent states. Our work is distinct from these as we are not assuming a reward signal  during training. Vision, memory, and controller modules are combined for learning a model of the world before learning a decision model in Ha and Schmidhuber’s World Models . A predictive model is trained in an unsupervised manner, permitting the agent to learn policies completely within its learned latent space representation of the environment. The main difference is that they first approximate the state distribution using a variational autoencoder, producing the encoded latent space. In contrast, our representation is learned such that it is maximally predictable for the predictor network. Similar to our training setup, Oh et al.  predict future frames in ATARI environments conditioned on actions. The predicted frames are used for learning the transition function of the environment, e.g. for improving exploration by informing agents of which actions are more likely to result in unseen states. Our work differs as we are acting within a learned latent space and not the full input space and our representations are used in a classical planning paradigm with start and goal states instead of a reinforcement learning one.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: There are many works in the literature that also approximate the transition function of environments, for instance by performing explicit latent-space planning computations [ref]7\n[ref]8 [ref]9    as part of learning and executing policies.
