Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Person Perception Biases Exposed: Revisiting the First Impressions Dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPersonality perception and its applications. People spontaneously build first impressions of unacquainted individuals in milliseconds, even from a still photograph, quite consistently . However, such snap judgements, which are built and used to interact with others, are often stereotyped [ref]30. Therefore, do we want machines to do the same? Having machines that form first impressions of others has risks. Such systems are trained from human annotations and inherit human perception bias along with other biases created by culture, beliefs or previous experiences. Since it is highly likely that automatic personality perception is not accurate, these technologies are not ready to be used for legal applications or for anything that determines opportunities for people, such as job interviews. Furthermore, having access to people’s personality (either if real or apparent) just by extracting and analysing data from any kind of input could represent a major threat to their privacy. Not only in terms of rights, but also because it could pave the way for effective mass manipulation and psychological persuasion . On the other side, automatic personality perception can be very useful in social robotics , to design machines that can approach people in a natural way, creating more comfortable experiences and building trust [ref]21. In particular, applications related to health care, education or human assistance can benefit from using automatic impression formation. Bias in face attributes recognition.\nOur work partially relies on automatic face classification methods to extract an attractiveness score and to estimate apparent age. Both methods suffer from the same type of perception bias previously described. According to , facial cues often guide first impressions and these first impressions guide our decisions. Face attractiveness, however, is very subjective and may be subject to critics when applied to social computing. Nevertheless, the topic has been widely studied in psychology/sociology   3  . These attributes have been selected to give visibility to the existing biases, especially because the well known “attractiveness halo effect” (i.e., more positive impressions are given to more attractive people) has its particular influence on data labelling.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: of unacquainted individuals in milliseconds, even from a still photograph, quite consistently . However, such snap judgements, which are built and used to interact with others, are often stereotyped [ref]30. Therefore, do we want machines to do the same? Having machines that form first impressions of others has risks. Such systems are trained from human annotations and inherit human perception\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
