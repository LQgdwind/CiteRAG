      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Relationship Detection with Visual-Linguistic Knowledge from Multimodal Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVISUAL relationship detection (VRD) aims to detect objects and classify triplets of subject-predicate-object in a query image.\nIt is a very crucial task for enabling an intelligent system to understand the content of images, and has received much attention over the past few years  [ref]2       [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.\nBased on VRD, Xu et al. 9 proposed scene graph generation (SGG)          , which targets at extracting a comprehensive and symbolic graph representation in an image, with vertices and edges denoting instances and for visual relationships respectively.\nWe focus on and use the term VRD throughout this paper for consistency.\nVRD is beneficial to various downstream tasks including but not limited to\nimage captioning 0 1,\nvisual question answering 2 3, etc. To enhance the performance of VRD systems, some recent works incorporate the external linguistic commonsense knowledge from pre-trained word vectors , structured knowledge bases 5, raw language corpora [ref]9, etc.,\nas priors,\nwhich has taken inspiration from human reasoning mechanism.\nFor instance, for a relationship triplet case person-ride-bike as shown in Figure 1, with linguistic commonsense, the predicate ride is more accurate for describing the relationship of person and bike\ncompared with other relational descriptions like on or above, which are rather abstract.\nIn addition, we argue that the external visual commonsense knowledge is also beneficial to lifting detection performance of the VRD models, which is however rarely considered previously.\nTake the same person-ride-bike in Figure 1 as an example.\nIf the pixels inside the bounding box of person are masked (zeroed) out, humans can still predict them as a person since we have seen many examples and have plenty of visual commonsense regarding such cases.\nThis reasoning process would be helpful for VRD systems since it incorporates relationships of the basic visual elements; however, most previous approaches learn visual knowledge only from target datasets and neglect external visual commonsense knowledge in abundant unlabeled data.\nInspired by the recent successful visual-linguistic pre-training methods (BERT-like models) 4 5,\nwe propose to exploit both linguistic and visual commonsense knowledge from Conceptual Captions 6 — a large-scale dataset containing 3.3M images with coarsely-annotated descriptions (alt-text) that were crawled from the web, to achieve boosted VRD performance.\nWe first pre-train our backbone model (multimodal BERT) on Conceptual Captions with different pretext tasks to learn the visual and linguistic commonsense knowledge.\nSpecifically, our model mines visual prior information via learning to predict labels for an image’s subregions that are randomly masked out.\nThe model also considers linguistic commonsense knowledge through learning to predict randomly masked out words of sentences in image captions.\nThe pre-trained weights are then used to initialize the backbone model and trained together with other additional modules (detailed at below) on visual relationship datasets. Besides visual and linguistic knowledge, spatial features are also important cues for reasoning over object relationships in images.\nFor instance, for A-on-B, the bounding box (or it’s center point) of A is often above that of B.\nHowever, such spatial information is not explicitly considered in BERT-like visual-linguistic models 7 5 4.\nWe thus design two additional modules to help our model better utilize such information: a mask attention module and a spatial Module.\nThe former predicts soft attention maps of target objects, which are then used to enhance visual features by focusing on target regions while suppressing unrelated areas;\nthe latter augments the final features with bounding boxes coordinates to explicitly take spatial information into account. We integrate the aforementioned designs into a novel VRD model,\nnamed Relational Visual-Linguistic Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RVL-BERT).\nRVL-BERT makes use of the pre-trained visual-linguistic representations as the source of visual and language knowledge to facilitate the learning and reasoning process on the downstream VRD task.\nIt also incorporates a novel mask attention module to actively focus on the object locations in the input images and a spatial module to capture spatial relationships more accurately.\nMoreover, RVL-BERT is flexibxle in that it can be placed on top of any object detection model. Our contribution in this paper is three-fold.\nFirstly, we are among the first to identify the benefit of visual-linguistic commonsense knowledge to visual relationship detection, especially when objects are occluded.\nSecondly, we propose RVL-BERT – a multimodal VRD model pre-trained on visaul-linguistic commonsense knowledge bases learns to predict visual relationships with the attentions among visual and linguistic elements, with the aid of the spatial and mask attention module.\nFinally, we show through extensive experiments that the commonsense knowledge and the proposed modules effectively improve the model performance, and our RVL-BERT achieves competitive results on two VRD datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: subject-predicate-object in a query image.\nIt is a very crucial task for enabling an intelligent system to understand the content of images, and has received much attention over the past few years  [ref]2       [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.\nBased on VRD, Xu et al. 9 proposed scene graph generation (SGG)          , which targets at extracting a comprehensive and symbolic graph representation in an\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
