Incidentally, recent RL algorithms for robust and efficient performance use multiple types of value functions [ref]62 , possibly hinting at the need for multiple pathways in the basal ganglia. In addition, effective RL critically depends on the representation of states and actions.\nThe cerebral cortex provides multimodal, hierarchical representations of states and actions through unsupervised representation learning and inference of hidden variables .\nAlthough backpropagation in a deep Q-network solves the problem of value-oriented representation learning, it is known to be highly data-demanding .\nFurthermore, although representation learning in the cortex appears to be unsupervised, experimental observations suggest that learning is modulated by reward or value signals  .\nA recent study that applied variational recurrent neural networks to RL demonstrated that task-critical latent variables can be learned . Moreover, to achieve fast learning and fine control, it is important to select the right level of abstraction.\nThe amygdala and the cortico-basal ganglia circuit appear to form a hierarchical RL system.\nThe evolutionarily old amygdala is crucial for immediate actions for primary reward and punishment. The amygdala is composed of a cortex-like lateral part and a basal ganglia-like central part , which may be seen as a prototype cortico-basal ganglia circuit.\nThe cortico-basal ganglia circuit is composed of multiple parallel loops: the limbic loop through the ventral striatum, the prefrontal loop through the dorsomedial striatum, and the motor loop through the dorsolateral striatum   .\nThese parallel loops appear to form a hierarchical RL system, spanning different levels of abstraction    .\nDetermining the right set of action options and their combinations is an active area of research  0.\n\nReference markers found: [104]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]104: spike output, followed by the dopamine input, that is, the dopamine-dependent plasticity   .\nOwing to these observations, RL models of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit have been proposed  [ref]104 .\nA specific hypothesis, which has been supported by neural recording experiments   0 , is that the neurons in the basal ganglia learn state and action value functions .\nThe circuit of the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
