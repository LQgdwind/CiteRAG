      "content": "Paper Title: Neural-PIM: Efficient Processing-In-Memory with Neural Approximation of Peripherals\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have been powering a broad range of applications¬†    [ref]7, including natural language processing, image classification, and object recognition.\nThe demand to achieve high accuracy for increasingly computational tasks leads to ever-growing model sizes of modern DNNs¬†[ref]8 .\nProcessing such huge DNNs¬†  [ref]7 [ref]8  in systems with conventional Von Neumann architectures¬†   incurs enormous energy consumption and significant execution latency due to the vast data movement between the separate memory and computing elements.\nTo tackle this challenge, processing-in-memory (PIM) is introduced as a promising paradigm by co-locating\ncompute and memory.\nVarious PIM architectures have been proposed to accelerate DNNs¬†    6 7  8 in the past years.\nParticularly, emerging non-volatile memory devices, e.g., resistive random access memory (RRAM) device,\nhave been extensively studied to design PIM accelerators owing to\ntheir inherent advantage in realizing highly efficient in-situ vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) with crossbar arrays. Examples of such accelerators¬† 6 7  8 have demonstrated significant improvements in energy efficiency and throughput on the order of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim1000√ó\\times compared to CPU and GPU platforms.\nDespite of their promise, RRAM-based PIM accelerators are still in the early stage of development with many open challenges.\nOne primary concern is that they rely on costly peripheral circuits, e.g., digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), to bridge analog VMM and digital storage.\nGiven the typical size of a crossbar array ranging from 6‚Äã4√ó6‚Äã4646464\\times 64 to 2‚Äã5‚Äã6√ó2‚Äã5‚Äã6256256256\\times 256 and the precision of a RRAM cell varying from 1-bit to 6-bit¬† 6 7  8 9, analog partial sums on bitlines (BLs) could have extremely fine voltage/current levels.\nSuch partial sums demand high-resolution ADCs for quantization which however dominate the energy consumption and the silicon area of RRAM-based PIM accelerators.\nFor example, 58%percent\\% of system energy is consumed by 8-bit ADCs in ISAAC¬†, and 98%percent\\% of silicon area is occupied by 8-bit ADCs in a scientific computing accelerator¬†9. Prior work has reported a number of various techniques to alleviate the heavy burden of ADCs in RRAM-based PIM accelerators.\nCNNWire¬†0 uses the Winograd algorithm to reduce the number of required analog VMM operations, thereby decreasing the associated energy consumed by analog-to-digital (A/D) conversions.\nYet, without optimizing the peripherals of crossbar arrays holistically, this method still endures huge overheads caused by its peripherals such as ADCs.\nPRIME¬†6 and PipeLayer¬†7 adopt single-bit sense amplifiers and integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to replace traditional high-resolution ADCs.\nHowever, these 1-bit quantizers take up to 2nsuperscript2ùëõ2^{n} clock cycles to produce an nùëõn-bit BL output, leading to significant processing latency.\nCASCADE¬† leverages RRAM buffer arrays to temporally store the analog partial sums and accumulate them before quantization.\nThis method can effectively reduce the required A/D conversions.\nHowever, buffering high-precision (6-bit) analog partial sums into RRAM cells demands non-trivial programming energy and suffers from severe device variations¬†1 2, degenerating the inference accuracy.\nWithout losing accuracy and throughput, further energy and area improvements in peripherals, are of paramount importance in building energy-efficient and high-performance RRAM-based PIM accelerators. In this paper, we aim to fundamentally address the overheads of RRAM-based PIM accelerators caused by the expensive A/D conversions.\nTowards the goal, we develop an analytical framework to characterize different accumulation strategies employed by existing RRAM-based PIM accelerators.\nIn this way, we reveal opportunities to further improve their performance by extending the accumulation into the analog domain to minimize the need for explicit A/D conversions.\nWith this key insight, we propose Neural-PIM‚Äìa novel accelerator architecture with neural approximated peripheral circuits to improve both energy efficiency and throughput for RRAM-based PIM acceleration.\nKey innovations and contributions in the paper are listed below: We classify different accumulation schemes used by RRAM-based PIM accelerators and build a unified analytical framework to compare the performances of associated dataflows.\nThe study shows that our proposed analog dataflow which fully extends the accumulation of partial sums into the analog domain can minimize the required A/D conversions.\n We propose a novel neural approximation method to design peripheral circuits (termed NeuralPeriph), enabling the proposed extended analog dataflow.\nNeuralPeriph circuits are synthesized using RRAM crossbar arrays and CMOS inverters, hence, are both energy- and area-efficient. We build a Neural-PIM accelerator upon the proposed analog dataflow with NeuralPeriph circuits.\nParticularly, we present the detailed system design and thoroughly discuss the inference accuracy of the proposed accelerator. We comprehensively investigate its system-level performance.\nCompared to the state-of-the-art baselines, i.e., ISAAC¬† (CASCADE¬†),\nNeural-PIM shows an average improvement of 5.36√ó5.36\\times (1.73√ó1.73\\times) in energy efficiency, and 3.43√ó3.43\\times (1.59√ó1.59\\times) in throughput across different DNN benchmarks without losing accuracy. The rest of the paper is organized as following:\nSection¬†2 provides the background of the work.\nSection¬†3 introduces the characterization framework.\nNeuralPeriph circuits are presented in Section¬†4.\nNeural-PIM accelerator is elaborated in Section¬†5.\nFinally, we present the simulation methodology in Section¬†6 and demonstrate the evaluation results in Section¬†7 before concluding the paper in Section¬†8.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been powering a broad range of applications¬†    [ref]7, including natural language processing, image classification, and object recognition.\nThe demand to achieve high accuracy for increasingly computational tasks leads to ever-growing model sizes\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
