      "content": "Paper Title: Discrete-Continuous Smoothing and Mapping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral recent works have considered the problem of jointly inferring a robot’s\ntrajectory and a set of landmark positions and classes with unknown measurement\ncorrespondences, i.e. semantic SLAM  . In particular, here we apply our approach to\noptimize jointly for robot poses xi∈SE⁡(3),i=1,…,nformulae-sequencesubscript𝑥𝑖SE3𝑖1…𝑛x_{i}\\in\\operatorname{SE}(3),i=1,\\ldots,n, and landmark\nlocations and classes ℓj=(pj,sj),pj∈ℝ3,sj∈𝒞,j=1,…,mformulae-sequencesubscriptℓ𝑗subscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑠𝑗formulae-sequencesubscript𝑝𝑗superscriptℝ3formulae-sequencesubscript𝑠𝑗𝒞𝑗1…𝑚\\ell_{j}=(p_{j},s_{j}),\\ p_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3},\\ s_{j}\\in\\mathcal{C},\\ j=1,\\ldots,m, where 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is an a priori known\nset of discrete semantic classes. We adopt the general methodology of Doherty et al.  for data\nassociation: given a range-bearing measurement and associated semantic class\nobtained from an object detector, we apply a threshold on the measurement\nlikelihood to determine whether the measurement corresponds to a new or\nold landmark (for this, we employ the approximate marginal computations\nin (12a) and (15)). If it is a new\nlandmark, we simply add the new measurement and landmark to our graph. If it is\nan old landmark, we add it to the graph as a mixture with a single component for\neach landmark that passes the likelihood threshold: where ℋk⊆Lsubscriptℋ𝑘𝐿\\mathcal{H}_{k}\\subseteq L is a subset of landmarks and the landmark\nmeasurement factor fk​(xi,ℓj)subscript𝑓𝑘subscript𝑥𝑖subscriptℓ𝑗f_{k}(x_{i},\\ell_{j}) decomposes as: Here ϕk​(sj)subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑘subscript𝑠𝑗\\phi_{k}(s_{j}) is a categorical distribution and ψk​(xi,pj)subscript𝜓𝑘subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑝𝑗\\psi_{k}(x_{i},p_{j}) is\nGaussian with respect to the range and bearing between xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} and pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j}. We\nalso incorporate odometry factors of the form used in\n(18).777For a more detailed exposition of this approach, see\n. The overall graphical model specifying this\nproblem is depicted in Figure 5. Since the\nmeasurement factors in equation (22) involve\nboth continuous and discrete variables, it is nontrivial to\nimplement this within any existing framework. In the hybrid factor graph\nrepresentation, however, problems of this form admit a concise description and\nsolution using discrete-continuous factors. In this demonstration, we consider semantic SLAM using stereo camera data from\nthe KITTI dataset [ref]43. We sample keyframes every two\nseconds, using VISO2 [ref]40 to obtain stereo odometry\nmeasurements and YOLO [ref]44 for noisy detections of two types of\nobjects: cars and trucks. We estimate the range and bearing to an\nobject’s position as that of the median depth point projecting into a detected\nobject’s bounding box. Using DC-SAM, we are able to compute solutions to this\nproblem online.888We run our solver on an Intel i7 2.6 GHz CPU and YOLO\non an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 3000 GPU. Table I gives a\nquantitative comparison of our approach with the odometric estimate from VISO2.\nOur approach substantially improves upon the translational errors of the\nodometric estimate and additionally enables the estimation of discrete landmark\nclasses.999Qualitative results visualizing the semantic map output from\nour method are available in the supplement\n\n.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: problems of this form admit a concise description and\nsolution using discrete-continuous factors.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
