      "content": "Paper Title: Guiding Word Equation Solving using Graph Neural Networks (Extended Technical Report)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past few years, reasoning within specific theories, including arithmetic, arrays, or algebraic data structures, has become one the main challenges in automated reasoning.\nTo address the needs of modern applications, new techniques have been developed, giving rise to SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers.\nSMT solvers implement efficient decision procedures and reasoning methods for a wide range of theories, and are used in applications such as verification. Among the theories supported by SMT solvers, the theory of strings has in particular received attention in the last years. Strings represent one of the most important data-types in programming, and string constraints are therefore relevant in various domains, from text processing to database management systems and web applications.\nOne of the simplest kind of constraints supported by the SMT-LIB theory of strings 2 are word equations, i.e., equations in a free semigroup [ref]30.\nMakanin’s work  demonstrated the decidability of the word equation problem, which was later confirmed to be in PSPACE .\nHowever, even the leading SMT solvers with support for string constraints (including cvc5 , Z3 , Norn , TRAU , Ostrich , Woorpje , and Z3-Noodler ) tend to be incomplete for proving the unsatisfiability of word equations, illustrating the hardness of the theory. Solving a word equation is to check for the existence of string values for variables that make equal both sides of the equation.\nFor example, consider the equation X​a​b=Y​a​Z𝑋𝑎𝑏𝑌𝑎𝑍Xab=YaZ, where\nX,Y𝑋𝑌X,Y, and Z𝑍Z are variables ranging over strings, and a𝑎a and b𝑏b are letters.\nThis equation is satisfiable and has multiple solutions. For example, assigning a𝑎a to both X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y and b𝑏b to Z𝑍Z results in a​a​b=a​a​b𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑎𝑏aab=aab. This paper presents an algorithm that makes use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN)  in order to solve word equations.\nIt is an extension of the method proposed in  and implemented in Norn , referred to as the split algorithm. The split algorithm is, in turn, based on the well-known Nielsen transformation 0.\nIt builds a proof tree by iteratively applying a set of inference (split) rules on a word equation. One critical aspect of the algorithm lies in selecting the next branch to be explored while constructing the proof tree, which significantly influences the solving time.\nTo address this, we present a heuristic that leverages deep learning to determine the exploration order of branches.\nGNNs  represent one of the paradigms in neural network research, tailored for non-Euclidean, graph-structured data. This makes them suited for scenarios where data points are interconnected, such as social networks [ref]22, molecular structures , programs  , and logical formulae 0  1 .\nOur work represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first use of deep learning in the context of word equations. Figure 1 illustrates the workflow of our approach.\nDuring the training stage, we initially employ the split algorithm (without GNN guidance) to solve word equation problems drawn from a training dataset. For each satisfiable (SAT) problem, we generate a corresponding proof tree. Within this tree, each branch (pair of a node and a direct child) is evaluated to determine whether it leads to a solution, as well as its distance to the corresponding leaf.\nBased on this information, we assign labels to each branch to indicate whether it is a favorable choice for reaching a solution. Subsequently, we encode each branching point comprising the node and its child nodes as a graph.\nThese graph representations, along with their associated labels, are then used to train the GNN model. In the prediction stage, word equations from an evaluation dataset are processed using the split algorithm, now guided by the GNN model.\nAt each branching point, the current branch is first transformed into a graph representation, which is in turn fed to the trained deep learning model with GNNs. The trained model, using its learned insights, advises on which branch should be prioritized and explored first.\n We implemented this algorithm in the DragonLi tool.\nExperiments were conducted using four word equation benchmarks: three of them are artificially generated and inspired by Woorpje ; a fourth one is extracted from SMT-LIB benchmarks  and encodes real-world problems.\nResults show that for SAT problems, the pure split algorithm without GNNs is already competitive with some leading string solvers (Z3 , cvc5 , Ostrich , Woorpje , Z3-Noodler ), while it performs less well on UNSAT problems.\nWe conjecture that this is due to the (relatively straightforward) depth-first search performed by our implementation of the split algorithm, which is a good strategy for finding solutions, whereas other solvers devote more time (e.g., using length reasoning) to show that formulas are unsatisfiable.\nEnabling GNN guidance in DragonLi uniformly improves performance on SAT problems, allowing it to outperform all other solvers in one specific benchmark. Specifically, in Benchmark 2, the GNN-guided version of DragonLi solves 115% more SAT problems than its non-GNN-guided counterpart and 43.0% more than the next best string solver, Woorpje. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: We define a proof system based on the split algorithm for\nsolving word equations, tailored to combining symbolic reasoning\nwith GNN-based guidance. Based on the proof system, we introduce an algorithm for\nintegrating GNN-based guidance with the proof system. To train a GNN on the data obtained from solving word equations,\nwe present five possible graph representations of word equations. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on four word\nequation benchmarks, comparing, in particular, the different graph\nencodings and different backtracking strategies of the algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: to database management systems and web applications.\nOne of the simplest kind of constraints supported by the SMT-LIB theory of strings 2 are word equations, i.e., equations in a free semigroup [ref]30.\nMakanin’s work  demonstrated the decidability of the word equation problem, which was later confirmed to be in PSPACE .\nHowever, even the leading SMT solvers with support for string\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
