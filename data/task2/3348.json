First, let A​P𝐴𝑃AP denote a fixed, finite set of atomic propositions ranged over by a, b, c, . . . . Then a labelled discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) D𝐷D is a triple (S,P,L)𝑆𝑃𝐿(S,P,L) with S𝑆S finite set of states, P𝑃P : S𝑆S XS𝑆S →→\\rightarrow    is a stochastic matrix, and L𝐿L : S𝑆S →→\\rightarrow 2A​Psuperscript2𝐴𝑃2^{AP} is a labelling function.[ref]22 For a DTMC, if ∑s′∈Ssubscriptsuperscript𝑠′𝑆\\sum_{s^{\\prime}\\in S} P​(s,s′)𝑃𝑠superscript𝑠′P(s,s^{\\prime}) =1, then we say it’s a stochastic. If the ∑s′∈Ssubscriptsuperscript𝑠′𝑆\\sum_{s^{\\prime}\\in S} P​(s,s′)∈[0,1)𝑃𝑠superscript𝑠′01P(s,s^{\\prime})\\in[0,1), then we call the model a fully probabilistic system (F​P​S𝐹𝑃𝑆FPS) and it is sub-stochastic. A state s𝑠s is absorbing if P​(s,s)=1𝑃𝑠𝑠1P(s,s)=1 if s𝑠s only has a self-loop. A path σ𝜎\\sigma in D𝐷D is a state sequence s0subscript𝑠0s_{0}, s1subscript𝑠1s_{1}, s2subscript𝑠2s_{2} … such that for all i𝑖i, P​(si,si+1)>0𝑃subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖10P(s_{i},s_{i+1})>0 where si∈Ssubscript𝑠𝑖𝑆s_{i}\\in S. The probability P​r​(σ)𝑃𝑟𝜎Pr(\\sigma) for finite path σ=s0,s1,….,sn\\sigma=s_{0},s_{1},....,s_{n} is defined as P​(s0,s1)⋅P​(s1,s2)​⋯​P​(sn−1,sn)⋅𝑃subscript𝑠0subscript𝑠1𝑃subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2⋯𝑃subscript𝑠𝑛1subscript𝑠𝑛P(s_{0},s_{1})\\cdot P(s_{1},s_{2})\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot P(s_{n-1,s_{n}}) . For the finite set of the paths C𝐶C, P​r​(C)=∑σ∈CP​r​(σ)𝑃𝑟𝐶subscript𝜎𝐶𝑃𝑟𝜎Pr(C)=\\sum_{\\sigma\\in C}Pr(\\sigma). And we denote σ​[i]𝜎delimited-[]𝑖\\sigma[i] as the (i+1)𝑖1(i+1)-st state in σ𝜎\\sigma. At here we define two terms’ syntax in the PCTL for the illustration purpose: (i) ΦΦ\\Phi: The state formula. (ii) ΨΨ\\Psi: The path formula. So, if we have the PCTL formula P≤p​(Ψ)subscript𝑃absent𝑝ΨP_{\\leq p}(\\Psi) , we have: So, P≤p​(Ψ)subscript𝑃absent𝑝ΨP_{\\leq p}(\\Psi) is refuted by state s𝑠s whenever the total probability mass of all ΨΨ\\Psi-paths that start in s𝑠s exceeds the lower probability bound p𝑝p. This indicates that a counterexample for P≤p​(Ψ)subscript𝑃absent𝑝ΨP_{\\leq p}(\\Psi) is a set of paths starting in state s𝑠s and satisfying the path formula ΨΨ\\Psi. As long as ΨΨ\\Psi is a path formula whose validity can be witnessed by finite state sequences, finite paths suffice. [ref]22 Previously, we have defined two problems that are aimed to provide useful DTMC model diagnostic feedback for property violation: (i) generating strongest evidences and (ii) smallest counterexamples. As a result, we are going to define the strongest evidence. First, we define a finite path σ𝜎\\sigma minimally satisfies the path formula ΨΨ\\Psi if it satisfies ΨΨ\\Psi, but no proper prefix of σ𝜎\\sigma does so. Then we have: (Definition of Strongest Evidence In DTMC) An evidence for P≤p​(Ψ)subscript𝑃absent𝑝ΨP_{\\leq p}(\\Psi) in state s𝑠s is a finite path σ𝜎\\sigma that starts in s𝑠s and minimally satisfies ΨΨ\\Psi. A strongest evidence is an evidence σ∗superscript𝜎\\sigma^{*} such that P​r​(σ∗)≥P​r​(σ)𝑃𝑟superscript𝜎𝑃𝑟𝜎Pr(\\sigma^{*})\\geq Pr(\\sigma) for any evidence σ𝜎\\sigma.[ref]22 Then we are going to define the smallest counterexample. The intuition of having the smallest counterexample is the smallest counterexample is mostly exceeding the required probability bound given that it has the smallest number of paths. To compute the strongest evidence and smallest counterexample, the DTMC D𝐷D is transformed to a weighted digraph GD=(V,E,w)subscript𝐺𝐷𝑉𝐸𝑤G_{D}=(V,E,w), where V𝑉V and E𝐸E are finite sets of vertices and edges, respectively. V=S𝑉𝑆V=S and (v,v′)∈E𝑣superscript𝑣′𝐸(v,v^{\\prime})\\in E iff P​(v,v′)>0𝑃𝑣superscript𝑣′0P(v,v^{\\prime})>0, and w​(v,v′)=l​o​g​(P​(v,v′)−1)𝑤𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃superscript𝑣superscript𝑣′1w(v,v^{\\prime})=log(P(v,v^{\\prime})^{-1}). Multiplication of transition probabilities is thus turned into the addition of edges weight along paths. So we have: (Definition of smallest counterexample) A counterexample for P≤p​(Ψ)subscript𝑃absent𝑝ΨP_{\\leq p}(\\Psi) in state s𝑠s is set C𝐶C of evidences such that P​r​(C)≥p𝑃𝑟𝐶𝑝Pr(C)\\geq p. C∗superscript𝐶C^{*} is the smallest counterexample if |C∗|≤|C||C*|\\leq|C| for all counterexamples C𝐶C and P​r​(C∗)≥P​r​(C′)𝑃𝑟superscript𝐶𝑃𝑟superscript𝐶′Pr(C^{*})\\geq Pr(C^{\\prime}) for any counterexample C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} with |C′|=|C∗|superscript𝐶′superscript𝐶|C^{\\prime}|=|C^{*}| . [ref]22 (Lemma 1) For any path σ𝜎\\sigma from s𝑠s to t𝑡t in DTMC D𝐷D, k𝑘k ∈\\in N>0subscript𝑁absent0N_{>0} , and hℎh ∈\\in N𝑁N ∪\\cup {∞}:σ:𝜎\\{\\infty\\}:\\sigma is a k𝑘k-th most probable path of at most hℎh hops in D𝐷D iff σ𝜎\\sigma is the k𝑘k-th shortest path of at most hℎh hops in GDsubscript𝐺𝐷G_{D}. [ref]22 Consider the property formula ΦΦ\\Phi ∪≤hsuperscriptabsentℎ\\cup^{\\leq h} ΨΨ\\Psi. If state s𝑠s \\nvDash\\nvDash\\nvDash P≤psubscript𝑃absent𝑝P_{\\leq p} ΦΦ\\Phi ∪≤hsuperscriptabsentℎ\\cup^{\\leq h} ΨΨ\\Psi, then a strongest evidence can be found by a shortest path algorithm (SP algorithm) once all ΦΦ\\Phi-states and all (¬ΨΨ\\neg\\Psi and ¬ΦΦ\\neg\\Phi )-states in DTMC D𝐷D are made absorbing. Also, the smallest counterexample can be found by applying the k𝑘k-SP algorithms that allow k𝑘k to be determined, where k𝑘k is the most probable path of at most hℎh hops in D𝐷D. If h≠∞ℎh\\neq\\infty, hop-constrained SP with time-complexity O​(h​m)𝑂ℎ𝑚O(hm) and k𝑘k-SP algorithms with time complexity O​(h​m+h​k​l​o​g​(m/n))𝑂ℎ𝑚ℎ𝑘𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑚𝑛O(hm+hklog(m/n)) need to be employed, where n=|S|𝑛𝑆n=|S| and m𝑚m is the number of non-zero entries in P𝑃P.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: D𝐷D is a triple (S,P,L)𝑆𝑃𝐿(S,P,L) with S𝑆S finite set of states, P𝑃P : S𝑆S XS𝑆S →→\\rightarrow    is a stochastic matrix, and L𝐿L : S𝑆S →→\\rightarrow 2A​Psuperscript2𝐴𝑃2^{AP} is a labelling function.[ref]22 For a DTMC, if ∑s′∈Ssubscriptsuperscript𝑠′𝑆\\sum_{s^{\\prime}\\in S} P​(s,s′)𝑃𝑠superscript𝑠′P(s,s^{\\prime}) =1, then we say it’s a stochastic.
