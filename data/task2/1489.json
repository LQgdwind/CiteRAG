      "content": "Paper Title: Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Image-Goal Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSLAM-based Methods. The task of navigation has been studied in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in robotics .\nSeveral SLAM methods comprise multiple hand-crafted modules to address strictly-defined problems in specific environments   .\nThese modules have been progressively replaced with learning-based functions: some approaches  implement the localization module with a neural network, while others  replace the metric map with a latent mapping of the environment.\nVariants of latent mapping also include a topological map whose nodes contain geometric and semantic information about the environment, as well as a global planner that relies on it .\nOther works replace SLAM entirely by deep models without explicit planning, and instead rely on a map or memory structure   .\nThe major drawback of such methods is that they contain multiple modules that are often trained in a supervised fashion, requiring a large amount of annotated data.\nMoreover, SLAM-based methods rely on the availability of position   and depth   sensors.\nIn our work, we focus on the realistic and challenging cas with access to RGB input only. RL-based Navigation. Another popular class of methods involves training deep models with reinforcement learning to solve navigation tasks without an explicit world representation.\nThey use end-to-end frameworks with modules that are less hand-crafted than SLAM-based methods, and have shown good performance on synthetic mazes  as well as real-world data    .\nSuch methods have also been explored on indoor-scenes datasets, similar to our setup on image-goal  and object-goal    navigation tasks.\nThey use an actor-critic model whose policy is a function of both the target and the current state.\nWhile episodic RL is a simple and elegant framework for navigation, it ignores the fact that useful information comes from previous episodes.\nIn our work, we propose to augment the policy used in RL frameworks with an external memory and to attend on it with a novel, dedicated module. Combining RL and Planning. A few recent works have augmented RL-based methods with topological structures, like graphs   [ref]9  0 or memory buffers [ref]6  .\nThey store representations of the visited locations and exploit them at navigation time.\nThe process of building these representations can be done offline [ref]9  0, and requires human-generated data in some cases [ref]9.\nFor example, the test phase in [ref]9 contains a warm-up stage where the agent builds a graph memory from human trajectories.\nAlternatives to this manual annotation do exist, such as building a graph directly with reinforcement learning, using the value function of a goal-conditioned policy as edges weights , or buffer of past observations [ref]6.\nThese methods were evaluated on synthetic datasets, and have not been scalable to high-dimensional visually-realistic setups.\nIn particular, [ref]6 proposes a method related to our model, with a policy that puts attention on an observation buffer.\nIn contrast, we learn a representation in a self-supervised fashion to store memory efficiently.\nWe also present results on a large-scale photorealistic dataset, while [ref]6 is limited to synthetic setups. Exploration and Representation Learning. Closely related to navigation, the task of exploration has also been extensively studied and has led to interesting breakthroughs in representation learning.\nIn particular, learning to explore unseen environments has been seen through the spectrum of computer vision  , SLAM-based , and RL-based   approaches.\nMethods such as  0 leverage a self-supervised representation learning stage to prepare the exploration phase.\nOur work extends this line of study by first showing that a self-supervised pretraining phase allows to learn useful information that generalizes to unseen environments, as well as proposing a novel attention-based navigation policy that takes advantage of this information.\nPosterior to our work, there have been extensions of our method, including  that exploits a similar approach for object-goal navigation in unseen environments.\nThis work uses the same components than our method: both short-term and long-term memories, as well as an attention mechanism to leverage past experience.\nThe main difference with our work relies on the task being tackled: contrary to our work,  focuses on object-goal navigation, which consists in navigating to an instance of a target object.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: with an external memory and to attend on it with a novel, dedicated module.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
