Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

For all models and algorithms presented, check if you include: A clear description of the algorithm. Please refer to Algorithm, 1. We also provide the source code. An analysis of the complexity (time, space, sample size) of any algorithm. We do not perform this analysis. A link to a downloadable source code, with specification of all dependencies, including external libraries. We provide the source code along with our submission. We also explain the experimental setting in the paper and in the Appendix. For any theoretical claim, check if you include: A statement of the result. See main paper. A clear explanation of any assumptions. See main paper. A complete proof of the claim.  See main paper. For all figures and tables that present empirical results, check if you include: A complete description of the data collection process, including sample size. For our tabular four-rooms task, we reuse the environment from . We use standard versions of Mujoco 5 and Miniworld  for our single task evaluations. As for the transfer setting, we use custom environments using [ref]15 for HalfCheetahWall-v0 and HopperIceWall-v0 and [ref]16 for TMaze (continuous). We provide the source code along with all the environments used for our experiments. A link to a downloadable version of the dataset or simulation environment.\nSee  for details regarding the four-rooms task and refer to our code for further details. Standard Mujoco 5 and Miniworld  tasks are available in their respective repositories. As for the custom tasks, please refer to our source code. An explanation of any data that were excluded, description of any pre-processing step.\nThere is no need for any kind of pre-processing for the data collected from the environments. No data was excluded in any experiment we performed. An explanation of how samples were allocated for training / validation / testing.\nAs with all standard reinforcement learning control experiments, we do not split the data for training and validation. The performance during learning is presented in the main paper. The range of hyper-parameters considered, method to select the best hyper-parameter configuration, and specification of all hyper-parameters used to generate results For the tabular setting, we tune both (TDEOC and OC) for the best hyper-parameters for the given transfer setting. As for the standard Mujoco and Miniworld tasks, we reuse the hyper-parameters provided by baselines and  for PPO. For OC we reuse the hyper-parameters provided by . As for the custom tasks, we tune the relevant hyper-parameters for each algorithm and compare the results based on the average results over 20 runs for each hyper-parameter configuration. All the final hyper-parameter configurations are reported in Appendix H. The exact number of evaluation runs. We average results over 300 runs for the tabular four-rooms case. All our experiments in the non-linear function approximation case are evaluated by averaging 20 independent seeds. A description of how experiments were run. Please refer to the experimental details provided in the main paper as well as the Appendix. A clear definition of the specific measure or statistics used to report results. In the four-rooms case, we use the number of steps to reach the goal as the performance measure for each algorithm. As for the non-linear function approximation case, we use average return to compare different algorithms. Our methods are consistent with standard performance measures used for the respective tasks. Clearly defined error bars. We plot error bars representing 0.5 of the standard deviation to observe differences in variance more acutely. A description of results with central tendency (e.g. mean) & variation (e.g. stddev ). Our results are an average over all the runs. The error bars are half of the standard deviations for each run. A description of the computing infrastructure used. A single CPU is used for the tabular as well as Mujoco based experiments. As for the Miniworld tasks, we use one CPU and a GPU for our results.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: four-rooms task, we reuse the environment from .
