      "content": "Paper Title: Polyline Simplification under the Local Fréchet Distance Has Almost-Quadratic Runtime in 2D\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolyline simplification has a long history in computational geometry,\nwhere it has also been known as polygonal approximation,\nline generalization, or ε𝜀\\varepsilon-simplification.\nIt owes its relevance – also beyond computational geometry – to a large variety of applications,\nsuch as processing of vector graphics  ,\nrobotics  ,\ntrajectory clustering [ref]8,\nshape analysis ,\ndata compression ,\ncurve fitting 0,\nand map visualization    4 3.\nThe task of polyline simplification\nis to replace a given polyline on n𝑛n vertices with a\nminimum-size subsequence of its vertices while\nensuring that the input and the output polyline are sufficiently similar.\nThe similarity is governed by a given distance threshold δ𝛿\\delta.\nLine segments between vertices in the output polyline are called shortcuts.\nTo determine the similarity of the input and output polyline,\nthe Hausdorff and the Fréchet distance are the most commonly used measures.\nBoth can be applied either globally or locally.\nIn the global version, the distance between the entire input and output\npolyline is measured and must not exceed δ𝛿\\delta.\nIn the local version, the distance between each shortcut and the part of\nthe input polyline it bridges must not exceed δ𝛿\\delta. For many applications, local similarity is more sensible and intuitive.\nSimplifications with global similarity have only been studied recently.\nFor the global (undirected) Hausdorff distance, computing a simplified polyline with the\nsmallest number of shortcuts yields an NP-hard problem .\nFor the global Fréchet distance, an 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) time algorithm was designed\nby Bringmann and Chaudhury .\nFor the more extensively studied and more classical problem\nof simplification with the local Hausdorff distance,\nthe Imai–Iri algorithm 3, published in 1988, guarantees\na running time of 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) by reducing the simplification\nproblem to a graph problem.\nEssentially, the algorithm constructs a graph where the polyline vertices are the nodes\nand where there is an edge between a pair of vertices if they can be connected with\na shortcut respecting the δ𝛿\\delta distance bound.\nFor the local Hausdorff distance, Melkman and O’Rourke 5 showed\nalready in 1988 that the Imai–Iri algorithm can be improved to run in\n𝒪​(n2​log⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\log n) time by making the graph construction phase more efficient.\nIn 1996, Chan and Chin  further reduced the running time to 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}). For the local Fréchet distance, though, the cubic running time of the Imai–Iri algorithm, which was shown by Godau  in 1991,\nwas a longstanding bound and used as a building block or reference also in recent publications  .\nAgarwal, Har-Peled, Mustafa and Wang  explicitly posed the problem of whether there exists a subcubic algorithm for polyline simplification under the local Fréchet distance as an open question in 2005.\nThe question was answered positively very recently\nby Buchin, van der Hoog, Ophelders, Schlipf, Silveira, and Staals 1.\nThey describe a data structure that outputs the Fréchet distance between any line segment and any subpolyline of a preprocessed input polyline in 𝒪​(n​log2⁡n)𝒪𝑛superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log^{2}n) time.\nUsing this data structure to check whether there is a valid shortcut for every vertex pair, a polyline simplified optimally can be computed in 𝒪​(n5/2+ε)𝒪superscript𝑛52𝜀\\mathcal{O}(n^{5/2+\\varepsilon}) time (and space) for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0.\nWe remark that this data structure is quite sophisticated and actually more powerful than required for polyline simplification.\nTo check whether there is a valid shortcut between a vertex pair with respect to the Fréchet distance, it suffices to be able to decide whether the distance of the shortcut to its subpolyline is at most δ𝛿\\delta.\nHowever, the data structure always returns the exact distance value and it can accomplish this for arbitrary line segments and not only potential shortcuts.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: owes its relevance – also beyond computational geometry – to a large variety of applications,\nsuch as processing of vector graphics  ,\nrobotics  ,\ntrajectory clustering [ref]8,\nshape analysis ,\ndata compression ,\ncurve fitting 0,\nand map visualization    4 3.\nThe task of polyline simplification\nis to replace a given polyline on n𝑛n vertices with a\nminimum-size\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
