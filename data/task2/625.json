      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Periodic Averaging: A Practical Approach to Reducing Communication in Distributed Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs machine learning today is involving training deeper and wider neural networks with larger\ndatasets, the compute and memory requirements for these deep learning tasks have been increasing.\nThis has led to great interest in scaling SGD on parallel\nsystems¬† .\nIn fact, parallel training is supported in almost all of today‚Äôs mainstream deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow¬†[ref]3, PyTorch¬†[ref]4, MXNet¬†, CNTK¬†[ref]6, and Caffe¬†. The most widely adopted approach to distributed training is a data-parallel SGD.\nThe idea is that each machine holds a copy of the entire model and computes stochastic gradients with\nlocal mini-batches.\nThe local model parameters or gradients are synchronized frequently to achieve a global consensus of the\nlearned model.\nThough the parallelization is straightforward, a naive implementation cannot achieve good\nperformance because the communication of the gradients in each iteration is expensive¬†0123.\nAs reported in¬†4, 50%percent5050\\% to 80%percent8080\\% of the total execution time is spent on communication\nwhen training deep neural networks on 16 GPUs from AWS EC2.\nAs we will show through our experiments, even on a HPC cluster with a 100Gbps InfiniBand connection, communication can still take up more than 50%percent5050\\% of the total execution time for training certain neural networks. The study of communication-efficient SGD reduces to the exploration of communication strategies that can achieve the best trade-off between convergence and communication for a given configuration.\nA common approach is to synchronize the model parameters among the machines once every few iterations (namely, periodic parameter averaging).\nThis method has several advantages.\nFirst, it reduces both the bandwidth cost and latency in communication ‚Äì in comparison, compression-based methods that we will discuss\nin next section only save the bandwidth.\nSecond, it can be easily combined with bandwidth-optimal Allreduce¬†5.\nThird, again unlike compression or quantization methods, it requires no or little extra computation.\nPeriodic parameter averaging has been adopted in many previous works for accelerating SGD¬†6 7 8 9 0 1.\nRecent works¬†23 also show that periodic parameter averaging can achieve the well-known O‚Äã(1/M‚ÄãK)ùëÇ1ùëÄùêæO(1/\\sqrt{MK}) convergence rate for distributed SGD on non-convex optimization if a ‚Äúproper‚Äù averaging period is used (Here, MùëÄM is the total mini-batch size in each iteration and KùêæK is the number of iterations). However, all of the work in this area assumes that a constant averaging period is to be used throughout the training. As we will show in our experiments, training with a constant averaging period of 888 can lead to noticeable decrease in convergence and accuracy, which indicates that a naive implementation of periodic parameter averaging SGD is not effective.\nMoreover, Zhou et al.¬†3 have shown that it is hard to determine the optimal averaging period in practice, and none of the previous works give a specific algorithm to determine this important parameter. In this paper, we establish both theoretically and empirically that, given a fixed communication budget, the optimal averaging period for distributed SGD should be adaptive.\nWe observe that, when using a constant averaging period, the variance of model parameters is large\ninitially, but decreases quickly over the iterations.\nThe large initial variance in constant periodic averaging SGD is harmful to the\nconvergence rate, whereas fast decrease of the variance turns out to be unnecessary for\nachieving the asymptotic O‚Äã(1/M‚ÄãK)ùëÇ1ùëÄùêæO(1/\\sqrt{MK}) convergence rate.\nBased on this observation,\nwe present an algorithm called ADaptive Periodic parameter averaging SGD (ADPSGD) which uses a small averaging period in the beginning and gradually increases it over the\niterations.\nWhen increasing the averaging period, the algorithm keeps the variance of model parameters on different nodes close to a value proportional to the learning\nrate.\nWe show that this adaptive periodic averaging strategy maintains the O‚Äã(1/M‚ÄãK)ùëÇ1ùëÄùêæO(1/\\sqrt{MK}) convergence rate while requiring less communication than constant periodic averaging. We evaluate our algorithm on multiple image classification benchmarks.\nCompared with constant periodic parameter averageing SGD, our algorithm achieves smaller training loss and higher\ntest accuracy, while\nrequiring smaller communication and total execution time.\nCompared against full-communication SGD,\nour algorithm runs 1.14x to 1.27x faster on 16 Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs connected by 100Gbps InfiniBand, and 1.46x to 1.95x faster when the connection bandwidth is throttled to 10Gbps.\nCompared against single-node SGD, our algorithm achieves linear speedups across 16 nodes due to the saved communication.\nCompared with gradient-quantization SGD, our algorithm achieves faster convergence with only half of the communication.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: has led to great interest in scaling SGD on parallel\nsystems¬† .\nIn fact, parallel training is supported in almost all of today‚Äôs mainstream deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow¬†[ref]3, PyTorch¬†[ref]4, MXNet¬†, CNTK¬†[ref]6, and Caffe¬†.
