Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

We build our model on top of the π𝜋\\pi-GAN implementation in PyTorch , re-using its released generator and discriminator architectures. We also use the discriminator architecture as the backbone of our encoder, where we add a t​a​n​h𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎtanh at the end of the latent code head. All models are optimized with Adam  optimizer for 300k iterations, which is approximately the same computational cost to obtain a π𝜋\\pi-GAN model. CelebA [ref]19 models are trained with batch size 48 on resolution 64×\\times64, where we sample 24 points per ray. We use learning rates of 2e-4, 6e-5, and 2e-4 for discriminator, generator, and encoder, respectively. For all other models, we utilized π𝜋\\pi-GAN [ref]2’s progressive training strategy, starting with training on resolution 32×\\times32 with learning rates 4e-5, 4e-4, and 4e-4 for generator, discriminator, and encoder, respectively, with 96 sampled points per ray. We increase to resolution 64×\\times64 with learning rates 2e-5, 2e-4, and 2e-4 for generator, discriminator, and encoder, respectively, and sample 72 points per ray after 50k iterations. We empirically set λrecon=5subscript𝜆recon5\\lambda_{\\mathrm{recon}}=5, λssim=1subscript𝜆ssim1\\lambda_{\\mathrm{ssim}}=1 and λvgg=1subscript𝜆vgg1\\lambda_{\\mathrm{vgg}}=1 for all datasets. For CelebA [ref]19, we follow [ref]2 and set λpos=15subscript𝜆pos15\\lambda_{\\mathrm{pos}}=15. For CARLA  and ShapeNet-SRN [ref]4 , we set λpos=0subscript𝜆pos0\\lambda_{\\mathrm{pos}}=0 as we do not observe significant difference. We use |z|=512𝑧512|z|=512 for CelebA [ref]19 and |z|=256𝑧256|z|=256 for CARLA  and Shapenet-SRN [ref]4 .\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: at the end of the latent code head.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
