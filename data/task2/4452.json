Chae was with Dongguk University.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA lot of researches have studied image and text as a multi-modal form. By tokenizing the object in an image, an alignment between an object and text has been proposed to apply a self-attention model [ref]7. In addition, [ref]7 showed such models achieve better performance in various downstream tasks compared with other vision-language approaches . Therefore, this study experiments with the approach suggested by [ref]7 for extracting the implicit knowledge. Multi-modal approaches using image features from Faster R-CNN or ResNet and question embedding of pre-trained models are also proposed [ref]90. [ref]9 generated joint representation through Bilinear Attention Map. 0 extracted image-text joint representation by using image features and question embedding, and proposed a 3-way Tucker fusion method. In addition to using pre-trained models, there have also been studies trying to solve VQA tasks using additional external knowledge.  proposed ArticleNet using Wikipedia search API related to keywords of an image and words of the question. A method for extracting an external knowledge related to the objects in an image was also introduced .  extracted the knowledge by using the object label output from the Faster R-CNN model.
