      "content": "Paper Title: Fuzzy Commitments Offer Insufficient Protection to Biometric Templates Produced by Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work develops and integrates the following components: adversarial guessing, attack on protected template, and reversing a biometric tempate. The concept of “brute” force attacks against systems is not a new one. Also in the context of biometrics, guessing attacks are well known. Previous works explored adversarial guessing as a method to empirically estimate the entropy offered by some representations. A guessing distance was defined in  as a number of guesses required to obtain the most likely acceptable element according to the population feature distribution. However, approximating a feature distribution accurately is a challenging task. The work in  focused on estimating the security against partial recovery of fingerprint features and defined a coverage effort curve as a number of guesses required for recovering a certain portion of the fingerprint minutiae.\nA more generic entropy measure was proposed in . Similarly to guessing entropy , they expressed the guessing effort as a function of a probability of usefully guessing at all possible trials and suggested two guessing attacks.\nIn  two empirical approaches were considered for evaluating quadratic Renyi entropy. First was a brute force attack using either bit-string templates of real people or code-words (assuming the knowledge of the system’s parameters). The second approach assumed a knowledge of the user’s commitment and  suggested narrowing down the search to templates that can be decoded using this commitment. In  a similar attack was analysed in terms of a minimum impostor decoding complexity. Our work expands this line of research towards modern deep learning representations. In other words, the guessing attack is a way to upper bound the entropy offered by the feature vectors produced by the state of the art deep learning feature extraction tools. There is a large volume of work on attacking protected biometric systems (see the survey of ): addressing various protection schemes, biometric traits, and configurations.\nPrevious work targetted the extraction of the (binary) template from the system (e.g.,   [ref]19). In other words, once the template was reconstructed, the attack was declared successful. In contrast, we look further and reconstruct the actual biometrics from the protected template. While this was done in the past for systems with no template protection , we are not aware of prior work that performed an end-to-end attack of reconstructing a biometric sample, e.g., facial image, from a protected template. Methods that reverse biometric templates in unprotected systems have been applied to obtain facial images  [ref]21 , fingerprints   , iris    and other biometric traits (see the comprehensive survey of  for details). Each of these works uses a different approach which depends on the biometric modality and the attacked system (i.e., the system which was used to obtain the templates from the biometric samples). Our work relies on NbNet . NbNet trains a De-Convolutional Neural Network (D-CNN) to invert templates obtained by a CNN back to a facial image. NbNet comprises a cascade of multiple neighborly de-convolution blocks (NbBlocks). To address the issues of previous D-CNNs, such as noise and redundant channels, NbBlock learns a reduced amount of channels compared to the deconvolutional block, while the rest of the channels are learned using the already computed channels in the same layer. The resulting network was shown to perform well on the LFW and color FERET benchmarks. NbNet can be applied to reverse templates obtained by any CNN feature extractor, as it uses it as a black box (without the knowledge of the feature extraction algorithm). This method fits well in our attack, and we indeed make use of it to reconstruct facial images from reconstructed feature vectors.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: systems (see the survey of ): addressing various protection schemes, biometric traits, and configurations.\nPrevious work targetted the extraction of the (binary) template from the system (e.g.,   [ref]19).

In contrast, we look further and reconstruct the actual biometrics from the protected template.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
