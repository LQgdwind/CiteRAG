Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sim-Suction: Learning a Suction Grasp Policy for Cluttered Environments Using a Synthetic Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic segmentation is an essential component in various robotic applications, particularly object grasping. Several studies have used segmentation masks to facilitate grasp planning  [ref]32 [ref]33   . By providing a detailed representation of object boundaries and spatial relationships, semantic segmentation enables robots to understand the shape, size, and category of objects. This information is essential for calculating feasible grasp points and optimizing grasp strategies. Mask R-CNN  has been widely used in robotics applications, such as object grasping, due to its ability to provide precise object localization and segmentation. However, Mask R-CNN does not generalize to unseen objects in novel categories. Recent ground-breaking work promptable Segment Anything Model (SAM) [ref]37 demonstrates promising out-of-box zero-shot image segmentation capabilities in various scenarios without any retraining and fine-tuning. It requires 2D points or 2D bounding boxes prompts to provide instance segmentation. The Grounding DINO model  proposes open-set image object detector which incorporates a language model to enhance concept understanding, resulting in more effective object detection for unseen objects. Our work fuses the advantages of SAM [ref]37, Grounding DINO , and point-wise affordance to propose a suction-grasping policy to use text prompt input to guide the picking-up task by predicting robust 6D suction grasp poses for objects of interest in cluttered environments.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Semantic segmentation is an essential component in various robotic applications, particularly object grasping.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
