      "content": "Paper Title: Option-Aware Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance in a variety of scenarios, such as games  [ref]2 [ref]3 and robotic control  . However, most of its applications rely on carefully-crafted, task-specific reward signals to drive exploration and learning, limiting its use in real-life scenarios. In this case, Imitation Learning (IL) methods have been developed to acquire a policy for a certain task based on the corresponding expert demonstrations (e.g., trajectories of state-action pairs) rather than reinforcement signals. However, complex long-horizon tasks can often be broken down and processed as a series of subtasks which can serve as basic skills for completing various compound tasks. In this case, learning a single monolithic policy with IL to represent a structured activity can be challenging. Therefore, Hierarchical Imitation Learning (HIL) has been proposed to recover a two-level policy for a long-horizon task from the demonstrations. Specifically, HIL trains low-level policies (i.e., skills) for accomplishing the specific control for each sub-task, and a high-level policy for scheduling the switching of the skills. Such a hierarchical policy, which is usually formulated with the option framework [ref]6, makes full use of the sub-structure between the parts within the activity and has the potential for better performance. The most state-of-the-art (SOTA) works on HIL   are developed based on Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)  which is a widely-adopted IL algorithm. In , they additionally introduce a directed information 0 term to the GAIL objective function. In this way, their method can enhance the causal relationship between the skill choice and the corresponding state-action sequence to form low-level policies for each subtask, while encouraging the hierarchical policy to generate trajectories similar to the expert ones in distribution through the GAIL objectives. However, they update the high-level and low-level policy on two separate stages. Specifically, the high-level policy is learned with behavioral cloning, which is a supervised IL algorithm and vulnerable to compounding errors 1, and remains fixed during the low-level policy learning with GAIL. Given that the two-level policies are coupled with each other, such a two-staged paradigm potentially leads to sub-optimal solutions. On the other hand, in , they propose to learn a hierarchical policy by option-occupancy measurement matching, that is, imitating the joint distribution of the options, states and actions of the expert demonstrations rather than only matching the state-action distributions like GAIL. However, they overlook the causal relationship between the subtask structure and the policy hierarchy, so the recovered policy may degenerate into a poorly-performed monolithic policy for the whole task, especially when the option annotations of the expert demonstrations are not provided. In this work, we propose a novel HIL algorithm â€“ Hierarchical Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (H-AIRL), which integrates the SOTA IL algorithm Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) 2 with the option framework through an objective based on the directed information.\nCompared with GAIL, AIRL is able to recover the expert reward function along with the expert policy and has more robust and stable performance for challenging robotic tasks 2 3 4. From the algorithm perspective, our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose a practical lower bound of the directed information between the option choice and the corresponding state-action sequences, which can be modeled as a variational posterior and updated in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) 5 framework. This design enables our algorithm to update the high-level and low-level policy at the same time in an end-to-end fashion, which is an improvement compared with . (2) We redefine the AIRL objectives on the extended state and action space, in order to directly recover a hierarchical policy from the demonstrations. (3) We provide an Expectation-Maximization (EM) 6 adaption of our algorithm so that it can be applied to the expert demonstrations without the sub-task annotations (i.e., unsegmented expert data) which are easier to obtain in practice. Further, we provide solid theoretical justification of the three folds mentioned above, and comparisons of our algorithm with SOTA HIL and IL baselines on multiple Mujoco 7 continuous control tasks where our algorithm significantly outperforms the others.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance in a variety of scenarios, such as games  [ref]2 [ref]3 and robotic control  .
