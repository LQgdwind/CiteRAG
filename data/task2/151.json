      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Training of Deep Neural Network Acoustic Models for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Learning has had great impact across a broad variety of areas such as computer vision, natural language processing and automatic speech recognition (ASR) over the past several years. It is also the driving force behind the current Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies that have achieved unprecedented success in a wide spectrum of applications. ASR is one of the first areas that witnessed performance breakthroughs using deep learning techniques [ref]1. Models that employ deep architectures are dominant in today’s ASR systems that are ubiquitous in our everyday life, for instance, Google’s voice search, Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and IBM’s Watson speech-to-text service. On some datasets, the word error rates (WERs) of high-performance ASR can even achieve human parity [ref]3. The high performance of deep learning heavily relies upon large amounts of training data and high computational power. For instance, the amount of training speech data for ASR nowadays can easily reach thousands of hours, is often tens of thousands of hours, and some tasks even utilize as much as one million hours . Moreover, deep neural networks (DNNs) can have tens of millions of parameters or more. Without an appropriate distributed training strategy, training such models with deep architectures using this order of magnitude of data may take months to finish on a single GPU. Therefore, it is critical to investigate strategies that can speed up the training and reduce the turn-around time to an acceptable level. In this context, distributed learning has been demonstrated to be a very effective approach for training speedup. Over the years, various distributed machine learning strategies have been proposed and applied to different tasks. Distributed training of acoustic models as a branch of distributed machine learning has a lot in common with other domains such as computer vision in terms of algorithmic and system design. However, it also has characteristics unique to the ASR domain. Therefore, directly borrowing techniques from other domains may not give the best training performance for ASR. In the speech community, distributed acoustic modeling has been an active research topic. Notable work includes parameter server (PS) based synchronous training , PS based asynchronous training [ref]8 and decentralized asynchronous training . This tutorial will review commonly-used techniques for distributed training of acoustic models. We will first walk through some fundamentals of parallel stochastic gradient descent (SGD), high performance computing (HPC) architectures and deep acoustic modeling which are the foundation of the current large-scale distributed training. We will then present an in-depth investigation of several distributed strategies including synchronous/asynchronous and centralized/decentralized schemes and discuss their pros and cons. In particular, an emphasis is put on the interplay between computation and communication, which is the most important factor to design a successful distributed training strategy. Experiments are carried out on the 2000-hour Switchboard (SWB2000) dataset , one of the most widely-used public benchmark datasets in the speech community [ref]3. We will conclude by analyzing the performance of various strategies. In particular, we will show that the asynchronous decentralized parallel SGD (AD-PSGD) algorithm recently proposed by IBM has achieved one of the best speedup performance to date on this dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: (AI) technologies that have achieved unprecedented success in a wide spectrum of applications.
