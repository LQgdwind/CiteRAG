      "content": "Paper Title: A Secure Federated Data-Driven Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFL as a new strategy for privacy-preserving machine learning, first proposed by McMahan et al. , provides a new machine learning paradigm by training local models separately on different clients and aggregating the updated local models on the server. The technology has gained popularity as it can offer a promising solution to data security and privacy protection. Compared with the traditional machine learning techniques, FL can not only improve the learning efficiency but also solve the problem of data silos and protect local data privacy . Since the raw data does not leave the owner’s local device, FL becomes a popular option for cross-border model training in data-sensitive scenarios, e.g., medical records, personal photo albums, personal voice, and genetic data, just to name a few.\nFL can be categorized into horizontal FL, vertical FL, and hybrid FL [ref]16. Horizontal FL shares feature space but has a different sample space in datasets. By contrast, vertical FL shares the same sample space but different feature spaces. Finally, hybrid FL uses a dataset that has a diverse sample and different feature spaces [ref]16. The most typical FL algorithm is FedAvg , where the server aggregates the clients’ updated models using weighted averaging. Although it is able to preserve data privacy to a certain degree, the basic FL scheme may be vulnerable to various attacks, such as gradient leakage attacks , inference attacks , and data poisoning attacks . An example of data poisoning attack is the pixel-wise backdoor presented in , which results in the canonical example of adversarial and backdoor attacks. To address these issues, researchers have proposed two main categories of privacy-enhancing techniques: encryption methods, such as secure multi-party computation  and homomorphic encryption , and data scrambling methods, such as differential privacy . While encryption methods provide strong data security, they often require intensive computational overhead and may be unpractical for edge devices. By contrast, data perturbation methods, which add random noise to the data to prevent attackers from inferring sensitive information about individuals based on the differences in output , are relatively lightweight. However, they suffer from a trade-off between the model accuracy and privacy preservation. Data-driven evolutionary algorithms  and Bayesian optimization  can effectively tackle complex and resource-intensive problems, which have attracted increased interest, focusing on constructing effective surrogates and surrogate management strategies in the presence of data paucity. However, most of them are designed in a centralized setting, without considering any privacy issues. For example, in 5 6, the generation of more synthetic data to enrich the original training data requires both the decision variables and the rankings of the top 50% solutions in the training data. A surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm based on multi-population 7 and two-stage search 8 is proposed to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation in handling high-dimensional problems. In both algorithms, a local surrogate model is constructed using a number of top-ranked solutions to enhance the exploitation ability. Luo et al. 9 develop a surrogate-assisted data-driven dynamic optimization algorithm and select the best solutions to construct surrogates to improve the efficiency of finding promising solutions in a rapidly changed environment. In , a surrogate-assisted two-stage differential evolution is proposed for expensive constrained optimization, in which a repair strategy is introduced to move the infeasible solutions closer to the feasible region and a clustering strategy of feasible solutions is adopted. In the surrogate-assisted cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm, several sub-populations co-evolve to optimize the architecture of liquid state machines . These algorithms require various types of information in addition to the training data, making them inapplicable to scenarios where the data and the required information are subject to privacy protection.\n There are only a few studies about the federated BO  and federated data-driven evolutionary optimization [ref]10. Federated BO aims to optimize the hyperparameters of a neural network in a federated way by parameterizing the GP model using random Fourier features so that GP models of different clients can be averaged. In addition, Thompson sampling is adopted as the acquisition function with the advantage that its inherent randomness is sufficient to avoid redundant function evaluations when multiple optimization processes are running in parallel, as discussed in .\nHowever, the current scheme can only protect the raw data on the clients with the inherent characteristics of FL. It is susceptible to advanced attacks if no additional privacy-preserving techniques are included in FL. To address this issue, the federated BO in  was extended in , where differential privacy is integrated into federated Thompson sampling. It guarantees user-level privacy by preventing the server from surmising whether a client has been involved in the training or not.\nIn addition, the search space is divided into different regions to handle different parameter vectors and improve the optimization efficiency. However, the divisions of the decision variables increase the number of local sub-regions exponentially, making it harder to extend to medium- or high-dimensional problems. Different from federated Thompson sampling with DP, where the optimization of the acquisition function is conducted on the clients, the optimization of the acquisition function is carried out on the server in several other federated BO [ref]33. The main benefit of optimizing the acquisition function on the server is that the information in the global and local models can be more easily exploited, and the server usually has sufficient computational resources. FDD-EA [ref]10, as the first work to extend data-driven evolutionary algorithm to a federated setting, is meant for privacy-preserving single-objective optimization, which replaces the GP with a radial-basis-function network (RBFN) so that federated averaging can be directly adopted. To estimate the uncertainty of the predictions, the standard deviation between the predictions of the local and global model is employed. FDD-EA is extended to multi-objective optimization in  by obtaining a set of non-dominated solutions using an multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and selecting a subset from these solutions for sampling using k-means. The above-mentioned studies do not consider fairness among clients, which may result in some clients being hesitant to involving in training. To achieve both fairness and efficiency among parties, a modified upper confidence bound acquisition function that accounts for fairness is proposed in [ref]33. However, this work requires each client to send the real objective values of each query point to the server, which is a huge security risk.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: in data-sensitive scenarios, e.g., medical records, personal photo albums, personal voice, and genetic data, just to name a few.\nFL can be categorized into horizontal FL, vertical FL, and hybrid FL [ref]16.
