      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Expert-Level Medical Question Answering with Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTables 4 and 5 summarize Med-PaLM 2 results on MultiMedQA multiple-choice benchmarks. Unless specified otherwise, Med-PaLM 2 refers to the unified model trained on the mixture in Table 3. We also include comparisons to GPT-4 [ref]45 [ref]2. Our unified Med-PaLM 2 model reaches an accuracy of 85.4% using ensemble refinement (ER) as a prompting strategy. Our best result on this dataset is 86.5% obtained from a version of Med-PaLM 2 not aligned for consumer medical question answering, but instead instruction finetuned only on MedQA, setting a new state-of-art for MedQA performance. On MedMCQA, Med-PaLM 2 obtains a score of 72.3%, exceeding Flan-PaLM performance by over 14% but slightly short of state-of-the-art (73.66 from GPT-4-base [ref]45). On PubMedQA, Med-PaLM 2 obtains a score of 75.0%. This is below the state-of-the-art performance (81.0 from BioGPT-Large [ref]15) and is likely because no data was included for this dataset for instruction finetuning. However, after further exploring prompting strategies for PubMedQA on the development set (see LABEL:sec-sup:pubmedqa-extra-prompting), the unified model reached an accuracy of 79.8% with a single run and 81.8% using self-consistency (11x). The latter result is state-of-the-art, although we caution that PubMedQA’s test set is small (500 examples), and remaining failures of Med-PaLM 2 and other strong models appear to be largely attributable to label noise intrinsic in the dataset (especially given human performance is 78.0% ). On MMLU clinical topics, Med-PaLM 2 significantly improves over previously reported results in Med-PaLM  and is the state-of-the-art on 3 out 6 topics, with GPT-4-base reporting better numbers in the other three. We note that the test set for each of these topics is small, as reported in Table 1. Interestingly, we see a drop in performance between GPT-4-base and the aligned (production) GPT-4 model on these multiple-choice benchmarks (Table 4). Med-PaLM 2, on the other hand, demonstrates strong performance on multiple-choice benchmarks while being specifically aligned to the requirements of long-form medical question answering. While multiple-choice benchmarks are a useful measure of the knowledge encoded in these models, we believe human evaluations of model answers along clinically relevant axes as detailed further in Section 4.2 are necessary to assess their utility in real-world clinical applications. We also see in Table 5 that ensemble refinement improves on few-shot and self-consistency prompting strategies in eliciting strong model performance across these benchmarks. Using the methodology described in Section 3.4, overlap percentages ranged from 0.9% for MedQA to 48.0% on MMLU Medical Genetics. Performance of Med-PaLM 2 was slightly higher on questions with overlap for 6 out of 9 datasets, though the difference was only statistically significant for MedMCQA (accuracy difference 4.6%, [1.3, 7.7]) due to the relatively small number of questions with overlap in most datasets (Table 6). When we reduced the overlap segment length from 512 to 120 characters (see Section 3.4), overlap percentages increased (11.15% for MedQA to 56.00% on MMLU Medical Genetics), but performance differences on questions with overlap were similar (LABEL:tab-sup:1), and the difference was still statistically significant for just one dataset. These results are similar to those observed by , who also saw minimal performance difference from testing on overlapping data. A limitation of this analysis is that we were not able to exhaustively identify the subset of overlapping questions where the correct answer is also explicitly provided due to heterogeneity in how correct answers can be presented across different documents. Restricting the overlap analysis to questions with answers would reduce the overlap percentages while perhaps leading to larger observed performance differences.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: 2 results on MultiMedQA multiple-choice benchmarks.
