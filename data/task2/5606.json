      "content": "Paper Title: Transformed Low-Rank Parameterization Can Help Robust Generalization for Tensor Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nT-SVD-based data and function representation.\nThe unique feature of t-SVD-based data representation, in contrast to classical low-rank decomposition methods, is the presence of low-rankness in the transformed domain. This transformed low-rankness is crucial for effectively modeling real multi-channel data with both smoothness and low-rankness [ref]24  . Utilized in t-product layers in DNNs   , t-SVD has also been a workhorse for function representation and achieves impressive empirical performance. While t-SVD-based signal processing models have been extensively studied theoretically  [ref]24    , the t-SVD-based learning model itself has not been thoroughly scrutinized until this paper. Hence, this study represents the first theoretical analysis of t-SVD-based learning models, contributing to the understanding of their theoretical foundations. Theoretical analysis methods. Our analysis draws on norm-based generalization analysis  and implicit regularization of gradient descent-based learning  as related theoretical analysis methods.\nNorm-based generalization analysis plays a crucial role in theoretical analysis across various domains, including standard generalization analysis of DNNs [ref]8, compressed models , non-compressed models , and adversarial generalization analysis   [ref]55.\nOur work extends norm-based tools to analyze both standard and adversarial generalization in t-NNs, going beyond the traditional use of matrix products. For implicit regularization of gradient descent based learning, extensive past research has been conducted on implicit bias of GF for both standard and adversarial training of homogeneous networks building on matrix product layers, respectively 0  .\nWe non-trivially extend these methods to analyze t-NNs and reveals that GF for over-parameterized ReLU t-NNs produces nearly transformed low-rank weights under scale invariant adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical results notably deviate from the standard error bounds for fully connected neural networks (FNNs) in several ways: The generalization bounds in Lemma 3 and Theorem 5 for t-NNs diverge from their counterparts for FNNs in Refs.¬†[ref]8 [ref]55  due to the channel number ùñºùñº{\\sf c} in t-NNs. Moreover, Theorem 5 encompasses a wider range of adversary classes than the lpsubscriptùëôùëùl_{p}-attacks in the aforementioned references. The uniqueness of Theorem 6, compared to Refs.¬†[ref]55 , stems from its consideration of weight low-rankness in the adversarial generalization bound, suggesting possible robustness improvements in generalization. Our exploration of the implicit bias in GF for adversarial training presents a novel angle: the bias towards approximate transformed low-rankness in t-NNs. While Ref.¬† focuses on the implicit bias in adversarial training for FNNs, centered on KKT point convergence with exponential loss, our work delves deeper, considering a wider array of loss functions in adversarial training for t-NNs. A crucial distinction in our adversarial generalization bounds, detailed in Section 4.3, from non-adversarial bounds for FNNs  is the integration of the localized Rademacher complexity. This encompasses the Minkowski difference between adversarial counterparts of both approximately and exactly low-tubal-rank t-NNs as seen in Theorem 12.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: methods, is the presence of low-rankness in the transformed domain.
