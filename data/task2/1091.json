      "content": "Paper Title: Large Scale Legal Text Classification Using Transformer Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the experiments we study the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT and XLNet on the given text\nclassification tasks. BERT is an early, and very popular, transformer model, RoBERTa is a modified version of BERT trained on a larger corpus, DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT and thereby with lower computational cost,\nand finally, XLNet can be fed with larger input token sequences. BERT: BERT [ref]10 is a bidirectional language model which aims to learn contextual relations between words\nusing the transformer architecture . We use an official release of the pre-trained models,\ndetails about the specific hyperparameters are found in Section V-A. The input to BERT is either a single text (a sentence or document), or a text pair.\nThe first token of each sequence is the special classification token [CLS], followed by WordPiece tokens of the first text A, then a separator token [SEP], and (optionally) after that WordPiece tokens for the second text B. In addition to token embeddings, BERT uses positional embeddings to represent the position of tokens in the sequence.\nFor training, BERT applies Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objectives.\nIn MLM, BERT randomly masks 15% of all WordPiece tokens in each sequence and learns to predict these masked tokens.\nFor NSP, BERT is fed in 50% of cases with the actual next sentence B, in the other cases\nwith a random sentence B from the corpus. RoBERTa: RoBERTa, introduced by Liu et al. [ref]11, retrains BERT with an improved methodology, much more data,\nlarger batch size and longer training times. In RoBERTa the training strategy of BERT is modified by removing the NSP objective.\nFurther, RoBERTa uses byte pair encoding (BPE) as a tokenization algorithm instead of WordPiece tokenization in BERT. DistilBERT: We use a distilled version of BERT released by Sanh et al. [ref]12.\nDistilBERT provides a lighter and faster version of BERT, reducing the size of the model by 40% while retaining 97% of its capabilities on language understanding tasks [ref]12.\nThe distillation process includes training a complete BERT model (the teacher) using the improved methodology proposed by Liu et al. [ref]11,\nthen DistilBERT (the student) is trained to reproduce the behaviour of the teacher by using cosine embedding loss. XLNet: The previously discussed transformer-based models are limited to a fixed context length\n(such as 512 tokens), while legal documents are often long and exceed this context length limit.\nXLNet  includes segments recurrence, introduced in Transformer-XL ,\nallowing it to digest longer documents. XLNet follows RoBERTa in removing the NSP objective, while introducing a novel permutation language model objective.\nIn our work with XLNet, we fine-tune the classifier directly without LM fine-tuning\n(as LM fine-tuning of XLNet was computationally not possible on the hardware available for our experiments).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: of BERT trained on a larger corpus, DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT and thereby with lower computational cost,\nand finally, XLNet can be fed with larger input token sequences.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
