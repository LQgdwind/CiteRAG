      "content": "Paper Title: RAFT: A Real-World Few-Shot Text Classification Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFew-shot learning, the capacity to complete a task given a small number of demonstrations , is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence  [ref]17. As researchers, we leverage this capacity when we delegate work on crowdsourcing platforms or give a task with examples to a human research assistant. Brown et al.  show that large pre-trained language models exhibit few-shot learning capabilities for a wide range of natural language tasks.\nIf those capabilities were comparable to people on economically relevant tasks, this would be important to know: a single model could be used across multiple real-world tasks, with low per-task data labeling cost.\nHowever, these models have also been shown to have inconsistent few-shot performance depending on the exact setup and task being solved [e.g. 21, 24].\nThe mixed evidence suggests that it would be valuable to measure and track few-shot performance on a set of tasks that is representative of what appears in practice. Natural language tasks coarsely split into generation, classification, and retrieval. We focus on classification tasks because they support high-quality automated evaluation, cover a wide range of economically valuable tasks, and yet don’t have existing real-world benchmarks. Existing few-shot classification benchmarks are typically designed to highlight areas where models fall short  or to study particular model abilities [ref]5 [ref]37 . The tasks and evaluation setup aren’t optimized to measure progress in applied settings: Tasks that are generated or chosen specifically to test language models may not represent some of the challenges found when applying these models in real-world settings. For example, SuperGLUE  and the few-shot equivalent FewGLUE  mainly include short texts. Doing well on applied tasks sometimes requires reasoning over long texts. Existing systems struggle with long texts due to a limited context window, especially in the few-shot setting where some systems learn from examples presented in context. The evaluation does not closely mirror deployment, and may both under- and overestimate models’ capabilities.\nIt may underestimate model capability by restricting models to the closed-book setting (e.g., no retrieval from online sources) and using uninformative labels (e.g., 0/1 instead of “about literature” vs. “about movies”).\nIt may overestimate model capability by using many more than a few examples for setting hyperparameters during validation . RAFT is a real-world few-shot text classification benchmark designed to measure how much recent and upcoming NLP advances benefit applications: The tasks are naturally occurring tasks. Their labeling is inherently valuable to someone, and they may have challenges that are not reflected in synthetic tasks. Inherent value means that, if it were sufficiently fast and cheap, it would be desirable to outsource the task to human research assistants or crowd workers. Challenges refers to the need for information retrieval, domain expertise, parsing long documents, and making use of instructions. Table 1 shows the real-world challenges presented by RAFT, including 4 datasets with long input texts. The evaluation closely mirrors deployment. For each task, we release a public training set with 50 examples and a larger unlabeled test set111Datasets are at https://raft.elicit.org/datasets. We encourage unsupervised pre-training on the unlabelled examples and open-domain information retrieval. We keep the test-set labels private and provide automated evaluation through a Hugging Face leaderboard222Instructions for submission are at https://raft.elicit.org/submit. In addition to the gold-standard human labels, we collect automatic and crowdsourced baselines. The automatic baselines reveal areas where current techniques struggle, such as reasoning over long texts and tasks with many classes. The crowdsourced baseline reveals that RAFT includes a mix of moderate to difficult tasks. We also observe difficulties in collecting human crowdsourced baselines on some datasets, particularly when domain expertise is important, which suggests that real-world value often depends on domain knowledge. The RAFT datasets and leaderboard can be viewed and submitted to at https://raft.elicit.org.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Few-shot learning, the capacity to complete a task given a small number of demonstrations , is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence  [ref]17.
