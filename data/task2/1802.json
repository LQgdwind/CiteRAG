      "content": "Paper Title: HVPR: Hybrid Voxel-Point Representation for Single-stage 3D Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare in Table 1 our model with the state of the art for LiDAR based 3D detection. We report mAP scores of car and pedestrian classes on the KITTI test dataset [ref]10. All numbers including ours are obtained from an official evaluation server, except for  [ref]42, which are taken from . We classify 3D object detection methods into point-based and voxel-based approaches, according to features used to represent 3D objects. The voxel-based approaches are further categorized into two groups based on whether they exploit 3D voxels explicitly or implicitly in a form of a pseudo image, where our model belongs to the latter one. We mainly compare our model with voxel-based methods, especially with the ones exploiting pseudo image representations. For comparison, we also report results of point-based and other voxel-based approaches. From this table, we observe four things: (1) Our model for the car class gives the best results among voxel-based methods using pseudo images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach to exploiting a hybrid 3D representation and scale-aware features for 3D object detection. (2) Our method is fastest among voxel-based approaches, except PointPillars , while providing competitive results. Although PointPillars is faster than ours (42.4Hz vs. 36.1Hz), it is outperformed by our model by a significant margin in terms of mAP for all difficulty levels. This suggests that our model offers a good compromise in terms of speed and accuracy. (3) The performance improvements over other voxel-based methods using pseudo images are particularly significant in a hard split, where 3D objects are typically small in size and largely occluded. For example, the mAP gain of our model w.r.t the second best method  (73.04 vs. 70.53) is much larger than those for easy and moderate splits of the car class. Also, our model gives the best result among other voxel-based methods using pseudo images on the hard split of the pedestrian class. This confirms that augmenting point-based features provides more discriminative 3D representations, especially for objects taken from sparse point clouds. (4) Our model for the pedestrian class outperforms PointPillars  significantly, while providing a competitive result with the best voxel-based method using pseudo images [ref]23. This shows that our model can generalize to other object classes. Note that our 3D representations from the HVPR network can be easily incorporated into other voxel-based methods   , which may boost the mAP performance.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: We compare in Table 1 our model with the state of the art for LiDAR based 3D detection.
