      "content": "Paper Title: Faster Approximate Covering of Subcurves under the Fréchet Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBuchin, Buchin, Gudmundsson, Löffler and Luo were the first to consider the problem of clustering subtrajectories under the Fréchet distance . They consider the problem of finding a single cluster of subtrajectories with certain qualities, like the number of distinct subtrajectories, or the length of the longest subtrajectory assigned to it. In their paper, they suggested a sweepline approach in the parameter space of the curves and obtain constant-factor approximation algorithms for finding the largest cluster. They also show NP-completeness of the corresponding decision problems. This hardness result extends to (2−ε)2𝜀(2-\\varepsilon)-approximate algorithms. For their 222-approximation algorithm, Buchin et al.  develop an algorithm that finds a legible cluster center among the subcurves of the input curve. Gudmundsson and Wong  present a cubic conditional lower bound for this problem and show that it is tight up to a factor of O​(no​(1))𝑂superscript𝑛𝑜1O(n^{o(1)}), where n𝑛n is the number of vertices. The algorithmic ideas presented in  were implemented and extended by Gudmundsson and Valladares [ref]19 who obtained practical speed ups using GPUs.\nIn a series of papers, these ideas were also applied to the problem of reconstructing road maps from GPS data  .\nIn a similar vain, Buchin, Kilgus and Kölzsch  studied the trajectories of migrating animals and defined so-called group diagrams which are meant to represent the underlying migration patterns in the form of a graph. In their algorithm, to build the group diagram, they repeatedly find the largest cluster and remove it from the data, inspired by the classical greedy set cover algorithm. The above cited works however do not offer theoretical guarantees when used for computing a clustering of subtrajectories, nor do they explicitly formulate a clustering objective.\nAgarwal, Fox, Munagala, Nath, Pan, and Taylor [ref]1 define an objective function for clustering subtrajectories based on the metric facility location problem, which consists of a weighted sum over different quality measures such as the number of centers and the distances between cluster centers and their assigned trajectories. While they show NP-hardness for determining whether an input curve can be covered with respect to the Fréchet distance, they also present a O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n)-approximation algorithm for clustering κ𝜅\\kappa-packed curves (for some constant κ𝜅\\kappa) under the discrete Fréchet distance, where n𝑛n denotes the total complexity of the input. The overall running time of their algorithm is roughly quadratic in n𝑛n, cubic in κ𝜅\\kappa and depends logarithmically on the spread of the vertex coordinates. In our paper, we focus on the clustering formulation previously studied by Akitaya, Chambers, Brüning, and Driemel . They present a pseudo-polynomial algorithm that computes a bi-criterial approximation in the sense of Definition 1.1 with expected running time in O~​(k​(λΔ)2+λΔ​n)~𝑂𝑘superscript𝜆Δ2𝜆Δ𝑛\\tilde{O}(k(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Delta})^{2}+\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Delta}n), where λ𝜆\\lambda denotes the total arclength of the input trajectory. The algorithm finds an (α,β)𝛼𝛽(\\alpha,\\beta)-approximate solution with α∈O​(1)𝛼𝑂1\\alpha\\in O(1) and β∈O​(ℓ2​log⁡(k​ℓ))𝛽𝑂superscriptℓ2𝑘ℓ\\beta\\in O(\\ell^{2}\\log(k\\ell)). It should be noted that in this problem formulation some complexity constraint on the eligible cluster centers is needed to prevent the entire input curve being a cluster center in a trivial clustering.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: is tight up to a factor of O​(no​(1))𝑂superscript𝑛𝑜1O(n^{o(1)}), where n𝑛n is the number of vertices.
