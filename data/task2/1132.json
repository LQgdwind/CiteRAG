      "content": "Paper Title: Diversity-Enriched Option-Critic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven\na set of Markov options ΩΩ\\Omega each with a stochastic termination function defined by Eq. (4) and stochastic intra-option policies, with |Ω|<∞Ω|\\Omega|<\\infty and |𝒜|<∞𝒜|\\mathcal{A}|<\\infty, repeated application of policy-options evaluation and improvement  [ref]2 yields convergence to a locally optimum solution. \n We continue the same assumptions and proofs derived by Bacon et al. , Bacon [ref]2. The termination functions (β𝛽\\beta) and the intra-option policies (πosubscript𝜋𝑜\\pi_{o}) are differentiable in their respective parameters, ν𝜈\\nu and θ𝜃\\theta. Also, the parameters of the termination functions, ν𝜈\\nu, and that of the intra-option policies, θ𝜃\\theta, are independent . We use the TDEOC algorithm with tabular intra-option Q-learning as a template for our proof. An ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy policy over options πΩsubscript𝜋Ω\\pi_{\\Omega} is used. We reuse the notations and terminologies defined by Bacon et al. . The option-value function is defined as: QU:S×Ω×𝒜→ℝ:subscript𝑄𝑈→𝑆Ω𝒜ℝQ_{U}:S\\times\\Omega\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is the value of executing the option in the context of state-option pair. QUsubscript𝑄𝑈Q_{U} is evaluated using the one-step off-policy update defined as: where α𝛼\\alpha is the step size and the update target, δ𝛿\\delta is given by: Now we present the intra-option policy optimization equations for option improvement. The objective to be maximized is the expected discounted return: where θ𝜃\\theta represents the parameters of the intra-option policies. Bacon et al.  have derived the intra-option gradient  [ref]2 for option policy improvement as: where μΩ​(s0,o0)subscript𝜇Ωsubscript𝑠0subscript𝑜0\\mu_{\\Omega}(s_{0},o_{0}) is the discounted weighting of state-option pair along trajectories starting from (s0,o0)subscript𝑠0subscript𝑜0(s_{0},o_{0}). Under assumption: then the sequence {θt}t=0∞superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝜃𝑡𝑡0\\{\\theta_{t}\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty} converges with probability 1 and the limt→∞∂𝒥​(θ)∂θ=0subscript→𝑡𝒥𝜃𝜃0\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{J}(\\theta)}{\\partial\\theta}=0  [ref]2.\nAs for the one-step off-policy intra-option Q learning update in Eq. (7), we can apply the same convergence properties used by Sutton and Barto 2 to show QUsubscript𝑄𝑈Q_{U} converges to optimal behavior, QU∗subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝑈Q^{*}_{U} with probability 1 under the same conditions on sequence of step size as in Eq. (10). To understand it intuitively, the intra-option gradient updates converges intra-option policies to a locally optimum behavior while the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy policy over options, πΩsubscript𝜋Ω\\pi_{\\Omega}, greedily selects the option with the highest value upon termination. Hence, our termination condition still allows policy-option iteration to converge to a locally optimum solution. The rate of convergence, however, may vary depending on the termination function.\nThe termination function during option evaluation is used to evaluate the value function QU​(st,ot,at)subscript𝑄𝑈subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑜𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡Q_{U}(s_{t},o_{t},a_{t}), based on the stochastic likelihood of the current option continuing or terminating at the given state. Upon termination, the option with the highest value at that state is selected for evaluation. The structure of the termination function is irrelevant for evaluating and improving options, and is solely used to define the scope of option’s abstraction. Bacon [ref]2 also derived a proof showing that a fixed termination function leave the convergence properties unaffected. The advantages of our proposed termination objective are mainly empirical. The assumptions |Ω|<∞Ω|\\Omega|<\\infty and |𝒜|<∞𝒜|\\mathcal{A}|<\\infty are required to ensure the intrinsic reward and the termination function are bounded.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: function defined by Eq.
