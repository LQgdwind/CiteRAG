      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph-Based Method for Soccer Action Spotting Using Unsupervised Player Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe objective of video summarization in sports is to highlight key moments from a game, for instance, when a team scores or when fouls are committed. Relevant work on soccer video summarization includes  . In , visual highlights of a soccer match are extracted by calculating importance scores of audio and metadata. In , a soccer match is summarized by using a hierarchical recursive neural network over sequences of event proposals extracted from frames. In , the task of sports video summarization is cast as spotting actions in video sequences, a task similar to action detection. Moreover, they introduced SoccerNet, the largest dataset of soccer matches for video summarization. The authors propose a neural network architecture that extracts visual features from sequences of frames and spots actions by using a NetVlad [ref]2 pooling layer. This architecture was further extended by combining audiovisual modalities [ref]46 and by preserving the temporal context of the pooling layer independently . Another work on the same dataset was presented in [ref]9. They introduce a context-aware loss function along with a deep architecture for video summarization that consists of a feature segmentation and action spotting modules. A closer work to ours was presented in . They model the players in a graph using their estimated location in the soccer pitch using a camera calibration approach . Their architecture fusions the output of a graph neural network  using their previous model [ref]9. Besides having different mechanisms for spotting actions, our graph representation is more robust by classifying the players and calculating their motion vector. Finally,  presents a transformer based architecture that uses as input features from five action recognition methods. In contrast, our approach models the dynamics of the soccer players rather than using global classification features from the frames and it is not as computationally demanding.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: dataset of soccer matches for video summarization.
