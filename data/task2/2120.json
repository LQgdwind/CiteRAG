      "content": "Paper Title: Quantifying and Improving Transferability in Domain Generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGulrajani and Lopez-Paz [ref]20 did extensive experiments on comparing DG algorithms, using the same neural architecture and data split. Specifically, they show that with data augmentation, ERM perform relatively well among a large array of algorithms. Our experiments are based on their settings. We run Algorithm 1 on standard benchmarks, including RotatedMNIST [ref]18, PACS [ref]28, Office-Home  and WILDS-FMoW  (c.f.¬†Section¬†C.1). Specifically, WILDS-FMoW is a large dataset with nearly half a million images. Detailed experimental settings can be seen at Appendix C. From Figure 3 it can be seen that at a neighborhood of the learned classifier, there exists a classifier such that the target accuracy is degraded significantly, whereas some source domain still has high accuracy. This poses questions to whether current popular algorithms such as ERM , DANN  and Mixup   are really learning invariant and transferable features. If so, the target accuracy should be high given a high source accuracy. However, for the PACS dataset and Mixup model (the second column of Figure 3), the target accuracy decreases by more than 30%percent3030\\% while the source accuracy remains roughly at the same level. We can also, e.g., read from the first column that with a small decrease of the source (test) accuracy by ‚àº2%similar-toabsentpercent2\\sim 2\\% (at Œ¥=2ùõø2\\delta=2), the target accuracy of DANN drops by ‚àº10%similar-toabsentpercent10\\sim 10\\%. From Figure 3 we can also see that Correlation Alignment [CORAL, 47] and Spectral Decomposition [SD, 40] have better transferability that other algorithms. In some sense, they are in fact learning robust classifiers, i.e., all the classifiers on the neighborhood of the learned classifier can achieve good accuracies. With this robust classifier, the target accuracy does not decrease much even if the classifier is perturbed. Algorithm¬†2 has good performance among all four datasets that we tried, comparable to CORAL and SD. Note that CORAL and SD do not always perform well, such as in the Office-Home and WILDS-FMoW datasets, but our Transfer algorithm does. However, in our experiments we find there are two limitations of Algorithm 2: (1) we need a large number of inner maximization steps to compute the gap, which needs more training time. This is similar to adversarial robustness  which is slower than usual training. In order to overcome this difficulty we used pretraining from other algorithms in the experiments on Office-Home and WILDS-FMoW; (2) Moderate hyper-parameter tuning is needed. For example, we need to tune NùëÅN is Algorithm 2, the learning rate (lr) of SGA and the choice of Œ¥ùõø\\delta. We find that taking N=20ùëÅ20N=20 or 303030 is usually a good choice, and Œ¥ùõø\\delta can be quite large such that the projection step is not taken. We take lr=0.01lr0.01\\texttt{lr}=0.01 for RotatedMNIST and lr=0.001lr0.001\\texttt{lr}=0.001 for other datasets. In order to show the difference with the well-known ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H}-divergence , we compute the label shifts in the PACS dataset. As shown in Zhao et¬†al. , the optimal joint error œµùíÆ‚Äã(h‚àó)+œµùíÆ‚Äã(h‚àó)subscriptitalic-œµùíÆsuperscript‚Ñésubscriptitalic-œµùíÆsuperscript‚Ñé\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{S}}(h^{*})+\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{S}}(h^{*}) (h‚àósuperscript‚Ñéh^{*} is the optimal classifier that minimizes œµùíÆ‚Äã(h)+œµùíØ‚Äã(h)subscriptitalic-œµùíÆ‚Ñésubscriptitalic-œµùíØ‚Ñé\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{S}}(h)+\\epsilon_{\\mathcal{T}}(h)) can be large under the shift of label distributions. We follow  and compute the label shift between pairs of domains in the PACS dataset, measured by total variation. From Table 1 we can see that the label shift is large in this case, and thus the ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H}-divergence bound  can be quite loose.\nComparably, our transfer measure bound Prop.¬†3 is tighter (c.f.¬†Prop.¬†26) and therefore still useful in practice.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz [ref]20 did extensive experiments on comparing DG algorithms, using the same neural architecture and data split.
