      "content": "Paper Title: MiVOLO: Multi-input Transformer for Age and Gender Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFacial age and gender recognition. Typically, solving the gender task separately is not of great interest in research or business. Therefore, most methods and benchmarks either tackle both age and gender tasks or focus solely on age. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art in most computer vision challenges, although in recent years, there has been a trend to replace them in certain tasks. Levi et al. [ref]26 were the first to use CNNs, evaluating their approach on the Adience dataset , which contains age and gender as classes. The network they implemented is a convolutional model with two fully-connected layers. It achieves an accuracy of 50.7 Â± 5.1 for age.\nWith significant advancements in computer vision neural networks, many methods have been developed, some based on face recognition techniques and models , suggesting the existence of powerful generic models for faces that can be adapted to downstream tasks.\nSome papers  even employ more general models as encoders, such as VGG16 , particularly for ordinal regression approaches in age estimation. Other methods utilize CNN networks for direct classification or regression for age recognition  . As of the writing of this article, the state-of-the-art model on Adience for age classification used the Attention LSTM Networks approach , achieving an accuracy of 67.47. However, they did not employ their model for gender prediction. Recognition using face and body images.\nMost methods for age or gender estimation are based on facial analysis. Some consider the body for age  or gender  recognition, but in very few works [ref]6, joint recognition using both face and body pictures has been utilized. Therefore, it is difficult to find a baseline in open sources to start with.\nOnly a few works exist that utilize full-body images of individuals. The earliest attempt  predates the era of neural networks and employed classical image processing techniques to predict age.\nA more recent study [ref]6 utilized both face and body images together in a single neural network for age and gender prediction. Another paper  employed face and body images with a late fusion approach, but solely for gender prediction. Datasets and benchmarks. Our focus primarily lies on datasets containing both age and gender information. The largest existing dataset for these tasks is IMDB-Wiki 2 4. However, the ground truth answers in this dataset do not appear to be clean. Therefore, we used the cleaned version . Another interesting dataset is UTKFace , which also contains both age and gender information but is much smaller, with only annotations for face crops. The MORPH 1 dataset is also notable for age estimation, although the domain captured in this dataset cannot be considered as representing wild conditions. KANFace  is another large dataset of images and videos that includes gender information. The CACD dataset  is also sizeable and features celebrities from different age groups, making it highly useful, but it does not include gender information.\nThe AgeDB  dataset contains face images of celebrities with age variations ranging from 1 to 101 years old, encompassing two gender groups.\nThe aforementioned datasets above contains age information suitable for regression. \nAdience dataset  contains both age and gender, but age presented as 8 classes.\nFairFace  is a big and well-balanced dataset, where age is categorized into ranges.\nAll these datasets are focused on faces, but for most of it is possible to generate additionally persons information.\nWe are using for training experiments only IMDB-clean and UTKFace as biggest datasets with suitable image domain and annotations.\nThe FairFace, Adience and AgeDB are employed specifically for benchmarking purposes. Visual Transformer Models. For many years, convolutional neural networks have dominated the field of computer vision. However, transformers have been increasingly gaining prominence in various tasks and benchmarks. Transformers are powerful and versatile models, and they are far from reaching their limits. One of the first transformer models applied to computer vision was ViT , which achieved great success and inspired the exploration of many other variants  9. VOLO is also a transformer-based model, but it efficiently combines the worlds of CNNs and Transformers and performs extremely well. We chose the VOLO model because it converges quickly and requires less data in our experience. Additionally, VOLO is one of the fastest transformer-based vision models. Human level for age estimation.\nIn , a comparison was made between the mean absolute error (MAE) of human and machine age estimation. The study examined the FG-NET dataset and the Pinellas County Sheriffâs Office (PCSO) dataset (currently unavailable). The authors found that the human MAE on the FG-NET dataset [ref]1 was 4.7, while on the PCSO dataset it was 7.2. For the machine results, they obtained 4.6 and 5.1, respectively. They also claimed that their algorithm performed worse than humans in the age range â absent015\\in  years. The authors noted that this age range is not present in the FG-NET dataset [ref]1, which caused the observed difference. When excluding this range, the estimated human MAE for FG-NET is also very close - 7.4. Eventually, the authors concluded that their model is more accurate than humans.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: neural networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art in most computer vision challenges, although in recent years, there has been a trend to replace them in certain tasks.
