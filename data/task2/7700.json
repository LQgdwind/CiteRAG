Given two mm-spaces M=(X,d,μ)𝑀𝑋𝑑𝜇M=(X,d,\\mu) and M′=(X′,d′,μ′)superscript𝑀′superscript𝑋′superscript𝑑′superscript𝜇′M^{\\prime}=(X^{\\prime},d^{\\prime},\\mu^{\\prime}) and a coupling π∈Π​(μ,μ′)𝜋Π𝜇superscript𝜇′\\pi\\in\\Pi(\\mu,\\mu^{\\prime}) and p∈[1,∞)𝑝1p\\in[1,\\infty), we introduce the p𝑝p-distortion dispGW​(π)superscriptsubscriptdis𝑝GW𝜋\\mathrm{dis}_{p}^{\\mathrm{GW}}(\\pi): By taking the infimum over all feasible couplings, we obtain the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) p𝑝p-distance between M𝑀M and M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime}: This quantity is finite if we work in the space of mm-spaces whose distance functions have finite p𝑝p-th moment; let us make the simplifying convention that we always work with bounded mm-spaces, in order to avoid this technical issue. The GW-distance induces a pseudo-metric on the space of mm-spaces  , such that dGW,p​(M,M′)=0subscript𝑑GW𝑝𝑀superscript𝑀′0d_{\\mathrm{GW},p}(M,M^{\\prime})=0 if and only if there is a measure-preserving isometry from M𝑀M to M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime}. For our purposes, we relax the requirement on the function d:X×X→ℝ:𝑑→𝑋𝑋ℝd:X\\times X\\to\\mathbb{R} to be a metric and instead allow any symmetric, measurable and bounded function k∈Lsymp​(X×X)𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑝sym𝑋𝑋k\\in L^{p}_{\\mathrm{sym}}(X\\times X). Then, the structure M=(X,k,μ)𝑀𝑋𝑘𝜇M=(X,k,\\mu) is instead referred to as a gauged measure space  or a measure network [ref]10 (in fact, the definition of a measure network in [ref]10 even drops the symmetry condition). This allows us to consider pairwise relations on X𝑋X to be modelled by a wider class of functions, such as affinity kernels. In this case, the space (ℳ,dGW,p)ℳsubscript𝑑GW𝑝(\\mathcal{M},d_{\\mathrm{GW},p}) of equivalence classes of measure networks (under the equivalence relation M∼M′⇔dGW,p​(M,M′)=0⇔similar-to𝑀superscript𝑀′subscript𝑑GW𝑝𝑀superscript𝑀′0M\\sim M^{\\prime}\\Leftrightarrow d_{\\mathrm{GW},p}(M,M^{\\prime})=0) is a complete, geodesic, metric space  [ref]10. Recently, a GW-like distance has been developed for comparing hypergraph structures , based on ideas from the co-optimal transport problem introduced in [ref]45. Recall that a hypergraph is defined by a pair H=(V,E)𝐻𝑉𝐸H=(V,E), where V𝑉V is a finite set of vertices and E𝐸E is a set of hyperedges; each e∈E𝑒𝐸e\\in E is a subset of V𝑉V. A general structure which encompasses the notion of a hypergraph is a measure hypernetwork, which is a quintuple H=(X,μ,Y,ν,ω)𝐻𝑋𝜇𝑌𝜈𝜔H=(X,\\mu,Y,\\nu,\\omega), where (X,μ)𝑋𝜇(X,\\mu) and (Y,ν)𝑌𝜈(Y,\\nu) are respectively Polish spaces with fully supported Borel probability measures, and ω𝜔\\omega is a non-negative, measurable and bounded function ω:X×Y→ℝ:𝜔→𝑋𝑌ℝ\\omega:X\\times Y\\to\\mathbb{R}. Indeed, from a hypergraph (V,E)𝑉𝐸(V,E), one obtains a measure network (V,μ,E,ν,ω)𝑉𝜇𝐸𝜈𝜔(V,\\mu,E,\\nu,\\omega), where μ𝜇\\mu and ν𝜈\\nu are uniform probability measures and ω:V×E→ℝ:𝜔→𝑉𝐸ℝ\\omega:V\\times E\\to\\mathbb{R} is a binary incidence function (ω​(v,e)=1⇔v∈e⇔𝜔𝑣𝑒1𝑣𝑒\\omega(v,e)=1\\Leftrightarrow v\\in e). Given two measure hypernetworks H=(X,μ,Y,ν,ω)𝐻𝑋𝜇𝑌𝜈𝜔H=(X,\\mu,Y,\\nu,\\omega) and H′=(X′,μ′,Y′,ν′,ω′)superscript𝐻′superscript𝑋′superscript𝜇′superscript𝑌′superscript𝜈′superscript𝜔′H^{\\prime}=(X^{\\prime},\\mu^{\\prime},Y^{\\prime},\\nu^{\\prime},\\omega^{\\prime}), the p𝑝p-co-optimal distortion for a pair of couplings (πv,πe)∈Π​(μ,μ′)×Π​(ν,ν′)superscript𝜋𝑣superscript𝜋𝑒Π𝜇superscript𝜇′Π𝜈superscript𝜈′(\\pi^{v},\\pi^{e})\\in\\Pi(\\mu,\\mu^{\\prime})\\times\\Pi(\\nu,\\nu^{\\prime}) (the notation here is intended to evoke the idea that πvsuperscript𝜋𝑣\\pi^{v} is a coupling of vertices and πesuperscript𝜋𝑒\\pi^{e} is a coupling of hyperedges) is defined to be Similarly to the GW distance, the hypernetwork p𝑝p-co-optimal transport distance is given by The expression dCOOT,p​(H,H′)subscript𝑑COOT𝑝𝐻superscript𝐻′d_{\\mathrm{COOT},p}(H,H^{\\prime}) defines a pseudo-metric on the space of measure hypernetworks, and induces a metric on the space of equivalence classes of measure hypernetworks up to isomorphism, which is also shown to be geodesic and complete in [11, Theorem 1].\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: k∈Lsymp​(X×X)𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝐿𝑝sym𝑋𝑋k\\in L^{p}_{\\mathrm{sym}}(X\\times X).
