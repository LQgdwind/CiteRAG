      "content": "Paper Title: Active Generation for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe rapid advancements in deep learning, propelled by extensive training data and automated feature engineering, have brought significant breakthroughs in computer vision tasks, including image recognition   , object detection   , and semantic segmentation   . Despite these achievements, the manual collection of large-scale labeled datasets remains a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Furthermore, concerns related to data privacy and usage rights have introduced additional hurdles in the acquisition of such datasets. Recently, deep generative models [ref]21 [ref]35  have made remarkable strides, driven by increased model capacity and access to larger datasets. These advancements have enabled the generation of high-fidelity images that correspond to specific conditions, such as text descriptions or predefined classes. Consequently, researchers have explored the use of synthetic data generated by these models in image classification and few-shot image classification tasks  [ref]1 . However, despite their potential, these approaches often yield only marginal improvements over baseline models trained solely on real data. The primary drawback lies in their voracious appetite for synthetic images, resulting in substantial computational costs and energy consumption111Stable diffusion V2 [ref]35 costs about 333 seconds and 161616 TMACs to generate a 512×512512512512\\times 512 image on a V100 GPU.. For instance, [ref]1 reported a mere 1.78% increase in accuracy in ImageNet classification, achieved by augmenting the real dataset with an equivalent number of 1.2 million synthetic images. This stark trade-off between computational resources and performance improvement raises a critical challenge in the application of synthetic data for image classification. In this paper, we assert that the inefficiency of existing methods arises from the unrestricted generation of images, resulting in a significant proportion of redundant images when compared to the target dataset. Therefore, we advocate a shift towards a more precise approach — prioritizing the generation of images specifically demanded by the model to enhance its performance on the target dataset. Our approach incorporates active learning  as a central tenet. By partitioning a validation set from the training data, we utilize these validation samples to continuously assess the model’s performance throughout training. When the model misclassifies validation images, it acts as a signal, pinpointing areas where the model lacks proficiency. To bolster validation accuracy, we strategically augment the misclassified images, enabling the model to specifically address these challenging cases. This active learning strategy ensures that the model focuses on refining its performance in areas crucial for optimal results on the target dataset. To augment misclassified images while preserving their inherent characteristics and infusing diverse scenes, we introduce an innovative approach dubbed attentive image guidance. This method leverages real images to guide the diffusion generation process. At each timestep within the DDPM sampler [ref]21, it interpolates the generated latent feature with the latent feature of a real image, producing a novel latent feature that encapsulates the desired characteristics. Furthermore, we harness the attentions within the cross-attention layer to precisely locate the foreground instance. These attentions are then employed as masks, restricting interpolations to the foreground areas. This targeted approach not only maintains the integrity of the instance but also facilitates the generation of diverse background scenes. In addition, to enhance the diversity of generated images and exert more complex control over the generation process, we introduce a gradient-based generation guidance mechanism. Unlike direct feature interpolation, this method enables us to achieve more nuanced control over the generation process. The mechanism involves backpropagating losses computed on the generated latents to the input text embedding, which serves as a critical conditional signal to steer text-to-image diffusion models. By updating the embedding. We apply two key types of losses to refine the text embedding: (1) Contrastive loss: This loss quantifies the distances between the current latent feature and the latent features of previously generated images. It acts as a regularizer, preventing the current image from closely resembling previous ones, thereby reducing redundancy. (2) Classification loss: The loss seeks to maximize the prediction loss of the current classification model. This approach challenges the diffusion model to generate images that are more difficult to classify, enhancing the overall quality of generated content. In summary, our contributions can be categorized into three key areas: We introduce an inventive approach to generate images from misclassified validation data during training, coupled with an attentive image guidance mechanism. This strategy enhances the practicality of generated images by aligning them with the model’s evolving needs throughout the training process. To further diversify synthetic images and gain finer control over the generation process, we present a gradient-based guidance mechanism. This mechanism refines the text embedding through two essential losses for generating a wider variety of images and elevating the classification difficulty. We conduct extensive experiments across various image classification settings to showcase the effectiveness of ActGen. For instance, on ImageNet classification, compared to previous work [ref]1, ActGen utilizes only 10% (0.13 million) of the synthetic images, while achieving a notable 2.26% accuracy improvement on ResNet-50 over the baseline.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: and time-consuming endeavor.
