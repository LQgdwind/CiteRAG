      "content": "Paper Title: LTC-SUM: Lightweight Client-driven Personalized Video Summarization Framework Using 2D CNN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis subsection compares the performance of the proposed LTC-SUM video summarization method with the baseline schemes described in Section 4.1.3. The performance evaluation experiments used ten different events to analyze the proposed LTC-SUM and baseline approaches. The list of events is described in Section 4.1.2. All the detected T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums for the proposed LTC-SUM method and frames for the FB-SUM baseline method are included in the summarization process for which the detection accuracy was higher than 95% for western, 65% for action, 80% for cricket sports, and 90% for soccer sports videos555The threshold value directly impacts the duration of the generated summary. If a low threshold is selected, then a lengthy summary will be generated.. The threshold of each video genre was selected to maintain the length of the summaries. The default parameters were used for the remaining baseline methods. The computation time (in minutes) required to generate a video summary using the baseline and the proposed approaches were compared in the first experiment, where all approaches were configured on the HCR device (refer to Table II for detailed specifications of the device). The steps involved in calculating the computation time are (i) frame extraction from the video (FB-SUM baseline) and T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums extraction from T​h​u​C​o​n𝑇ℎ𝑢𝐶𝑜𝑛ThuCons (proposed); (ii) event(s) recognition using the lightweight trained 2D CNN model from frames (FB-SUM baseline) and T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums (proposed); (iii) determining and downloading S​e​g𝑆𝑒𝑔Seg; (iv) and finally, aggregate S​e​g𝑆𝑒𝑔Seg into a single continuous video stream. Meanwhile, default configurations and steps are used for HECATE  [ref]7, DR-DSN  , VASNet  , and AC-SUM- GAN   baseline approaches to generate summaries. Compared with the number of frames, the number of lightweight thumbnail images was significantly smaller (Table III). Thus, the overall computation time of the proposed LTC-SUM method is significantly lower than that of the FB-SUM baseline approach. Table V shows the computation time in minutes required to generate a summary using baseline methods, on the HCR device. Extracting frames from the video and using all the extracted frames to generate a summary are the key factors in increasing the overall computation time while using the baseline methods. Because this study focused on generating summaries resource-constrained on client end devices, in the next experiment, the proposed LTC-SUM method is configured on the LCR device (i.e., the Nvidia Jetson TX2). Table VI lists the computation time required in minutes on every step to generate a summary using the FB-SUM baseline method on the HCR device and proposed LTC-SUM method on the HCR and LCR devices. Table VII depicts the duration of summaries generated automatically to detected frames/T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums for the corresponding video using FB-SUM and LTC-SUM methods on the LCR device. From Table VI, it can be observed that the computation time for FB-SUM is significantly higher than that for LTC-SUM. In addition, it can also be observed from Table V that even when the proposed technique is implemented on the LCR device, the computation time is still significantly shorter than that of FB-SUM and HECATE  [ref]7 baseline approaches implemented on the HCR device. Considering that the combined duration of all videos was 1,974 min, HECATE  [ref]7, DR-DSN  , VASNet  , AC-SUM-GAN  , and FB-SUM baseline approaches took 595.789 min, 107.28 min, 105.96 min, 104.34 min and 1536.09 min using the computational resources of the HCR device to generate the 18 summaries for each video as shown in Table V, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed approach on HCR took 43.82 min to generate the 18 summaries for each video. Thus, based on the analysis of these 18 videos, computationally for the HCR device, on average, the proposed approach is 13.59, 2.45, 2.42, and 2.38 times faster than HECATE  [ref]7, DR-DSN  , VASNet  , and AC-SUM-GAN  , respectively. The computational resources of the LCR device are very low compared to the HCR device, even when the proposed method is 3.57 HECATE  [ref]7; and the 9.2 FB-SUM method is faster than the baseline approaches on the LCR device. In conclusion, these results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient even for an LCR device. Note that the proposed approach is also efficient in terms of communication and storage compared to the baseline approaches. As in the baseline approaches, the complete video needs to be downloaded and stored. In the proposed approach, only the T​h​u​C​o​n𝑇ℎ𝑢𝐶𝑜𝑛ThuCons are downloaded and stored. Thus, compared with the complete video, the download time and storage requirements for T​h​u​C​o​n𝑇ℎ𝑢𝐶𝑜𝑛ThuCons are significantly less. For example, the size of the movie 89 (2017) is approximately 612 MB, while the size of the T​h​u​C​o​n𝑇ℎ𝑢𝐶𝑜𝑛ThuCons of the corresponding movie is just approximately 14 MB. In addition, DR-DSN  , VASNet  , AC-SUM-GAN  , and FB-SUM baseline approaches need to store the original video along with the extracted frames during the summarization process. By comparing number of T​h​u​m𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑚Thums with number of frames in a video, the number of frames is very large. Thus, significant local storage is needed for the baseline approaches. Therefore, in addition to achiving the computational efficiency, the proposed LTC-SUM method is also efficient in terms of storage and communication requirements for the summarization process. From Tables V-VII, it can be concluded that the proposed approach is significantly better than the baseline approaches in terms of low computational complexity and processing time for long-form videos. This superiority exists even when the proposed approach is configured on a significantly LCR device (Nvidia Jetson TX2). Interestingly, the duration of the summaries generated using the proposed approach was much smaller than the duration of the summaries generated using FB-SUM baseline approach (refer to Table VII). It is intuitive to ask what the impact of the significant reduction in computational time and the small duration of video summaries has on the quality of the summary. In the following section, the results of a comprehensive qualitative survey are presented to answer this question.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: (iii) determining and downloading S​e​g𝑆𝑒𝑔Seg; (iv) and finally, aggregate S​e​g𝑆𝑒𝑔Seg into a single continuous video stream.
