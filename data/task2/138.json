      "content": "Paper Title: PUGeo-Net: A Geometry-centric Network for 3D Point Cloud Upsampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOptimization based methods. Alexa et al.  interpolated points of Voronoi diagram, which is computed in the local tangent space. Lipman et al. developed a method based on locally optimal projection operator (LOP) . It is a parametrization-free method for point resampling and surface reconstruction. Subsequently, the improved weighted LOP and continuous LOP were developed by Huang et al.  and Preiner et al.  respectively. These methods assume that points are sampling from smooth surfaces, which degrades upsampling quality towards sharp edges and corners. Huang et al. [ref]23 presented an edge-aware (EAR) approach which can effectively preserve the sharp features. With given normal information, EAR algorithm first resamples points away from edges, then progressively upsamples points to approach the edge singularities. However, the performance of EAR heavily depends on the given normal information and parameter tuning. In conclusion, point cloud upsampling methods based on geometric priors either assume insufficient hypotheses or require additional attributes. Deep learning based methods. The deep learning based upsampling methods first extract point-wise feature via point clouds CNN. The lack of point order and regular structure impede the extension of powerful CNN to point clouds. Instead of converting point clouds to other data representations like volumetric grids [ref]28, , [ref]30 or graphs , , recently the point-wise 3D CNN , , , ,  successfully achieved state-of-the-art performance for various tasks. Yu et al. pioneered PU-Net, the first deep learning algorithm for point cloud upsampling. It adopts PointNet++  to extract point features and expands features by multi-branch MLPs. It optimizes a joint reconstruction and repulsion loss function to generate point clouds with uniform density. PU-Net surpasses the previous optimization based approaches for point cloud upsampling.\nHowever, as it does not consider the spatial relations among the points, there is no guarantee that the generated samples are uniform. The follow-up work, EC-Net , adopts a joint loss of\npoint-to-edge distance, which can effectively preserve sharp edges. EC-Net requires labelling the training data with annotated edge and surface information, which is tedious to obtain.\nWang et al.  proposed a patch-based progressive upsampling method (MPU). Their method can successfully apply to large upsampling factor, say 16×\\times. Inspired by the image super-resolution techniques, they trained a cascade of upsampling networks to progressively upsample to the desired factor, with the subnet only deals with 2×\\times case. MPU replicates the point-wise features and separates them by appending a 1D code {−1,1}11\\{-1,1\\}, which does not consider the local geometry. MPU requires a careful step-by-step training, which is not flexible and fails to gain a large upsampling factor model directly.\nSince each subnet upsizes the model by a factor 2, MPU only works for upsampling factor which is a power of 2. PUGeo-Net distinguishes itself from the other deep learning method from its geometry-centric nature. See Sec. 4 for quantitative comparisons and detailed discussions. Recently, Li et al.  proposed PU-GAN which introduces an adversarial framework to train the upsampling generator. Again, PU-GAN fails to examine the geometry properties of point clouds. Their ablation studies also verify the performance improvement mainly comes from the introducing of the discriminator.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: by Huang et al.  and Preiner et al.  respectively. These methods assume that points are sampling from smooth surfaces, which degrades upsampling quality towards sharp edges and corners. Huang et al.
