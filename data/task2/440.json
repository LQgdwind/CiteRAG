      "content": "Paper Title: BiERU: Bidirectional Emotional Recurrent Unit for Conversational Sentiment Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSentiment analysis and emotion recognition are of vital importance in dialogue systems and have recently gained increasing attention [ref]1. They can be applied to a lot of scenarios such as mining the opinions of speakers in conversations and improving the feedback of robot agents. Moreover, sentiment analysis in live conversations can be used in generating talks with certain sentiments to improve human-machine interaction. Existing approaches to conversational sentiment analysis can be divided into party-dependent approaches, like DialogueRNN [ref]2, and party-ignorant approaches, such as AGHMN . Party-dependent methods distinguish different parties in a conversation while party-ignorant methods do not. Both party-dependent and party-ignorant models are not limited to dyadic conversations. Nevertheless, party-ignorant models can be easily applied to multi-party scenarios without any adjustment. In this paper, we propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework based on the emotional recurrent unit (ERU), a recurrent neural network that contains a generalized neural tensor block (GNTB) and a two-channel feature extractor (TFE) to tackle conversational sentiment analysis.\nNevertheless, party-ignorant models can be easily applied to multi-party scenarios without any adjustment. In this paper, we propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework based on emotional recurrent unit (ERU), a recurrent neural network that contains a generalized neural tensor block (GNTB) and a two-channel feature extractor (TFE) to tackle conversational sentiment analysis. Context information is the main difference between dialogue sentiment analysis and single sentence sentiment analysis tasks. It sometimes enhances, weakens, or reverses the raw sentiment of an utterance (Fig. 1). There are three main steps for sentiment analysis in a conversation: obtaining the context information, capturing the influence of the context information for an utterance, and extracting emotional features for classification. Existing dialogue sentiment analysis methods like c-LSTM , CMN [ref]5, DialogueRNN [ref]2, and DialogueGCN  make use of complicated deep neural network structures to capture context information and describe the influence of context information for an utterance. We redefine the formulation of conversational sentiment analysis and provide a compact structure to better encode the context information, capture the influence of context information for an utterance, and extract features for sentiment classification. According to Mitchell and Lapata , the meaning of a complete sentence must be explained in terms of the meanings of its subsentential parts, including those of its singular elements. Compositionality allows language to construct complicated meanings from its simpler terms. This property is often expressed in a manner of principle: the meaning of a whole is a function of the meaning of the components . For conversation, the context of an utterance is composed of its historical utterances information. Similarly, context is a function of the meaning of its historical utterances. Therefore, inspired by the composition function in , we design GNTB to perform context compositionality in conversation, which obtains context information and incorporates the context into utterance representation simultaneously, then employ TFE to extract emotional features. In this case, we convert the previous three-step task into a two-step task. Meanwhile, the compact structure reduces the computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is the first to perform context compositionality in conversational sentiment analysis. The GNTB takes the context and current utterance as inputs and is capable of modeling conversations with arbitrary turns. It outputs a new representation of current utterance with context information incorporated (named ‘contextual utterance vector’ in this paper). Then, the contextual utterance vector is further fed into TFE to extract emotional features. Here, we employ a simple two-channel model for emotion feature extraction. The long short-term memory (LSTM) unit  and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN)  are utilized for extracting features from the contextual utterance vector. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters. To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: We propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework based on ERU. We design GNTB which is suitable for different structures, to perform context compositionality. Experiments on three standard benchmarks indicate that our model outperforms the state of the art with fewer parameters. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: related work is introduced in Section II; the mechanism of our model is explained in Section III; results of the experiments are discussed in Section IV; finally, concluding remarks are provided in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition are of vital importance in dialogue systems and have recently gained increasing attention [ref]1.
