      "content": "Paper Title: An Alternative to Variance: Gini Deviation for Risk-averse Policy Gradient\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe demand for avoiding risks in practical applications has inspired risk-averse reinforcement learning (RARL). For example, we want to avoid collisions in autonomous driving , or avoid huge financial losses in portfolio management . In addition to conventional RL, which finds policies to maximize the expected return , RARL also considers the control of risk. Many risk measures have been studied for RARL, for instance, exponential utility functions , value at risk (VaR) [ref]5, conditional value at risk (CVaR)  , and variance  . In this paper, we mainly focus on the variance-related risk measures given their popularity, as variance has advantages in interpretability and computation 0 1. Such a paradigm is referred to as mean-variance RL. Traditional mean-variance RL methods consider the variance of the total return random variable. Usually, the total return variance is treated as a constraint to the RL problem, i.e., it is lower than some threshold   2. Recently, 3 proposed a reward-volatility risk measure, which considers the variance of the per-step reward random variable. 3 shows that the per-step reward variance is an upper bound of the total return variance and can better capture the short-term risk. 4 further simplifies 3’s method by introducing Fenchel duality. Directly optimizing total return variance is challenging. It either necessitates double sampling  or calls for other techniques to avoid double sampling for faster learning   2. As for the reward-volatility risk measure, 3 uses a complicated trust region optimization due to the modified reward’s policy-dependent issue. 4 overcomes this issue by modifying the reward according to Fenchel duality. However, this reward modification strategy can possibly hinder policy learning by changing a “good” reward to a “bad” one, which we discuss in detail in this work. To overcome the limitations of variance-based risk measures, we propose to use a new risk measure: Gini deviation (GD). We first review the background of mean-variance RL. Particularly, we explain the limitations of both total return variance and per-step reward variance risk measures. We then introduce GD as a dispersion measure for random variables and highlight its properties for utilizing it as a risk measure in policy gradient methods. Since computing the gradient using the original definition of GD is challenging, we derive the policy gradient algorithm from its quantile representation to minimize it. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in overcoming the limitations of variance-based risk measures, we modify several domains (Guarded Maze , Lunar Lander 5, Mujoco 6) where risk-aversion can be clearly verified. We show that our method can learn risk-averse policy with high return and low risk in terms of variance and GD, when others fail to learn a reasonable policy.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: policies to maximize the expected return , RARL also considers the control of risk.
