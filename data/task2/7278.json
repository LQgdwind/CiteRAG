      "content": "Paper Title: Zoom-shot: Fast and Efficient Unsupervised Zero-Shot Transfer of CLIP to Vision Encoders with Multimodal Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCLIP [ref]34 marked a milestone in vision-language models. Since its inception, various methods have surpassed its zero-shot accuracy through scaling data and compute [ref]40  [ref]48 . Other methods have focused on improving efficiency while maintaining performance    . Our approach, Zoom-shot, aims to address both ends of this spectrum, by retaining performance with both small (e.g., MobileNetV3 ) and enhancing performance with larger vision encoders like DINOv2 . CLIP also demonstrated a path forward for multimodal models by establishing a joint latent space across modalities, which subsequent works expanded upon   . This latent space has led to novel applications like zero-shot image generation   . However, there are recently identified limitations, such as the modality gap present between CLIP’s text and image features, as a result of local minimas in its training objective  . Despite this, the CLIP’s latent space may still contain untapped potential. Our focus involves transferring information from the CLIP latent space to pre-trained vision encoders, enabling them to leverage CLIP’s zero-shot capabilities without retraining the encoders. Many different works have made progress on similar tasks, although with differing end goals to our own. For instance, LiT  aimed to improve the efficiency of training VLMs by contrastively fine-tuning a pre-trained text model to a pre-trained vision encoder. While an improvement over CLIP training from scratch, it still requires significant computational resources and data as it fine-tunes the whole encoder model. In a similar work, Merullo et al.   align pre-trained vision encoders to pre-trained language models using only linear mapping. While this could hypothetically be used to create a CLIP-like VLM, they only use it to investigate the representations within language models (i.e. mapping from image features into the text latent space). The work of Khan and Fu  aims to address the shortcomings suffered by LiT by focusing on aligning only approximately 7% of the model parameters. Although it reduces training parameters, it still requires large training data. In addition, all these works use contrastive learning which requires paired image and text data. Our method does not need paired data and requires a much smaller amount of data to train. This is due to leveraging the multimodal information encoded in the CLIP latent space. Different from the above works, Moayeri et al.  with their proposed Linear Aligner (LA), showed that a pre-trained vision encoder can be directly aligned to CLIP’s latent space using only a linear mapping trained with unlabeled image data. To our knowledge, LA was the first method to show that it is possible to align a pre-trained vision encoder with CLIP’s latent space, effectively augmenting the vision encoder with the VLM capabilities of CLIP, without the need for paired data.\nUnfortunately, they only map the vision encoder, neglecting the language component and the fundamental interaction between these two modalities. Our approach, Zoom-shot, capitalizes on this interaction, leading to remarkable improvements in performance and training efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: CLIP [ref]34 marked a milestone in vision-language models.
