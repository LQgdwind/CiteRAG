      "content": "Paper Title: Overcoming Reward Overoptimization via Adversarial Policy Optimization with Lightweight Uncertainty Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is proven to be effective for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences 5 . RLHF typically involves three main steps: 1) Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) of a pretrained LLM using high-quality data, 2) Reward Modelling to capture human preferences that the LLM should follow, and 3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) based policy optimization (e.g., PPO ) where a policy initialized from the SFT model is further improved, guided by the reward model as a proxy for human feedback. However, a critical issue arises in this process: the reward model, built from a finite dataset of human preferences, often fails to accurately represent the underlying human preference. This approximation error, worsened by the distribution shifts during policy updates , leads to unreliable rewards during the RL stage.\nThis directly causes the phenomenon of ‘reward over-optimization’, wherein the LLM exploits erroneous high-reward states, artificially inflating the estimated proxy reward, while the ground-truth reward decreases  [ref]9 [ref]11.\nThis misalignment leads LLMs to prioritize reward maximization over actual content quality and user alignment, as seen in phenomena like ‘length bias’, where longer responses are erroneously favoured regardless of their relevance . Current mitigation strategies against reward over-optimization, as proposed in [ref]9 [ref]11, focus on penalizing samples with high reward uncertainty during RL-based policy training. These approaches utilize ensembles of different reward models trained with different seeds, either during pre-training or fine-tuning phases, and leverage the variance in estimated rewards across ensembles to quantify uncertainty. Nevertheless, while in theory, these uncertainty estimates can identify unreliable rewards, the computational cost associated with training and maintaining multiple reward models in memory during policy optimization makes them impractical in real-world settings.\nWhat is worse, this computational constraint also hinders achieving the maximum performance potential, given that the “scaling laws” generally advocate for larger reward models  . Our work builds upon the recent advancements in understanding the representation learning abilities in LLMs, particularly the last layer of a neural network. Numerous previous studies have shown that the last layer contains crucial information about the network’s prediction deviation from original training data    .\nInspired by these findings, we begin by inspecting lightweight uncertainty estimation methods in reward modelling, relying solely on the last layer embedding of the reward model.\nSubsequently, we propose Adversarial Policy Optimization (AdvPO), addressing overoptimization by solving a distributionally robust optimization problem centred around the reward model’s prediction confidence interval for policy improvement.\nThis approach has proven to be a less conservative strategy for leveraging uncertainty in policy optimization compared to the utilization of uncertainty in previous work addressing overoptimization [ref]9 [ref]11.\nIn a variety of experiments, we show how AdvPO  effectively mitigates reward over-optimization without the computational burden as in the ensemble-based methods.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that AdvPO results in an improved policy overall, as evaluated through human-assisted assessments. Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of last-layer embeddings, combined with off-the-shelf uncertainty estimation methods, in signalling over-optimization. We compare these against ensembles of comparable size and illustrate the advantage of our lightweight approach. Secondly, we introduce Adversarial Policy Optimization algorithm (AdvPO) that adversarially searches around the reward model’s prediction confidence interval for policy optimization. We show that AdvPO is less conservative compared to previous work addressing over-optimization [ref]9 [ref]11. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate that AdvPO effectively addresses the reward overoptimization issue on the Anthropic HH  and TL;DR summarization  datasets. We further validate the learnt LLMs through human-assisted evaluations by comparing AdvPO against existing methods incorporating uncertainty and standard PPO, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: the phenomenon of ‘reward over-optimization’, wherein the LLM exploits erroneous high-reward states, artificially inflating the estimated proxy reward, while the ground-truth reward decreases  [ref]9 [ref]11.\nThis misalignment leads LLMs to prioritize reward maximization over actual content quality and user alignment, as seen in phenomena like ‘length bias’, where longer responses are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
