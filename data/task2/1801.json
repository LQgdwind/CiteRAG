      "content": "Paper Title: HVPR: Hybrid Voxel-Point Representation for Single-stage 3D Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our model on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark [ref]10. The KITTI dataset provides 7,481 training and 7,518 test samples for object classes of cars, pedestrians and cyclists. Object instances across different classes are further classified into easy, moderate and hard splits, depending on the object size, the degree of occlusion and the maximum truncation level. We evaluate our model on the car and the pedestrian classes, most commonly used object class and the hardest one for 3D object detection, respectively. Following [ref]23, we split the training set into two splits with the ratio of around 5:1 to train our model for testing via an official evaluation server. For other experiments including an ablation study, we follow the experimental protocol in  , and split the original training set of 7,481 samples into 3,712 and 3,769 ones for training and validation, respectively. We report the mean average precision (mAP) on both validation and test splits with 40 recall positions on a PR curve [ref]10. At test time, we apply non maximum suppression (NMS) with a threshold of 0.1 to eliminate multiple overlapping bounding boxes. Following the previous works  2  [ref]23, we train separate networks for the car and the pedestrian classes. We describe hereafter the training setting for the car class, and the one for the pedestrian is included in the supplementary material. We train our network for 100 epochs, with a learning rate of 3e-3 and a weight decay of 1e-2. We use a cosine annealing technique  as a learning rate scheduler. Batch size is set to 8 for the network. All models are trained end-to-end using PyTorch . We use data augmentation techniques during training. Specifically, we apply random flipping along the x𝑥x-axis, global scaling, where a scaling factor is randomly chosen within a range of [0.95,1.05]0.951.05[0.95,1.05], and global rotation along the z𝑧z-axis, where a rotation angle is sampled randomly from a range of [−π4,π4]𝜋4𝜋4[-\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{4}]. We also use a ground-truth augmentation technique 2 that randomly selects ground-truth bounding boxes within the entire training dataset and associates them for each 3D scene. We set the parameters for our model by a grid search in terms of mAP on the validation split: K=20𝐾20K=20, C=64𝐶64C=64, T=2,000𝑇2000T=2,000, λreg=2.0subscript𝜆reg2.0\\lambda_{\\mathrm{reg}}=2.0, λdir=0.2subscript𝜆dir0.2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{dir}}=0.2, λcls=1.0subscript𝜆cls1.0\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cls}}=1.0 and λmem=1.0subscript𝜆mem1.0\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mem}}=1.0. For other parameters, we use the same setting as in  as follows: We assume that the dimension of a 3D scene (W,H,L𝑊𝐻𝐿W,H,L) is within a range of [(0,70.4),(−40,40),(−3,1)]070.4404031[(0,70.4),(-40,40),(-3,1)] meters. We set the size of anchors as 1.6×3.9×1.51.63.91.51.6\\times 3.9\\times 1.5. To define positive and negative pairs, we compute IoU scores between the anchors and the ground truth. We choose the anchors with the IoU scores being larger than 0.6, as positive boxes, while those lower than 0.45 are used as negative ones. We use (0.16,0.16,4)0.160.164(0.16,0.16,4) as the size of a voxel, vW×vH×vLsubscript𝑣𝑊subscript𝑣𝐻subscript𝑣𝐿v_{W}\\times v_{H}\\times v_{L}. The number of point clouds within each voxel Nvoxsubscript𝑁voxN_{\\mathrm{vox}} and the size of augmented point clouds D𝐷D are set to 32 and 9, respectively.
