      "content": "Paper Title: Search For Deep Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile searching for deep GNN architecture, our model could severely suffer from the “over-smooth” problem [ref]48. Recently, APPNP  applied initial residual connection in the context of Personalized PageRank to alleviate this problem, but failed to achieve a deep model. Following , GCNII  further pointed out that solely applying initial residual connection is not sufficient. Inspired by Resnet [ref]10, they utilized identity mapping as supplement for initial residual connection, which successfully deepened GCN model to 64 layers and achieved top performance. Inspired by these works, we propose to extend these two techniques to other graph convolutional layers, and then utilize these layers as basic components of our GNN blocks. Here, we present a general representation of a GNN layer with identity mapping and initial residual connection as: where hi(l)superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖𝑙h_{i}^{(l)} is the embedding for node i𝑖i in layer l𝑙l. α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta are two hyper-parameters that control the weight for residual connection from the initial embedding hj(0)superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑗0h_{j}^{(0)} and identity mapping for the weight matrix θi​jsubscript𝜃𝑖𝑗\\theta_{ij} respectively. And ci​jsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗c_{ij} denotes the coefficients between target node i𝑖i and its one-hop adjacent node j𝑗j. For example, ci​jsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗c_{ij} is the attention coefficients ai​jsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗a_{ij} in GAT [ref]40 and 1di​dj1subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑑𝑗\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_{i}d_{j}}} in GCN . Finally, a permutation invariant aggregation function σ𝜎\\sigma is applied to aggregate features from adjacent nodes.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: While searching for deep GNN architecture, our model could severely suffer from the “over-smooth” problem [ref]48.
