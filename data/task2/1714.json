      "content": "Paper Title: Exact and Approximate Pattern Counting in Degenerate Graphs: New Algorithms, Hardness Results, and Complexity Dichotomies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we consider the complexity of approximately counting subgraphs and induced subgraphs in degenerate graphs. We will identify classes of graphs C𝐶C for which #​Subd​(C)#subscriptSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{Sub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) and #​IndSubd​(C)#subscriptIndSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{IndSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) can be approximated efficiently by a fixed-parameter tractable approximation scheme: Let (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) be a parameterized counting problem. A fixed-parameter tractable approximation scheme (FPTRAS) for (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) is a randomised algorithm 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} that expects as input an instance I𝐼I of (P,κ)𝑃𝜅(P,\\kappa) and ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, and returns an output c^^𝑐\\hat{c} such that The running time of 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} must be bounded by f​(κ​(I))⋅p​o​l​y​(|I|,ε−1)⋅𝑓𝜅𝐼𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝐼superscript𝜀1f(\\kappa(I))\\cdot{poly}(|I|,\\varepsilon^{-1}), where f𝑓f is computable and independent of I𝐼I. The error probability of an FPTRAS can be brought down to any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, thus matching the original definition of an FPTRAS by [ref]4, by standard amplification techniques, at the cost of an additional factor of O​(log⁡(1/δ))𝑂1𝛿O(\\log(1/\\delta)) in the running time (see ). In what follows, we will call c^^𝑐\\hat{c} an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximation of P​(I)𝑃𝐼P(I) if (1−ε)​P​(I)≤c^≤(1+ε)​P​(I)1𝜀𝑃𝐼^𝑐1𝜀𝑃𝐼(1-\\varepsilon)P(I)\\leq\\hat{c}\\leq(1+\\varepsilon)P(I). Let us start by noting that, for #​Subd​(C)#subscriptSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{Sub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) and #​IndSubd​(C)#subscriptIndSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{IndSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C), an FPTRAS may not always exist. To see this, let C𝐶C be the set of all 111-subdivisions of cliques. Then the k𝑘k-clique problem, which is 𝖶​𝖶delimited-[]1\\mathsf{W}-hard, reduces to the decision problems Subd​(C)subscriptSubd𝐶\\textsc{Sub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) and IndSubd​(C)subscriptIndSubd𝐶\\textsc{IndSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C), by computing the 111-subdivision G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} of G𝐺G, which has degeneracy at most 222, and checking if it contains the subdivision of a k𝑘k-clique. Since an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximation of the number of subdivided k𝑘k-cliques in G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} reveals whether or not G𝐺G contains a k𝑘k-clique, we conclude that #​Subd​(C)#subscriptSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{Sub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) and #​IndSubd​(C)#subscriptIndSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{IndSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) do not have an FPTRAS unless FPTFPT\\mathrm{FPT} coincides with 𝖶​𝖶delimited-[]1\\mathsf{W} under randomised reductions. Hence, in general #​Subd​(C)#subscriptSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{Sub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) and #​IndSubd​(C)#subscriptIndSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{IndSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) are unlikely to admit an FPTRAS. Nonetheless, we identify large classes of patterns C𝐶C for which an FPTRAS exists. For the remaining classes, we are not able to prove hardness results; but we point out that, for approximate counting problems, dichotomies into easy and hard cases are quite uncommon, and often even unlikely to exist [ref]27. Even in the case of non-degenerate graphs, the complexity of approximate counting subgraphs is only partially resolved: [ref]4 established the existence of an FPTRAS for counting copies of patterns of bounded treewidth, but it it still not known if patterns of unbounded treewidth induce hardness. For our results, presented in the subsequent subsections, we rely on a recent reduction from “approximate counting to colourful decision” for self-contained k𝑘k-witness problems due to . To this end, we say that a graph G𝐺G is k𝑘k-vertex coloured if it comes with a (not necessarily proper) surjective colouring c:V​(G)→[k]:𝑐→𝑉𝐺delimited-[]𝑘c:V(G)\\rightarrow[k].\nNow let C𝐶C be a class of graphs. The problem MultiColSubd​(C)subscriptMultiColSubd𝐶\\textsc{MultiColSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) expects as input a k𝑘k-vertex coloured graph G𝐺G and a k𝑘k-vertex pattern H𝐻H, and the goal is to decide whether G𝐺G contains a subgraph isomorphic to H𝐻H that, additionally, contains each colour precisely once. The parameterization is given by k+d​(G)𝑘𝑑𝐺k+d(G). The problem MultiColIndSubd​(C)subscriptMultiColIndSubd𝐶\\textsc{MultiColIndSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) is the same, but for induced multicoloured copies. The following is a direct consequence of Theorem 9 in :181818We remark that the formal statement of Theorem 9 in  describes the running time of the algorithm for the multicolour decision version only as a function in n𝑛n and k𝑘k. However, by mimicking its proof (that is, by applying [24, Theorem 1]) for our case of approximate counting copies and induced copies of H𝐻H in G𝐺G, we see that the running time can also be expressed as a function in G𝐺G and k𝑘k, and thus also in d​(G)𝑑𝐺d(G). Let C𝐶C be a class of graphs. If MultiColSubd​(C)subscriptMultiColSubd𝐶\\textsc{MultiColSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) can be solved in time T​(G,k,d​(G))𝑇𝐺𝑘𝑑𝐺T(G,k,d(G)), then there is a randomised algorithm 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} that, on input a k𝑘k-vertex pattern H∈C𝐻𝐶H\\in C, an n𝑛n-vertex graph G𝐺G, and ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, computes in time ε−2​k2​k​no​(1)​T​(G,k,d​(G))superscript𝜀2superscript𝑘2𝑘superscript𝑛𝑜1𝑇𝐺𝑘𝑑𝐺\\varepsilon^{-2}k^{2k}n^{o(1)}T(G,k,d(G)) and with probability at least 2/3232/3 an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximation of #​𝖲𝗎𝖻​(H→G)#𝖲𝗎𝖻→𝐻𝐺\\#\\mbox{$\\mathsf{Sub}(H\\!\\rightarrow\\!G)$}. In particular, #​Subd​(C)#subscriptSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{Sub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) has an FPTRAS whenever MultiColSubd​(C)subscriptMultiColSubd𝐶\\textsc{MultiColSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) is FPT. The same holds true for MultiColIndSubd​(C)subscriptMultiColIndSubd𝐶\\textsc{MultiColIndSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C) and #​IndSubd​(C)#subscriptIndSubd𝐶\\#\\textsc{IndSub}_{\\textsc{d}}(C). Before we begin with our treatment of the multicolour decision versions, let us remark that, following Theorems 2 and 9 in , we also obtain efficient algorithms for ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximate sampling of subgraphs and induced subgraphs in degenerate graphs whenever the multicolour decision version is fixed-parameter tractable.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: where f𝑓f is computable and independent of I𝐼I. The error probability of an FPTRAS can be brought down to any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, thus matching the original definition of an FPTRAS by [ref]4, by standard amplification techniques, at the cost of an additional factor of O​(log⁡(1/δ))𝑂1𝛿O(\\log(1/\\delta)) in the running time (see ).
