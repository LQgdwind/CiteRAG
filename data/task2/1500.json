      "content": "Paper Title: ExpFinder: An Ensemble Expert Finding Model Integrating ùëÅ-gram Vector Space Model and \\hits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, with the growing amount of digital expertise sources, expert finding has become an intensive research area in information retrieval community¬†.\nWe can mainly classify expert finding approaches into three categories: VSM, DLM and GM. In the VSM approach,\nthe common idea is to estimate relevance between a document and a topic using a weighting scheme in VSM (e.g. TFIDF or its variation). Then, finding experts can be done by assuming that an expert is seen as the collection of its published documents ùíüxsubscriptùíüùë•\\mathcal{D}_{x}. That is, the weight of an expert xùë•x given a topic tùë°t is estimated by aggregating relevance scores between each document in ùíüxsubscriptùíüùë•\\mathcal{D}_{x} and tùë°t.\nFor example, TFIDF was used to find experts in community question answering websites in which the goal is to find users with relevant expertise to provide answers for given questions¬†. A variation of TFIDF was also applied for expert finding in an organization‚Äôs ERP system¬†. The work¬† also used TFIDF to identify experts given a topic using a topic extension method (finding interrelated terms of a given topic from the corpus), where TFIDF was used to estimate relevance between extended terms and each expert‚Äôs documents. TFIDF was also used to estimate the weights of topics indicating the interests of an expert, and this information is used with fuzzy logics for expert finding¬†. The aim of the DLM approach\nis to find experts whose documents are directly related to a given topic.\nIn common, this approach estimates the relationships between a topic and an expert as the probability of generating the topic by the expert , or between an expert and its publications¬†[ref]22. BMExpert¬†[ref]7 used the DLM¬† for expert finding using three factors: relevance of documents to the topic, importance of documents, and associations between documents and experts. Similarly, the work  used a probabilistic DLM for expert finding by probabilistically generating a textual representation of an expert according to his documents and then ranking such documents according to a given topic. Recently, a probabilistic model, WISER¬†, estimated the importance of experts‚Äô documents given a topic using BM25¬†. Using this importance, such documents were ranked and these ranks were summed to represent the topic-sensitive weight of an expert. In the GM approach,\nexperts are represented as nodes, and their relationships are represented by their edges or implicitly derived from a graph. Different algorithms were used in the GM approach, such as Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS)    and PageRank .\nFor expert finding, PageRank was adapted in the context of online community discussions on a user-user graph built based on votes from users whose questions were answered by whom¬†. Also, a modified PageRank algorithm was developed and applied for finding experts in online knowledge communities¬†.\nHITS is also a graph-based link analysis algorithm originally designed for ranking the importance of web pages based on authority and hub scores. The work¬† built an expert-expert bipartite graph based on email communication patterns and attempted to find the ranking of experts using HITS.\nCO-HITS was introduced¬† to incorporate a bipartite graph with the content information from both sides (e.g. experts and documents in our context) by adding personalised parameters to HITS, and CO-HITS showed higher performance than HITS¬†. Using an author-document-topic (ADT) graph, the expert finding GM model¬† leveraged possible paths between a topic and an expert on the ADT graph. Recently, diverse expert finding approaches were proposed in a social network. For example, the authors  proposed a method for finding experts who can answer questions in a social network for ‚Äòcommunity question answering‚Äô using users‚Äô votes and reputations. The approach  focused on finding experts who can answer users‚Äô questions based on\nusers‚Äô online social activities in a social network (e.g. Twitter). Also, we observe that some models tend to mix different techniques among DLM, VSM, and/or GM . For example,\nAuthorRank 0 combined a generative probabilistic DLM and a PageRank-like GM based on community engagement of expert candidates. The DLM was used to identify the most relevant documents, while the GM was used to model the authors‚Äô authorities based on the community co-authorship.\nThe work¬†1 combined a cluster-based language model and a VSM for finding experts in question and answer communities. The authors  proposed a complex model for community question answering using a variation of the DLM¬† and a HITS-based GM (the HITS algorithm on a competition based expertise network¬†2), where the scores from these models were linearly combined to rank experts given a question.\nThe work¬†3 used the Dempster-Shafer combination theory to combine the DLM¬† and a graph algorithm that analyses a social interaction of experts. However, this work did not provide technical details on how such combination is done. Differing from the above approaches, ExpFinder is a first attempt in devising an ensemble model that incorporates nùëõnVSM into \\hitson an ECG. The proposed nùëõnVSM takes advantage of the IDF weighting for NùëÅN-grams¬†. \\hitsis a novel variation of CO-HITS and runs on an ECG (i.e. expert-document bipartite graph), compared to previous works¬†  that applied HITS on an expert-expert graph.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: a given topic.\nIn common, this approach estimates the relationships between a topic and an expert as the probability of generating the topic by the expert , or between an expert and its publications¬†[ref]22. BMExpert¬†[ref]7 used the DLM¬† for expert finding using three factors: relevance of documents to the topic, importance of documents, and associations between documents and experts. Similarly,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
