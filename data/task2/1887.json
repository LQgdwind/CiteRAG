      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-fold Correlation Attention Network for Predicting Traffic Speeds with Heterogeneous Frequency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nShort-term traffic speed prediction (STTSP), which predicts the future traffic speeds in the next few minutes or even hours, is a core component in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The prediction accuracy critically impacts the performance of various applications, such as route planning, dynamic traffic management, and location-based service .\nIn the STTSP problem, the road network is typically organized as a graph, where the road segments are usually modeled as graph nodes while the graph links indicate the relationship between adjacent road segments.\n\nSTTSP problem is challenging as the prediction accuracy is not only affected by environmental and periodical factors such as weather conditions (e.g., a strong storm), time of day (e.g., rush hours) and holidays,\nbut also by the complex dynamic spatiotemporal correlations among the traffic data.\nA road segment’s traffic speed series usually follows periodic patterns (e.g. daily, weekly periodicity) which change over time and vary geographically . Also, the spatial correlation between different road segments’ speed series is highly dynamic.\nCompared with long-term traffic prediction, the STTSP problem is more challenging due to severe fluctuations of traffic data caused by dynamic traffic conditions and uncertainties (e.g., in data acquisition, driver behaviors, etc.).\n The STTSP problem has been extensively studied, and various prediction models were proposed. It is well recognized that the traffic states in nearby regions are correlated with each other, which is also known as spatial correlations/dependencies. Many efforts have been devoted to incorporating spatiotemporal correlations to improve traffic prediction accuracy.\nIn the early years, many classical methods (e.g., probabilistic graphical models [ref]30, latent space model ) were developed for modeling pairwise correlations. However, they either use simple linear models which cannot model complex realistic scenarios or incur extremely high computational costs due to the large number of parameters.\n\nRecently, deep learning-based methods have been widely used for traffic prediction problems, due to their ability to model non-linear and non-stationary behaviors in traffic data. Many novel deep learning techniques (e.g., convolution neural network (CNN), graph convolutional network (GCN)) have been applied to traffic speed/flow prediction over road network structure for capturing spatial correlations   [ref]24 .\nTo overcome the challenge of handling varying number of neighboring roads and connections in road networks, the work in  and  utilized GCN combined with RNN to jointly capture spatial and temporal correlations. The difference is that,  applied a diffusion convolution layer directly on the road graph, while  learned from optimized graphs via an updating strategy during the training phase.\nA dynamic GCN is proposed for traffic prediction [ref]24 by constructing dynamic graphs, which reflect time-specific spatial dependencies of road segments. The local neighborhood information can then be aggregated by dynamic GCN and propagated over the dynamic adjacent matrices. It is highlighted in  that traffic systems are hierarchical structures consisting of micro layers (road networks) and macro layers (region networks); however, current GCN is only applied on the micro graph. Therefore, they applied a novel GCN-based traffic prediction method to capture features from both layers and the dynamic interaction between them. Although various methods have been developed to model spatial correlations, they are solely based on a single measurement to characterize the correlations (typically the traffic speed values). In this paper, we will demonstrate that spatial correlations can be characterized through multiple measurements such as the speed value, changing trends in speed values, and deviations from normal speed values. We will also explore and incorporate the effectiveness of multi-fold temporal correlations.\n Next, we show that closely located road segments exhibit a diverse set of spatial correlations when they are characterized using different measurements. These correlations alternatively dominate the spatial correlation, i.e., produce the highest correlation score.\nFor example, two road segments rasubscript𝑟𝑎r_{a} and rbsubscript𝑟𝑏r_{b} may both observe similar speed values (e.g. vasubscript𝑣𝑎v_{a}=20m/s, vbsubscript𝑣𝑏v_{b}=17m/s) at different time (e.g. 7:00 am and 11:50 am), indicating the same traffic situation at the two time instances.\nHowever, roads rasubscript𝑟𝑎r_{a} and rbsubscript𝑟𝑏r_{b} may exhibit different changing trends at those time instances. For example, the traffic speed on both rasubscript𝑟𝑎r_{a} and rbsubscript𝑟𝑏r_{b} tend to decelerate at 7:00am, while at 11:50am, the traffic speed at rasubscript𝑟𝑎r_{a} tends to decrease but the traffic speed at rbsubscript𝑟𝑏r_{b} increases. As such, the spatial correlation measured based on changing trends is different from that based on traffic speed.\nThere also exist many other measurements to characterize the spatial correlations, such as how much the current traffic speed deviates from its historical average speed.\n Specifically, the multi-fold spatial correlations studied in this paper refer to the multiple spatial correlations between two traffic speed series calculated based on multiple measurements. The measurements include not only the speed value but also the speed changing trend and deviation of current speed from the historical average.\nA more detailed comparison of different spatial correlations will be illustrated later in Figure 2.\nWe will show that dynamically capturing and incorporating such multi-fold spatial correlations into the prediction model is vital for achieving higher prediction accuracy.\n\nAdopting multi-fold temporal correlations for traffic predictions has been previously explored. For example, the daily and weekly periodicity are jointly considered for traffic prediction on grid network [ref]46 and multi-resolution temporal correlations are adopted for traffic flow prediction on graph network. However, these methods fail to simultaneously model the multi-fold spatial correlations of traffic data.\nIn addition, actual traffic data are heterogeneous due to diverse road types (e.g. primary road, highway), travel demand, as well as the environmental and periodic factors (weather, time-of-day, events).\nAs such, it is common for different road segments to exhibit traffic speed series with diverse frequencies.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce heterogeneous frequency in traffic speed data by considering different sampling rates for different road segments in the entire traffic network.\nFor example, road segment rasubscript𝑟𝑎r_{a} has a speed observation per 5 minutes while rbsubscript𝑟𝑏r_{b} generates a speed observation per 10 minutes.\n\nAlso, the generated speed series sometimes fluctuate notably due to missing values.\nAccurate traffic speed prediction on the graph road network with heterogeneous time-frequency traffic data still remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose a Multi-fold Correlation Attention Network (MCAN) for traffic speed prediction that takes into consideration the heterogeneous frequency of traffic speed series. MCAN jointly takes into account multi-fold spatial correlations and multi-fold temporal correlations to provide discriminating features for improving the accuracy of traffic speed prediction. The major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. 1) We propose alternative measurements to characterize the spatiotemporal correlations of the traffic data, i.e. how are they correlated with each other in terms of speed changing trend and the deviation from historical average speed. We demonstrate that the correlation patterns based on different measurements behave differently under various traffic situations, and they alternatively dominate the spatial correlation (i.e. produce the highest correlation score). 2) We propose a Heterogeneous Spatial Correlation (HSC) model to capture the spatial correlation with a specific measurement.\nThe HSC model is able to deal with traffic data of heterogeneous sampling frequency. 3) We propose a novel MCAN framework to accurately predict traffic speed by simultaneously incorporating multi-fold spatial correlations, multi-fold temporal correlations as well as multiple contextual factors. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to explicitly explore the multi-fold correlations for traffic prediction.\nMCAN relies on the HSC model to explore multi-fold spatial correlations (based on the traffic speed, the speed changing trend and the deviation from historical average speed) and leverage upon the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture multi-fold temporal correlations (short-term dependency, daily and weekly periodicity). The learned multi-fold spatiotemporal correlations together with contextual factors are fused with an attention mechanism to make the final predictions. 4) We conduct extensive experiments on real-world traffic datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed MCAN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, and significant prediction accuracy improvement can be achieved by incorporating multi-fold correlations. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related works and highlights the similarity and differences between this work and the existing ones. Section 3 presents the necessary preliminaries, which include notations, problem formulation, and demonstration of multi-fold spatial correlations. Section 4 introduces our proposed MCAN model as well as the details of each component in MCAN. Section 5 evaluates the performance of the proposed methods using two real-world trafﬁc datasets. Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses potential directions of future work.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Many efforts have been devoted to incorporating spatiotemporal correlations to improve traffic prediction accuracy.\nIn the early years, many classical methods (e.g., probabilistic graphical models [ref]30, latent space model ) were developed for modeling pairwise correlations.
