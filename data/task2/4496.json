      "content": "Paper Title: On the independence between phenomenal consciousness and computational intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe concept of consciousness has always been difficult to define, as it is a property that can not be directly measured by any method coming from our current scientific method . In particular, it is an ontologically subjective phenomenon, and a measure in the sense of the scientific method applies to an epistemologically objective phenomenon . However, we can split the consciousness concept into several phenomenons associated with the term to make it easier to work with this phenomenon. Specifically, the philosophy of mind literature splits consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, also referred as vigilance according to neuroscience ) and that basically refers to the subjective and private to the observer sensations that human beings feel (also called awareness) and access consciousness, , that refers to the ability to put attention to a particular feeling. Last, another type of consciousness is self-consciousness, that is basically the model of our identity that we build based on our experience and abilities [ref]49. In other words, we differentiate between subjective phenomenona, the relative to the observer experience of something that the observer is paying attention to, and the objective phenomena, that can be simulated in a computer even if it is related to consciousness . For example, we can manipulate colours with computers but we cannot simulate qualia. We can even simulate the bottleneck of consciousness  but cannot simulate the perceived experience of the result. Whereas access and self-consciousness can arguably, and in our opinion, be simulated by a computer successfully, for example with attention mechanisms  and a computational ontology of a person based on historical records [ref]6, how to implement or simulate phenomenal consciousness, that is going to be the target of this paper, remains a complete mystery. In particular, we can not simulate the experience of the perception of qualia, such as the redness of the red colour. Philosophy of mindexplains this impossibility with the example of Mary, a blind girl that is an expert in vision. Although being an expert, Mary is unable to know what is the difference in the perception of red or black, as this information comes from qualia and is subjective, that is, cannot be represented in an objective manner such as in a book description . This is known as the knowledge argument: and it rests on the idea that someone who has a complete objective knowledge, from the point of view of the scientific method and our epistemological scope, about another conscious being might yet lack knowledge about how it feels to have the experiences of that being . A common belief shared by many people of the computer science community, and concretely in the machine consciousness community  and even in the philosophy of mind community and more concretely shared by the connectionism community , is that if an artificial general intelligence 0 is modelled (supposedly via some meta-learning [ref]63 or transfer learning methodology  applied to high capacity deep learning models  and huge datasets), due to emergence, phenomenal consciousness may arise. Hence, this group of people believe, assuming the multiple realizability philosophy of mind assumption 4, that an intelligent enough system is the cause of phenomenal consciousness, that phenomenal consciousness arises as an epiphenomenon , or that intelligence is the cause of phenomenal consciousness or viceversa, that is, that they are dependent variables. In order to continue analyzing the potential statistical, or even metaphysical, causal relation between phenomenal consciousness and intelligence, it is important to also briefly describe intelligence, which is another controversial concept that has been in focus since the times of ancient philosophers. Coming from the psychology community, and in a broad sense, intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience 1. If these problems are computational, we can reduce and quantify intelligence as an analytical expression , as we will see in further sections, giving rise to the concept of computational intelligence. From an ontological objective point of view, independent of the observer, the described definition of intelligence shown by a system or living being would be epistemologically subjective, as it is relative to the observer and its knowledge, culture and beliefs. Consequently, we can not directly measure it without observing the external behaviour of the person. As a result, the observer could be really more intelligent that he appears to be according to its behaviour. However, it is the only measure that we can express quantitatively and to study its relation with phenomenal consciousness, although it is based on the behaviour of the subject. As we will further see, as in the case of Asperger and Autism syndrome subjects, the person may be really more intelligent according to Stern’s intelligence quotient or some measures of intelligence that we will show than its behaviour shows, which is very problematic. In other words, we argue that computational intelligence would be an ontological objective continuous numerical latent variable whose observation is noisy and obscured by a series of factors such as the personality or mood of the person being measured. As phenomenal consciousness is also an ontological dichotomous property, it only has sense to use this definition of computational intelligence, and not a epistemological subjective definition, to study its independence with phenomenal consciousness. If these computational problems can be solved by a computer, either traditional or a quantum computer, we find the concept of artificial or machine intelligence . Concretely, it is important to remark that the artificial intelligence models implemented in quantum, traditional or other computing paradigms such as biological computation mechanisms, solve the same space of problems, in particular, those solvable by an universal Turing machine. However, artificial intelligence does not involve concepts as understanding , as understanding requires an entity being aware of the learned concept. Nevertheless, computational intelligence does not require understanding. For example, a model can beat any human at chess, displaying a bigger estimation of computational intelligence than aware beings, while being unaware. It wins chess by having learned complex patterns of previous data with statistical models or performing search algorithms that humans can not perform but it does not understand the meaning of chess as it is not aware of the experience of playing chess. Consequently, it is merely following a sequence of instructions that maximizes the probability of winning chess based on previous data. Hence, we find that computational intelligence, which is a subset of intelligence, is independent in this example from phenomenal consciousness, which is the focus of this paper and we will further continue to provide examples such as this one. General intelligence  involves other types of intelligence such as emotional intelligence 3 or multiple intelligences 9. These intelligences can also be measured in human beings with measures such as the Stern’s intelligence quotient 7, or more sophisticated metrics, and may be simulated in machines if they do not require understanding nor qualia experience. All the other aspects of intelligence coming from the psychology community definition such as learning from experience, thinking abstractly or planning can be simulated with machines, as for example The Generalized Agent (GATO) from DeepMind empirically shows. Citing the paper explicity: ”The agent, which we refer to as Gato, works as a multi-modal, multi-task, multi-embodiment generalist policy. The same network with the same weights can play Atari, caption images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more, deciding based on its context whether to output text, joint torques, button presses, or other tokens.” We will provide arguments to theoretically support the claim that computational intelligence is not related to phenomenal consciousness and that machines do not possess phenomenal consciousness. Therefore, as we will illustrate in detail in further sections, we justify and claim that rights must belong to people and ethical decisions must be taken by people, not just by, for example, machine learning systems. Moreover, we must not judge a person for its intelligence but because it is a human being with the potential of being conscious. Not doing it so implies a discrimination of a conscious being because of its measurable computational intelligence. In this paper, we will provide solid arguments coming from computer science, neuroscience, physics, psychology and philosophy of mind to reject the hypothesis that phenomenal consciousness computational intelligence are dependent variables. We find that the root of this belief is explicitly formulated in the ”Analogy” paper written by Bertrand Russell 1. Hence, all the argumentation that will be shown in this paper tries to show that the Analogy of Russell, that very briefly states that as the observable degree of computational intelligence of an individual increases then it becomes more probable that the individual possesses phenomenal consciousness, is a fallacy. The organization of the paper is the following.First, we illustrate the Analogy of Russell and formalize it from a Bayesian point of view. Then, we provide some simple counter-examples of it that show empirical evidence of how unlikely is that hypothesis to be true. In an additional section, we study the concept of intelligence and provide a new definition of computational intelligence to more formally reject the mentioned hypothesis. With that definition, modelling computational intelligence with a numerical variable and phenomenal consciousness with a dichotomous variable, we study the potential causal relation of phenomenal consciousness and computational intelligence and theoretically provide an argument that shows how these properties are independent, formally and with an exhaustive list of counter-arguments. Afterwards, we formalize how phenomenal consciousness and computational intelligence are independent and the consequences that this fact have in our society. Finally, we finish the paper with a section of conclusions and further work.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: to put attention to a particular feeling.
