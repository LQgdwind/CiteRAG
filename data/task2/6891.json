In a context akin to ours, [ref]5 utilized a contrastive loss signal alongside a distance function capturing instance and class-level fidelity to recursively update the encoder network.\nSimilarly,  employed Contrastive Learning to create a compressed representation of training data which is used to detect drifting samples with class centroids.\nBoth these works use a contrastive signal that pulls embeddings of the same class together and pushes those of different classes apart, we instead rely on Center-Loss .\nMoreover, these works use autoencoders while we adopt a FeedForward Network.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: A significant portion of the network intrusion literature on ML applications focuses on anomaly detection   and concept drift    [ref]29.\nAnomaly techniques, such as autoencoders , have gained interest due to their ability to detect unknown attacks using only normal traffic and without requiring labels.\nHowever, these methods\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
