      "content": "Paper Title: Mind Reasoning Manners: Enhancing Type Perception for Generalized Zero-shot Logical Reasoning over Text\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLogical reasoning over text has aroused wide interest in the area of Machine\nReading Comprehension (MRC)  and Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP)  recently. In the form of the\ntraditional multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) [ref]4[ref]5, the task of logical\nreasoning requires the model to perform complex reasoning and generalization.\nOne of the main difficulties of the task lies in addressing diverse reasoning\ntypes. Fig. 1 shows some examples of reasoning types in the\nlogical reasoning task. Given questions with different reasoning types, humans\ntend to focus on the respective aspects of interactions between the context and\nthe option. For instance, for the type Identify the flaw (a), the option\nis strongly related to the detailed logic flaws within the global idea. While\nfor the type Necessary assumption (b), the focus may be switched to the\npremise of the arguments and detect the missing assumption reflected by the\noption. Also, for the reasoning type of Parallel reasoning (c), it is\nrequired to consider the corresponding logical structure of the context and the\noption, rather than the specific entities or events. Therefore, the modeling of\nthe specific reasoning type is intuitive and necessary to the logical\nreasoning task. Recent works have witnessed improvements in the logical reasoning tasks.\nGenerally, they can be categorized into two folds: graph-based and data-based.\nIn the graph-based family, DAGN , FocalReasoner\n and Logiformer [ref]9 attempt to\nconstruct the context graphs from different levels, such as causal and\nco-occurrence. And AdaLoGN 0 proposes a neural-symbolic\nsystem in an adaptive manner. In the data-based family, previous works explore\nvarious data augmentation strategies. For example, LReasoner\n1 extracts the symbols from the text and extends them with\nlogical rules. MERIt 2 designs several data generation\nmethods to facilitate the training process. However, all of the methods in the\ntwo families lack the modeling of the reasoning type features. Although the\nabove mentioned methods achieve superior results over strong baselines, the\ncurrent researches are based on the ideal setting that train and test splits\nshare the similar distribution of reasoning types. Nevertheless, in the real\napplication, we are mainly exposed to the common types of questions while\nunfamiliar with the reasoning on the novel and uncommon types. In another word,\nthere is an obvious gap between the ideal setting and the real scenarios. To\naddress this issue, there exist two problems to be studied: 1) What about the\ntest performance on the unseen types during training and how is the zero-shot\ncapability of the models? 2) How to enhance the perception of reasoning types\nfor the models? As for Problem 1, we propose a new benchmark for the generalized\nZero-shot Logical Reasoning, named\nZsLR. Based on the ReClor dataset 3 with 17\nreasoning types, we form 6 zero-shot data splits according to 3 strategies\n(i.e., amount, randomness, and difficulty). To make comprehensive assessments,\nwe introduce the generalized zero-shot setting 4, which test on both seen types and\nunseen types with two defined metrics. The necessity and meaning of ZsLR is\nverified by the pilot experiments and it encourages more future works to mind\nreasoning manners. As for Problem 2, we propose a Type-aware reasoning network\nbased on Contrastive learning, named TaCo. First, we\ndesign a keyword-based extractor to output the reasoning type. Then, through\nthe two designed heuristic strategies, we merge each question and the option\ninto a unified Q-A pair. Based on the co-occurrence node extraction algorithm proposed in\nLogiformer [ref]9, we form the topology within context\npart and Q-A pair part respectively. To model the interaction of the\ncontext and Q-A pair for different reasoning types, we add a global node\nto connect all the nodes of the two parts. Through the self-attention\naggregation, the final representation of the global node is obtained and\nutilized to predict the answer. Meanwhile, we employ the sentence-BERT\n5 to obtain type embeddings based on their\ndescriptions. The margin loss is applied to model the reasoning type, where the\nglobal node serves as the anchor, ground truth type as positive example and\nother types as negative examples. In this way, the global node representation\ncontains both the context and the reasoning type semantics. Therefore, the\nperception of the reasoning types can facilitate the zero-shot capability. In all, the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We are the first to focus on the issue of type-oriented reasoning\nmanners. To address the issue, we propose the first benchmark: generalized\nZsLR.111The ZsLR dataset and implementation of TaCo are public at github.com/xufangzhi/TaCo It can well reflect the real scenarios and test the zero-shot\ncapabilities of the models. (2) We propose to tackle the zero-shot task through the heuristic\ninput reconstruction and type-aware contrastive learning. The proposed model\nTaCo can function as a strong baseline for the future works on the task of ZsLR. (3) Extensive experiments on both zero-shot and full-data settings\nprove the huge potential of the proposed issue, as well as the superiority of TaCo. Also, we conduct additional experiments to further verify the generalization capability of TaCo on other setting and dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: aroused wide interest in the area of Machine\nReading Comprehension (MRC)  and Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP)  recently.
