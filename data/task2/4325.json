      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Shot Semantic Relation Prediction across Heterogeneous Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince there are no solutions specifically designed to solve the novel problem of few-shot semantic relation prediction, we selected 10 state-of-the-art models as baselines, which are relevant to our model and can be used to perform experiments with minor modifications. These baselines can be divided into five groups as follows: Semantic relation prediction models: ProxEmbed  first samples multiple paths between two objects, then feeds these paths into LSTM to get the embedding for semantic relation prediction; IPE [ref]9 constructs an interactive-path structure consisting of multiple paths between two objects, then adopts a Gated Recurrent Unit network to embed each interactive-path for semantic relation prediction. Homogeneous GNN: GraphSAGE [ref]21 is a graph neural network model that aggregates feature information of neighbors by different neural networks, such as LSTM; GAT  is a graph attention network model that aggregates neighborsâ€™ feature information by self-attention neural network. Heterogeneous GNN: HAN  is a heterogeneous GNN that learns metapath-specific object embeddings from different metapath-based homogeneous graphs, and leverages the attention mechanism to combine them into one vector representation for each object; MAGNN  is a heterogeneous GNN that incorporates intermediate semantic objects along metapaths, and combines messages from multiple metapaths to learn object representations. Meta-learning based GNN: Meta-GNN 3 is an MAML-based meta-learning framework that trains a GNN for few-shot node classification on homogeneous graphs; G-Meta 2 uses local subgraphs with MAML to train a GNN for few-shot problems on homogeneous graphs. Subgraph-based GNN: SEAL  is a link prediction framework designed for homogeneous graphs, which simultaneously learns from local enclosing subgraphs, embeddings and attributes based on graph neural networks; SLiCE  is a graph neural network that aggregates information from higher-order relations in context subgraphs to learn contextual subgraph representations on heterogeneous graphs. Note that G-Meta 2 is also a subgraph-based GNN model because it extracts local subgraphs for link prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: follows: Semantic relation prediction models: ProxEmbed  first samples multiple paths between two objects, then feeds these paths into LSTM to get the embedding for semantic relation prediction; IPE [ref]9 constructs an interactive-path structure consisting of multiple paths between two objects, then adopts a Gated Recurrent Unit network to embed each interactive-path for semantic relation\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
