      "content": "Paper Title: Matching Guided Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep networks [ref]41  enjoy massive neuron parameters for achieving the state-of-the-art performances on lots of technique lines, such as visual recognition [ref]9, image captioning , object detection system  and language understanding  .\nHowever, the industry prefers to carry out model inference on cheap devices, therefore the small model with few parameters is needed.\nThe dilemma of achieving analogous performance to the large model in lightweight backbone recently motivates extensive research directions, such as channel pruning , lightweight model design  , quantization  and neural architecture search (NAS) for efficient model  .\nAmong them, model distillation is another active track, which aims to transfer knowledge or semantic feature information from a large teacher model into a light student model.\nPioneered by dark knowledge , the main body of recent works [ref]39  focuses on using distilling intermediate features to enrich the learnable information for guiding student in different tasks, such as classification 8 and detection . However, a prominent challenging problem for these methods is on how to fill the gap in semantic feature structure between teacher and student.\nRoughly speaking, the contrast lies in two aspects:\n1) The different channel dimensions of feature outputs used for distillation.\n2) The different perceptual information or activations between two channel sets.\nPrevious works 8 [ref]39  overcome these two obstacles by building an adaptive module between hidden layers of teacher and student.\nWhereas this manner can alleviate the issue, it still has two limitations:\n1) The adaptation module introduces more parameters (including weights, gradients and optimizer states) into training 7.\nThese additional parameters induce the training harder despite the fact that they would be brushed off for model inference.\n2) The adaptation module with random initialization or special non-parameter transformation   isn’t friendly for distilling a pre-trained student, because it would potentially disturb the student features.\nTo avoid this break, [ref]39 8 performs stage-wise training by separating optimization into multiple steps.\nBut this way isn’t perfect yet because it will plunge training into a cumbersome one. To crack the limitations of former works, we propose a novel distillation method named Matching Guided Distillation (MGD).\nAs shown in Fig. 1, MGD follows the general distillation paradigm.\nGiven batches of data fed into teacher and student, MGD matches their intermediate channels from distillation position.\nThe motivation is that whether the student has been pre-trained or not, each channel of it should be guided by its high related teacher channel directly to narrow the semantic feature gap.\nIn order to implement element-wise losses, teacher channels would be reduced according to the matching graph.\nThe method for channel reduction is flexible, we propose three manners: sparse matching, random drop and absolute max pooling.\nExperiments show that all three ways are effective on various tasks.\nFor the whole training, we apply coordinate descent algorithm  to alternate between two optimizations for channels matching and weights updating.\nFurthermore, distilling a pre-trained student using MGD is efficient due to its parameter-free nature as same as training from-scratch.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Deep networks [ref]41  enjoy massive neuron parameters for achieving the state-of-the-art performances on lots of technique lines, such as visual recognition [ref]9, image captioning , object detection system  and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
