      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Shadow Removal for Facial Landmark Detection and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFacial landmark detection  [ref]50 [ref]22 is a fundamental step for numerous facial related applications, e.g., face recognition and verification  , 3D face reconstruction , and safety-critical applications, e.g., deepfake detection  , and facial reenactment [ref]48  for virtual avatar applications. While recent deep-learning techniques bring us continuously improved landmark-detection performance, most of them are designed to handle only images of “clean faces”. However, in real-world applications, face images usually contain image degradations, such as noise, shadow, and haze, which may significantly affect the performance of landmark detectors. Particularly, as a natural phenomenon, shadows are very common on face images – in practice, light to any face region can be occluded by surrounding objects, especially for portrait images captured in the wild. Spatial-variant illumination and color distortion in the shadow region  degrade the image quality and undermine the image features significantly. As shown in Fig. 1, shadowed faces hurts the image quality with large root mean square error (RMSE), and presents unreasonable landmark locations for the eyebrows (See Case1) and mouth (See Case2). An intuition way to alleviate the performance loss caused by shadow is to restore the underlying shadow-free image utilizing current state-of-the-art (SOTA) shadow removal methods. However, there are two challenges posing to such a solution: ❶ The interplay between light, occluder, and the subject directly affects the shadow appearance. As a result, in the real world, shadow patterns are significantly diverse, which increases the difficulty of shadow removal algorithms. ❷ Even though shadow removal methods could obtain high visual-quality images with lower RMSE, as shown in Fig. 1 (Case1), the landmark detection performance even gets worse compared to that of shadow images due to the potential domain shift between landmark detection and image quality enhancement.\nAll above facts motivate us to answer two basic problems: how shadow affects the landmark detection, and whether shadow removal can benefit the robustness enhancement of landmark detectors. To this end, for the first attempt, we propose to link the two seemingly independent but intrinsically related tasks, i.e., shadow removal and facial landmark detection, by constructing a totally novel dataset and benchmark. Such a solution has never been tried in both communities before this work.\nNote that, constructing such a benchmark is challenging and not trivial since the shadow patterns are not exhaustive, and existing benchmarking techniques   collecting natural images cannot meet the requirements.\nTo alleviate the challenges, we propose novel solutions to ensure the comprehensiveness: ❶ We employ the physical model of shadow and synthesize facial shadow images by considering four common factors (i.e., intensity, size, shape, and location) with three severities, ❷ We think the shadow from the perspective of adversarial attack and propose a totally new attack (i.e., adversarial shadow attack) to identify shadow patterns that are more challenging to landmark detection. ❸ We introduce a real-world shadow face dataset for verifying the generalization ability of facial landmark detectors. With these elaborated designs, we are able to quantitatively and systematically study the effect of shadows to the facial landmark detection. Moreover, we study whether shadow removal can help improve the robustness of landmark detectors covering three SOTA shadow removal methods and three landmark detectors. We observe that shadow removal can not only improve the image visual quality, but also boost the performance of landmark detection – there is a positive correlation between the shadow-removal accuracy and the landmark detection accuracy.\nNote that, such a relationship is not apparent in haze-removal and classification task  or even opposite in deraining and detection task .\nIn this work, the relationship is dominate especially when shadow degradation level is higher (i.e., higher-severity shadow and adversarial shadow). It implies that feature embedding spaces of shadow removal and landmark detection aiming to optimize partially overlap with each other, which provides a bridge for the two tasks.\nInspired by this observation, we further propose a new shadow-removal framework regularized by landmark detection to verify whether the two tasks can benefit from each other. As shown in Fig. 1, the visual quality and landmark detection performance are improved simultaneously. Overall, we summarize our contributions as follows: We construct a new shadow-face benchmark SHAREL , including synthetic shadow-face dataset, adversarial shadow-face dataset, and real shadow-face dataset, by comprehensively considering shadow intensity, size, shape and locations and developing a novel adversarial attack. Based on SHAREL , we comprehensively and quantitatively study the effect of shadow and shadow removal to image visual quality and the performance of facial landmark detection. We propose a novel shadow removal framework with awareness of facial landmark detection and verify its performance on the proposed benchmark, boosting both the shadow removal and landmark detection performance.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: Facial landmark detection  [ref]50 [ref]22 is a fundamental step for numerous facial related applications, e.g., face recognition and verification  , 3D face reconstruction , and safety-critical applications, e.g., deepfake\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
