      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning for Economic Policy: A New Frontier?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModelling is an integral part of an economist’s strategy for making sense of the world, and computer simulations have long been a part of the discipline. For example, as early as 1960, researchers were attempting to simulate the United States’ economy in recession 4. Of course, much has changed in the nature of these simulations since then—such experiments were done by hand, with a small number of governing equations. Notwithstanding, the research into simulation certainly continued as computing power increased during the latter half of the 20th century, and bold predictions were made about the future of the field. In the early 1990s, Holland and Miller presented a seminal paper  proposing the development of “Artificial Agents” in economic modelling. The authors firmly believed that the discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could offer new possibilities for economic analysis—formulating the idea of “complex adaptive system” models. Interestingly, in this early formulation, the agents were being modelled in the same way as in Reinforcement Learning (RL): adaptive agents that have a value function for their various actions, and which try to maximize the cumulative reward over time, using Markov processes as a mathematical foundation. Out of these low-level, individual agent actions, emergent behaviour could be realised, the authors argued. Perhaps due to the discipline of RL being relatively nascent at the time, research into adaptive agents for economic modelling mostly waned, but the excitement around rule-based agents certainly prevailed—where the agent’s nature is hard-coded a priori. A new schema of Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE) arose, along with a wealth of literature on the topic, as detailed by Tesfatsion and Judd . Prominent economists such as J. Doyne Farmer and Duncan Foley boldly declared that “the economy needs agent-based modelling” . However, despite the excitement in academic circles, adoption of ACE has been slow in real-world contexts, for real-world economic policy design . Several ambitious projects have been pursued, such as EURACE —which had an intention to model the entire European economy as an agent-based simulation—but these projects have been distinctly limited in scope and applicability, facing a series of challenges  [ref]35. This review, then, aims to synthesize from the literature four core stumbling blocks faced by ACE techniques, in a hope to understand the reasons for its slow uptake. Thereafter, it revisits Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the discipline, as originally envisaged by Holland and Miller , where agents are adaptive. Accordingly, we assess whether any of the identified challenges of ACE can be addressed by RL, by considering the prominent research from the field. The core question is thus: has the development in modern RL algorithms unlocked a new frontier for computational economic policy design, transcending the historical challenges faced by agent-based modelling? With this research question in mind, we now highlight a distinct scope for this review. Importantly, this paper is notably cursory, and does not claim to delve into any of the ideas comprehensively. There exists a plethora of research into the intersection of AI and Economics—the reader is encouraged to see the broad introduction by Furman and Seamans , or various other works    for in-depth examples and analyses. In this review, only agent-based computational modelling approaches are considered, and only in a handful of economic settings; moreover, the only paradigm of AI considered is that of RL, as a subset of Machine Learning, and this is done only insofar as it is relevant to ACE’s challenges. While there are many other fascinating avenues to explore in these domains, they remain outside of this report’s scope. This review proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the field of Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE) and its key concepts. Four challenges facing ACE are synthesized from the literature and presented. Each challenge is supported by research, either through theoretical analyses or actual ACE implementation reports, and the high-level criticisms are summarised. Section 3 then dives in Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the context of computational economics, and presents a ‘Scorecard’—where each of the four challenges is discussed with the state of contemporary RL in mind. We remark that of the four challenges presented, RL might assist in just one regard: the need for an explicitly-modelled agent. Next, Section 4 presents a short table of case studies in which RL has indeed been attempted for use in computational economics. Finally, conclusions are drawn, and recommendations are made for future research.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: had an intention to model the entire European economy as an agent-based simulation—but these projects have been distinctly limited in scope and applicability, facing a series of challenges  [ref]35.
