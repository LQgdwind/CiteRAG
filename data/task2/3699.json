      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-based Latent Aligner for Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct extensive experiments with incremental classifiers and object detectors to evaluate ELI.\nTo the best of our knowledge, ours is the first methodology, which works across both these settings without any modification. Protocols:\nIn both problem domains, we study class-incremental setting where a group of classes constitutes an incremental task.\nFor class-incremental learning of classifiers, we experiment with two prominent protocols that exist in the literature: a) train with half the total number of classes as the first task [ref]31 , and equal number of classes per task thereafter, b) ensure that each task (including the first) has equal number of classes [ref]41   . The former tests extreme class incremental learning setting, where in the 252525 task setting we incrementally add only two classes at each stage for a dataset with 100100100 classes. It has the advantage of learning a strong initial classifier as it has access to half of the dataset in Task 1. The later setting has a uniform class distribution across tasks. Both these settings test different plausible dynamics of an incremental classifier. For incremental object detection, similar to existing works [ref]22  , we follow a two task setting where the second task contains 101010, 555 or a single incremental class. Datasets and Evaluation Metrics:\nFollowing existing works [ref]31  [ref]41  [ref]22  we use incremental versions of CIFAR-100 , ImageNet subset [ref]41, ImageNet 1k  and Pascal VOC  datasets. CIFAR-100  contains 505050k training images, corresponding to 100100100 classes, each with spatial dimensions of 32√ó32323232\\times 32. ImageNet-subset [ref]41 contains 100100100 randomly selected classes from ImageNet datasets. We also experiment with the full ImageNet 2012 dataset  which contains 100010001000 classes. In contrast to CIFAR-100, there are over 130013001300 images per class with 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 size in both ImageNet-subset and ImageNet-1k. Pascal VOC 2007  contains 996399639963 images, where each object instance is annotated with its class label and location in an image. Instances from 202020 classes are annotated in Pascal VOC.\nAverage accuracy across tasks [ref]41 [ref]31 and mean average precision (mAP)  is used as the evaluation metric for incremental classification and detection, respectively. Implementation Details:\nFollowing the standard practice [ref]41 [ref]31, we use ResNet-18  for CIFAR-100 experiments and ResNet-32  for ImageNet experiments. We use a batch size of 128128128 and train for 160160160 epochs. We start with an initial learning rate of 0.10.10.1, which is decayed by 0.10.10.1 after 80t‚Äãhsuperscript80ùë°‚Ñé80^{th} and 120t‚Äãhsuperscript120ùë°‚Ñé120^{th} epochs.\nThe EBM is a three layer neural network with 646464 neurons in the first two layers and single neuron in the last layer. The\nfeatures that are passed on to the final softmax classifier of the base network, are used for learning the EBM. It is trained for 150015001500 iterations with mini-batches of size 128128128. The learning rate is set to 0.00010.00010.0001. We use 303030 langevin iterations to sample from the EBM. We found that keeping an exponential moving average of the EBM model\nwas effective.\nThe implementations of the three prominent class-incremental methodologies (iCaRL [ref]41, LUCIR  and AANet [ref]31) follows the official code from AANet [ref]31 authors, released under an MIT license. They use an exemplar store of 202020 images per class. Note that our latent aligner does not use exemplars. The iCaRL inference is modified to use fully-connected layers following Castro et al. .\nAll results are mean of three runs.\nWe use an incremental version of Faster R-CNN  for object detection experiments, following iOD [ref]22. The 204820482048 dimensional penultimate feature vector from the RoI Head is used to learning the EBM.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: task.\nFor class-incremental learning of classifiers, we experiment with two prominent protocols that exist in the literature: a) train with half the total number of classes as the first task [ref]31 , and equal number of classes per task thereafter, b) ensure that each task (including the first) has equal number of classes [ref]41   . The former tests extreme class incremental learning\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
