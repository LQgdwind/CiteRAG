      "content": "Paper Title: Proposal-Free Temporal Action Detection via Global Segmentation Mask Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformers vs. CNNs \nWe compare our multi-scale Transformer with CNN for snippet embedding.\nWe consider two CNN designs:\n(1) a 1D CNN\nwith 3 dilation rates\n(1, 3, 5) each with 2 layers,\nand\n(2) a multi-scale MS-TCN ,\nand (3) a standard single-scale Transformer [ref]36.\nTable 5 shows that\nthe Transformers are clearly superior to both 1D-CNN and a relatively stronger MS-TCN. This suggests that our global segmentation mask learning is more compatible with self-attention models due to stronger contextual learning capability.\nBesides, multi-scale learning with Transformer gives 0.4%percent0.40.4\\% gain in avg mAP validating the importance of larger snippets. As shown in Table 5, the gain almost saturates from 200 snippets,\nand finer scale only increases the computational cost. Proposal-based vs. proposal-free\nWe compare our proposal-free TAGS with conventional proposal-based TAD methods BMN  (anchor-free) and R-C3D [ref]42 (anchor-based) via false positive analysis . We sort the predictions by the scores and take the top-scoring predictions per video. Two major errors of TAD are considered:\n(1) Localization error, which is defined as when a proposal/mask is predicted as foreground, has a minimum tIoU of 0.1 but does not meet the tIoU threshold.\n(2) Background error, which happens when a proposal/mask\nis predicted as foreground but its tIoU with ground truth instance is smaller than 0.1.\nIn this test, we use ActivityNet.\nWe observe in Fig. 5 that TAGS has the most true positive samples at every\namount of predictions. The proportion of localization error\nwith TAGS is also notably smaller,\nwhich is the most critical metric for improving average mAP .\nThis explains the gain of TAGS over BMN and R-C3D.\n\n Direction of improvement analysis \nTwo subtasks are involved in TAD – temporal localization and action classification, each of which would affect the final performance.\nGiven the two-branch design in TAGS,\nthe performance effect of one subtask can be individually examined\nby simply assigning ground-truth to the other subtask’s output at test time.\nFrom Table 7, the following observations can be made:\n(1) There is still a big scope for improvement on both subtasks.\n(2) Regarding the benefit from the improvement from the other subtask, the classification subtask seems to have the most to gain at mAP@0.5,\nwhilst the localization task can benefit more on the average mAP metric.\nOverall, this analysis suggests that further improving the efficacy on the classification subtask would be more influential to the final model performance. Analysis of components \nWe can see in Table 7 that without the proposed segmentation mask branch, the model will degrade significantly, e.g., a drop of 7.6% in average mAP. This is due to its fundamental capability of modeling the global temporal structure of action instances and hence yielding better action temporal intervals.\nFurther, for TAGS we use a pre-trained UntrimmedNet (UNet) [ref]37 as an external classifier instead of using the classification branch, resulted in a 2-stage method.\nThis causes a performance drop of 4.7%, suggesting\nthat both classification and mask branches\nare critical for model accuracy and efficiency. Global mask design\n\nWe compare our global mask with previous 1D actionness mask 8 .\nWe integrate actionness with TAGS by reformulating the mask branch to output 1D actionness. From the results in Table 8, we observe a significant performance drop of 11.5%percent11.511.5\\% in mAP@0.5 IOU. One reason is that the number of action candidates generated by actionness is drastically limited,\nleading to poor recall. Additionally, we\nvisualize the cosine similarity scores of all snippet feature pairs on a random ActivityNet val video. As shown in Fig. 8,\nour single-instance mask (global mask) design learns more discriminating feature representation with larger separation between background and action, as compared to multi-instance actionness design.\nThis validates the efficacy of our design in terms of\njointly learning multiple per-snippet masks each with focus on a single\naction instance.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: CNN for snippet embedding.\nWe consider two CNN designs:\n(1) a 1D CNN\nwith 3 dilation rates\n(1, 3, 5) each with 2 layers,\nand\n(2) a multi-scale MS-TCN ,\nand (3) a standard single-scale Transformer [ref]36.\nTable 5 shows that\nthe Transformers are clearly superior to both 1D-CNN and a relatively stronger MS-TCN.
