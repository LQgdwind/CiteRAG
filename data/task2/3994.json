      "content": "Paper Title: Theory and Applications of Probabilistic Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe coding theorem for Kolmogorov complexity roughly states that if a string x𝑥x can be sampled with probability δ𝛿\\delta by some algorithm A𝐴A, then its Kolmogorov complexity 𝖪​(x)𝖪𝑥\\mathsf{K}(x) is at most log⁡(1/δ)+OA​(1)1𝛿subscript𝑂𝐴1\\log(1/\\delta)+O_{A}(1). In particular, strings that can be generated with non-trivial probability by a program of small description length admit shorter representations. The coding theorem is a fundamental result in Kolmogorov complexity theory that has found many applications in theoretical computer science (see, e.g.,    ). In fact,  regards the coding theorem as one of the four pillars of Kolmogorov complexity.999The other three are incompressibility, language compression, and symmetry of information. The proof of the coding theorem crucially explores the time-unbounded feature of the Kolmogorov complexity measure, and it is unclear how it can be extended to the time-bounded setting. Ideally, we would like to show that if a string x𝑥x can be generated with probability δ𝛿\\delta by some efficiently samplable distribution, then its time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity 𝖪𝗍​(x)𝖪𝗍𝑥\\mathsf{Kt}(x) is about log⁡(1/δ)1𝛿\\log(1/\\delta). One reason why such a time-bounded coding theorem is hopeful is that it can be proven under certain strong derandomisation assumption .101010The assumption in  states that there is a language L∈𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤​[2O​(n)]𝐿𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤delimited-[]superscript2𝑂𝑛L\\in{\\sf TIME}\\!\\left[2^{O(n)}\\right] that requires Boolean circuits of size 2Ω​(n)superscript2Ω𝑛2^{\\Omega(n)} for all but finitely many n𝑛n, even in the presence of oracle gates to a Σ2psubscriptsuperscriptΣ𝑝2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}-complete problem in the circuit. In particular, under such an assumption, if a polynomial-time samplable distribution outputs a string x𝑥x with probability at least δ𝛿\\delta, then 𝖪𝗍​(x)≤log⁡(1/δ)+O​(log⁡n)𝖪𝗍𝑥1𝛿𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{Kt}(x)\\leq\\log(1/\\delta)+O(\\log n). However, the latter result is only conditional, in the sense that it relies on an unproven assumption that seems far beyond the reach of currently known techniques. Moreover, strong assumptions of this form could even be false. While it remains unclear whether we can obtain a coding theorem for 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt}, [ref]44 considered the problem of establishing an unconditional coding theorem in the randomised time-bounded setting. Somewhat surprisingly, it can be shown unconditionally that if a string x𝑥x can be sampled efficiently with probability δ𝛿\\delta, then 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)≤O​(log⁡1/δ)+O​(log⁡n)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥𝑂1𝛿𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(x)\\leq O(\\log 1/\\delta)+O(\\log n). In a subsequent work [ref]46, this result is further improved to 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)≤(2+o​(1))⋅log⁡1/δ+O​(log⁡n)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥⋅2𝑜11𝛿𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(x)\\leq(2+o(1))\\cdot\\log 1/\\delta+O(\\log n). Suppose there is an efficient algorithm A𝐴A for sampling strings such that A​(1n)𝐴superscript1𝑛A(1^{n}) outputs a string x∈{0,1}n𝑥superscript01𝑛x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} with probability at least δ𝛿\\delta. Then where the constant behind the O​(⋅)𝑂⋅O(\\cdot) depends on A𝐴A and is independent of the remaining parameters. Moreover, given x𝑥x, the code of A𝐴A, and δ𝛿\\delta, it is possible to compute in time 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(n,|A|)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛𝐴\\mathsf{poly}(n,|A|), with probability ≥0.99absent0.99\\geq 0.99, a probabilistic representation of x𝑥x that satisfies this 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}-complexity bound. (The running time of this algorithm does not depend on the time complexity of A𝐴A.) Similar to the results in the previous section that are concerned with the compressibility of prime numbers, the results of [ref]44 [ref]46 again show the power of utilizing randomness in Kolmogorov complexity, which enables us to establish results for time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity that seem very difficult to show in the deterministic setting. We refer to these papers for a discussion of the techniques employed to show an unconditional coding theorem for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}. We note that (as in previous work of [ref]44) the coding theorem in Theorem 10 has an unexpected constructive feature: it gives a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm that, when given x𝑥x, the code of the sampler, and δ𝛿\\delta, outputs a probabilistic representation of x𝑥x that certifies the claimed 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} complexity bound. (Additionally, the running time of this algorithm does not depend on the running time of the sampler.) Such an efficient coding theorem has interesting implications for search-to-decision reductions for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}. Recall that a search-to-decision reduction is an efficient procedure that allows one to find solutions to a problem from the mere ability to decide when a solution exists. Using results from [ref]44 [ref]46, one can show the following search-to-decision reduction for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}. Let 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} be a function that linearly approximates 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} complexity. That is, for every x∈{0,1}∗𝑥superscript01x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{*}, Then there is a randomised polynomial-time algorithm with access to 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O} that, when given an input string x𝑥x, outputs with probability ≥0.99absent0.99\\geq 0.99 a valid 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} representation of x𝑥x of complexity O​(𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x))𝑂𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥O(\\mathsf{rKt}(x)). Furthermore, this algorithm makes a single query q𝑞q to 𝒪𝒪\\mathcal{O}, where q=x𝑞𝑥q=x. We would like to invoke Theorem 10 to efficiently compute an 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} representation of x𝑥x, but the “moreover” part of this result requires the explicit code of a sampler. The idea is to construct a “universal” sampler that outputs x𝑥x with the desired probability, then to hit this sampler with an appropriate coding theorem for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}. For simplicity, suppose we knew the exact value k=𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)∈ℕ𝑘𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥ℕk=\\mathsf{rKt}(x)\\in\\mathbb{N}. Consider the following sampler A𝐴A:\n A​(1n)𝐴superscript1𝑛A(1^{n}): Randomly selects a randomised program M𝑀M of length k𝑘k among all strings in {0,1}ksuperscript01𝑘\\{0,1\\}^{k}. Run M𝑀M for at most 2ksuperscript2𝑘2^{k} steps, then output the n𝑛n-bit string that M𝑀M outputs during this simulation (or the string 0nsuperscript0𝑛0^{n} if M𝑀M does not stop or its output is not an n𝑛n-bit string).\n Note that A𝐴A runs in time t=𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(n,2k)=𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(2k)𝑡𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛superscript2𝑘𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒superscript2𝑘t=\\mathsf{poly}(n,2^{k})=\\mathsf{poly}(2^{k}) (since k≥log⁡n𝑘𝑛k\\geq\\log n for any n𝑛n-bit string), and that it outputs x𝑥x with probability at least δ=2−k⋅2/3𝛿⋅superscript2𝑘23\\delta=2^{-k}\\cdot 2/3, since by the definition of k𝑘k at least one such program prints x𝑥x with probability at least 2/3232/3. By the coding theorem for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} from [ref]44 (which is stated in a slightly more general form than Theorem 10), one obtains that 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)=O​(log⁡(1/δ))+O​(log⁡t)=O​(k)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥𝑂1𝛿𝑂𝑡𝑂𝑘\\mathsf{rKt}(x)=O(\\log(1/\\delta))+O(\\log t)=O(k). Since A𝐴A is an explicit algorithm, crucially, its “moreover” part implies that we can efficiently output an 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}-representation of x𝑥x of complexity O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k). This completes the sketch of the proof. We refer to [44, Section 4] for the formal proof of Theorem 11, which is a simple adaptation of the idea described here.\n∎ An interesting feature of the above search-to-decision reduction is that it is instance-wise in the sense that to produce\na near-optimal 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} representation of x𝑥x, we only need to make a single query to a decision oracle for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} on the same x𝑥x.111111This is also called a search-to-profile reduction in some references in Kolmogorov complexity . Note that there are known search-to-decision reductions in the context of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity with respect to various notions of complexity (e.g., 6  0 2  1), but they require an oracle to the decision problem that is correct on all or at least on a large fraction of inputs. As a consequence of this feature, we can easily derive the following result.121212Results of this form were previously known in time-unbounded Kolmogorov complexity (see 3). Given a string x𝑥x of length n𝑛n, it is possible to compute with probability ≥0.99absent0.99\\geq 0.99 and in polynomial time a collection of at most ℓ=log⁡(n)ℓ𝑛\\ell=\\log(n) strings M1,…,Mℓsubscript𝑀1…subscript𝑀ℓM_{1},\\ldots,M_{\\ell} such that at least one of these strings is a valid 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} representation of x𝑥x of complexity O​(𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x))𝑂𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥O(\\mathsf{rKt}(x)). We run the instance-wise search-to-decision reduction on the input x𝑥x. While it is not clear how to efficiently estimate 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥\\mathsf{rKt}(x), we can still “guess” the 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} complexity of x𝑥x to be of order 2isuperscript2𝑖2^{i}, for each i∈{1,2,…,log⁡n}𝑖12…𝑛i\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,\\log n\\}. We run the procedure on each possible guess, obtaining a list of strings M1,…,Mℓsubscript𝑀1…subscript𝑀ℓM_{1},\\ldots,M_{\\ell}, where ℓ=log⁡nℓ𝑛\\ell=\\log n. Since there is at least one value i𝑖i such that 2i=Θ​(𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x))superscript2𝑖Θ𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥2^{i}=\\Theta(\\mathsf{rKt}(x)), we have the guarantee that in this case the reduction outputs with probability at least 0.990.990.99 a valid 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} representation of x𝑥x of similar complexity. Therefore, the list contains with probability at least 0.990.990.99 a representation of the desired form.\n∎ While the above coding theorem for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} is a novel development after a long gap in an area with only conditional results, it has an important drawback: the 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} upper bound is at least 2log(1/δ))2\\log(1/\\delta)) and hence is sub-optimal. In contrast, the bounds in the time-unbounded setting and in the conditional result of  mentioned above have the form log⁡(1/δ)1𝛿\\log(1/\\delta). A natural question then is whether we can show a coding theorem for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} with an optimal dependence on the probability parameter δ𝛿\\delta, which is crucial in many applications of the result. It turns out that under a certain hypothesis about the security of cryptographic pseudorandom generators131313The hypothesis states that there is a pseudorandom generator G:{0,1}ℓ​(n)→{0,1}n:𝐺→superscript01ℓ𝑛superscript01𝑛G\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell(n)}\\to\\{0,1\\}^{n}, where (log⁡n)ω​(1)≤ℓ​(n)≤n/2superscript𝑛𝜔1ℓ𝑛𝑛2(\\log n)^{\\omega(1)}\\leq\\ell(n)\\leq n/2, computable in time poly⁡(n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(n) that is secure against uniform algorithms running in time 2(1−Ω​(1))⋅ℓ​(n)superscript2⋅1Ω1ℓ𝑛2^{(1-\\Omega(1))\\cdot\\ell(n)}. Note that every candidate PRG of seed length ℓ​(n)ℓ𝑛\\ell(n) can be broken in time 2ℓ​(n)⋅𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(n)⋅superscript2ℓ𝑛𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛2^{\\ell(n)}\\cdot\\mathsf{poly}(n) by trying all possible seeds. This hypothesis can be viewed as a cryptographic analogue of the well-known strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) about the complexity of k𝑘k-CNF SAT 3., the 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} bound in Theorem 10 is essentially optimal if we consider only coding theorems that are efficient, i.e., where an 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} representation can be constructed in polynomial time regardless of the running time of the sampler. In particular, [ref]46 showed that in this case, there is no efficient coding theorem that can achieve a bound of the form 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)≤(2−o​(1))⋅log⁡(1/δ)+poly⁡(log⁡n)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥⋅2𝑜11𝛿poly𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(x)\\leq(2-o(1))\\cdot\\log(1/\\delta)+\\operatorname{poly}(\\log n). On the other hand, the conditional coding theorem for 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} in  is not efficient. This leads to the following open problem on (unconditionally) showing an existential coding theorem for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} with optimal parameters. Show that if there is an efficient algorithm A𝐴A for sampling strings such that A​(1n)𝐴superscript1𝑛A(1^{n}) outputs a string x∈{0,1}n𝑥superscript01𝑛x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} with probability at least δ𝛿\\delta, then 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)≤log⁡(1/δ)+poly⁡(log⁡n)𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥1𝛿poly𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(x)\\leq\\log(1/\\delta)+\\operatorname{poly}(\\log n). To this point, we have mentioned the existence of an optimal coding theorem for time-unbounded Kolmogorov complexity and an optimal conditional coding theorem for 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} (in fact, the conditional result holds even for 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t} for t=𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(n)𝑡𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛t=\\mathsf{poly}(n)). Also, an unconditional coding theorem can be obtained for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} but its dependency on the probability parameter δ𝛿\\delta is not log⁡(1/δ)1𝛿\\log(1/\\delta) (Theorem 10). Note that 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} can be viewed as a “relaxed” notion of 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} and is intermediate between 𝖪𝖪\\mathsf{K} and 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt}. If we consider some further relaxed notion of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, can we show a coding theorem that is both unconditional and optimal? Note that the time-bounded measure 𝗉𝖪𝗉𝖪\\mathsf{pK} can be viewed as an intermediate notion between time-unbounded Kolmogorov complexity and time-bounded 𝗋𝖪𝗋𝖪\\mathsf{rK}. It turns out that 𝗉𝖪tsuperscript𝗉𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{pK}^{t} admits an optimal coding theorem. Suppose there is a randomised algorithm A𝐴A for sampling strings such that A​(1n)𝐴superscript1𝑛A(1^{n}) runs in time T​(n)≥n𝑇𝑛𝑛T(n)\\geq n and outputs a string x∈{0,1}n𝑥superscript01𝑛x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} with probability at least δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0. Then where t​(n)=poly⁡(T​(n))𝑡𝑛poly𝑇𝑛t(n)=\\operatorname{poly}\\!\\left(T(n)\\right) and the constant behind the O​(⋅)𝑂⋅O(\\cdot) depends on |A|𝐴|A| and is independent of the remaining parameters. The proof of Theorem 14 is similar in spirit to that of the conditional coding theorem for 𝖪polysuperscript𝖪poly\\mathsf{K}^{\\operatorname{poly}} in . As an application of the latter,  showed a conditional characterisation of the worst-case running times of languages that are in average polynomial time over all samplable distributions. Using Theorem 14, [ref]46 provided an unconditional characterisation, and this will be discussed in Section 6. Finally, we can connect the time-bounded coding theorems discussed in this section to the compressibility of prime numbers discussed in the previous section, via the following equivalence. Let δ:ℕ→ :𝛿→ℕ01\\delta\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to  be a time-constructible function. The following statements are equivalent. Samplability. There is a randomised algorithm A𝐴A for sampling strings such that, for infinitely many (resp. all but finitely many) n𝑛n, A​(1n)𝐴superscript1𝑛A(1^{n}) runs in time (1/δ​(n))O​(1)superscript1𝛿𝑛𝑂1(1/\\delta(n))^{O(1)} and outputs an n𝑛n-bit prime qnsubscript𝑞𝑛q_{n} with probability at least δ​(n)O​(1)𝛿superscript𝑛𝑂1\\delta(n)^{O(1)}. Compressibility. For infinitely many (resp. all but finitely many) n𝑛n, there is an n𝑛n-bit prime pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} with 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(pn)=O​(log⁡(1/δ​(n)))𝗋𝖪𝗍subscript𝑝𝑛𝑂1𝛿𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(p_{n})=O(\\log(1/\\delta(n))). The implication from (i) to (ii) relies on the existing coding theorem for 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt}. The other direction employs a universal sampler in the spirit of the proof of Theorem 11 sketched above. See [ref]44 for the details.\n∎ Theorem 15 can be seen as an analogue of the relation between deterministically constructing large primes and obtaining 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} upper bounds for primes, which was explained in Section 1. Using this result, the problem of showing that prime numbers have smaller 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} complexity (Problem 9) can be reduced to showing the existence of a faster sampling algorithm for primes. In particular, if we can sample an n𝑛n-bit prime pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} in time 2poly⁡(log⁡n)superscript2poly𝑛2^{\\operatorname{poly}(\\log n)} with probability at least 2−poly⁡(log⁡n)superscript2poly𝑛2^{-\\operatorname{poly}(\\log n)}, then 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(pn)≤poly⁡(log⁡n)𝗋𝖪𝗍subscript𝑝𝑛poly𝑛\\mathsf{rKt}(p_{n})\\leq\\operatorname{poly}(\\log n). We remark that an even tighter equivalence between samplability and compressibility can be established using 𝗉𝖪tsuperscript𝗉𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{pK}^{t} complexity, thanks to the optimality of Theorem 14.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: beyond the reach of currently known techniques.
