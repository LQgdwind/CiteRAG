      "content": "Paper Title: Learning a Generic Value-Selection Heuristic Inside a Constraint Programming Solver\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBengio et al.  identified three ways to leverage machine learning for combinatorial optimization.\nFirst, end-to-end learning aims to solve the problem only with a trained ML model. This has been, for instance, considered for\nthe traveling salesman problem  . However, such an approach does not guarantee the validity nor optimality of the solution obtained. Second, learning to configure is dedicated\nto providing insights to a solver before its execution. This can be, for instance, the decision to linearize the problem in the context of quadratic programs  or to learn when a decomposition is appropriate [ref]26.\nThis approach is also referred to as parameter tuning .\nWe refer to the initial survey for extended information about these two families of approaches.\nThird, learning within a search procedure uses machine learning within the solver.\nOur contribution belongs to this last category of methods.\nAlthough the idea of combining learning and searching for solving combinatorial optimization problems was already discussed in the nineties , it has re-emerged recently with the rise of deep learning.\nMost combinatorial optimization solvers are based on branch-and-bound and backtracking.\nIn this context, ML is often used with branching rules to follow. Imitation learning \nhas been for instance used to replicate the expensive strong branching strategy for mixed-integer programming solvers  .\nOne limitation of imitation learning is that the performances are bounded by the performance of the imitated strategy, which remains heuristic\nand perfectible 3.\nThis opens the door for RL approaches that have the guarantee to find the best branching strategy eventually .\nA branching strategy can be split into two challenging decisions, variable-selection and value-selection.\nReinforcement learning approaches have been considered for both of them. Concerning the learning for selecting the next variable to branch on, Song et al. 2 proposed to combine\na double deep Q-network algorithm 9 with a graph neural network for carrying out this task.\nThe approach is trained to minimize the expected number of nodes to reach a leaf node using the first-fail principle.\nAlthough this is a good proxy for pruning a maximum of infeasible solutions for a constraint satisfaction problem,\nit does not extend naturally to optimization variants, for which one should consider a trade-off between the quality of the solution found and the number of nodes required to reach that solution.\nSimilarly, van Driel et al. 8 leveraged a graph neural network to initialize a variable-selection heuristic\nfor Chuffed, a hybrid CP-SAT solver. In an online setting,\nDoolard and Yorke-Smith  also proposed to learn variable ordering heuristics where training time is included in the total solving time.\nBandit-based learning approaches were also considered by\nXia and Yap to automatically select search heuristics 0. For the value-selection heuristic,\nChu and Stuckey  introduced a scoring function which gives a score indicating how good an assignation is,\ngiven the current domain. A training phase is the carried out in a supervised manner\nto learn this scoring function. Cappart et al.  proposed to train a model with reinforcement learning outside the CP solver and to integrate the agent, once trained, subsequently in the solver. This has been achieved by reaping the benefits of a dynamic programming formulation of a combinatorial problem.\nAn important limitation of this work is that no information related to the CP solver, such as the propagation achieved on a node, can be used to drive the decision. Chalumeau et al.  mitigated this issue by carrying out the learning inside the solver.\nThe model is trained to find the optimal solution and to prove it with the least number of explored search nodes.\nHowever, this goal is disconnected from finding the best solution as quickly as possible and is practically hard to achieve, even with a good heuristic.\nA more realistic goal is to find a good solution quickly without closing the search.\nThis is how the contribution of this paper is positioned. We want to point out that learning how to branch is not the only way to leverage ML inside a combinatorial optimization solver.\nRelated works have also been proposed on learning tight optimization bounds  or for accelerating\ncolumn generation approaches .\nA recurrent design choice is an architecture based on graph neural networks. We refer to the following survey for\nmore information about combinatorial optimization with graph neural networks .\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: insights to a solver before its execution. This can be, for instance, the decision to linearize the problem in the context of quadratic programs  or to learn when a decomposition is appropriate [ref]26.\nThis approach is also referred to as parameter tuning .\nWe refer to the initial survey for extended information about these two families of approaches.\nThird, learning within a search\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
