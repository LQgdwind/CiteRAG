      "content": "Paper Title: DeepSeq: Deep Sequential Circuit Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) in the past decade, its application in the electronic design automation (EDA) field has become a hot research topic  . Many DL-based techniques are proposed to improve circuit design and test solutions, and they fall into two categories. The first class of solutions targets different EDA problems independently and solves them from scratch   [ref]5. Specifically, these solutions either learn a policy to replace the empirical decision-making choices in traditional heuristics  or model the circuit directly for performance prediction and/or optimization  [ref]5. Despite showing promising results, these solutions require careful model design and tuning for every problem from scratch. The second class of solutions is motivated by the transfer learning paradigm in DL where a pre-trained model is employed to solve multiple downstream tasks [ref]6 . First, a generic representation of circuit netlists is learned. Next, the model is fine-tuned with a small amount of task-specific data for various downstream EDA tasks  [ref]9. For example,  learns a generic gate-level representation of combinational circuits, and it is later applied to test point insertion (TPI) task0. This class of solutions is more appealing than the previous one since the learned representations are capable of dealing with a vast set of EDA problems with limited efforts in fine-tuning, instead of solving each problem independently. However, existing works in circuit representation learning are only applicable for combinational circuits  [ref]9. Due to the presence of memory elements (e.g., flip-flops – FFs) in sequential netlists, the circuit behavior is reflected as state transitions at each clock cycle. Consequently, it is essential to capture such behavior by learning effective embeddings on the memory elements, which is an important yet challenging problem to resolve. To this end, we propose DeepSeq, a novel representation learning framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) for sequential netlists.\nFor the combinational components of the sequential netlists, we follow the DeepGate framework  and convert them into an optimized and-inverter graph (AIG) format. Consequently, the transformed sequential circuits contain only 2-input AND gates, inverters, and FFs, which are represented as directed graphs with four type of nodes (primary inputs are treated as a special type of nodes). Given the sequential netlist in AIG format, DeepSeq employs a novel DAG-GNN architecture equipped with a customized propagation scheme and a dedicated aggregation mechanism named Dual Attention to effectively learn the temporal correlations between gates and FFs. Moreover, to effectively learn sequential circuit behavior, we introduce a multi-task 1 training objective. Specifically, we use two sets of strongly related supervision: state transition probabilities and logic probabilities (the probability of being logic ‘1’) on each node.\nSuch a joint supervision scheme helps to direct DeepSeq towards learning informative representations that reflect the true logical behavior of the underlying sequential netlists. In this way, we effectively encode the computational and structural information of sequential circuits into the embeddings of logic gates and FFs.  DeepSeq has the potential to facilitate many downstream EDA tasks in sequential circuit design and analysis. We evaluate it on two tasks, i.e., power estimation and reliability analysis. Experimental results show that DeepSeq not only produces the accurate estimates of dynamic power across different designs under diverse set of workloads but also generalizes well to circuit reliability task. We summarize the contributions of our work as follows: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to learn a generic representation of sequential circuits. We propose a novel DAG-GNN architecture to effectively model the working mechanism of sequential circuits. We design a multi-task learning objective with two sets of related supervision: i) transition probabilities and ii) logic probabilities, which facilitate to capture the behavior of sequential netlists. We propose a dedicated aggregator function, i.e., dual attention that mimics the logic computation and transition probabilities calculation in sequential circuits. We demonstrate the efficacy and generalization capability of pre-trained DeepSeq on two downstream power estimation and reliability analysis tasks, and it is almost faithful to the results obtained from simulation based power and reliability estimation. We organize the remainder of this paper as follows. We review related works in Section II. Section III introduces the DeepSeq framework, while in Section IV, we present the experimental results of transition and logic probabilities prediction. In Section IV, we show the results on the downstream power estimation and reliability analysis tasks. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: are proposed to improve circuit design and test solutions, and they fall into two categories.
