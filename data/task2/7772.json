      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Dynamic Logic — Towards A Cyclic Logical Framework for Program Verification via Operational Semantics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReasoning about programs directly through their executable semantics is not a new idea.\nAs far as we know, the first related work was\nmatching logic, proposed by Rosu and Stefanescu in [ref]36.\nMatching logic is based on patterns and pattern matching.\nIts basic form, a reachability rule φ⇒φ′⇒𝜑superscript𝜑′\\varphi\\Rightarrow\\varphi^{\\prime} (note that ⇒⇒\\Rightarrow means differently there than in our sequents), captures whether pattern φ′superscript𝜑′\\varphi^{\\prime} is reachable from pattern φ𝜑\\varphi in a given pattern reachability system.\nOne-path reachability logic  and all-paths reachability logic \nwere developed based on matching logic by adding conditional rules and a all-paths reachability rule φ⇒∀φ′superscript⇒for-all𝜑superscript𝜑′\\varphi\\Rightarrow^{\\forall}\\varphi^{\\prime} respectively.\nThe concept of ‘patterns’ in matching/reachability logics has a wider scope of meaning than the concepts of ‘programs’, ‘configurations’ and ‘formulas’ in 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}.\nThe program specifications described with modal operator [⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot] in 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} cannot be expressed in matching logic and one-path reachability logic when the program models are non-deterministic, as [⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot] captures “the reachability of ALL execution paths”.\nHowever, the semantics of [⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot] can be captured by the reachability rule φ⇒∀φ′superscript⇒for-all𝜑superscript𝜑′\\varphi\\Rightarrow^{\\forall}\\varphi^{\\prime} in all-paths reachability logic.\nA more powerful matching μ𝜇\\mu-logic  was developed by adding a least fixpoint μ𝜇\\mu-binder to matching logic.\nWe conjecture that matching μ𝜇\\mu-logic can encode 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}, as it has been declared in  that it can encode traditional dynamic logics.\nSo compared to reachability logic and matching-μ𝜇\\mu logic, our contribution is not about expressiveness, but that we propose a different proof theory rooted in cyclic reasoning (rather than coinduction ) and the theory of dynamic logic for program verification via operational semantics. Compared to all matching, reachability and matching-μ𝜇\\mu logics above, one advantage of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} is that\n𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} comes to program deductions in a more natural and direct way, in the sense that the concepts of ‘programs’ and ‘configurations’ are explicitly expressed, and programs and formulas are clearly separated by the modal operator [⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot].\nAs we put previously, this brings a benefit that we can observe how program behaviours evolve independently from the formulas along the whole derivation processes.\nOn the other hand,\nto express a 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} specification like (σ:ϕ)⇒(σ:⟨α⟩ψ)(\\sigma:\\phi)\\Rightarrow{}(\\sigma:\\langle\\alpha\\rangle\\psi) in matching logic for example,\none needs to ‘mix up’ all structures together to form a pattern, in a form like: φ=d​fα∧σ∧ϕsubscript𝑑𝑓𝜑𝛼𝜎italic-ϕ\\varphi=_{df}\\alpha\\wedge\\sigma\\wedge\\phi and φ′=d​f↓∧σ′∧ψ\\varphi^{\\prime}=_{df}\\downarrow\\wedge\\sigma^{\\prime}\\wedge\\psi for some configuration σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime}, in order to prove the reachability rule φ⇒φ′⇒𝜑superscript𝜑′\\varphi\\Rightarrow{}\\varphi^{\\prime}.  proposed a general program verification framework based on coinduction, the theory the reachability logics   also rely on.\nUsing the terminology in this paper,\nin  a program specification can be expressed as a pair (c,P)𝑐𝑃(c,P) with c𝑐c a program state and P𝑃P a set of program states, capturing the exact meaning of\nformula σ:[α]​ϕ:𝜎delimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ\\sigma:[\\alpha]\\phi in 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} if we let c𝑐c be (α,σ)𝛼𝜎(\\alpha,\\sigma) and let set P𝑃P be the semantics of formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi.\nThe authors designed a method to derive a program specification (c,P)𝑐𝑃(c,P) in a coinductive way\naccording to the operational semantics of c𝑐c.\nThe soundness of the method is proved by using the greatest fixpoint theory on mathematical sets.\nFollowing ,  also proposed a general framework for program reasoning, but via big-step semantics.\nUnlike the frameworks in  and , which are directly based on set theory,\n𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} has an explicit form of logic, which is more suitable in some cases to catch specifications.\nThe proof system of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} is based on the cyclic proof theory (cf. ) rather than coinduction, where\nespecially, the soundness of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} is proved by contradiction on the well-foundedness of partial-order relations.\nBesides, in 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}, one can also express and derive the negation of a dynamic formula σ:[α]​ϕ:𝜎delimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ\\sigma:[\\alpha]\\phi as the dual formula σ:⟨α⟩​¬ϕ:𝜎delimited-⟨⟩𝛼italic-ϕ\\sigma:\\langle\\alpha\\rangle\\neg\\phi, whose meaning cannot be captured in the framework of . The structure ‘updates’ in traditional dynamic logics, used in Java dynamic logic , differential dynamic logic , dynamic trace logic , etc., works as a special case of the configurations in this paper. As illustrated at the end of Section 4.1, a configuration is more than just a calculus for substitutions of variables and terms. The proof system of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} relies on the cyclic proof theory which firstly arose in 0, and later developed in\ndifferent logics such as , , etc.\nTraditional dynamic logics’ proof systems are not cyclic ones.\nIn ,\nJungteerapanich proposed a complete cyclic proof system for μ𝜇\\mu-calculus, which subsumes propositional dynamic logic (PDL)  in its expressiveness. In , Docherty and Rowe proposed a complete labelled cyclic proof system for PDL.\nBoth μ𝜇\\mu-calculus and PDL are logics with regular expressions with tests as their program models, which are not in a parameterized form like the program models of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}.\nThe labelled form of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formula σ:[α]​ϕ:𝜎delimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ\\sigma:[\\alpha]\\phi comes from , where a labelled PDL formula is of the form s:[α]​ϕ:𝑠delimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕs:[\\alpha]\\phi, with s𝑠s a state in Kripke structure.\nRather than just a state,\na configuration σ𝜎\\sigma in 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} allow more forms rather than functions mapping variables to values (see our Example 2).\n has inspired us to use the well-founded relation ≺msubscriptprecedes𝑚\\prec_{m} in the proof of the soundness of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}, though we take a different proof approach since unlike PDL, 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formulas do not satisfy the “finite model property” (cf. ).\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Reasoning about programs directly through their executable semantics is not a new idea.\nAs far as we know, the first related work was\nmatching logic, proposed by Rosu and Stefanescu in [ref]36.\nMatching logic is based on patterns and pattern matching.\nIts basic form, a reachability rule φ⇒φ′⇒𝜑superscript𝜑′\\varphi\\Rightarrow\\varphi^{\\prime} (note that ⇒⇒\\Rightarrow means differently\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
