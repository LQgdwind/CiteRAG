      "content": "Paper Title: Stopping Criteria for Value Iteration on Stochastic Games with Quantitative Objectives This research was funded in part by DFG projects 383882557 ‚ÄúSUV‚Äù and 427755713 ‚ÄúGOPro‚Äù.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBeside VI there are several techniques used to solve MDP or SG.\nLinear programming (LP) typically yields solutions to MDP problems running in polynomial time.\nIn contrast, for games, LP cannot capture the opposite goals of the players and we have to resort to quadratic programming¬†, which, using current methods, is either practically infeasible or exponential in the size of the SG¬†.\nBesides, even in MDP the use of LP is practically limited, since it does not perform well on larger models¬† .\nThus, for both MDP and SG, usually either strategy iteration (SI) or value iteration are preferred. Strategy iteration  computes a sequence of improving strategies in at most exponentially many iterations  [ref]25.\nUpon termination, the algorithm returns a guaranteed optimal strategy, i.e.¬†one achieving the optimal value.\nHowever, the intermediate results only provide one-sided (converging) approximation of the result.\n(Indeed, SI improves and evaluates the strategies of one player only, since alternating improvement for both players may not terminate due to cycling¬†.)\nConsequently, in order to obtain a guaranteed approximation, SI must finish the whole computation, which may be infeasible for large systems.\nOur stopping criterion extends to SI, providing a simple fix, and thus yields (to the best of our knowledge) the first anytime SI algorithm with guaranteed approximation even before termination. Value iteration only is guaranteed to yield the precise result after a number of steps exponential in the size of the SG as well as the denominators of its quantities , which is infeasible even for toy games.\nMoreover, there are SG (even MDP) where this exponential number of steps indeed is necessary¬†.\nDespite the imprecision for the practically whole time of the algorithm execution, using VI to compute ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon-precise solutions has been the most popular technique for MDP   and SG  even without stopping criteria.\nThis is because it (i)¬†performs even better than SI on MDP  , (ii)¬†uses heuristics exploiting that the result is imprecise anyway (asynchronous VI and partial exploration   ), and (iii)¬†performs on par with SI on SG . The survey  provides a general treatment of VI on various models and objectives.\nWhile it discusses convergence and the worst-case analysis, we strengthen this with error bounds and anytime algorithms, providing better practical performance.\nIt also conjectures VI is extensible to SG with long-run average reward, which we prove in this paper.\nFor total reward, our starting point are algorithms presented in  which converge in the limit. Finally, there are also further, mostly theoretical techniques to solve games, such as reducing SG with long-run average reward to SG with discounted reward or with reachability  at the cost of introducing impractically small quantities, leading to a very poor convergence rate.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: both MDP and SG, usually either strategy iteration (SI) or value iteration are preferred.
