To support the implementation of machine learning applications, methodologies have been proposed in a general manner   . Additionally, extensions of such methods with particular support for data science in the engineering domain are introduced [ref]4 [ref]27.\nIn literature, the methods of the CIRSP-DM  and KDDÂ  are assessed in a comparative study . According to , CRISP-DM is a kind of implementation of the KDD process. In the following, CRISP-DM is described and used as basis for the structure of the proposed method described in Section 3. In CRISP-DM, six core steps are defined supporting the implementation of a DM application: Business Understanding: Project objectives, requirements and an understanding from a business level is achieved. Based thereon, a DM problem is defined and a rough roadmap is elaborated. Data Understanding: Data is collected to understand the situation from a data point of view. Data Preparation The construction of the final dataset for the learning algorithm based on raw data and data transformations. Modeling: Various or sometimes one algorithm is selected and applied to elaborated dataset from the previous step. In this step, so-called hyperparameter tuning is applied to vary on parameter values and achieve a most valuable result. Evaluation: The result of the algorithm is evaluated against metrics and the objectives from the first step. Deployment: The achievements are presented in a way that a customer or an implementation team can use it for further integration.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: digging of such information to derive knowledge is called data mining (DM).\nMachine learning (ML) is one subfield of DM, which automatically allows computer programs to improve through experience [ref]23.\nMachine learning algorithms aim to solve a (specific) problem to eliminate the need for being explicitly programmed .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
