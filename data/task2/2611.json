      "content": "Paper Title: SemIE: Semantically-aware Image Extrapolation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis is the final stage (stage 4) which converts the extrapolated semantic label map back into a colored image. This stage takes in input 𝐗′(∈ℝh1×w1×c′)annotatedsuperscript𝐗′absentsuperscriptℝsubscriptℎ1subscript𝑤1superscript𝑐′\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}}(\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h_{1}\\times w_{1}\\times c^{\\prime}}) (Figure 2), which is concatenation of the extrapolated semantic label map obtained from the second stage, the cropped (input) image, the boundary map obtained using the panoptic label map obtained from the previous stage and the feature map obtained using the proposed Instance-aware Context Normalization. The output is an RGB image 𝐘∈ℝh1×w1×3𝐘superscriptℝsubscriptℎ1subscript𝑤13\\mathbf{Y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h_{1}\\times w_{1}\\times 3}. This is different from prior conditional GANs problems [ref]15  [ref]32  since they synthesize RGB images from semantic label maps, but we have to synthesize RGB images from semantic label maps, given some pixel information of the to-be-synthesized RGB image, which is the cropped image in our case. Here, we have to take care of texture consistency in the synthesized image while maintaining an identity mapping from the input image to the corresponding part in the final image. Generator\nWe use SPADE [ref]32 normalization residual blocks for each of the layers in the generator. We use similar learning objective functions, as used in SPADE [ref]32 and pix2pixHD : GAN loss with hinge-term    (ℒG​A​Nsubscriptℒ𝐺𝐴𝑁\\mathcal{L}_{GAN}), Feature matching loss  based on the discriminator (ℒF​Msubscriptℒ𝐹𝑀\\mathcal{L}_{FM}) and VGGNet  for perceptual losses   (ℒV​G​Gsubscriptℒ𝑉𝐺𝐺\\mathcal{L}_{VGG}) Instance-aware Context Normalization (IaCN)\nOutpainting-SRN  proposed Context Normalization (CN) to maintain texture consistency between the inside (cropped) region and the outside (outpainted) region. It involves transferring the mean feature or color from the inside region to the outside region. However, we believe that transferring this input mean color directly to the outside region is not suitable for images that have very diverse object instances (like outdoor images, street images). To this end, we propose Instance-aware Context Normalization (IaCN) (Figure 2), which takes as input the cropped image and the instance map. IaCN module computes the mean color using the input (cropped) image for all the partial instances. Partial instances refer to the instances which get extrapolated in the final image. Since the problem with texture consistency occurs only for partial instances, therefore we compute features only for them. These computed feature maps are then concatenated to the input. Discriminators\nWe propose to use two discriminators, i) a traditional image discriminator (multi-scale discriminator) that attempts to differentiate between the real and the fake image, ii) a patch co-occurrence discriminator similar to , which employed it to ensure texture transfer   from an input image to the target image to be edited. We employ a similar idea wherein the region in the image that needs to be extrapolated takes the role of the target image (equation 2). This facilitates consistent texture transfer from the inside region (source) to the extrapolated region (target) (illustrated in Figure 4). Here x𝑥x is the input and y𝑦y is the corresponding ground-truth image. c​r​o​p​(y)𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦crop(y) function takes a random patch from image y𝑦y and c​r​o​p​s​(y)𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑠𝑦crops(y) takes 4 random patches from image y𝑦y, which serve as the reference patches. The details of the network architectures for all generators and discriminators for the various stages are provided in Section A. Variational Autoencoder\nTo ensure appropriate style transfer from the input image, we use an encoder that processes the input image, which is then fed to the generator. We use the encoder used in [ref]32. This encoder forms a VAE [ref]19 with the generator. In the objective function, we add a KL-Divergence Loss term [ref]19 (ℒK​L​Dsubscriptℒ𝐾𝐿𝐷\\mathcal{L}_{KLD}).\n\n\n\nFinal Objective\nThe training objective is as shown below in equation 3:\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Normalization.
