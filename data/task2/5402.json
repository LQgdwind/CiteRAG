Notations and Conditions: We first detail some notations and the required conditions in Thm. 5.1 below.\nDenote 𝑾j∈ℝn×1subscript𝑾𝑗superscriptℝ𝑛1\\bm{W}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times 1} as the row vector of a matrix 𝑾∈ℝ(d+1)×n𝑾superscriptℝ𝑑1𝑛\\bm{W}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(d+1)\\times n} for j=1,⋯​d+1𝑗1⋯𝑑1j=1,\\cdots d+1. Let supp(v)={i:vi≠0}supp𝑣conditional-set𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖0\\operatorname*{supp}(v)=\\{i:v_{i}\\neq 0\\} denote the support of a vector v𝑣v, which is the set of indices of nonzero terms of v𝑣v. The first condition requires a bounded true matrix 𝑩𝑩\\bm{B} as follows. The true matrix 𝑩∈ℝ(d+1)×(d+1)𝑩superscriptℝ𝑑1𝑑1\\bm{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(d+1)\\times(d+1)} is bounded such that ‖𝑩‖2=𝒪​(1)subscriptnorm𝑩2𝒪1\\|\\bm{B}\\|_{2}=\\mathcal{O}(1),\nand the maximum degree across different rows is less than the number of nodes in the graph, i.e., s0=maxj​supp(𝑩j)≤d+1subscript𝑠0subscript𝑗suppsubscript𝑩𝑗𝑑1s_{0}=\\max_{j}{\\operatorname*{supp}(\\bm{B}_{j})}\\leq d+1. Next, we recall the linear structural equation model condition on 𝑾≡[g​(𝒁)⊤,Y]⊤𝑾superscript𝑔superscript𝒁top𝑌top\\bm{W}\\equiv[g(\\bm{Z})^{\\top},Y]^{\\top} as follows. Suppose Model (1) such that 𝑾=𝑩⊤​𝑾+ϵ𝑾superscript𝑩top𝑾bold-italic-ϵ\\bm{W}=\\bm{B}^{\\top}\\bm{W}+\\bm{\\epsilon}, with independent Gaussian error ϵbold-italic-ϵ\\bm{\\epsilon} and the error variance is a constant σ2superscript𝜎2\\sigma^{2}. Furthermore, define the order as ν=[ν1,ν2,⋯,νd+1]⊤𝜈superscriptsubscript𝜈1subscript𝜈2⋯subscript𝜈𝑑1top\\nu=[\\nu_{1},\\nu_{2},\\cdots,\\nu_{d+1}]^{\\top} is a permutation of indices {1,2,…,d,d+1}12…𝑑𝑑1\\{1,2,...,d,d+1\\} of nodes in the causal graph, such that νj∈{1,2,…,d+1}subscript𝜈𝑗12…𝑑1\\nu_{j}\\in\\{1,2,...,d+1\\}. If we set the last node to be the target variable, then the last index is fixed to be d+1𝑑1d+1. Let 𝑩​(ν)𝑩𝜈\\bm{B}(\\nu) as 𝑩​(ν)=[𝑩1​(ν),⋯,𝑩d+1​(ν)]⊤𝑩𝜈superscriptsubscript𝑩1𝜈⋯subscript𝑩𝑑1𝜈top\\bm{B}(\\nu)=[\\bm{B}_{1}(\\nu),\\cdots,\\bm{B}_{d+1}(\\nu)]^{\\top}, such that Note that the true causal graph 𝑩𝑩\\bm{B} that generates 𝑾𝑾\\bm{W} also has a topological order, ν∗superscript𝜈\\nu^{*}, which is called the true topological order (this true order may not be unique). Then the true causal graph 𝑩𝑩\\bm{B} can also be denoted as 𝑩​(ν∗)𝑩superscript𝜈\\bm{B}(\\nu^{*}). Denote the set of all permuations of {1,2,⋯,d+1}12⋯𝑑1\\{1,2,\\cdots,d+1\\} as ΥΥ\\Upsilon and the set of true order as Υ∗superscriptΥ\\Upsilon^{*} such that Υ∗⊂ΥsuperscriptΥΥ\\Upsilon^{*}\\subset\\Upsilon. Denote the order of 𝑩^^𝑩\\widehat{\\bm{B}} as ν∈Υ𝜈Υ\\nu\\in\\Upsilon, so 𝑩^^𝑩\\widehat{\\bm{B}} can also be notated as 𝑩^​(ν)^𝑩𝜈\\widehat{\\bm{B}}(\\nu). Then let sj​(ν)=supp(𝑩j​(ν)),s^j​(ν)=supp(𝑩^j​(ν))formulae-sequencesubscript𝑠𝑗𝜈suppsubscript𝑩𝑗𝜈subscript^𝑠𝑗𝜈suppsubscript^𝑩𝑗𝜈s_{j}(\\nu)=\\operatorname*{supp}(\\bm{B}_{j}(\\nu)),\\widehat{s}_{j}(\\nu)=\\operatorname*{supp}(\\widehat{\\bm{B}}_{j}(\\nu)). The last condition assumes the consistency of the topological ordering.\n The true topological ordering of 𝑩𝑩\\bm{B}, i.e., ν∗superscript𝜈\\nu^{*}, is consistently estimated.\n Condition D.3 is commonly imposed when proving the error bound of causal structural learning results [see Condition (A6) in  33]. Overview of Proof: With the aforementioned three conditions, our proof follows similar strategies of the causal structural learning literature [e.g., 33] but accounts for the extra penalty term from causal effects. Notice that the explicit forms of causal effects under LSEM are linear combinations of elements of 𝑩𝑩\\bm{B}. This implies our new regulation can similarly vanish away as n𝑛n goes to infinity. For simplicity, in the rest of the proof, we show the consistency given a selection function g𝑔g for brevity.\nTo start with, proving the consistency of 𝑩^^𝑩\\widehat{\\bm{B}}\nreturned by NSCSL with NOTEARS as baseline is equivalent to showing that the 𝑩^^𝑩\\widehat{\\bm{B}} solving is consistent.\nThen the proof of Thm. 5.1 follows the same strategy as the proof of Proposition 1 in . The key difference between Thm. 5.1 and Proposition 1 in  is that the loss function in (D.18) contains extra penalty term h2​(𝑩)=δ∗−∑i=1d|C​E^i​(𝑩)|+∑i=1d+1|bi,d+1|subscriptℎ2𝑩superscript𝛿superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑑subscript^𝐶𝐸𝑖𝑩superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑑1subscript𝑏𝑖𝑑1h_{2}(\\bm{B})=\\delta^{*}-\\sum_{i=1}^{d}|\\widehat{CE}_{i}(\\bm{B})|+\\sum_{i=1}^{d+1}|b_{i,d+1}|, that involves causal effect information compared to the original loss function in [ref]46.\nIn this proof, we need to show a main statement and the rest of the proof will follow the same procedure of Steps 2-3 in Appendix Section 9 of . The Main Statement is: with λ𝜆\\lambda satisfy the bound of 𝒪​((n​log⁡n)1/2)𝒪superscript𝑛𝑛12\\mathcal{O}({(n\\log{n})}^{1/2}) for arbitrary ν∈Υ𝜈Υ\\nu\\in\\Upsilon. Proof of Main Statement:\nSince 𝑩^​(ν)^𝑩𝜈\\widehat{\\bm{B}}(\\nu) solves (D.18),\nwe have Following Theorem 7.1 in Van de Geer & Bühlmann [ref]40 and Shi & Li , we can transform (D.19) to for some κ>0𝜅0\\kappa>0.\nRecall D.2 such that 𝑾=𝑩⊤​𝑾+ϵ𝑾superscript𝑩top𝑾bold-italic-ϵ\\bm{W}=\\bm{B}^{\\top}\\bm{W}+\\bm{\\epsilon} with ϵ∼N​(𝟎n×1,𝑰n×σ2)similar-tobold-italic-ϵ𝑁superscript0𝑛1subscript𝑰𝑛superscript𝜎2\\bm{\\epsilon}\\sim N(\\bm{0}^{n\\times 1},\\bm{I}_{n}\\times\\sigma^{2}).\nFrom Equation (65) in , we have 0<κ∗<σ20superscript𝜅superscript𝜎20<\\kappa^{*}<\\sigma^{2} such that Combining (D.21) with (D.20), we have If λ​h2​(𝑩^​(ν))>λ​h2​(𝑩​(ν))𝜆subscriptℎ2^𝑩𝜈𝜆subscriptℎ2𝑩𝜈\\lambda h_{2}(\\widehat{\\bm{B}}(\\nu))>\\lambda h_{2}({\\bm{B}}(\\nu)), the main statement directly holds. In the other case, we focus on showing the main statement when λ​h2​(𝑩^​(ν))≤λ​h2​(𝑩​(ν))𝜆subscriptℎ2^𝑩𝜈𝜆subscriptℎ2𝑩𝜈\\lambda h_{2}(\\widehat{\\bm{B}}(\\nu))\\leq\\lambda h_{2}({\\bm{B}}(\\nu)). Specifically, we first define a vector Our goal is to bound ‖𝝁​(ν)‖2=∑j=1d+1‖𝑩^j​(ν)−𝑩j​(ν)‖22subscriptnorm𝝁𝜈2superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑑1subscriptsuperscriptnormsubscript^𝑩𝑗𝜈subscript𝑩𝑗𝜈22\\|\\bm{\\mu}(\\nu)\\|_{2}=\\sum_{j=1}^{d+1}\\|\\widehat{\\bm{B}}_{j}(\\nu)-\\bm{B}_{j}(\\nu)\\|^{2}_{2}. Define ℳ​(ν)=supp(𝝁​(ν))ℳ𝜈supp𝝁𝜈\\mathcal{M}(\\nu)=\\operatorname*{supp}(\\bm{\\mu}(\\nu)) and ℳc​(ν)superscriptℳ𝑐𝜈\\mathcal{M}^{c}(\\nu) is the complementary set. Then denote 𝝁​(ν)ℳ​(ν)𝝁subscript𝜈ℳ𝜈\\bm{\\mu}(\\nu)_{\\mathcal{M}(\\nu)} as the vector formed by elements of 𝝁​(ν)𝝁𝜈\\bm{\\mu}(\\nu) in ℳ​(ν)ℳ𝜈\\mathcal{M}(\\nu). Denote 𝝁​(ν)ℳc​(ν)𝝁subscript𝜈superscriptℳ𝑐𝜈\\bm{\\mu}(\\nu)_{\\mathcal{M}^{c}(\\nu)} as the vector formed by elements of 𝝁​(ν)𝝁𝜈\\bm{\\mu}(\\nu) in ℳc​(ν)superscriptℳ𝑐𝜈\\mathcal{M}^{c}(\\nu). Hence, we can show Recall the close form of causal effects in Def. 4.5 derived in § 5.1 under the LSEM model. We have where θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\theta_{i} presents the weight of the direct edge g​(𝒁)i→Y→𝑔subscript𝒁𝑖𝑌g(\\bm{Z})_{i}\\rightarrow Y according to (1) and Def. 4.5. In addition, the total causal effect can be quantified by the path method [see e.g.,  43; 20] as where\nP​E​{πi(k)}=bi,l1​⋯​blτk,(d+1)𝑃𝐸superscriptsubscript𝜋𝑖𝑘subscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑙1⋯subscript𝑏subscript𝑙subscript𝜏𝑘𝑑1PE\\{\\pi_{i}^{(k)}\\}=b_{i,l_{1}}\\cdots b_{l_{\\tau_{k}},(d+1)} is the causal effect of gi​(𝒁)subscript𝑔𝑖𝒁g_{i}(\\bm{Z}) on Y𝑌Y through the directed path πi(k)={i,l1,⋯,lτk,d+1}∈πisuperscriptsubscript𝜋𝑖𝑘𝑖subscript𝑙1⋯subscript𝑙subscript𝜏𝑘𝑑1subscript𝜋𝑖\\pi_{i}^{(k)}=\\{i,l_{1},\\cdots,l_{\\tau_{k}},d+1\\}\\in\\pi_{i} with length τk+1subscript𝜏𝑘1{\\tau_{k}}+1, and bi,jsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑗b_{i,j} is the weight of the edge gi​(𝒁)→gj​(𝒁)→subscript𝑔𝑖𝒁subscript𝑔𝑗𝒁g_{i}(\\bm{Z})\\rightarrow g_{j}(\\bm{Z}) if it exists, and bi,j=0subscript𝑏𝑖𝑗0b_{i,j}=0 otherwise, for i,j∈{1,⋯,d}𝑖𝑗1⋯𝑑i,j\\in\\{1,\\cdots,d\\}, and blτk,(d+1)=θlτksubscript𝑏subscript𝑙subscript𝜏𝑘𝑑1subscript𝜃subscript𝑙subscript𝜏𝑘b_{l_{\\tau_{k}},(d+1)}=\\theta_{l_{\\tau_{k}}} as the direct edge from glτk​(𝒁)subscript𝑔subscript𝑙subscript𝜏𝑘𝒁g_{l_{\\tau_{k}}}(\\bm{Z}) to Y𝑌Y.\nBoth T​Ei𝑇subscript𝐸𝑖TE_{i} and D​Ei𝐷subscript𝐸𝑖DE_{i} can be explicitly calculated given a matrix 𝑩𝑩\\bm{B} under a selector g𝑔g. We denote their estimates as T​E^isubscript^𝑇𝐸𝑖\\widehat{TE}_{i} and D​E^isubscript^𝐷𝐸𝑖\\widehat{DE}_{i} given the estimated matrix 𝑩^^𝑩\\widehat{\\bm{B}} and g𝑔g. Using the direct causal effects as an example, we have (D.23) be further bounded by for some constant C1>0subscript𝐶10C_{1}>0.\nRecall ‖𝝁​(ν)‖2=∑j=1d+1‖𝑩^j​(ν)−𝑩j​(ν)‖22subscriptnorm𝝁𝜈2superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑑1subscriptsuperscriptnormsubscript^𝑩𝑗𝜈subscript𝑩𝑗𝜈22\\|\\bm{\\mu}(\\nu)\\|_{2}=\\sum_{j=1}^{d+1}\\|\\widehat{\\bm{B}}_{j}(\\nu)-\\bm{B}_{j}(\\nu)\\|^{2}_{2}. Combining (D.23) and (D.24), we have where the last inequality follows Equation (67) in Shi & Li .\nTogether with (D.22), we have and thus Rearranging (D.26)\nleads to for arbitrary ν∈Υ𝜈Υ\\nu\\in\\Upsilon.\nHence\nthe proof of the Main Statement is completed. The rest of the proofs follow the similar arguments in Proposition 1 of . For λ𝜆\\lambda satisfying the bound of 𝒪​((n​log⁡n)1/2)𝒪superscript𝑛𝑛12\\mathcal{O}({(n\\log{n})}^{1/2}), the consistency of the estimated matrix holds for arbitrary ν∈Υ𝜈Υ\\nu\\in\\Upsilon. The proof of Thm. 5.1 is hence completed.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: that involves causal effect information compared to the original loss function in [ref]46.\nIn this proof, we need to show a main statement and the rest of the proof will follow the same procedure of Steps 2-3 in Appendix Section 9 of .
