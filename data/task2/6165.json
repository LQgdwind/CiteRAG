Below we generalize Gál’s result to arbitrary bipartite graphs satisfying appropriate conditions, by a similar argument as . Let G=(A∪B,E)𝐺𝐴𝐵𝐸G=(A\\cup B,E) be a bipartite graph that is r𝑟r-regular and K2,ssubscript𝐾2𝑠K_{2,s}-free for some s≥2𝑠2s\\geq 2.

By Lemma 2, it suffices to show that GALGsubscriptGAL𝐺\\operatorname{GAL}_{G} is ⌊(r−1)/(s−1)⌋𝑟1𝑠1\\lfloor(r-1)/(s-1)\\rfloor-mixed. Let S⊆A𝑆𝐴S\\subseteq A be an arbitrary subset of size ⌊(r−1)/(s−1)⌋𝑟1𝑠1\\lfloor(r-1)/(s-1)\\rfloor, let α≠β𝛼𝛽\\alpha\\neq\\beta be two subsets of S𝑆S and assume a∈α\\β𝑎\\𝛼𝛽a\\in\\alpha\\backslash\\beta, see Figure 2. We need to show that there exists a subset γ⊆A\\S𝛾\\𝐴𝑆\\gamma\\subseteq A\\backslash S such that Nb⁡(α∪γ)=BNb𝛼𝛾𝐵\\operatorname{Nb}(\\alpha\\cup\\gamma)=B\nbut\nNb⁡(β∪γ)≠BNb𝛽𝛾𝐵\\operatorname{Nb}(\\beta\\cup\\gamma)\\neq B. Since G𝐺G is K2,ssubscript𝐾2𝑠K_{2,s}-free and r𝑟r-regular, and |S|=⌊(r−1)/(s−1)⌋𝑆𝑟1𝑠1|S|=\\lfloor(r-1)/(s-1)\\rfloor, Take γ=A\\(S∪Nb⁡(b))𝛾\\𝐴𝑆Nb𝑏\\gamma=A\\backslash(S\\cup\\operatorname{Nb}(b)).

Apply Proposition 14, Lemma 36 and Theorem 39.\n∎ Similar to Gál’s BP1subscriptBP1\\operatorname{\\operatorname{BP}_{1}} lower bound , Bollig and Wegener in  also showed that BP1⁡(BWGq)subscriptBP1subscriptBWsubscript𝐺𝑞\\operatorname{\\operatorname{BP}_{1}}(\\operatorname{BW}_{G_{q}}) has an exponential lower bound. In  they pointed out that BWGqsubscriptBWsubscript𝐺𝑞\\operatorname{BW}_{G_{q}} is not mixed, here we strengthen this by showing that in fact S^​(BWGq)^𝑆subscriptBWsubscript𝐺𝑞\\widehat{S}(\\operatorname{BW}_{G_{q}}) is small. S^​(BWGq)=O​(1)^𝑆subscriptBWsubscript𝐺𝑞𝑂1\\widehat{S}(\\operatorname{BW}_{G_{q}})=O(1). Let kt=t​(q+1)subscript𝑘𝑡𝑡𝑞1k_{t}=t(q+1). We first show for 1≤t≤q1𝑡𝑞1\\leq t\\leq q, there exist S⊆A∪B𝑆𝐴𝐵S\\subseteq A\\cup B with size |S|=kt𝑆subscript𝑘𝑡|S|=k_{t} such that 𝗆𝗎𝗅𝗍​((BWGq)S)𝗆𝗎𝗅𝗍subscriptsubscriptBWsubscript𝐺𝑞𝑆\\mathsf{mult}((\\operatorname{BW}_{G_{q}})_{S}) is large.\nLet V={x1,…,xq}⊆A𝑉subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑞𝐴V=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{q}\\}\\subseteq A be a subset of q𝑞q points that form a vertical line. Then, Nb⁡(xi)∩Nb⁡(xj)=∅Nbsubscript𝑥𝑖Nbsubscript𝑥𝑗\\operatorname{Nb}(x_{i})\\cap\\operatorname{Nb}(x_{j})=\\emptyset and V𝑉V is a minimal blocking set.\nLet\nT={x1,…,xt}⊆V𝑇subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑡𝑉T=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{t}\\}\\subseteq V.\nChoose\nS=T∪Nb⁡(T)𝑆𝑇Nb𝑇S=T\\cup\\operatorname{Nb}(T),\nso\n|S|=t​(q+1)=kt𝑆𝑡𝑞1subscript𝑘𝑡|S|=t(q+1)=k_{t},\nsee Figure 41.\nLet H​(S,E​(S))≤Gq​(A∪B,E)𝐻𝑆𝐸𝑆subscript𝐺𝑞𝐴𝐵𝐸H(S,E(S))\\leq G_{q}(A\\cup B,E) denote the induced subgraph by S𝑆S.\nLet\n(α,β)∈{0,1}T×{0,1}Nb⁡(T)𝛼𝛽superscript01𝑇superscript01Nb𝑇(\\alpha,\\beta)\\in\\{0,1\\}^{T}\\times\\{0,1\\}^{\\operatorname{Nb}(T)}.\nWith this notation, one has Let Ptsubscript𝑃𝑡P_{t} denote the probability that BWH⁡(α,β)=0subscriptBW𝐻𝛼𝛽0\\operatorname{BW}_{H}(\\alpha,\\beta)=0 where (α,β)𝛼𝛽(\\alpha,\\beta) is chosen uniformly at random, i.e., the probability that there are no edges between α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta in H𝐻H.

Open Problem (  0). Does there exist a Boolean function f𝑓f such that\nBP1⁡(f)subscriptBP1𝑓\\operatorname{\\operatorname{BP}_{1}}(f)\nis superpolynomially larger than\nw​(f)𝑤𝑓w(f)? This problem has been open for more than two decades. If we replace BP1subscriptBP1\\operatorname{\\operatorname{BP}_{1}} by OBDDOBDD\\operatorname{OBDD}, we could deduce separations in both sides. Let DTSize⁡(f)DTSize𝑓\\operatorname{DTSize}(f) denote the decision tree size of f𝑓f. w​(NANDn)≥exp⁡(Ω​(n/log⁡n))𝑤subscriptNAND𝑛Ω𝑛𝑛w(\\operatorname{NAND}_{n})\\geq\\exp(\\Omega(\\sqrt{n/\\log n})) but OBDD⁡(NANDn)=O​(n)OBDDsubscriptNAND𝑛𝑂𝑛\\operatorname{OBDD}(\\operatorname{NAND}_{n})=O(n). w​(ISAn)≤DTSize⁡(ISAn)=O​(n2)𝑤subscriptISA𝑛DTSizesubscriptISA𝑛𝑂superscript𝑛2w(\\operatorname{ISA}_{n})\\leq\\operatorname{DTSize}(\\operatorname{ISA}_{n})=O(n^{2}) but OBDD⁡(ISAn)=exp⁡(Ω​(n/log⁡n))OBDDsubscriptISA𝑛Ω𝑛𝑛\\operatorname{OBDD}(\\operatorname{ISA}_{n})=\\exp(\\Omega(n/\\log n)). In [ref]9 it shows (see also a proof from )\nDTSize⁡(f)≤exp⁡(O​((log⁡n)⋅log2⁡w​(f)))DTSize𝑓𝑂⋅𝑛superscript2𝑤𝑓\\operatorname{DTSize}(f)\\leq\\exp(O((\\log n)\\cdot\\log^{2}w(f))).\nBy ,\nDTSize⁡(NANDn)≥2Ω​(n)DTSizesubscriptNAND𝑛superscript2Ω𝑛\\operatorname{DTSize}(\\operatorname{NAND}_{n})\\geq 2^{\\Omega(n)}.\nThese two together implies the lower bound for w​(NANDn)𝑤subscriptNAND𝑛w(\\operatorname{NAND}_{n}). Theorem 4.3.3 from 0 shows that OBDD⁡(ISAn)≥exp⁡(Ω​(n/log⁡n))OBDDsubscriptISA𝑛Ω𝑛𝑛\\operatorname{OBDD}(\\operatorname{ISA}_{n})\\geq\\exp(\\Omega(n/\\log n)). The upper bounds are easy to see.\n∎ It is easy to see that\nCNFSize⁡(GALGq)=O​(q3)CNFSizesubscriptGALsubscript𝐺𝑞𝑂superscript𝑞3\\operatorname{CNFSize}(\\operatorname{GAL}_{G_{q}})=O(q^{3})\nand\nDNFSize⁡(BWGq)=O​(q3)DNFSizesubscriptBWsubscript𝐺𝑞𝑂superscript𝑞3\\operatorname{DNFSize}(\\operatorname{BW}_{G_{q}})=O(q^{3}).\nHence, it is interesting to ask what is DNFSize⁡(GALGq)DNFSizesubscriptGALsubscript𝐺𝑞\\operatorname{DNFSize}(\\operatorname{GAL}_{G_{q}})? It is not hard to see that\nDNFSize⁡(f)≥C^​(f)DNFSize𝑓^𝐶𝑓\\operatorname{DNFSize}(f)\\geq\\widehat{C}(f). Hence, for the purpose of a lower bound, it suffices to show C^​(GALGq,n/2)^𝐶subscriptGALsubscript𝐺𝑞𝑛2\\widehat{C}(\\operatorname{GAL}_{G_{q}},n/2) is large, where n=q2𝑛superscript𝑞2n=q^{2}. This raises naturally the following question. Question 1. Let M⊆𝔽q2𝑀superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞2M\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2} be an arbitrary subset of size q2/2superscript𝑞22q^{2}/2. Is the number of blocking sets inside M𝑀M always exponentially (or superpolynomially) smaller than 2q2/2superscript2superscript𝑞222^{q^{2}/2}? Indeed, it is not hard to see that if there is an M⊆𝔽q2𝑀superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞2M\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2} of size n/2=q2/2𝑛2superscript𝑞22n/2=q^{2}/2 with t𝑡t blocking sets inside, then GALGqsubscriptGALsubscript𝐺𝑞\\operatorname{GAL}_{G_{q}} contains a 111-monochromatic n/2𝑛2n/2-rectangle of size t​2p2/2𝑡superscript2superscript𝑝22t2^{p^{2}/2}. If one wishes to show C^​(GALGq,n/2)^𝐶subscriptGALsubscript𝐺𝑞𝑛2\\widehat{C}(\\operatorname{GAL}_{G_{q}},n/2) is large by showing that every 111-monochromatic n/2𝑛2n/2-rectangle is small, then answering Question 1 is crucial. The following simple fact is a contrast to Question 1. As q→∞→𝑞q\\to\\infty, almost all subsets in 𝔽q2superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞2\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2} are blocking sets. By definition, every non-blocking-set is a subset of 𝔽q2\\ℓ\\superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞2ℓ\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}\\backslash\\ell for some (non-vertical) line ℓℓ\\ell. As there are q2superscript𝑞2q^{2} such lines,\nthe number of non-blocking-set\n≤q2⋅2q2−qabsent⋅superscript𝑞2superscript2superscript𝑞2𝑞\\leq q^{2}\\cdot 2^{q^{2}-q}.\nThis implies the number of blocking sets\n≥2q2​(1−q2/2q)→2q2absentsuperscript2superscript𝑞21superscript𝑞2superscript2𝑞→superscript2superscript𝑞2\\geq 2^{q^{2}}(1-q^{2}/2^{q})\\to 2^{q^{2}},\nas q→∞→𝑞q\\to\\infty.\n∎ One potential way towards answering Question 1 might be the following. Question 2. Classify all minimal blocking sets in 𝔽q2superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞2\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: but OBDD⁡(ISAn)=exp⁡(Ω​(n/log⁡n))OBDDsubscriptISA𝑛Ω𝑛𝑛\\operatorname{OBDD}(\\operatorname{ISA}_{n})=\\exp(\\Omega(n/\\log n)).
