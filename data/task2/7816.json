      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesis of Temporal Causality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe study of causality and its applications in formal methods has gained great interest in recent years¬†. In a finite setting, Ibrahim et al.¬†use SAT solvers and linear programming to check¬†4 and infer¬†3 actual causes. Our definition of actual causality for reactive systems extends the definitions of Coenen et al.¬†9 to cases in which the limit assumption does not hold. While Coenen et al.¬†study the theory of actual causality¬† in reactive systems, they do not provide a way to generate causes and explanations.\nIn terms of cause synthesis, the most related work is by Beutner et al.¬†, which checks causality and generates causes based on sketching. Unlike ours, their tool is only applicable for the small fragment of LTL containing only \\operatorname{\\leavevmode\\hbox to7.41pt{\\vbox to7.41pt{\\pgfpicture\\makeatletter\\hbox{\\hskip 3.70276pt\\lower-1.11943pt\\hbox to0.0pt{\\pgfsys@beginscope\\pgfsys@invoke{ }\\definecolor{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\pgfsys@color@rgb@stroke{0}{0}{0}\\pgfsys@invoke{ }\\pgfsys@color@rgb@fill{0}{0}{0}\\pgfsys@invoke{ }\\pgfsys@setlinewidth{0.4pt}\\pgfsys@invoke{ }\\nullfont\\hbox to0.0pt{\\pgfsys@beginscope\\pgfsys@invoke{ }{\n{{}{}}{{}}{}{{{}}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}}\\pgfsys@beginscope\\pgfsys@invoke{ }\\pgfsys@setlinewidth{0.51666pt}\\pgfsys@invoke{ }{}\\pgfsys@moveto{0.0pt}{2.58333pt}\\pgfsys@moveto{3.44443pt}{2.58333pt}\\pgfsys@curveto{3.44443pt}{4.48566pt}{1.90233pt}{6.02776pt}{0.0pt}{6.02776pt}\\pgfsys@curveto{-1.90233pt}{6.02776pt}{-3.44443pt}{4.48566pt}{-3.44443pt}{2.58333pt}\\pgfsys@curveto{-3.44443pt}{0.681pt}{-1.90233pt}{-0.8611pt}{0.0pt}{-0.8611pt}\\pgfsys@curveto{1.90233pt}{-0.8611pt}{3.44443pt}{0.681pt}{3.44443pt}{2.58333pt}\\pgfsys@closepath\\pgfsys@moveto{0.0pt}{2.58333pt}\\pgfsys@stroke\\pgfsys@invoke{ }\n\\pgfsys@invoke{\\lxSVG@closescope }\\pgfsys@endscope}\n\\pgfsys@invoke{\\lxSVG@closescope }\\pgfsys@endscope{}{}{}\\hss}\\pgfsys@discardpath\\pgfsys@invoke{\\lxSVG@closescope }\\pgfsys@endscope\\hss}}\\lxSVG@closescope\\endpgfpicture}}} operators, while we are able to generate temporal causes for all œâùúî\\omega-regular specifications. In a series of works, Leue et al.¬†study symbolic description of counterfactual causes in Event Order Logic¬† 7 8.\nHowever, this logic can only reason about the ordering of events, and not their absolute timing, as we can do with œâùúî\\omega-regular properties (e.g., specifying that the input at the second position is the cause). G√∂ssler and M√©tayer¬† define causality for component-based systems, and G√∂ssler and Stefani¬† study causality based on counterfactual builders. Their formalisms differ from ours, which is based on Coenen et al.¬†9, and none of the works considers cause synthesis. Most other works related to cause synthesis concern generating explanations for effects observed on finite traces¬†  [ref]26 , or effects restricted to safety properties¬†.\nIn the context of cause synthesis over infinite traces for effects given as temporal specifications,\nexisting works are limited to causes given as sets of events (i.e., atomic propositions and times points)¬†  1 or take a state-centric view to, e.g., measure the responsibility of a state for an observed effect property¬†  1.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: is based on Coenen et al.¬†9, and none of the works considers cause synthesis.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
