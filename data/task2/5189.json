      "content": "Paper Title: Post-Quantum ùúÖ-to-1 Trapdoor Claw-free Functions from Extrapolated Dihedral Cosets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, Leveraging TCFs primitive for quantum cryptographic tasks was pioneered in two breakthrough works: (1) the construction of quantum homomorphic encryption with classical keys  and (2) the verifiable proof of quantumness [ref]4. The latter work also serves as a certifiable quantum randomness generator from an untrusted quantum device. These works have since been extended to other interesting tasks including delegated quantum computation , quantum money   and remote state preparation . Remarkably, instead of LWE-based NTCFs with the adaptive hardcore bit property in [ref]4, recent works accept a broader landscape of TCFs for interactive quantumness tests. Wherein, the construction of TCFs could be based around other hardness assumptions for eliminating the need for an adaptive hardcore bit and using TCFs with a lower circuit complexity, such as Ring-LWE [ref]6, learning with rounding (LWR) , Rabin‚Äôs function and Diffie-Hellman problem . Recently, Alamati et al.  further constructed two-to-one TCFs from isogeny-based group actions. Moreover, there are numerous extensions and follow-up works for TCF-based proofs of quantumness   [ref]6 . Particularly, in [ref]6, an efficient non-interactive proof of quantumness protocol was proposed in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) to further reduce the round complexity of [ref]4. In , the work for improving the rate of generation of randomness of [ref]4 was proposed, which greatly inspires the present work. Generally, solving the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) in the dihedral group is unclear even for quantum computation. In , Regev first linked the DHSP to the lattice problems and pointed out that uSVP is no harder to solve than the dihedral coset problem (DCP). Consequently, leveraging the reductions between LWE and unique SVP   , we could naturally bridge the LWE and the DCP. However, the DCP modulus requires super-exponential in nùëõn in the reduction of , i.e. 2ùí™‚Äã(n2)superscript2ùí™superscriptùëõ22^{\\mathcal{O}(n^{2})}. Recently, Brakerski et al. showed that under quantum polynomial-time reductions, the LWE is equivalent to the extrapolated dihedral coset problem (EDCP) [ref]5, which can be seen as a special case of the generalized DCP. Besides, since the EDCP is quantumly reducible to the DCP under some certain parameters, the hardness reduction from the LWE to the DCP can be constructed efficiently. Since the work [ref]5 skips the reduction from BDD to LWE and instead starts from LWE, the modulus of DCP in their reduction is reduced to a polynomial. To date, finding an efficient solution to DHSP, as well as for DCP and EDCP, remains an open question. The first quantum algorithm for DHSP was proposed by Ettinger and H√∏yer . They pointed that it is sufficient to solve the DCP by a linear number of coset samples, but post-processing requires exponentially more time. Besides, Bacon et al.  showed that, no quantum algorithm can find a solution of the DCP with high probability with only a sublinear number of such samples from the DCP oracle. So far the best known quantum algorithm for the DCP is Kuperberg‚Äôs algorithm 7 which runs in sub-exponential time. Based on this, a series of improvements were subsequently proposed. Regev 9 improved Kuperberg‚Äôs algorithm by using only p‚Äão‚Äãl‚Äãy‚Äã(log‚Å°N)ùëùùëúùëôùë¶ùëÅpoly(\\log N) space complexity, despite a slight increase in time complexity to 2ùí™‚Äã(log‚Å°N‚Äãlog‚Å°log‚Å°N)superscript2ùí™ùëÅùëÅ2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\log N\\log\\log N})}. Kuperberg further optimized the space complexity later, whereas the time complexity remains sub-exponential 8. Recently, inspired by the works of Ivanyos et al. 0 1 5, quantum algorithms for solving EDCP via a filtering technique are proposed by Chen et al. . Notably, the fantastic connection between EDCP and LWE will play the key role in our work.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: for quantum cryptographic tasks was pioneered in two breakthrough works: (1) the construction of quantum homomorphic encryption with classical keys  and (2) the verifiable proof of quantumness [ref]4.
