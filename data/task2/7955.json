The most notable one is linear Datalog, introduced by Dalmau .\nLinear Datalog programs can be evaluated in non-deterministic logarithmic space (NL), and hence cannot express P-hard problems (unless P=NL).\nDalmau asked whether the converse is true as well, i.e., whether every finite-domain CSP which is in NL can be solved by a linear Datalog program .\nThis is widely treated as a conjecture, to which we refer as the linear Datalog conjecture; it is one of the biggest open problems in finite-domain constraint satisfaction. There are some sufficient conditions for solvability by linear Datalog (see Bulatov, Kozik, and Willard [ref]5\nand Carvalho, Dalmau, and Krokhin ) and some necessary conditions (Larose and Tesson )\nbut the results still leave a large gap.\nFor examples of CSPs of orientations of trees that fall into this gap, see Bodirsky, Bulín, Starke, and Wernthaler .\nAgain, linear Datalog is closed under gadget reductions .\nAnd indeed, if HornSat has a gadget-reduction in a finite-domain CSP, then the finite-domain CSP cannot be solved by a linear Datalog program .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: conjecture; it is one of the biggest open problems in finite-domain constraint satisfaction.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
