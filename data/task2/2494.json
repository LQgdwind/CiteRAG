Inspired by the success of the self-attention mechanism, researchers have explored to use transformer framework for fundamental vision tasks such as image classification[ref]26, object detection[ref]9[ref]28,segmentation and other low-level vision tasks such as image generation, super-resolution and de-noising.  splits an image into patches and feeds them into a stack of transformer encoder to learn a representation for classification. [ref]26 leverages generative pre-training to learn visual representation in a self-supervised way with stacks of transformer decoder block. The encouraging work DETR proposed in [ref]9 formulates object detection as a set prediction problem, eliminating the need for proposal generation, anchor box design and Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) all at once. This work sets a new paradigm for object detection and inspired many following works such as deformable DETR[ref]28 and Transformer-based Set Prediction (TSP). [ref]28 proposed deformable attention operation to solve the convergence issue in [ref]9 while in  an encoder-only transformer based detector is proposed.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: natural language processing.
