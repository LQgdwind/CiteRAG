      "content": "Paper Title: Fast and Accurate Error Simulation for CNNs against Soft Errors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTensorFI offers FES facilities, based on a limited fault model with respect to the one we defined and use in the proposed FES activity.\nWe did not perform any qualitative comparison between our results and the ones obtained by TensorFI because the error models implemented by TensorFI, basically bit-flips or single value corruptions, are a reduced subset of the ones we identified and implemented.\nThe comparison against the state-of-the-art solution is therefore carried out considering only the performance of the approaches, given the previous discussion on the cardinality and adherence of the fault models. Indeed, we were not able to execute YOLO with TensorFI, for two reasons mainly; TensorFI does not support all the operators, e.g., Leaky ReLu and Batch normalization, and the tensor data format (Batch, Height, Width, Channel – BHWC vs. Batch, Channel, Height, Width – BCHW) employed by YOLO and it would have required too long execution times, according to .\nFor this reason, we here introduce two simpler CNNs to carry out the performance comparison: LeNet-5  and CIFAR10 [ref]26\nand gather a trend in the achievable speedup. LeNet-5 is used for hand-written digits classification for the MNIST dataset ,\nable to achieve a 99.05%percent99.0599.05\\% accuracy. It is a simple network composed of two convolutional layers and three dense layers. CIFAR10 performs object classification for the CIFAR10 dataset [ref]26.\nIn particular, we employed the Keras implementation111Keras: Deep Learning for humans, https://github.com/awslabs/keras-apache-mxnet, (Accessed on 12/01/2021)., that achieves an accuracy equal to the 78%percent7878\\%. For this test, we defined a campaign of 10,000 random error simulations.\nThe execution times (in minutes) of TensorFI and CLASSES for the various campaigns are reported in Table V.\nWe also report the time for the nominal execution of the CNN to allow the reader to get an idea of the minimal overhead introduced by our error injection mechanism. As it can be noticed, CLASSES is able to execute the experiment on YOLO in a reasonable time, i.e. with a 2.5x slow down.\nMoreover, CLASSES considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art solution on these small CNNs, with a speedup of about 44x and 63x. The motivation is that, as commented in , TensorFI re-defines CNN operators in Python to perform the injection and such implementation is not accelerated onto GPU as the original TensorFlow counterpart.\nAt the opposite, CLASSES is exclusively based on TensorFlow public API, thus benefiting from the GPU acceleration of the operators. Moreover, the defined input caching strategy allows for an additional performance improvement.\nAs a final remark, the time required for the instrumentation of the CNN to run the error simulations is about 80s, which is negligible for both approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: employed by YOLO and it would have required too long execution times, according to .\nFor this reason, we here introduce two simpler CNNs to carry out the performance comparison: LeNet-5  and CIFAR10 [ref]26\nand gather a trend in the achievable speedup.
