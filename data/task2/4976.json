      "content": "Paper Title: Symbolic Distillation for Learned TCP Congestion Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we develop a new algorithmic framework for performance-oriented congestion control (PCC) agents, which can  1 run as fast as classical algorithmic methods;  2 adjust the rate as accurately as data-driven RL methods; and  3 be simpler than the original neural network , potentially improving practitioners’ understanding of the model in an actionable manner. We solve this problem by grasping the opportunity enabled by advances in symbolic regression [ref]17  [ref]19  [ref]21  . Symbolic regression bridges the gap between the infeasible search directly in the enormous symbolic algorithms space and the differentiable training of over-parameterized and un-interpretable neural networks. At a high level, one can first train an RL agent through gradient descent, then distill the learned policy to obtain the data-driven optimized yet simpler and easier-to-understand\nsymbolic rules.\nThis results in a set of symbolic rules through data-driven optimization that meets TCP CC’s extreme efficiency and reliability demands. However, considering the enormous volume of discrete symbolic space, it is challenging to learn effective symbolic rules from scratch directly. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt a two-stage approach: we first train a deep neural network policy with reinforcement learning mimicking Aurora , and then distill the resultant policy into numerical symbolic rules, using symbolic regression (SR). As the challenge, directly applying symbolic regression out of the box does not yield a sufficiently versatile expression that captures diverse networking conditions.\nWe hence propose a novel branching technique for training and then aggregating a number of SymbolicPCC agents, each of which caters to a subset of the possible network conditions. Specifically, we have multiple agents, each called a branch, and employ a light-weight “branch decider” to choose between the branches during deployment. In order to create the branching conditions we partition the network condition space into adjacent non-overlapping contexts, then regress symbolic rules in each context. With this modification, we enhance the expressiveness of the resulting SR equation and overcome the bias of traditional SR algorithms to output rules mostly using numerical operators. Our concrete technical contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a symbolic distillation framework for TCP congestion control, which improves upon the state-of-the-art RL solutions. Our approach, SymbolicPCC, consists of two stages: first training an RL agent and then distilling its policy network into ultra-compact and simple rules in the symbolic expression form. We propose a novel branching technique that advances existing symbolic regression techniques for training and aggregating multiple context-dependent symbolic policies, each of which specializes for its own subset of network conditions. A branch decider driven by light-weight classification algorithms determines which symbolic policy to use. Through our simulation and emulation experiments, we show that SymbolicPCC achieves highly competitive or even stronger performance results compared to their teacher policy networks while running orders of magnitude faster. The presented model\nuses a tree structure that is light-weight, and could be simpler for practitioners to reason about and improve manually\nwhile narrowing their performance gap.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: neural network , potentially improving practitioners’ understanding of the model in an actionable manner.
