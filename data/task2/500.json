Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Vietnamese Word Segmentation with SVM: Ambiguity Reduction and Suffix Capture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to analyze the word segmentation results in more detail, we computed F1subscriptF1\\text{F}_{\\text{1}} score according to number of syllables in a word and three and four syllables words containing suffixes. Additionally, we also re-trained UETsegmenter  with the Vietnamese words dictionary of RDRsegmenter [ref]9 and vice versa. As we can see in Table 8, our method obtains higher F1subscriptF1\\text{F}_{\\text{1}} scores than UETSegmener , and RDRsegmenter [ref]9 on one and two syllables words (1 & 2). On three-syllable words (3asuperscript3a\\text{3}^{\\text{a}}), RDRsegmenter [ref]9 achieves the highest F1subscriptF1\\text{F}_{\\text{1}} score. On four-syllable words (4asuperscript4a\\text{4}^{\\text{a}}), UETsegmenter  achieves the highest F1subscriptF1\\text{F}_{\\text{1}} score. Notably, UETsegmenter  used another Vietnamese words dictionary666https://github.com/phongnt570/UETsegmenter/blob/master/dictionary which contains all 7 three-and-four-syllable unknown words that they predict correctly. Besides, UETSegmener  can not predict three syllables words containing suffixes (3bsuperscript3b\\text{3}^{\\text{b}}) when training with the Vietnamese words dictionary of RDRsegmenter [ref]9. Therefore, we can conclude that RDRsegmenter [ref]9 and our word segmentation method have not solved unknown words containing suffixes badly (3bsuperscript3b\\text{3}^{\\text{b}}). Lastly, different from the result of UETsegmenter  on three-syllable words (3asuperscript3a\\text{3}^{\\text{a}}) and RDRsegmenter [ref]9 on four-syllable words (4asuperscript4a\\text{4}^{\\text{a}}), our result on three-syllable and words four-syllable words are not left far away by the highest result. Lastly, Table 9 shows POS tagging performance on the test dataset of VLSP 2013 POSTag with the predicted word segmentation. We re-trained the UETsegmenter tool on VLSP 2013 POSTag. Our Vietnamese word segmentation method has helped VnMarMot  of increase in performance on VLSP 2013 POSTag with 0.3+% improvement of F1subscriptF1\\text{F}_{\\text{1}} score by comparing with (VnMarMoT  using RDRsegmenter [ref]9) approach.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: according to number of syllables in a word and three and four syllables words containing suffixes. Additionally, we also re-trained UETsegmenter  with the Vietnamese words dictionary of RDRsegmenter [ref]9 and vice versa. As we can see in Table 8, our method obtains higher F1subscriptF1\\text{F}_{\\text{1}} scores than UETSegmener , and RDRsegmenter [ref]9 on one and two syllables words (1 & 2).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
