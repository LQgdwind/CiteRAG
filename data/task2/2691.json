      "content": "Paper Title: Studying Fake News Spreading, Polarisation Dynamics, and Manipulation by Bots: a Tale of Networks and Language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this appendix, we follow up the analysis described in Sec. 3 of the survey to list all the top-10 papers with high centrality values (global citations, in-degree, betweenness, and page rank). For each measure, we ranked the papers corresponding to nodes in the “Fake News Reserch” library network, and in the following tables we show the top-10 for every rank. Assuming that the papers in the core library are more relevant to the topic that is the subject of our review, we filtered out the papers from the so called periphery from almost every table included in this section. Of course, rankings can change while new related papers are published, varying citation dynamics. As a consequence, we recommend the reader to use the search engine at http://fakenewsresearch.net for updated information and ranks. We start with the rank for global citations (see Table 4). According to , it is important to distinguish between “global citations” and “local citations”, respectively the citations that an article receives as is, and the in-degree, i.e., the citations that an article receives from other articles in our corpus only. It is worth mentioning that every paper in this and in the following lists is associated to a discipline, that is deduced from the first level-0 Concept that is returned by the OpenAlex API when queried with the given paper. \n\n\n\nPaper information\nRef.\n\nid\ntitle\ndiscipline\nyear\ncluster\n\n\n1\nThe spread of true and false news online\npsychology\n2018\n  1\n71\n\n2\nSocial Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election\npolitical science\n2017\n  1\n\n\n3\nThe science of fake news\ncomputer science\n2018\n  1\n[ref]163\n\n4\nFake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective\ncomputer science\n2017\n  2\n\n\n5\nMisinformation and Its Correction: Continued Influence and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful Debiasing\npsychology\n2012\n  3\n\n\n6\nThe rise of social bots\ncomputer science\n2016\n  5\n5\n\n7\nHow to fight an infodemic\npolitical science\n2020\n  4\n\n\n8\nThe spreading of misinformation online\ncomputer science\n2016\n  9\n\n\n9\nManagement misinformation systems\ncomputer science\n1967\n-\n\n\n10\nOops They Did It Again! Carbon Nanotubes Hoax Scientists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin Viability Assays\nchemistry\n2006\n-\n83\n\n Counting global citations helps us to understand which papers are objectively recognised at a wider level, not necessarily limiting our analysis to papers we collected to create the library, that are more focused on the “fake news” topic.\nQuite interestingly, in the top-10 rank in Table 4 we find papers that have been covered in this survey, and that we also recognise as fundamental contributions to the development of the given topic, but also two papers that have been added to our library just because they contain the words “misinformation” and “hoax”: paper n. 9 is a classic computer science paper on information system and data base management 131313Quite ironically, in this paper the word “misinformation” looks like a mistake in the title, since MIS is used as an acronym for Management Information Systems, and the meaning of “misinformation” in this domain is never defined in the article., and paper n. 10 describes an anomaly, and how to deal with it, in a chemical empirical experiment. Quite interestingly, in our focused citation graph, both papers do not belong to any of the major nine clusters and their in-degree is very low, suggesting that despite their very high global citations, their impact to the “fake news” topic is neglectable. This also suggests that in-degree ranking shown in Table 5 is more informative to our purposes than the global citation list. \n\n\n\nPaper information\nRef.\n\nid\ntitle\ndiscipline\nyear\ncluster\n\n\n1*\nThe spread of true and false news online\npsychology\n2018\n  1\n71\n\n2*\nSocial Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election\npolitical science\n2017\n  1\n\n\n3*\nThe science of fake news\ncomputer science\n2018\n  1\n[ref]163\n\n4*\nFake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective\ncomputer science\n2017\n  2\n\n\n5*\nMisinformation and Its Correction: Continued Influence and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful Debiasing\npsychology\n2012\n  3\n\n\n6*\nThe rise of social bots\ncomputer science\n2016\n  5\n5\n\n7\nDefining “Fake News”\npolitical science\n2018\n  1\n57\n\n8*\nThe spreading of misinformation online\ncomputer science\n2016\n  9\n\n\n9\n“Liar, Liar Pants on Fire”: A New Benchmark Dataset for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFake News Detection\ncomputer science\n2017\n  2\n72\n\n10*\nHow to fight an infodemic\npolitical science\n2020\n  4\n\n\n Like global citations, in-degree is a network measure of “popularity”; however, the basic assumption is that if a paper receives many local citations, as opposed to global ones, it is likely that the community is endorsing that contribution as relevant to the field. In Table 5 we show the top 10 papers ranked according in-degree in the core library. As expected, 8 out of 10 papers that are in the first list are also in the top-10 global citations ranking, and the off topics papers have been flushed out because of their very low internal in-degree). Also, papers in this rank have been covered in our survey as important milestones in the area. To be noticed that papers 1, 2, 3, and 7 belong to the first cluster (see Sec. 3). Also, all of them represent highly multidisciplinary contributions that exploit advanced computational techniques to perform empirical analysis on data from social media. In particular, paper 7 contributes to the problem of defining the different variants of “fake news” (a terminology that we adopted as well in Sec. 2). The difficulties of debunking and correcting misinformation are usually connected to the misinformation effect, that is described in paper 5, and that is grounded in cognitive psychology. Fake news and social bots detection is one of the most faced challenges by computer scientist, and papers 4, 6 and 9 in the rank are commonly referred as milestones, as well as paper 8 that represents one of the most widely recognised contribution to study misinformation spreading in terms of the role played by echo-chambers in social media. Finally, paper 10 is a one page report published on Feb. 2020 on “The Lancet” calling for counter measures against the COVID-19 infodemic to come: an important signal that related sub-topic emerged sharply in the last two years. To be noticed that the majority of these contributions exploit computational linguistics and network science models and tools, confirming once again that a solid background on both scientific areas is necessary to make sense of the overall contributions. \n\n\n\nPaper information\nRef.\n\nid\ntitle\ndiscipline\nyear\ncluster\n\n\n1*\nMisinformation and Its Correction: Continued Influence and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful Debiasing\npsychology\n2012\n  3\n\n\n2*\nThe spread of true and false news online\npsychology\n2018\n  1\n71\n\n3*\nSocial Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election\npolitical science\n2017\n  1\n\n\n4*\nThe spreading of misinformation online\ncomputer science\n2016\n  9\n\n\n5\nSystematic Literature Review on the Spread of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth-related Misinformation on Social Media\npsychology\n2019\n  3\n74\n\n6*\nFake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective\ncomputer science\n2017\n  2\n\n\n7\nSocial Media, Political Polarization, and Political Disinformation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Review of the Scientific Literature\npolitical science\n2018\n  5\n62\n\n8\nBeyond misinformation: Understanding and coping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the “post-truth” era\npsychology\n2017\n  3\n\n\n9\nThe COVID-19 social media infodemic\ncomputer science\n2020\n  4\n\n\n10*\nThe science of fake news\ncomputer science\n2018\n  1\n[ref]163\n\n A node with high betweenness is likely to be a “bridge” in a graph. Given the clustered structure of our citation graph, a bridge node could corresponds to highly cited papers, or to studies that are relevant for different disciplines, or both; in fact, 6 out of 10 papers in Table 6 are also in the in-degree top-10. Among the “newly” discovered contributions, paper 5 is a systematic literature review that describes a bibliometric analysis tailored on health-related misinformation; paper 7 is another survey that overviews political science most relevant contributions; paper 8 focuses on the psychological misinformation bias and its implication on the post-truth era (as paper 1); finally, paper 9 is one of the pioneering work describing data driven observations on the COVID-19 social media infodemic. It is probably not surprising that all of these studies could be of interest for a wide range of different disciplines. \n\n\n\nPaper information\nRef.\n\nid\ntitle\ndiscipline\nyear\ncluster\n\n\n1*\nSocial Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election\npolitical science\n2017\n  1\n\n\n2*\nThe spread of true and false news online\npsychology\n2018\n  1\n71\n\n3*\nFake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective\ncomputer science\n2017\n  2\n\n\n4*\nThe science of fake news\ncomputer science\n2018\n  1\n[ref]163\n\n5*\nMisinformation and Its Correction: Continued Influence and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful Debiasing\npsychology\n2012\n  3\n\n\n6*\nThe rise of social bots\ncomputer science\n2016\n  5\n5\n\n7*\nHow to fight an infodemic\npolitical science\n2020\n  4\n\n\n8*\n“Liar, Liar Pants on Fire”: A New Benchmark Dataset for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFake News Detection\ncomputer science\n2017\n  2\n72\n\n9*\nThe spreading of misinformation online\ncomputer science\n2016\n  9\n\n\n10\nAutomatic deception detection: methods for finding fake news\ncomputer science\n2015\n  2\n\n\n Page rank has already been used for finding “hidden gems” in citation networks (e.g., in ): although some papers do not receive a huge number of citations such as other hubs, they can be referred as very influential by other very important contributions.\nIn Table 7, we show the top-10 papers with highest page rank in our core library. Nevertheless, here we find that all the papers in this list have been already mentioned because of their high in-degree or betweenness scores, so that apparently page rank does not help to let emerge some other highly influential paper. However, we must consider that this network measure works well in the medium-long term, because we need to have different layers of “important” papers that cite other papers. This scientific field is probably too young to give page rank more insights abilities than other simpler measures. Looking at the periphery (see Table 8) allows us to go back to pioneering studies that preceded the boost of interest aroused after 2016. For the sake of brevity, we show here only the top-20 papers by in-degree only. \n\n\n\nPaper information\nRef.\n\nid\ntitle\ndiscipline\nyear\n\n\n1\nLong Short-Term Memory\ncomputer science\n1997\n\n\n2\nGlove: Global Vectors for Word Representation\ncomputer science\n2014\n08\n\n3\nInformation credibility on twitter\ncomputer science\n2011\n\n\n4\nThe case for motivated reasoning\npsychology\n1990\n\n\n5\nWhen Corrections Fail: The Persistence of Political Misperceptions\npolitical science\n2010\n\n\n6\nThe moderator–mediator variable distinction in social psychological\n\n\n\n\n\nresearch: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations\npsychology\n2014\n5\n\n7\nThe theory of planned behavior\npsychology\n1991\n\n\n8\nThe Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion\npolitical science\n1992\n85\n\n9\nSource monitoring\npsychology\n1993\n\n\n10\nCollective dynamics of ‘small-world’ networks\ncomputer science\n1998\n76\n\n11\nCutoff criteria for fit indexes in covariance structure analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\nConventional criteria versus new alternatives\nmathematics\n1999\n\n\n12\nEmergence of Scaling in Random Networks\ncomputer science\n1999\n3\n\n13\nWhat is Twitter, a social network or a news media?\n\n\n\n\n14\nMotivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs\npolitical science\n2006\n53\n\n15\nThe Strength of Weak Ties\nbusiness\n1973\n\n\n16\nBirds of a Feather: Homophily in Social Networks\nsociology\n2001\n\n\n17\nSocial Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship\nsociology\n2007\n\n\n18\nJudgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\ncomputer science\n1974\n63\n\n19\nUsers of the world, unite!

However, we have a strong signal that the current knowledge on how misinformation spreads is based on network science and computational linguistics, besides cognitive psychology, political science and sociology. In fact, some papers present artificial intelligence tools very popular in the computational linguistic community, such as LSTM (paper 1) and Glove (paper 2), classic statistical methods (papers 11 and 18), milestones in network science (papers 10, 12, 15, and 16), and early studies on emerging social media providing plenty of data to scientists and analysts (papers 13, 17, 19, and 20). To be noticed that current works on opinion dynamics, political partisanship and cognitive motivations for misinformation often refer to classic political/social/psychological science studies (book 8, papers 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 14). This could be very likely the list of the essential recommended readings for every advanced “social media manipulation” course.\n\nReference markers found: [163]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]163: spread of true and false news online\npsychology\n2018\n  1\n71\n\n2\nSocial Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election\npolitical science\n2017\n  1\n\n\n3\nThe science of fake news\ncomputer science\n2018\n  1\n[ref]163\n\n4\nFake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective\ncomputer science\n2017\n  2\n\n\n5\nMisinformation and Its Correction: Continued Influence and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
