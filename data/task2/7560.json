      "content": "Paper Title: FlaKat: A Machine Learning-Based Categorization Framework for Flaky Tests\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIncorporating machine learning algorithms into the identification of flaky tests is an effective solution according to recent studies¬† [ref]18 . One approach is to vectorize test case source code using the basic bag-of-words technique. Then, use machine learning classifiers, such as Random Forest, to predict whether a given test case is flaky or not¬†[ref]18 . Other approaches consider more factors related to the behaviour of test cases and extract additional source code features, such as the number of lines and test execution time¬†. Both approaches can achieve flakiness predictions with good performance and low overhead. The most recent work tracking the category of flaky test fixes is FlakyCat¬† where they classify flaky tests by keywords on embeddings vectorized by pre-trained neural network and achieved a weighted F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} of 0.7. They look at flakiness from a different perspective than IDoFT and could be a great aid in understanding the variation of flaky tests. Although the state-of-the-art does not include a universal repair strategy for all types of flaky tests, there are plenty of flaky test repair techniques for addressing specific types of flaky tests. For instance, concurrency-related flakiness can be mitigated by adding waitFor methods for the asynchronous wait blocks¬† . Automatic tools have also been developed for order-dependent and implementation-dependent flaky tests¬† [ref]16 and achieved successful fixes in real-life software projects to improve the reliability of their test suites. Recently, a deep-learning framework, FlakyFix¬†, took advantage of the existing large language models and achieved satisfying recommendations of flaky test fixes based on the history of manual flaky test repairs. So far, no framework effectively categorizes known flaky tests and labels them according to their behaviour and root cause. A potential approach to implementing this novel framework can adopt a machine-learning algorithm for fast and accurate classification while avoiding the runtime cost of repeated test execution. The new framework can provide categorical classifications following the standards established in prior studies, such as the distinction between order-dependent and implementation-dependent flaky tests¬† . Compared to the existing tools¬†[ref]18 , developers can gain more insight into the nature of the flaky tests, avoid similar mistakes, and boost their productivity.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Incorporating machine learning algorithms into the identification of flaky tests is an effective solution according to recent studies¬† [ref]18 .
