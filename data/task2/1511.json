For instance, Mou et al.  investigated the transferability of neural networks in sentence classification and sentence-pair classification tasks. One of their main findings is that transferability across domains depends on the level of similarity between the considered tasks. Unlikely, previous work in IR which mainly involves ranking tasks, have only casually applied transfer learning methods (e.g., fine-tuning , multi-tasking  and adversarial learning [ref]7) without bringing generalizable lessons about the transferability of neural ranking models. One consensual result reported across previous research in the area, is that traditional retrieval models (e.g., learning-to-rank models ) that make fewer distributional assumptions, exhibit more robust cross-domain performances [ref]7 0. Besides, it has been shown that the ability of neural ranking models to learn new features may be achieved at the cost of poor performances on domains not observed during training . Another consensual result is that although embeddings are trained using large scale corpora, they are generally sub-optimal for domain-specific ranking tasks 0. \nBeyond domain adaptation, there is a recent research trend in NLP toward lifelong learning of neural networks, particularly in machine translation 6, and language understanding tasks  9 [ref]51.\nFor instance, Xu et al. [ref]51 recently revisited the domain transferability of traditional word embeddings  and proposed lifelong domain embeddings using a meta-learning approach. The proposed meta-learner is fine-tuned to identify similar contexts of the same word in both past domains and the new observed domain. Thus, its\ninference model is able to compute the similarity scores on pairs of feature vectors representing the same word across domains. These embeddings have been successfully applied to a topic-classification task.\nUnlikely, catastrophic forgetting and lifelong learning are still under-studied in IR. We believe that a thorough analysis of the transferability of neural ranking models from a lifelong learning perspective would be desirable for a wide range of emerging open-domain IR applications including but not limited to conversational search    3.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Transferability of neural networks has been particularly studied in classification tasks, first in computer vision   and then only recently in NLP [ref]19  .
