      "content": "Paper Title: Calibrated Diffusion Tensor Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough DL models are rightly criticized for being too complex and hard to interpret, they are increasingly used to address safety-critical applications. Therefore, proper assessment of reliability and uncertainty of these models has high practical utility [ref]22. Yet, it has been shown that DL models produce overconfident and poorly calibrated predictions [ref]23 . Most prior studies have addressed classification problems [ref]22.\nUncertainty estimation of DL-based regression has received less attention. In fact, while for classification there is a widely-accepted definition of calibration, for regression different definitions have been proposed. A classifier that assigns label y^isubscript^𝑦𝑖\\hat{y}_{i} to the data sample xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} with probability pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is said to be calibrated if E​[y^i=ytrue]=pi𝐸delimited-[]subscript^𝑦𝑖subscript𝑦truesubscript𝑝𝑖E[\\hat{y}_{i}=y_{\\text{true}}]=p_{i}. Kuleshov et al. proposed a natural extension of this definition for regression . Consider a regression function that maps each input xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} to a probability distribution pi​(y)subscript𝑝𝑖𝑦p_{i}(y). Denoting the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} with Fisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i}, they suggest that the regression function is perfectly calibrated if: This definition is similar to the definitions based on credible intervals that have been used in many prior works . However, it has been suggested that this definition should be referred to as average calibration because it reflects the average calibration over the entire dataset rather than calibration on each individual data point  [ref]28. It is possible to have uninformative models with perfect average calibration. To avoid this problem, some studies have proposed to also quantify the sharpness/concentration of the predicted distributions [ref]28. Sharpness is usually quantified as the standard deviation of the predicted uncertainty or confidence intervals, and it is independent of the true distribution. An alternative definition that aims to overcome this shortcoming of Eq. 2 is adversarial group calibration , which essentially requires calibration over any random subset of the input space. Moreover, it has been shown that using the definition in Eq. 2 one can calibrate any output distribution, even distributions that are uncorrelated with the empirical uncertainty . Levi et al. have proposed an alternative definition that avoids the averaging. Denoting the predicted mean and variance, respectively, with μ​(x)𝜇𝑥\\mu(x) and σ​(x)𝜎𝑥\\sigma(x), perfect calibration is defined as one that follows: The idea behind this definition is that uncertainty, quantified as standard deviation σ𝜎\\sigma, should match the expected error. This definition, has similarities with definitions that have been proposed for classification [ref]23. Another set of metrics used to assess uncertainty calibration are based on proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and interval score . Alternatively, a number of works have followed distribution-free approaches to defining uncertainty and evaluating calibration. The central concept in these methods is to estimate prediction intervals that capture most of the observations while being as narrow as possible  . This has sometimes been referred to as the high-quality principle . Two widely used measures in these methods are Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Mean Prediction Interval Width (MPIW). Let us denote the lower and upper bounds of the prediction interval for the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\text{th}} data point with yLisubscriptsubscript𝑦𝐿𝑖{y_{L}}_{i} and yUisubscriptsubscript𝑦𝑈𝑖{y_{U}}_{i}. Then, PICP and MPIW are defined as  : A common objective is to minimize MPIW subject to PICP≤(1−α)PICP1𝛼\\text{PICP}\\leq(1-\\alpha), where α𝛼\\alpha is typically 0.01 or 0.05. Although there is much overlap between some of the criteria that have been discussed above, not all these criteria always agree . A combination of several of these measures may be necessary to produce a complete picture of estimation uncertainty in a specific application [ref]28.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: and hard to interpret, they are increasingly used to address safety-critical applications.
