      "content": "Paper Title: Algebraic Semantics of Generalized RIFs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGranular operator spaces, variants thereof and related partial algebras are abstract constructs that can express part of relations between objects, approximations of objects, generalized orders between objects, granular properties of approximations, and other rough-set theoretic properties The main advantage over other abstractions is that granules are directly part of the discourse and the distinction between Mer and Ord is maintained. Further the conditions on approximations are minimalist. As many as six variants of such spaces have been defined by the present author – these can be viewed as special cases of a set theoretic and a relation-theoretic abstraction with abstract operations from a category theory perspective. As proved in  , higher order versions are partial algebraic systems, the space in the terminology is because of mathematical usage conventions. Motivations for the present approach relate to issues of simplifying rough Y-systems (RYS)  to purely set theoretic contexts which in turn were motivated by the need to accommodate granulations and simultaneously generalize abstract approaches to rough sets   [ref]26 without superfluous assumptions. But over time, the level of abstraction has evolved to cover more ground beyond general rough and fuzzy set theories. In the literature on mereology     [ref]17 , it is argued that most ideas of binary part of relations in human reasoning are at least anti-symmetric and reflexive. A major reason for not requiring transitivity of the parthood relation is because of the functional reasons that lead to its failure (see ), and to accommodate apparent parthood . In the context of approximate reasoning interjected with subjective or pseudo-quantitative degrees, transitivity is again not common. The role of such parthoods in higher order approaches are distinctly different from theirs in lower order approaches – specifically, general approximation spaces of the form S𝑆S mentioned above with R𝑅R being a parthood relation are also of interest. In a high general granular operator space (GGS), defined below, aggregation and co-aggregation operations (∨,∧\\vee,\\,\\wedge) are conceptually separated from the binary parthood 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P}), and a basic partial order relation (≤\\leq). Parthood is assumed to be reflexive and antisymmetric. It may satisfy additional generalized transitivity conditions in many contexts. Real-life information processing often involves many non-evaluated instances of aggregations (disjunctions), co-aggregation (conjunctions) and implications because of laziness or supporting meta data or for other reasons – this justifies the use of partial operations. Specific versions of a GGS and granular operator spaces have been studied in  by the present author for handling a very large spectrum of rough set contexts. GGS has the ability to handle adaptive situations as in 8 9 through special morphisms – this is again harder to express without partial operations. The underlying set 𝕊¯¯𝕊\\underline{\\mathbb{S}} can be a set of sets of attributes, but this interpretation is not compulsory. In actual practice, the set of all attributes in a context need not be known exactly to the reasoning agent constructing the approximations. The element ⊤top\\top may be omitted in these situations or the issue can be managed through restrictions on the granulation. While the elements of 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S} can have many meanings, A High General Granular Operator Space (GGS) 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S} is a partial algebraic system of the form 𝕊=⟨𝕊¯,γ,l,u,𝐏,≤,∨,∧,⊥,⊤⟩𝕊¯𝕊𝛾𝑙𝑢𝐏bottomtop\\mathbb{S}\\,=\\,\\left\\langle\\underline{\\mathbb{S}},\\gamma,l,u,\\mathbf{P},\\leq,\\vee,\\wedge,\\bot,\\top\\right\\rangle with 𝕊¯¯𝕊\\underline{\\mathbb{S}} being a set, γ𝛾\\gamma being a unary predicate that determines 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} (by the condition γ​x𝛾𝑥\\gamma x if and only if x∈𝒢𝑥𝒢x\\in\\mathcal{G})\nan admissible granulation(defined below) for 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S} and l,u𝑙𝑢l,u being operators :𝕊¯⟼𝕊¯:absent⟼¯𝕊¯𝕊:\\underline{\\mathbb{S}}\\longmapsto\\underline{\\mathbb{S}} satisfying the following (𝕊¯¯𝕊\\underline{\\mathbb{S}} is replaced with 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S} if clear from the context. ∨\\vee and ∧\\wedge are idempotent partial operations and 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} is a binary predicate. Further γ​x𝛾𝑥\\gamma x will be replaced by x∈𝒢𝑥𝒢x\\in\\mathcal{G} for convenience.): Let ℙℙ\\mathbb{P} stand for proper parthood, defined via ℙ​a​bℙ𝑎𝑏\\mathbb{P}ab if and only if 𝐏​a​b&¬𝐏​b​a𝐏𝑎𝑏𝐏𝑏𝑎\\mathbf{P}ab\\,\\&\\,\\neg\\mathbf{P}ba). A granulation is said to be admissible if there exists a term operation t𝑡t formed from the weak lattice operations such that the following three conditions hold: The conditions defining admissible granulations mean that every approximation is somehow representable by granules in a algebraic way, that every granule coincides with its lower approximation (granules are lower definite), and that all pairs of distinct granules are part of definite objects (those that coincide with their own lower and upper approximations). Special cases of the above are defined next. For details, the reader is referred to 0 . In a GGS, if the parthood is defined by 𝐏​a​b𝐏𝑎𝑏\\mathbf{P}ab if and only if a≤b𝑎𝑏a\\leq b then the GGS is said to be a high granular operator space GS. A higher granular operator space (HGOS) 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S} is a GS in which the lattice operations are total. In a higher granular operator space, if the lattice operations are set theoretic union and intersection, then the HGOS will be said to be a set HGOS. In the context of Def. 2 if additional lower and upper approximation operations are present in the signature, then the system will be referred to as an enhanced GGS (EGGS. Under certain conditions, partial or total groupoid operations can correspond to binary relations on a set. Related algebraic results are used by the present author (see ) to rewrite the GGS as partial algebras . These results can be used to improve the axiomatic frameworks used.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: rough Y-systems (RYS)  to purely set theoretic contexts which in turn were motivated by the need to accommodate granulations and simultaneously generalize abstract approaches to rough sets   [ref]26 without superfluous assumptions.
