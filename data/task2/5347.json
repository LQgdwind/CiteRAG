      "content": "Paper Title: Local consistency as a reduction between constraint satisfaction problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provide a few examples to illustrate the power of k𝑘k-consistency reductions. First, note that it is consistent with the current understanding of complexity of promise CSPs that a promise CSP is NP-hard if and only if it allows a k𝑘k-consistency reduction from an NP-hard CSP (e.g., graph 3-colouring).\nFor example, the reductions of Barto and Kozik  are covered by k𝑘k-consistency reductions, and consequently many results about NP-hardness of promise CSPs can be explained by a k𝑘k-consistency reduction including the hardness of 555 colouring 333-colourable graphs  and the NP-hardness in [24; 4; 36; 27; 5; 40]. The NP-hardness of colouring k𝑘k-colourable graphs with (k⌊k/2⌋)−1binomial𝑘𝑘21\\binom{k}{\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor}-1 colours provided by Wrochna and Živný [ref]47 (which is the current state-of-the-art for k≥5𝑘5k\\geq 5) is also obtained by a k𝑘k-consistency reduction from a previous result of Huang . Second, several well-known hierarchies of relaxation algorithms for promise CSPs fall within our framework. A comprehensive look at hierarchies is given in Section 4 where we describe several hierarchies in terms of k𝑘k-consistency reductions to a fixed problem. This includes the bounded width hierarchy (i.e., the hierarchy of promise CSPs expressible by Datalog), and the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear programming for promise CSPs.\nFurthermore, we show that the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of (promise) CSPs coincides with the hierarchy of (promise) CSPs reducible to linear programming by a k𝑘k-consistency reduction (Theorem 4.5).\nA different framework to study hierarchies of relaxations of algorithms was recently introduced by Ciardo and Živný . The Ciardo-Živný hierarchy is always subsumed by the hierarchy of k𝑘k-consistency reductions to a fixed problem, and in some cases, e.g., the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, both hierarchies align perfectly. One of the new hierarchies is of particular interest to us — the hierarchy of problems that reduce via a k𝑘k-consistency reduction to solving linear equations with integer coefficients. We provide several pieces of evidence for our belief that this hierarchy of relaxations might solve all finite-template CSPs solvable by algorithms of Bulatov  and Zhuk . If true, this would yield a substantially simpler polynomial-time algorithm for such CSPs, and a new proof of the CSP dichotomy. As a final example of the enhanced power of k𝑘k-consistency reductions, see Figure 1 which shows all Boolean CSPs ordered by three types of reductions (Fig. 1(a) is due to Bodirsky and Vucaj ), and confirms our conjecture in the Boolean case. Since consistency reductions contain, as a particular case, gadget reductions, it follows that any class of (promise) CSPs closed under consistency reductions can be, at least theoretically, described in terms of polymorphisms. This is a very desirable feature as polymorphisms lie at the heart of the algebraic approach. As a direct consequence of our findings it follows that both the class of promise CSPs solvable by local consistency and the class of promise CSPs solvable by some level of the Sherali-Adams relaxation are closed under gadget reductions. While the former result had previously been established in [6, Lemma 7.5] extending an analogous result for non-promise CSPs by Larose and Zádori , the latter result, in its full generality, is new. Prior to our work it had only been known for the particular case of non-promise CSPs where it can be derived by combining the results of Thapper and Živný  and Barto and Kozik [ref]8.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: and the NP-hardness in [24; 4; 36; 27; 5; 40].
