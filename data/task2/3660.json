      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Effective Clustered Federated Learning: A Peer-to-peer Framework with Adaptive Neighbor Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proliferation of smart devices such as mobile phones, cameras, and sensors has dramatically expanded the perception of edge intelligence, increasingly forming\nan Internet of Things (IoT) network   [ref]3. The massive data from edge devices is key in generating powerful predictive models to provide better services to users. However, transferring the edge data to the data server poses a high privacy risk and high communication traffic burden, which renders the traditional centralized training ineffective. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL)  [ref]5   is proposed to facilitate collaborative training among edge clients without transferring the data to the cloud server. FL guarantees user privacy, reduces communication latency, and enhances learning performance, and it has broad and promising applications in IoT systems  [ref]3. In the real-world practice of FL, heterogeneity is an inherent problem (i.e. the Non-IID problem) since clients may have heterogeneous data distributions and thus diverse optimization objectives (learning tasks) . Clustered heterogeneity is prevalent in users’ data, which means that a small group of clients has similar data distributions while there is dominant inconsistency among different groups. It is very common in applications such as recommendation systems  0. Therefore, clustered FL methods 1 2 3 4 are proposed for better personalization by grouping clients into clusters and maintaining a global model in each cluster. The main challenge of clustered heterogeneity is that the latent similarity relationship among clients is unknown. Existing clustered FL researches adopt the conventional server-client communication pattern and estimate clients’ cluster identities by iterative 1 or hierarchical 3 methods. These centralized clustered FL methods highly rely on the assumed number of clusters or the assumed hierarchical level. However, in the real-world environment, the clustered relationship is latent, and it is impossible to know the number of clusters as prior knowledge. Inappropriate estimations of clusters’ numbers will cause bad convergence. Besides, other concerns, like the reliability and communication bandwidth issues 5, brought by the central server, also hinder the performance of these centralized clustered FL methods. To address these challenges, in this paper, we transform the client clustering problem into a binary classification problem from a peer-to-peer (P2P) perspective. Under P2P communication, each client decides whether to accept an accessible client as its neighbor based on local similarity measurement. Clients will select the most similar peers as their neighbors to realize personalization. Once the neighbor estimation is established, a clustered communication topology will be inherently built without assuming the number of clusters. Our method is named as Personalized Adaptive Neighbour Matching (PANM) and it is proved to be effective and robust in various clustered heterogeneity. In addition to the advantages compared with centralized clustered FL, PANM has superior performance over P2P FL counterparts. In previous works, most P2P FL algorithms assume random or fixed communication topologies 6 7 and they focus on reaching the global consensus by optimization techniques 8 9. But in clustered heterogeneity, the global consensus does not exist, and random or fixed communications will harm personalization and decrease the accuracy. On the contrary, our method achieves partial group consensus by realizing the adaptive topology. Our main contributions are as follows. We propose two efficient, effective, and privacy-preserving metrics to evaluate the pair-wise similarity of client objectives in P2P FL. They are based on losses and gradients, respectively. We present PANM, a novel clustered FL algorithm based on P2P communication. PANM enables clients to match neighbors with consistent objectives (same cluster identity), improving local performance. We devise two stages in PANM, the first is neighbor selection based on Monte Carlo, and the second is neighbor augmentation based on Gaussian Mixture Model. We provide theoretical guarantees of PANM. We conduct extensive experiments on different datasets, Non-IID degrees, and network settings under both synthetic and real-world clustered heterogeneity. It is shown that PANM outperforms all P2P baselines, including Oracle that has the prior knowledge of cluster identities. Compared with centralized clustered FL algorithms, PANM is more effective in exploring latent cluster structure and has better performance. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related works in clustered FL and P2P FL. Section 3 provides basic formulation about P2P clustered FL. Section 4 elaborates the technical details of PANM, including the two metrics for measuring client similarity and the two-stage neighbor matching algorithm. Theoretical analysis is also included in Section 4. Section 5 presents the experimental results. Sections 6 and 7 provide further discussions and the conclusion of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: proliferation of smart devices such as mobile phones, cameras, and sensors has dramatically expanded the perception of edge intelligence, increasingly forming\nan Internet of Things (IoT) network   [ref]3.
