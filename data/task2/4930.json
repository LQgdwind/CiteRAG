      "content": "Paper Title: Google’s Quantum Supremacy Claim: Data, Documentation, and Discussion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile the Google experiment was characterized as performing a sampling task, the empirical distribution was not compared to the noise model, and the experimental samples were too small to allow such a comparison (directly) when n>14𝑛14n>14. Google’s quantum supremacy claim is based on a comparison with a single classical algorithm.\nThe Google team itself developed better algorithms for related computational tasks. When the Google team found an improved type of algorithm (around May 2019) they\nswitched to a different class of circuits to which the new algorithm could not not be applied without\nsufficient evidence that similar improvements could not be made for them as well. (Later, as we mentioned, improvements were also made to the new class of circuits.) The results were not presented to the academic community before publication (e.g., as an arXiv publication), and careful review of the experiment prior to publication may have been insufficient.\n In view of the rigid nature of the experimental circuits, the reference to a “programmable quantum computer” in the paper’s title is unjustified. The notion of quantum supremacy as a scientific claim is problematic. This concern was raised by Borcherds [ref]8 and several other scientists. The main fidelity estimator ℱX​E​Bsubscriptℱ𝑋𝐸𝐵{\\cal F}_{XEB} is not unbiased and can be improved . Changing to a new pattern ABCDCDAB weakened the power of the extrapolation argument. For the new pattern no experiments for\ncircuits with fewer than 53 qubits were conducted.\n(This was a weakness in the planning of the experiment although some of the fidelity predictions are now confirmed .) Improvements to the calibration process were carried out at the same time as\nthe experiment was being run. The description of the calibration process in Google’s popular video  may be in tension with the claim that there was a clear separation between the calibration stage and the experiment itself. The calibration process itself further weakens the claim for a “programmable quantum computer.” (This concern was raised\nby a commentator “Till” in an Internet discussion ; it was also raised and discussed even earlier by Gidney from the Google team ).) The effect of the calibration process is very large (it is not a “fine tuning” of some sort). The precise programs for the calibration process are commercial secrets. (However, the main innovation in the calibration was the use of XEB,\nand that code is open-sourced.) The levels of transparency and of documentation of the Google experiment seem insufficient. Of the items presented above some are controversial, some are rather minor, and many are interrelated. Items (15) and (16) are a priori weaknesses that turned out to be crucial (as seen by refutation (6) above). The recent confirmations (2) indicate that weakness (20) may have no bearing on the predictions for large circuits, but we still regard it as a weakness in the planning of the experiment. (The Google team disagrees with us.) A recent remarkable work of Gao, Kalinowski, Chou, Lukin, Barak, and Choi  is relevant to some of the concerns discussed above. Analysis based on  strengthens concern (10) and casts some doubt on our confirmation (3). For a random quantum circuit C𝐶C, Gao et al.’s paper describes a method for producing samples with high linear cross-entropy value, without computing the probabilities described by C𝐶C. We also note that the expectations expressed in the Google paper \nseem overly optimistic: “Quantum processors have thus reached the regime of quantum supremacy. We expect that their computational power will continue to grow at a double-exponential rate: the classical cost of simulating a quantum circuit increases exponentially with computational volume, and hardware improvements will probably follow a quantum-processor equivalent of Moore’s law, doubling this computational volume every few years.” There is no evidence for doubly exponential growth (or even slower growth) of computational power, and there are theoretical reasons ( 6 ) to doubt that these expectations will be fulfilled.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: the reference to a “programmable quantum computer” in the paper’s title is unjustified.
