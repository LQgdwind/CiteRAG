      "content": "Paper Title: A weakly compressible hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin formulation for fluid-structure interaction problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe simulation of the interaction of fluid flows with flexible structures is of great interest in many engineering fields and it has been extensively investigated over the last decades.\nThe numerical techniques developed for the solution of this challenging multiphysics problem can be catalogued based on many different aspects, for instance, with respect to the spatial discretization, the kinematical description, and the coupling of the fluid and the structure subproblems. Among many other techniques developed so far, the finite element method is one of the most successful spatial discretization approaches for the solution of the partial differential equations (PDEs) underlying many physical phenomena, including fluid-structure interaction.\nThe standard continuous Galerkin method provides computationally efficient discretizations with a very limited number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) for the solution of elasticity problems.\nFor an overview on CG methods for solid mechanics, the interested reader is referred to .\nOn the other hand, the interest in discontinuous Galerkin methods has increased over the last decades in the computational fluid dynamics community [ref]43   because of their distinctive properties, such as the inherited stabilization of the convection terms in conservation laws, the ability to construct high order discretizations on unstructured meshes and the flexibility in performing pùëùp-adaptivity in addition to the classical h‚Ñéh-adaptivity.\nMore recently, hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods have gained a lot of attention owing to their reduced computational costs with respect to classical matrix-based DG approaches, thanks to the reduced number of global DOFs in the associated linear systems, especially for high-degree polynomial approximations.\nMoreover, the possibility to obtain a superconvergent solution through an efficient element-by-element postprocessing allows to obtain an improved approximation of the solution and to drive efficient degree adaptivity procedures   .\nIn the context of flow problems, the HDG method has been successfully applied for the discretization of fully compressible flows  as well as incompressible flows   .\nThe strong enforcement of the symmetry of the stress tensor via Voigt notation to retrieve the optimal convergence of the mixed variable and to ensure the superconvergence of the postprocessed solution without additional enrichment of the discrete spaces has been proposed in   and it is exploited also in the proposed formulation for weakly compressible flows.\nThe solution of FSI problems with incompressible flows by means of the HDG method for both the fluid and the structure has been formulated in  .\nHowever, these formulations are computationally much more expensive than the one proposed here and they moreover fail to provide an optimal convergent structural strain field (and therefore a superconvergent displacement field), losing therefore one of the key advantages of the HDG method. A successful coupling of DG and CG methods for the solution of fluid-structure interaction problems has been proposed in , where the high-order accuracy in time given by the implicit-explicit Runge‚ÄìKutta method has been demonstrated on a non-trivial test problem.\nAs opposed to , the formulation proposed here aims to couple the HDG method for the discretization of the fluid equations and the CG method for the solution of the structural problem and a high-order accuracy is demonstrated for the hybrid spatial discretization on a problem with manufactured solution.\nA first attempt to couple HDG and CG discretizations has been proposed in , while an improved minimally-intrusive HDG-CG coupling has been formulated in  for the solution of multi-material structural problems, involving compressible and nearly incompressible solids. An important aspect in the simulation of multiphysics problems is the choice of an appropriate kinematical description.\nPure fluid problems are commonly solved with an Eulerian description, i.e., the computational mesh is fixed and the fluid moves with respect to the grid.\nThis approach facilitates the treatment of large distortion in the fluid motion and it is in particular indispensable in case of turbulent flows.\nOn the contrary, the Lagrangian description is usually used in structural mechanics and with this approach the nodes of the mesh follow the associated material particles during the motion, facilitating the tracking of free surfaces and interfaces between different materials.\nArbitrary Lagrangian‚ÄìEulerian (ALE) algorithms  aim to combine the advantages of the classical kinematical descriptions by introducing a computational mesh which can move with a velocity independent of the velocity of the material particles.\nThis technique is particularly useful for flow problems in the presence of mobile and deforming boundaries, as it happens in fluid-structure interaction   [ref]44. In the formulation derived here, the Arbitrary Lagrangian‚ÄìEulerian method is used for the description of the fluid flow, while the total Lagrangian method is adopted for the description of the structural motion. Regarding the coupling of the single fields, partitioned schemes solve one subproblem per time and exchange the interface information between the fluid and the structure.\nThe exchange of the interface state is performed just once per time step in the so-called loosely-coupled staggered approaches , while the solution of the flow and structural problems are repeated within one time step until a convergence criterion is satisfied in the strongly-coupled staggered approaches .\nThe partitioned schemes may suffer several stability and convergence issues, but on the other hand they allow the use of well established and optimized single-field solvers.\nIn particular, these schemes are affected by a detrimental phenomenon, defined in literature ‚Äúartificial added mass effect‚Äù and analyzed in   in the context of incompressible flows.\nIn a recent work 2, it is analytically demonstrated how the introduction of a weak compressibility in the fluid formulation alleviates the constraints of the instability condition of the artificial added mass effect, thanks to the reduction of the maximal eigenvalue of the so-called added mass operator.\nMoreover, in comparison to a fully incompressible solver, a significant reduction of the coupling iterations and the computational time is observed.\nIt is worth highlighting that alternative approaches to relax the incompressibility constraint based on the artificial compressibility, as the ones proposed in   in the context of DG methods, provide a strongly consistent approximation of the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations.\nEmbedding such fluid solvers in a partitioned FSI code would not offer any beneficial contribution against the artificial added mass effect.\nA general framework for constructing high-order partitioned solvers based on implicit-explicit Runge‚ÄìKutta methods for the solution of multiphysics problems (including fluid-structure interaction) has been introduced in 5, where four consistent predictors are proposed, leading to different partitioned solvers that preserve the theoretical order of accuracy of the temporal integration scheme.\nAs opposed to the partitioned strategies, in a monolithic framework  3, a unique solver is in charge of the solution of the complete system of nonlinear equations.\nThis approach exhibits a higher robustness and it is usually faster compared to partitioned strategies in challenging cases, but it requires an ad hoc implementation.\nIn addition, the adoption of efficient preconditioners is often needed for the solution of computationally demanding problems. In the present contribution, a strongly-coupled staggered scheme based on the Dirichlet‚ÄìNeumann partitioning is revisited for the hybrid HDG-CG coupling and a novel FSI monolithic approach based on Nitsche‚Äôs method is also introduced.\nIt is worth noting that the partitioned algorithm adopted here considers a strong Gauss‚ÄìSeidel-type predictor, which is acknowledged in 5 to be most stable among the techniques therein analyzed.\nA weak compressibility is then considered in the fluid formulation in order to provide an improved robustness and efficiency for the coupled solver. The present article is organized as follows.\nFirst, the novel HDG formulation for weakly compressible flows is derived in section 2 for pure fluid problems with an Arbitrary Lagrangian‚ÄìEulerian description.\nIn section 3 the standard CG formulation for nonlinear elastodynamics is briefly recalled and the two HDG-CG coupling strategies for fluid-structure interaction are presented.\nSection 4 is devoted to the numerical validation of the pure fluid formulation first and the coupling strategies for fluid-structure interaction afterwards.\nFinally, in section 5, the results of this work are summarized.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: mechanics, the interested reader is referred to .\nOn the other hand, the interest in discontinuous Galerkin methods has increased over the last decades in the computational fluid dynamics community [ref]43   because of their distinctive properties, such as the inherited stabilization of the convection terms in conservation laws, the ability to construct high order discretizations on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
