      "content": "Paper Title: DiffWire: Inductive Graph Rewiring via the Lov√°sz Bound\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we provide an overview of the most relevant works that have been proposed in the literature to tackle the challenges of over-smoothing, over-squashing and under-reaching in MPNNs by means of graph rewiring and pooling. Graph Rewiring in MPNNs. Rewiring is a process of changing the graph‚Äôs structure to control the information flow and hence improve the ability of the network to perform the task at hand (e.g. node or graph classification, link prediction‚Ä¶). Several approaches have been proposed in the literature for graph rewiring, such as connectivity diffusion [ref]25 or evolution [ref]20, adding new bridge-nodes  and multi-hop filters , and neighborhood , node  and edge  sampling. Edge sampling methods sample the graph‚Äôs edges based on their weights or relevance, which might be computed in different ways. Rong et¬†al.  show that randomly dropping edges during training improves the performance of GNNs. Klicpera et¬†al. [ref]25, define edge relevance according to the coefficients of a parameterized diffusion process over the graph and then edges are selected using a threshold rule. For Kazi et¬†al. , edge relevance is given by the similarity between the nodes‚Äô attributes.\nIn addition, a reinforcement learning process rewards edges leading to a correct classification and penalizes the rest. Edge sampling-based rewiring has been proposed to tackle over-smoothing and over-squashing in MPNNs. Over-smoothing may be relieved by removing inter-class edges¬†. However, this strategy is only valid when the graph is homophilic, i.e. connected nodes tend to share similar attributes. Otherwise, removing these edges could lead to over-squashing¬†[ref]20 if their removal obstructs the message passing between distant nodes belonging to the same class (heterophily). Increasing the size of the bottlenecks of the graph via rewiring has been shown to improve node classification performance in heterophilic graphs, but not in homophilic graphs¬†[ref]20. Recently, Topping et¬†al. [ref]20 propose an edge relevance function given by the edge curvature to mitigate over-squashing. They identify the bottleneck of the graph by computing the Ricci curvature of the edges. Next, they remove edges with high curvature and add edges around minimal curvature edges. Graph Structure Learning (GSL). GSL methods¬† aim to learn an optimized graph structure and its corresponding representations at the same time. DiffWire could be seen from the perspective of GSL: CT-Layer, as a metric-based, neural approach, and GAP-Layer, as a direct-neural approach to optimize the structure of the graph to the task at hand. Graph Pooling. Pooling layers simplify the original graph by compressing it into a smaller graph or a vector via pooling operators, which range from simple  to more sophisticated approaches, such as DiffPool¬† and MinCut pool¬†.\nAlthough graph pooling methods do not consider the edge representations, there is a clear relationship between pooling methods and rewiring since both of them try to quantify the flow of information through the graph‚Äôs bottleneck. Positional Encodings (PEs) A Positional Encoding is a feature that describes the global or local position of the nodes in the graph. These features are related to random walk measures and the Laplacian‚Äôs eigenvectors¬†. Commute Times embeddings (CTEs) may be considered an expressive form of PEs due to their spectral properties, i.e. their relation with the shortest path, the spectral gap or Cheeger constant. Velingker et¬†al. [ref]35 recently proposed use the CTEs as PE or commute times (CT) as edge feature. They pre-compute the CTEs and CT and add it as node or edge features to improve the structural expressiveness of the GNN. PEs are typically pre-computed and then used to build more expressive graph architectures, either by concatenating them to the node features or by building transformer models¬† .\nOur work is related to PEs as CT-Layer learns the original PEs from the input ùêóùêó\\mathbf{X} and the adjacency matrix ùêÄùêÄ\\mathbf{A} instead of pre-computing and potentially modifying them, as previous works do¬†   [ref]35. Thus, CT-Layer may be seen as a method to automatically learn the PEs for graph rewiring.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: network to perform the task at hand (e.g. node or graph classification, link prediction‚Ä¶).
