      "content": "Paper Title: AMS-DRL: Learning Multi-Pursuit Evasion for Safe Targeted Navigation of Drones\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith self-play   , RL has achieved remarkable success in adversarial environments (or competitive games), such as DeepMind’s AlphaZero , AlphaStar [ref]42 and OpenAI Five . Self-play uses the agent’s current or past “selves” as opponents to train the agents to automatically generate curricula, which can be a powerful algorithm for learning behaviors within high-dimensional continuous environments. Silver et al.  demonstrated the superhuman performance of AlphaZero, a general RL algorithm with self-play, in many challenging perfect-information games (such as chess, shogi, and Go) without domain knowledge. To address large-scale imperfect-information games with RL, Heinrich et al.  introduced Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) via a combination of Fictitious Self-Play (FSP)  and neural networks, and demonstrated it can approach NE without prior domain knowledge over real-world scale games. Following that, Vinyals et al. [ref]42 provided the first Grandmaster level player-AlphaStar in the real-time strategy game StarCraft II with complex, imperfect information and long-time horizons. AlphaStar features a Prioritized Fictitious Self-Play (PFSP) algorithm, which adopts a match-making mechanism to provide a better learning signal instead of uniformly playing against all previous “selves” to improve the training efficiency. In the year 2019, OpenAI Five  first defeated the world champions in Dota 2 game with proposed self-play experience buffers and surgery techniques, which achieved large-scale distributed learning and long-time training. These methods paved the way for training agents in complicated adversarial environments and provided them with superhuman performance against opponents. Furthermore, OpenAI found that multi-agent self-play can induce distinctive emergent strategies toward open-ended growth in complexity , which helped solve evolution-required decision-making problems. However, all the aforementioned methods only process zero-sum two-team games where the rewards of two adversarial teams can be flipped, i.e., the sum of rewards for two teams remains zero during training. In fact, it is determined by the inherent property of self-play that exploits “selves” as opponents during training, which means two adversarial teams’ observations and rewards must be symmetric. Nevertheless, pursuit-evasion for drones is not a zero-sum game since the runner drone is required to reach the target while the chaser drones aim to pursue the runner drone. The success of reaching the target will not bring a loss to the chasing team. Meanwhile, the observation spaces for the runner agent and chaser agents are not symmetric since the chaser drones cannot perceive the location of the target. In our work, we extend the capabilities of DRL to address the pursuit-evasion problem for drones via AMS-DRL. AMS-DRL provides a cold-start learning stage for the runner drone to reach the target and asynchronous training for two adversarial teams at multiple stages/phases. At each phase, agents can compete with their opponents driven by the policy from the prior stage/phase. The limitation of self-play is addressed via the asynchronous training scheme toward an approximate NE.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: With self-play   , RL has achieved remarkable success in adversarial environments (or competitive games), such as DeepMind’s AlphaZero , AlphaStar [ref]42 and OpenAI Five .
