      "content": "Paper Title: BD-MSA: Body decouple VHR Remote Sensing Image Change Detection method guided by multi-scale feature information aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compared the approaches mentioned in this work to some SOTA methods, which are listed below: FC-EF, FC-Siam-Di and FC-Siam-Conc  are built on fully convolutional networks [ref]54 with a model structure similar to that of U-Net [ref]55, and they use distinct methodologies to analyze paired image data. BIT [ref]25 introduces Transformer  to classic CNN change detection networks, which can more effectively capture long-distance interdependence and complex spatial dynamics. ChangeFormer , unlike typical fully convolutional network-based techniques, ChangeFormer combines a hierarchically structured Transformer encoder and a multilayer perceptron decoder to efficiently capture long range information at multi-scale, enhancing change detection accuracy. ChangerEx-MiT  emphasizes the significance of feature interaction and presents simple but effective interaction mechanisms—AD and feature “exchange”. HANet  addresses the challenge of data imbalance between changed and unchanged pixels in the change detection task by proposing a stepwise foreground-balanced sampling strategy to improve model learning for changed pixels and employing a concatenated network structure with hierarchical attention to integrate multi-scale features for finer detection. IFNet  collects deep features using a fully convolved two-stream architecture and then uses a difference discrimination network and an attention module to identify changes, highlighting the significance of deep supervision in improving border integrity and object internal compactness. SNUNet , through tight hopping connections between the encoder and decoder as well as between decoders, SNUNet is able to maintain high-resolution fine-grained features while mitigating pixel uncertainty at the borders of changing targets and deterministic missingness of small targets. STANet  captures spatial-temporal correlations via a self-attentive method in order to generate more discriminative features. It was divided into three variants, STANet-Base, STANet-Bam, and STANet-Pam. TINY-CD  employs the Siamese U-Net architecture and a new feature mixing method to optimally utilize low-level information for spatial and temporal domains, while also offering a new spatial-semantic attention mechanism via its Mix and Attention Mask Block (MAMB).\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: We compared the approaches mentioned in this work to some SOTA methods, which are listed below: FC-EF, FC-Siam-Di and FC-Siam-Conc  are built on fully convolutional networks [ref]54 with a model structure similar to that of U-Net [ref]55, and they use distinct methodologies to analyze paired image data.
