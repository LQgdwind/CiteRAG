      "content": "Paper Title: A unified framework for dataset shift diagnostics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset shift detection methods can have different objectives. For instance, specific approaches monitor the test error of a predictor over time, triggering an alarm when there is a significant degradation in its performance [ref]11  . Other approaches are specifically designed to provide a deeper understanding of how data distribution has changed by detecting specific types of shifts, e.g., changes in the distribution of features. Our research aligns closely with the latter category, which we will delve into next. Source and target distributions can be different in many ways. For instance, if PY(1)≠PY(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃1𝑌subscriptsuperscript𝑃2𝑌P^{(1)}_{Y}\\neq P^{(2)}_{Y} but P𝐗|Y(1)=P𝐗|Y(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃1conditional𝐗𝑌subscriptsuperscript𝑃2conditional𝐗𝑌P^{(1)}_{\\mathbf{X}|Y}=P^{(2)}_{\\mathbf{X}|Y}, then the dataset shift can be characterized as label shift. If labels from the target domain are unavailable, label shift detection and quantification are not straightforward but can be accomplished under some conditions  [ref]45. The method proposed by Lipton et al. , for example, exploits arbitrary black box classifiers and their confusion matrices to estimate PY(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑃2𝑌P^{(2)}_{Y}. In a different direction, various methods are available when we are interested in detecting or understanding changes in the marginal distribution of possibly high-dimensional features 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}. Detecting shifts in P𝐗subscript𝑃𝐗P_{\\mathbf{X}} can be solved using two-sample tests  , and some extensions are possible. For example, Jang et al.  proposes an online approach in which data is seen sequentially, and Wijaya et al.  proposes extracting concept-based features from images (e.g., rotation, shape) and then testing for shifts of those concepts. Moreover, Ginsberg et al.  proposes a method for harmful covariate shift detection while Luo et al.  proposes a martingale-based approach in which false alarms are controlled over time. For objectives centered on detecting shifts in conditional distributions like PY|𝐗subscript𝑃conditional𝑌𝐗P_{Y|\\mathbf{X}}, several methods emerge. For instance, Schrouff et al.  proposes using a conditional independence test to detect shifts in conditional distributions in the context of algorithmic fairness. In contrast, Vovk  proposes a martingale-based approach to detect online changes in P𝐗|Ysubscript𝑃conditional𝐗𝑌P_{\\mathbf{X}|Y} considering classification problems. While identifying specific types of shifts is essential, it is typically insufficient for making informed decisions. Ideally, practitioners should access a unified framework that evaluates multiple dataset shifts, guiding them on optimal next steps. That framework would also allow the practitioner to compare the strength of the several shift types, permitting a more interpretable analysis. Webb et al. [ref]47 proposes a framework with those characteristics. The authors use the total variation (TV) distance between two probability distributions to measure shifts in PYsubscript𝑃𝑌P_{Y}, P𝐗subscript𝑃𝐗P_{\\mathbf{X}}, PY|𝐗subscript𝑃conditional𝑌𝐗P_{Y|\\mathbf{X}}, and P𝐗|Ysubscript𝑃conditional𝐗𝑌P_{\\mathbf{X}|Y}, to provide the practitioner with valuable insights. Their approach is limited, however. Estimating the TV distance between two probability distributions is challenging when variables are not discrete or their dimensionality is high (see Figure 3 in our experiments section).\nMoreover, Webb et al. [ref]47 does not suggest using formal hypothesis testing. Thus, false alarm control is not guaranteed. Building upon Webb et al. [ref]47, our work augments their framework, offering adaptability to high-dimensional/continuous data and integrating rigorous hypothesis testing.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: can have different objectives.
