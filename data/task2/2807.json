      "content": "Paper Title: DNN-assisted Particle-based Bayesian Joint Synchronization and Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe fifth-generation (5G) of mobile communication networks is expected to deploy Access Points (APs) with a high spatial density to meet the increasing demand for mobile data traffic. As a result, Mobile Users (MUs) are expected to be most of the time in Line-of-Sight (LoS) of several APs. This also lays the ground for an accurate MU localization, which is in particular of crucial importance for services such as user tracking and location-assisted beamforming  . Furthermore, such APs are likely to be equipped with antenna arrays and they are expected to support Fine Time Measurement (FTM) capability introduced in several standards, e.g., IEEE 802.11 . The former facilitates the Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation, while the latter allows for the AP-MU time-stamp exchange, by means of which synchronization and distance measurements are enabled. The synchronization itself also plays a decisive role when performing time-based localization. In particular, for many of the state-of-the-art MU localization techniques to function, the clock parameters of the MUs need to be known (or to be continuously tracked). Therefore, it appears that the MU’s clock parameter estimation and MU localization are closely intertwined and need to be tackled jointly. The joint MU synchronization and localization (sync&loc) problem has been extensively addressed in the literature [ref]4 [ref]5   [ref]8 . The authors in [ref]5 rely on symmetric inter-agent (AP-MU, inter-MU, and inter-AP) time-stamp exchange and Belief Propagation (BP) to jointly estimate MUs’ locations and clock offsets. A similar approach has been adopted by   with the aid of asymmetric time-stamp exchange mechanism proposed in 0. While time-stamp exchange is expected to be supported in 5G networks , the high number of message-passings required by BP renders the approach limited in practice. Additionally, [ref]5   0  provide the estimation of the sync&loc parameters at MUs, whereas for the location-based services to be delivered, these parameters need to be computed at the network side. Another drawback is the strong assumption of a fully cooperative network (also made in 1). That is, in addition to inter-AP and AP-MU communications, the MUs can also communicate with each other, which is not envisioned in 5G mobile networks. Nevertheless, the cooperation capability between the APs and the Base Stations (BSs) can be drawn on to perform hybrid synchronization as done in 2 3, laying the ground for an accurate MU joint sync&loc. Moreover, in [ref]8 , the authors leverage Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) to obtain the estimation of clock and position parameters in ultra-dense networks. In particular, they assume accurate inter-AP synchronization and perform MU joint sync&loc in the presence of uncertainty about the time of arrival and AoA parameters. The level of uncertainty is then determined based on the derived Cramer-Rao bound. Another approach called Linearized BRF (L-BRF), which is based on linearizing the filter, has been employed in 4 5, albeit the perfect inter-AP synchronization assumption is lifted. Instead, the APs and their backhauling BSs are assumed to be synchronized using cooperative hybrid synchronization introduced in 2 3. While EKF and L-BRF can partially mitigate the destructive impact of nonlinearities in the measurements, they are likely to diverge if a reliable estimate of the initial state is not available 6. Another weakness of these filters is the underestimation of the covariance matrix. A promising approach, on the one hand, to avoid such shortcomings of EKF/L-BRF, and, on the other hand, to boost the accuracy of position estimation, is estimating the (prediction, measurement likelihood, and posterior) distributions by means of Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters introduced in 7. Specifically, in this approach, instead of approximating each distribution as a single Gaussian function, they are approximated with a sum weighted of Gaussian functions, or, alternatively, Gaussian mixtures 8. Nevertheless, the problem that immediately arises when using PGM filters is dimensionality, rendering the approach computationally expensive for multi-variable estimations. To overcome this drawback, we resort to a hybrid parametric and particle-based approach where we capitalize on the linear relations between the measurements and the clock parameters to reduce the dimensionality. In comparison to the standard PF, this approach features a strictly lower estimation variance as a result of Rao-Blackwell’s lemma discussed in 9, and leads to more accurate estimates given the same number of particles 8. Specifically, PGM’s performance stands out when the uncertainty increases. Even the PGM-based localization techniques can suffer from divergence under certain conditions, e.g., improper tuning of the filter’s hyper-parameters and faulty measurements, resulting mostly from Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) links 0.\nThe former must be addressed when designing the filter, while the latter can be dealt with using NLoS mitigation methods such as those proposed in 1 2 3. The technique in 1 relies on the multipath components of NLoS links to enhance the positioning accuracy. However, such a method functions well only in the presence of strong multipath components and prior statistics on NLoS-induced errors. The latter are also estimated and utilized along with trajectory tracking in 2 to perform indoor positioning. The authors in 3, however, take another approach and model the measurement noise by a two-mode mixture distribution and approximate the maximum likelihood estimator using expectation maximization. Such approaches add an extra computation overhead that may not be necessary in dense networks where the LoS probability is around 0.80.80.8 and increases with the AP density 4. Therefore, to mitigate the estimation inaccuracy stemming from the faulty measurements, we draw on NLoS identification techniques to identify the NLoS links and discard them. Such an approach boosts the accuracy and features less complexity compared to the methods proposed in 1 2 3. There is a wide spectrum of NLoS identification approaches adopted in the literature, e.g., hypothesis testing as in 5, the statistical approach taken in 6, and Machine Learning (ML)-based methods such as that of 7. However, recently ML algorithms, particularly DNN-based approaches such as AmpN 8, have drawn substantial attention in classification problems. In particular, DNNs exhibit a remarkable performance due to their ability, on one hand, in implementing almost any classifier function, and, on the other hand, in extracting task-related features from the input data 9 0. Other approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Bayesian sequential testing require human intervention that may be, given the limited intuition, flawed, and erroneous. Furthermore, DNN units are also expected to be part of the communication devices as they are the cornerstone of many solutions for different communication problems such as slice management and anomaly detection 1. Therefore, a DNN-based NLoS identifier appears to be a reasonable choice. The input to the DNN can be signals containing class-relevant features such as received signal strength or Channel Impulse Response (CIR). The CIR turns out to be more informative about the communication environment and link condition. Therefore, for the sake of prediction accuracy, we rely on AP-MU CIRs in this work. In addition to NLoS-identification, the CIR can also be fed into one of the state-of-the-art AoA estimation algorithms to obtain the signal’s direction of arrival. AoA estimation has been extensively investigated in the literature. Algorithms such as MUSIC 2, reduced-dimension MUSIC 3, and ESPRIT 4 can accurately estimate the AoA. A detailed comparison between them has been conducted in 5 concluding that the difference is negligible, albeit MUSIC slightly outperforms the others and, therefore, it is employed for the purpose of this work. In this paper, we propose a DNN-assisted PF-based (DePF) joint sync&loc algorithm that draws on the CIR to estimate the AoA and to determine the link condition, i.e., LoS or NLoS, thereby excluding the faulty measurements to enable a more precise parameter estimation. It then estimates the joint probability distribution of MU’s clock and position parameters using a PGM filter. The dimension of the PGM filter is then reduced by revealing and exploiting the existing linear sub-structures in the measurements, thereby tackling the dimensionality problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work employing a PGM filter in a hybrid particle-based and parametric manner to perform joint sync&loc. The contribution of this paper is summarized as follows: We present and discuss the principles of asymmetric time-stamp exchange and AoA estimation. The former assists in the estimation of the clock skew, offset, and the AP-MU distance, while the latter aids in the position estimation by providing the direction of an MU relative to the position of its serving APs. We develop a DNN for NLoS identification based on AP-MU CIRs. The outcome of such a DNN helps to identify erroneous measurements, i.e., time-stamps and AoAs, and discard them, thereby preventing large errors in the estimation. We propose a DNN-assisted particle filter-based joint sync&loc algorithm that estimates the clock parameters and the position of an MU in a hybrid parametric and particle-based manner. Such an approach not only boosts the estimation accuracy but also overcomes the dimensionality problem that arises in particle Gaussian mixture filters due to the high number of parameters. We analyze the performance of the proposed approach with the aid of detailed simulations in a challenging real-world scenario. In particular, the MUs’ movement profile comprises acceleration, deceleration, and constant speed. Furthermore, the APs are distributed to provide signal coverage for the MUs. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we introduce the system model and the preliminaries. Section III describes the details of the DePF algorithm for joint estimation of the clock and position parameters. Furthermore, the simulation results are presented and discussed in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes this work and points to future works.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: and MU localization are closely intertwined and need to be tackled jointly.
