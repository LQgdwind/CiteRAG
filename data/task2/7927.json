The combination of these strategies can be generalized in the form of 3D-parallelism [ref]28.\nFig. 1 shows the concept of 3D-parallelism. In this case, each training worker is a part of one MP, DP, and PP group, where the id (offset) of each NPU within its MP/DP/PP group is determined using the first/second/third digits of a 3-digit worker id. Therefore, the NPUs that have the same DP & PP digits are within the same MP group (e.g., 000, 100, 200, and 300). Similarly, we can obtain the workers within the same DP or PP group. The NPUs within the same DP group should communicate through the All-Reduce collective pattern during the back-propagation to sync their locally computed model gradients and update the model before starting the next training iteration .\nThe pattern changes to Reduce for weight streaming (Sec. III-A).\nFor the MP group case, NPUs need to communicate during forward-pass/back-propagation to synchronize on output-activations/input-gradients. The communication pattern, however, depends on the layer type and the way it is sharded. The usual observed patterns are: All-Reduce , All-to-All , Reduce-Scatter , and All-Gather . For the PP group, the NPUs need to transfer the output-activations/input-gradient during forward-pass/back-propagation on the borderline layers and pass the data to the NPU(s) hosting the next set of layers. Fig. 1 also shows the necessity to handle multiple collectives at the same time. For e.g., there are eight different DP groups, meaning that up to eight concurrent All-Reduces should be handled for the DP communications (similarly there are six/twelve concurrent communication operations for MP/PP communications). Moreover, the communication type and peer workers differ across MP, DP, and PP groups. Thus, it is crucial for the underlying network fabric to be flexible for concurrent and different collective patterns.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: There are multiple ways of distributing the distributed training tasks across multiple NPUs (a.k.a. the parallelization strategy): MP , DP , and PP [ref]16 [ref]27.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
