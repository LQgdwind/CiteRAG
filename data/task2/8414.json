      "content": "Paper Title: Unconditional proofs of quantumness between small-space machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe two basic computational models considered in this paper are probabilistic and quantum Turing machines. In both cases, the machine has a read/only input tape. For any input string w𝑤w, this tape will contain the string ⊳w⊲limit-fromcontains-as-subgroup𝑤subgroup-of\\rhd w\\lhd, where ⊳contains-as-subgroup\\rhd and ⊲subgroup-of\\lhd are special endmarker symbols. Details about the work tapes differ among models, as will be seen. A probabilistic Turing machine (𝑝𝑡𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑚\\mathit{ptm})222This definition has been obtained by restricting the transition probabilities of the model in  to computable numbers. is a 7/̄tuple (S,Σ,K,δ,s0,sacc,srej)𝑆Σ𝐾𝛿subscript𝑠0subscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rej\\left\\lparen S,\\Sigma,K,\\delta,s_{0},s_{\\mathrm{acc}},s_{\\mathrm{rej}}\\right\\rparen, where S𝑆S is the finite set of states, ΣΣ\\Sigma is the finite input alphabet, not containing ⊳contains-as-subgroup\\rhd and ⊲subgroup-of\\lhd, K𝐾K is the finite work alphabet, including the blank symbol   missing, δ:(S∖{sacc,srej})×(Σ∪{⊳,⊲})×K×S×K×{−1,0,1}×{−1,0,1}→𝒞 [ref]1:𝛿→𝑆subscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rejΣcontains-as-subgroupsubgroup-of𝐾𝑆𝐾101101subscript𝒞01\\delta:\\left\\lparen S\\setminus\\Set{s_{\\mathrm{acc}},s_{\\mathrm{rej}}}\\right\\rparen\\times\\left\\lparen\\Sigma\\cup\\Set{\\rhd,\\lhd}\\right\\rparen\\times K\\times S\\times K\\times\\Set{-1,0,1}\\times\\Set{-1,0,1}\\to\\mathcal{C}_{\\left[0,1\\right]}, such that, for each fixed s𝑠s, σ𝜎\\sigma, and κ𝜅\\kappa, ∑s′,κ′,di,dwδ​(s,σ,κ,s′,κ′,di,dw)=1subscriptsuperscript𝑠′superscript𝜅′subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑑𝑤𝛿𝑠𝜎𝜅superscript𝑠′superscript𝜅′subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑑𝑤1\\sum_{s^{\\prime},\\kappa^{\\prime},d_{i},d_{w}}\\delta(s,\\sigma,\\kappa,s^{\\prime},\\kappa^{\\prime},d_{i},d_{w})=1, is the transition function, s0∈Ssubscript𝑠0𝑆s_{0}\\in S is the start state, and sacc,srej∈Ssubscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rej𝑆s_{\\mathrm{acc}},s_{\\mathrm{rej}}\\in S, such that sacc≠srejsubscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rejs_{\\mathrm{acc}}\\neq s_{\\mathrm{rej}}, are the accept and reject states, respectively. A ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm} has a single read/write work tape, which is initially blank, with the work head positioned on the leftmost cell. The computation of a ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm} M𝑀M on input w∈Σ∗𝑤superscriptΣw\\in\\Sigma^{*} begins with the input head positioned on the first symbol of the string ⊳w⊲limit-fromcontains-as-subgroup𝑤subgroup-of\\rhd w\\lhd, and the machine in state s0subscript𝑠0s_{0}. In every computational step, if M𝑀M is in some state s∉{sacc,srej}𝑠subscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rejs\\notin\\Set{s_{\\mathrm{acc}},s_{\\mathrm{rej}}} with the input head scanning some symbol σ𝜎\\sigma at the i𝑖ith tape position and the work head scanning some symbol κ𝜅\\kappa at the j𝑗jth tape position, it switches to state s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime}, sets the scanned work symbol to κ′superscript𝜅′\\kappa^{\\prime}, and locates the input and work heads at the (i+di)𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖(i+d_{i})th and (j+dw)𝑗subscript𝑑𝑤(j+d_{w})th positions respectively with probability δ​(s,σ,κ,s′,κ′,di,dw)𝛿𝑠𝜎𝜅superscript𝑠′superscript𝜅′subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑑𝑤\\delta(s,\\sigma,\\kappa,s^{\\prime},\\kappa^{\\prime},d_{i},d_{w}).\nWe assume that δ𝛿\\delta is defined such that the input head never moves beyond the tape area delimited by the endmarkers. If M𝑀M is in state saccsubscript𝑠accs_{\\mathrm{acc}} (srejsubscript𝑠rejs_{\\mathrm{rej}}), it halts and accepts (rejects). A ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm} is said to run within space s​(n)𝑠𝑛s(n) if, on any input of length n𝑛n, at most s​(n)𝑠𝑛s(n) work tape cells are scanned throughout the computation. We are going to focus on machines that run within space bounds that are o​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑜𝑛\\mathit{o}\\left\\lparen\\log\\log n\\right\\rparen. A computation performed by a machine that runs within O​(1)𝑂1\\mathit{O}\\left\\lparen 1\\right\\rparen space can also be performed by a machine which does not use its work tape at all, and encodes all the workspace in its state set. The definition of this constant/space model, known as the two/way probabilistic finite automaton (2​p​f​a2𝑝𝑓𝑎\\mathit{2pfa}), is easily obtained from Definition 1 by removing the components related to the work tape. A two/way deterministic finite automaton (2​d​f​a2𝑑𝑓𝑎\\mathit{2dfa}) is simply a 2​p​f​a2pfa\\mathrm{2pfa} whose transition function is restricted to the range {0,1}01\\Set{0,1}. Our protocols in Sections 4 and 5 will make use of the well/known capability of 2​p​f​a2pfa\\mathrm{2pfa}’s to implement “alarm clocks” that can be set to any desired polynomial time bound. A detailed proof of the following fact can be found, for example, in [ref]13: For any pair of positive integers c,t>0𝑐𝑡0c,t>0 and desired “error” bound εpremature>0subscript𝜀premature0\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{premature}}>0, there exists a 2​p​f​a2pfa\\mathrm{2pfa} with expected runtime in O​(nt+1)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑡1\\mathit{O}\\left\\lparen n^{t+1}\\right\\rparen, such that the probability that this machine halts in fewer than c​nt𝑐superscript𝑛𝑡cn^{t} steps is εprematuresubscript𝜀premature\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{premature}}. For our quantum Turing machine (𝑞𝑡𝑚𝑞𝑡𝑚\\mathit{qtm}) model, we adopt the definition of Watrous .\nThis model is best visualized as a deterministic Turing machine (with a classical work tape) which has been augmented by adding a finite quantum register and a quantum work tape, each cell of which holds a qubit. The randomness in the behavior of a qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm} is a result of the operations performed on the quantum part of the machine at intermediate steps. A qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm} is said to run within space s​(n)𝑠𝑛s(n) if, on any input of length n𝑛n, at most s​(n)𝑠𝑛s(n) cells are scanned on both the classical and quantum work tapes during the computation. It turns out that all the qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm}’s that we need in our results in this paper are constant/space machines. As described above, machines obeying this restriction can be modeled in a simpler way by removing the work tapes from the definition. Doing this to the qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm}’s of  yields the well/studied quantum finite automaton model due to Ambainis and Watrous [ref]1, which we describe in detail below.333Remscrim  provides a detailed explanation of how quantum finite automata are generalized to qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm}’s with larger space bounds. The following definition, which can be viewed as a 2​d​f​a2dfa\\mathrm{2dfa} augmented with a quantum register of constant size, is somewhat more involved than Definition 1, because of the way it breaks down each computational step into two stages for evolving the quantum state and the remaining classical part of the machine separately: A two/way finite automaton with quantum and classical states (2​q​c​f​a2𝑞𝑐𝑓𝑎\\mathit{2qcfa}) is a 9/̄tuple (Q,S,Σ,δq,δc,q0,s0,sacc,srej)𝑄𝑆Σsubscript𝛿𝑞subscript𝛿𝑐subscript𝑞0subscript𝑠0subscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rej\\left\\lparen Q,S,\\Sigma,\\delta_{q},\\delta_{c},q_{0},s_{0},s_{\\mathrm{acc}},s_{\\mathrm{rej}}\\right\\rparen, where Q𝑄Q is the finite set of basis states of the quantum part of the machine, S𝑆S is the finite set of classical states, ΣΣ\\Sigma is the finite input alphabet, not containing ⊳contains-as-subgroup\\rhd and ⊲subgroup-of\\lhd, δqsubscript𝛿𝑞\\delta_{q} is the quantum transition function, which, for any s∈(S∖{sacc,srej})𝑠𝑆subscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rejs\\in(S\\setminus\\Set{s_{\\mathrm{acc}},s_{\\mathrm{rej}}}) and σ∈(Σ∪{⊳,⊲})𝜎Σcontains-as-subgroupsubgroup-of\\sigma\\in(\\Sigma\\cup\\Set{\\rhd,\\lhd}), maps the pair (s,σ)𝑠𝜎(s,\\sigma) to an action that will be performed on the quantum part of the machine, as will be described below, δcsubscript𝛿𝑐\\delta_{c} is the classical transition function, which determines the input head movement direction and resulting classical state associated with the current computational step, as will be described below, q0∈Qsubscript𝑞0𝑄q_{0}\\in Q is the initial quantum state, s0∈Ssubscript𝑠0𝑆s_{0}\\in S is the classical start state, and sacc,srej∈Ssubscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rej𝑆s_{\\mathrm{acc}},s_{\\mathrm{rej}}\\in S, such that sacc≠srejsubscript𝑠accsubscript𝑠rejs_{\\mathrm{acc}}\\neq s_{\\mathrm{rej}}, are the accept and reject states, respectively. Just like in the classical case, the input string to a 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa} is delimited by endmarkers (beyond which the machine does not attempt to move its head) on the read/only tape. At the start of the computation, the input head is located on the left endmarker, the state of the quantum register is described by the vector |q0⟩ketsubscript𝑞0\\ket{q_{0}}, and the classical state is s0subscript𝑠0s_{0}. Every computational step begins with the action δq​(s,σ)subscript𝛿𝑞𝑠𝜎\\delta_{q}(s,\\sigma) determined by the current classical state s𝑠s and the currently scanned tape symbol σ𝜎\\sigma being performed on the quantum register. Each such action is either a unitary transformation or a projective measurement of the quantum state, resulting in some outcome τ𝜏\\tau with an associated probability. The second and final stage of the computational step is a classical transition that determines the pair (s′,d)superscript𝑠′𝑑(s^{\\prime},d) of the resulting classical state and head movement direction of this step: If δq​(s,σ)subscript𝛿𝑞𝑠𝜎\\delta_{q}(s,\\sigma) was a unitary transformation, this pair is simply δc​(s,σ)subscript𝛿𝑐𝑠𝜎\\delta_{c}(s,\\sigma), depending again only on s𝑠s and σ𝜎\\sigma. If, on the other hand, δq​(s,σ)subscript𝛿𝑞𝑠𝜎\\delta_{q}(s,\\sigma) was a measurement with outcome τ𝜏\\tau, the pair (s′,d)superscript𝑠′𝑑(s^{\\prime},d) is δc​(s,σ,τ)subscript𝛿𝑐𝑠𝜎𝜏\\delta_{c}(s,\\sigma,\\tau), which also depends on that outcome. Computation halts with acceptance (rejection) when the 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa} reaches the classical state saccsubscript𝑠accs_{\\mathrm{acc}} (srejsubscript𝑠rejs_{\\mathrm{rej}}). Since we want our classical and quantum machine models to be “comparable” in all respects except the fact that one is classical and the other is quantum, we restrict all entries of all unitary matrices describing the transitions of 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa}’s to be complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts are computable.444The unrealistic case where uncomputable numbers are allowed in the descriptions of these machines has been studied in  . Remscrim 0 has investigated the effects of imposing more restrictions on the set of allowed matrix entries. Let 𝙰,𝙱⊆Σ∗𝙰𝙱superscriptΣ\\mathtt{A},\\mathtt{B}\\subseteq\\Sigma^{*} with 𝙰∩𝙱=∅𝙰𝙱\\mathtt{A}\\cap\\mathtt{B}=\\emptyset. We say that a (classical or quantum) machine M𝑀M separates 𝙰𝙰\\mathtt{A} and 𝙱𝙱\\mathtt{B} (with error bound ε𝜀\\varepsilon) if there exists a number ε<12𝜀12\\varepsilon<\\frac{1}{2} such that for all w∈𝙰𝑤𝙰w\\in\\mathtt{A}, M𝑀M accepts input w𝑤w with probability at least 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon, and for all w∈𝙱𝑤𝙱w\\in\\mathtt{B}, M𝑀M rejects input w𝑤w with probability at least 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon. Equivalently, one says that M𝑀M solves the promise problem (𝙰,𝙱)𝙰𝙱(\\mathtt{A},\\mathtt{B}). We say that M𝑀M recognizes 𝙰𝙰\\mathtt{A} if M𝑀M separates 𝙰𝙰\\mathtt{A} and the complement of 𝙰𝙰\\mathtt{A}. For any given 2​p​f​a2pfa\\mathrm{2pfa} MCsuperscript𝑀𝐶M^{C} recognizing some language 𝙻𝙻\\mathtt{L}, it is trivial to construct a 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa} that recognizes 𝙻𝙻\\mathtt{L} by mimicking MCsuperscript𝑀𝐶M^{C} step by step. 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa}’s are, in fact, strictly more powerful computational machines than 2​p​f​a2pfa\\mathrm{2pfa}’s. We review the relevant facts below. Although some nonregular languages like 𝙴𝚀𝚊𝚋={an​bn|n≥0}subscript𝙴𝚀𝚊𝚋superscript𝑎𝑛superscript𝑏𝑛𝑛0\\mathtt{EQ_{ab}}{}=\\Set{a^{n}b^{n}}{n\\geq 0} are known  to have exponential/time 2​p​f​a2pfa\\mathrm{2pfa}’s that recognize them,\nno o​(log⁡log⁡n)𝑜𝑛\\mathit{o}\\left\\lparen\\log\\log n\\right\\rparen/space ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm} can recognize a nonregular language in polynomial expected time, as proven by Dwork and Stockmeyer . On the other hand, Ambainis and Watrous [ref]1 describe a polynomial/time 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa} that recognizes 𝙴𝚀𝚊𝚋subscript𝙴𝚀𝚊𝚋\\mathtt{EQ_{ab}}{}. Naturally, polynomial/time 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa}’s also exist for infinitely many other languages whose recognition is reducible to determining whether two different symbols appear equally many times\nin the input string, e.g., 𝙴𝚀={w|w∈{a,b}∗​ and ​w​ contains equally many a’s and b’s}𝙴𝚀𝑤𝑤superscript𝑎𝑏 and 𝑤 contains equally many a’s and b’s\\mathtt{EQ}=\\Set{w}{w\\in\\Set{a,b}^{*}\\text{ and }w\\text{ contains equally many $a$'s and $b$'s}}  and studied in . More recently, Remscrim 0 has shown that any language corresponding to the word problem of a finitely generated virtually abelian group can be recognized in cubic time by some bounded/error 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa}. 𝙴𝚀𝙴𝚀\\mathtt{EQ}{} is one of the “simplest” members of this set of languages, whose more “complicated” members have alphabets of the form {a1,b1,a2,b2,…,ak,bk}subscript𝑎1subscript𝑏1subscript𝑎2subscript𝑏2…subscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝑏𝑘\\Set{a_{1},b_{1},a_{2},b_{2},\\dotsc,a_{k},b_{k}} and require the strings to contain equal numbers of aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i}’s and bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i}’s for every i𝑖i.\nLet 𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖲𝖯∗​(t​(n),s​(n))subscript𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖲𝖯𝑡𝑛𝑠𝑛\\mathsf{\\mathsf{BQTISP_{*}}(\\scalebox{1.0}{$t(n),s(n)$})} denote the class of languages recognizable by qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm}’s that run in at most t​(n)𝑡𝑛t(n) expected time and within at\nmost s​(n)𝑠𝑛s(n) space on all inputs of length at most n𝑛n, so that such a qtmqtm\\mathrm{qtm} recognizing the corresponding language exists for any desired positive error bound. All languages mentioned in this paragraph are known to be in 𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖲𝖯∗​(nk,c)subscript𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖲𝖯superscript𝑛𝑘𝑐\\mathsf{\\mathsf{BQTISP_{*}}(\\scalebox{1.0}{$n^{k},c$})} for some constants k𝑘k and c𝑐c depending on the specific language. In their seminal paper, Ambainis and Watrous [ref]1 also gave an exponential/time 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa} algorithm for 𝙿𝙰𝙻𝙿𝙰𝙻\\mathtt{PAL}, the language of palindromes on a binary alphabet. This provided another early example of quantum superiority over classical machines, since it is known   that no sublogarithmic/space ptmptm\\mathrm{ptm} can recognize 𝙿𝙰𝙻𝙿𝙰𝙻\\mathtt{PAL}{} in any amount of time. A rational 1​p​f​a1𝑝𝑓𝑎\\mathit{1pfa} 7 is a 2​p​f​a2pfa\\mathrm{2pfa} whose transition function is restricted to contain only rational numbers in its range, and not to assign positive probabilities to transitions that do not move the head to the right.\nA language 𝙻𝙻\\mathtt{L} is said to belong to the class 𝖲ℚ=subscriptsuperscript𝖲ℚ\\mathsf{S}^{=}_{\\mathbb{Q}} 7 \nif there exists a rational 1​p​f​a1pfa\\mathrm{1pfa} that\naccepts all and only the members of 𝙻𝙻\\mathtt{L} with probability 1212\\frac{1}{2}. 𝖲ℚ≠subscriptsuperscript𝖲ℚ\\mathsf{S}^{\\neq}_{\\mathbb{Q}} is the class of languages whose complements are in 𝖲ℚ=subscriptsuperscript𝖲ℚ\\mathsf{S}^{=}_{\\mathbb{Q}}. Using a technique developed in , Yakaryılmaz and Say have proven  that all languages in 𝖲ℚ=∪𝖲ℚ≠subscriptsuperscript𝖲ℚsubscriptsuperscript𝖲ℚ\\mathsf{S}^{=}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\cup\\mathsf{S}^{\\neq}_{\\mathbb{Q}} can be recognized by 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa}’s . Combining this result with Remscrim’s work on word problems 0, Table 1 lists some other interesting languages known to have 2​q​c​f​a2qcfa\\mathrm{2qcfa}’s that recognize them in 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{\\mathit{O}\\left\\lparen n\\right\\rparen} expected time for inputs of length n𝑛n.555wRsuperscript𝑤𝑅w^{R} denotes the reverse of string w𝑤w.
