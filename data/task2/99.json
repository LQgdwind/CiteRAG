      "content": "Paper Title: Work-efficient Batch-incremental Minimum Spanning Trees with Applications to the Sliding Window Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph is a\nclassic and fundamental problem that has been studied for nearly a century,\ngoing back to early algorithms of Borůvka , and\nJarník  (later rediscovered by Prim\n and Dijkstra ), and later, the\nperhaps more well-known algorithm of Kruskal . The MST\nproblem is, given a connected weighted undirected graph, to find a set of edges\nof minimum total weight that connect every vertex in the graph. More generally,\nthe minimum spanning forest (MSF) problem is to compute an MST for every connected\ncomponent of the graph. The dynamic MSF problem is to do so while responding\nto edges being inserted into and deleted from the graph . The incremental\nMSF problem is a special case of the dynamic problem in which edges are only inserted. While most\ndynamic data structures handle only a single update at a time, there has also\nbeen work on batch-dynamic data structures, which process a batch of\nupdates in each round. Typically it is assumed that the size of a batch can\nvary from round to round. Batch-dynamic data structures have two potential\nadvantages—they can allow for more parallelism, and they can in some\nsituations perform less work than processing updates one at a time. There has been significant interest in parallelizing incremental and dynamic MSF. Some of this work studies how to implement single updates in parallel          , and some studies batch updates      .\nThe most recent and best result  requires O​(n​lg⁡n)𝑂𝑛lg𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}\\lg n) work per update on n𝑛n vertices, and only allows single edge updates. All previous results that support batches of edge updates in polylogarithmic time require Ω​(n​min⁡(ℓ,n))Ω𝑛ℓ𝑛\\Omega(n\\min(\\ell,n)) work, where ℓℓ\\ell is the size of the batch. This is very far from the work performed by the best sequential data structures, which is O​(lg⁡n)𝑂lg𝑛O(\\lg n) worst-case time for incremental edge insertions  , and O​(lg4⁡nlg⁡lg⁡n)𝑂superscriptlg4𝑛lglg𝑛O(\\frac{\\lg^{4}n}{\\lg\\lg n}) amortized expected time for fully dynamic edge insertions and deletions . In this paper, we start by presenting a parallel data structure for the batch-incremental MSF problem. It is the first such data structure that achieves polylogarithmic work per edge insertion. The data structure is work efficient with respect to the fastest sequential single-update data structure, and even more efficient for large batch sizes, achieving optimal linear expected work [ref]37 when inserting all edges as a batch. The size of a batch can vary from round to round. Our main contribution is summarized by the following theorem: There exists a data structure that maintains the MSF of a weighted undirected graph that can insert a batch of ℓℓ\\ell edges into a graph\nwith n𝑛n vertices in O​(ℓ​lg⁡(1+nℓ))𝑂ℓlg1𝑛ℓO\\left(\\ell\\lg\\left(1+\\frac{n}{\\ell}\\right)\\right) work in expectation and O​(lg2⁡(n))𝑂superscriptlg2𝑛O(\\lg^{2}(n)) span w.h.p.111We say that g​(n)∈O​(f​(n))𝑔𝑛𝑂𝑓𝑛g(n)\\in O(f(n)) with high probability (w.h.p.)\nif g​(n)∈O​(k​f​(n))𝑔𝑛𝑂𝑘𝑓𝑛g(n)\\in O(kf(n)) with probability at least 1−O​(1/nk)1𝑂1superscript𝑛𝑘1-O(1/n^{k}) for all k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0 in the arbitrary-CRCW PRAM. We then use our batch-incremental MSF data structure to develop various data\nstructures for graph problems in a batch variant of the sliding window model. In\nthe sliding-window model , one keeps a fixed-sized window with\nupdates adding new updates to the new side of the window and dropping them from\nthe old side. For incremental updates, each insertion on the new side of the\nwindow does a deletion of the oldest element on the old side. In general, this\ncan be more difficult than pure incremental algorithms, but not as difficult as\nsupporting arbitrary deletion in fully dynamic algorithms. This setup has become\npopular in modeling an infinite steam of data when there is only bounded memory,\nand a desire to “forget” old updates in favor of newer ones. There have been\nmany dozens, perhaps hundreds, of papers using the model in general. Crouch et.\nal.  have derived several algorithms for graph problems\nin this model. The goal for graph algorithms is typically to use only\nO~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\tilde{O}(n) memory. Here we extend the model to allow for rounds of batch updates on the new side of the window, and batch removals from the old side. Specifically, for graph algorithms we consider batch edge insertions on the new side and batch edge deletions on the far side. Our results allow for arbitrary interleavings of batch insertions or deletions, and each of arbitrary size. Matching up equal sized inserts and deletes, of course, gives a fixed sized window, but we do not require this. Based on our batch-incremental MSF data structure, we are able to efficiently solve a variety of problems in the batch sliding-window model, including connectivity, k𝑘k-certificate, bipartiteness, (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-MSF, and cycle-freeness. This uses an approach similar to the one of Crouch et. al. , which is based on sequential incremental MSF. However, beyond using the batch-incremental MSF data structures, we have to augment their data structures in several ways. For example, since their focus was on memory and not on time, they did not did not discuss efficient implementations of many of their structures. Since we are interested in parallelism, time is important in our results. Our results are summarized by the following theorem: There exist data structures for the batch sliding-window model (batch edge\ninsertions on the new side and deletions on the old size) for the problems of\nmaintaining connectivity, k𝑘k-certificate, bipartiteness, (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-MSF, cycle-freeness, and ε𝜀\\varepsilon-sparsifiers, that all require\nO~​(n)~𝑂𝑛\\tilde{O}(n) memory, support batch updates of size ℓℓ\\ell in\nO~​(ℓ)~𝑂ℓ\\tilde{O}(\\ell) work and polylogarithmic span, and queries (except for\nsparsifiers) in polylogarithmic work, where n𝑛n denotes the number of\nvertices. Finally, we note that we can also apply these techniques to the incremental setting, and, using existing\nresults on incremental graph connectivity , obtain fast algorithms there as well.\nTable 1 gives more specifics on the individual results and compares them to the\nexisting bounds for parallel dynamic graphs in the incremental and fully dynamic settings.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: The data structure is work efficient with respect to the fastest sequential single-update data structure, and even more efficient for large batch sizes, achieving optimal linear expected work [ref]37 when inserting all edges as a batch.
