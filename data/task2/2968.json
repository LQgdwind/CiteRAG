      "content": "Paper Title: Policy Optimization for Constrained MDPs with Provable Fast Global Convergence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolicy gradient (PG) methods and their variants play an important role in reinforcement learning (RL). The gradient-based methods are attractive due to their flexibility in being applicable to any differentiable policy parameterization and generality for extensions to function approximation of policies . Standard PG methods have been applied to Markov decision processes (MDPs), which focus on optimizing a single objective without any explicit constraint on the policies. However, in many real-world applications, stringent safety constraints are imposed on control policies 3  . For example, a mobile wireless application may desire to maximize throughput, with a constraint on power consumption. The model of a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) [ref]4, where the goal is to optimize an objective while satisfying safety constraints, is a standard approach for modeling the necessary safety criteria of a control problem through constraints on safety costs. Recently, many algorithms using PG and natural policy gradient (NPG)  methods have been developed for solving CMDPs. Lagrangian-based methods  6   optimize CMDP as a saddle-point problem via primal-dual approach, while constrained policy optimization methods  1 calculate new dual variables from scratch at each update to maintain constraints during the learning process. Although these algorithms provide a way to iteratively optimize the learned policy, they can only guarantee local convergence, with no guarantees on the convergence rate to a globally optimal solution. Motivated by recent works  2 that prove global convergence of PG algorithms for MDPs, Ding et al. 2 developed an NPG-based primal-dual method with the softmax policy parameterization, which provides an ùí™‚Äã(1/T)ùí™1ùëá\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T}) global convergence rate for both the optimality gap and the constraint violation, where TùëáT is the total number of iterations that the algorithm executes. Similarly, Xu et al. 9 showed how to attain the global optimal with the same order convergence rate via NPG-based primal methods. However, it is known that the NPG-based methods for unconstrained MDPs enjoy ùí™‚Äã(1/T)ùí™1ùëá\\mathcal{O}(1/T) convergence rate  and exp‚Å°(‚àíT)ùëá\\exp(-T) convergence rate with certain regularizations 0 5. This motivates the following important theoretical question: Can we design a policy gradient-based algorithm for CMDPs that can provably achieve a global convergence rate faster than ùí™‚Äã(1/T)ùí™1ùëá\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})?\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: control policies 3  .
