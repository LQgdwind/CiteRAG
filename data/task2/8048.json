To be able to control the difference between the log-ratios inductively, a certain telescoping procedure is crucial for us.\nFix two distinct colors ℓ1,ℓ2∈[q]subscriptℓ1subscriptℓ2delimited-[]𝑞\\ell_{1},\\ell_{2}\\in[q].\nChoose an ordering of the neighborhood N​(v)𝑁𝑣N(v) of v𝑣v, v1,…,vdsubscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑑v_{1},\\ldots,v_{d}.\nLet G^isubscript^𝐺𝑖\\hat{G}_{i} be the partially q𝑞q-colored graph obtained from G−v𝐺𝑣G-v by adding a leaf to each vertex vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} with j≠i𝑗𝑖j\\neq i such that for j<i𝑗𝑖j<i that leaf is colored with color ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} and for j>i𝑗𝑖j>i it is colored with color ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}; the leaf connected to visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} is free and is denoted by v^isubscript^𝑣𝑖\\hat{v}_{i}.\nAssume that ZG^i,v^iℓ​(w~)≠0superscriptsubscript𝑍subscript^𝐺𝑖subscript^𝑣𝑖ℓ~𝑤0Z_{\\hat{G}_{i},\\hat{v}_{i}}^{\\ell}(\\tilde{w})\\neq 0 for all ℓ∈[q]ℓdelimited-[]𝑞\\ell\\in[q] and i=1,…,d𝑖1…𝑑i=1,\\ldots,d.\nThen by standard properties of the logarithm, See Figure 1 for a proof by pictures of this identity. [width=0.85]tikz Let us denote by Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i} the partially q𝑞q-colored graph obtained from G^isubscript^𝐺𝑖\\hat{G}_{i} by removing the vertex v^isubscript^𝑣𝑖\\hat{v}_{i}.\nWe will say that the graphs Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i} are obtained from G𝐺G via the telescoping procedure with respect to the colors ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} and the ordering of N​(v)𝑁𝑣N(v). See Figure 2 for an illustration of this. For concreteness we will continue the discussion for the case ℓ1=1subscriptℓ11\\ell_{1}=1 and ℓ2=qsubscriptℓ2𝑞\\ell_{2}=q.\nWe can by symmetry of course always relabel the colors so that this is without loss of generality.

We will formally verify this in Section 4. Bounding Fw,𝐜i​(𝐑i​(w))−Fw,𝐜i​(𝐑i​(w~))subscript𝐹𝑤superscript𝐜𝑖superscript𝐑𝑖𝑤subscript𝐹𝑤superscript𝐜𝑖superscript𝐑𝑖~𝑤F_{w,{\\bf c}^{i}}({\\bf R}^{i}(w))-F_{w,{\\bf c}^{i}}({\\bf R}^{i}(\\tilde{w})) is much more work and to do so we will use the gradient of Fw,𝐜isubscript𝐹𝑤superscript𝐜𝑖F_{w,{\\bf c}^{i}}.\nWe have where ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⋅⋅\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle denotes the standard inner product on ℂq−1.superscriptℂ𝑞1\\mathbb{C}^{q-1}. This motivates us to investigate the gradient of Fw,𝐜subscript𝐹𝑤𝐜F_{w,{\\bf c}}.\nFor this purpose let us define for a partially q𝑞q-colored graph H𝐻H with a free vertex v𝑣v and a color ℓ∈[q]ℓdelimited-[]𝑞\\ell\\in[q] the partially q𝑞q-colored graph H+ℓsuperscript𝐻ℓH^{+\\ell} by attaching a pinned leaf of color ℓℓ\\ell to v𝑣v.\nFor w∈ 𝑤01w\\in  the vector PH,v​(w)subscriptP𝐻𝑣𝑤\\textbf{P}_{H,v}(w) in ℝq−1superscriptℝ𝑞1\\mathbb{R}^{q-1} is defined by The next lemma tells us that the gradient of Fw,𝐜H,vsubscript𝐹𝑤subscript𝐜𝐻𝑣F_{w,{\\bf c}_{H,v}} evaluated at a real log-ratio vector is exactly the vector 𝐏H,v​(w)subscript𝐏𝐻𝑣𝑤{\\bf P}_{H,v}(w). Let w∈ 𝑤01w\\in .\nLet (H,v)∈𝒢Δ,q∙𝐻𝑣superscriptsubscript𝒢Δ𝑞∙(H,v)\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\Delta,q}^{\\bullet} and let 𝐜=𝐜H,v𝐜subscript𝐜𝐻𝑣{\\bf c}={\\bf c}_{H,v} be the vector of blocked colors at v𝑣v.\nLet 𝐑∈ℝq−1𝐑superscriptℝ𝑞1{\\bf R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{q-1} be the vector defined by Rj=RH¯,v;j,q​(w)subscript𝑅𝑗subscript𝑅¯𝐻𝑣𝑗𝑞𝑤R_{j}=R_{\\overline{H},v;j,q}(w).\nThen Writing P=P𝐜​(w,𝐱)𝑃subscript𝑃𝐜𝑤𝐱P=P_{\\bf c}(w,{\\bf x}) and Q=Q𝐜​(w,𝐱)𝑄subscript𝑄𝐜𝑤𝐱Q=Q_{\\bf c}(w,{\\bf x}), we have Fw,𝐜​(𝐱)=log⁡(PQ)subscript𝐹𝑤𝐜𝐱𝑃𝑄F_{w,\\bf c}({\\bf x})=\\log\\left(\\frac{P}{Q}\\right) and therefore by standard rules of partial derivatives, Noting that wcj​eRj=ZH,vj​(w)ZH,vq​(w)superscript𝑤subscript𝑐𝑗superscript𝑒subscript𝑅𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑍𝐻𝑣𝑗𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑍𝐻𝑣𝑞𝑤w^{c_{j}}e^{R_{j}}=\\tfrac{Z_{H,v}^{j}(w)}{Z_{H,v}^{q}(w)} and hence and similarly, we see that i.e. ∇Fw,𝐜​(𝐑)=𝐏H,v​(w)∇subscript𝐹𝑤𝐜𝐑subscript𝐏𝐻𝑣𝑤\\nabla F_{w,{\\bf c}}({\\bf R})={\\bf P}_{H,v}(w), as desired.\n∎ To use (9), we actually need to understand the gradient of Fw,𝐜subscript𝐹𝑤𝐜F_{w,{\\bf c}} evaluated at the vector t​RG¯i,vi;j,q​(w~)+(1−t)​RG¯i,vi;j,q​(w~)𝑡subscript𝑅subscript¯𝐺𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖𝑗𝑞~𝑤1𝑡subscript𝑅subscript¯𝐺𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖𝑗𝑞~𝑤tR_{\\overline{G}_{i},v_{i};j,q}(\\tilde{w})\\allowbreak+(1-t)R_{\\overline{G}_{i},v_{i};j,q}(\\tilde{w}) for some small perturbation w~~𝑤\\tilde{w} of w𝑤w.\nHowever, it is not difficult to see that for w~~𝑤\\tilde{w} small enough and q>Δ+1𝑞Δ1q>\\Delta+1, this gradient can be made arbitrarily close to 𝐏Gi,vi​(w)subscript𝐏subscript𝐺𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖𝑤{\\bf P}_{{G}_{i},v_{i}}(w) independent of the graph.\nWe verify this formally in Section 4. So to bound (9), the essential ingredient is to bound the absolute value of the inner product of the vector 𝐏Gi,vi​(w)subscript𝐏subscript𝐺𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖𝑤{\\bf P}_{{G}_{i},v_{i}}(w) with the vector 𝐑G¯i,vi;j,q​(w)−𝐑G¯i,vi;j,q​(w~)subscript𝐑subscript¯𝐺𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖𝑗𝑞𝑤subscript𝐑subscript¯𝐺𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖𝑗𝑞~𝑤{\\bf R}_{\\overline{G}_{i},v_{i};j,q}(w)-{\\bf R}_{\\overline{G}_{i},v_{i};j,q}(\\tilde{w}) for each i=1,…,d𝑖1…𝑑i=1,\\ldots,d.\nThis motivates us to develop bounds on the marginal probability of the root vertex, which we will do in Section 3 and Section 6. With the bounds from Section 3 and Section 4 we give a proof of Theorem 1 for η=0𝜂0\\eta=0 in Section 5.\nWe do this for two reasons.\nFirst of all, it makes it easier to see the structure of the technically more involved proof for the proof when η>0𝜂0\\eta>0, and secondly, it gives an alternative and arguably more transparent proof of the result of Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava [ref]27.\nThe ingredients that we use are pretty much the same as in [ref]27; the main difference is that we do not bound the real part and imaginary part of the log-ratio difference separately as is done in [ref]27, but our novel contribution is to make use of the symmetry between the colors to bound the absolute value of the inner product of the vector 𝐏G,v​(w)subscript𝐏𝐺𝑣𝑤{\\bf P}_{G,v}(w) with the vector 𝐑i​(w)−𝐑i​(w~)superscript𝐑𝑖𝑤superscript𝐑𝑖~𝑤{\\bf R}^{i}(w)-{\\bf R}^{i}(\\tilde{w}) in terms of a marginal probability of the root vertex times the maximum of over all j=1,…,q𝑗1…𝑞j=1,\\ldots,q (see Lemma 5), which in our proof we show is bounded by ε2subscript𝜀2\\varepsilon_{2}, by induction.\nSince for q≥2​Δ𝑞2Δq\\geq 2\\Delta this marginal probability is easily seen to be bounded by 1/Δ1Δ1/\\Delta (see Lemma 2 below), this allows to conclude that |RG,v;1,q​(w)−RG,v;1,q​(w~)|subscript𝑅𝐺𝑣1𝑞𝑤subscript𝑅𝐺𝑣1𝑞~𝑤|R_{G,v;1,q}(w)-R_{G,v;1,q}(\\tilde{w})| is again bounded by ε2subscript𝜀2\\varepsilon_{2}. See Section 5 for the details. In Section 7 we finally give a proof of Theorem 2 for η>0𝜂0\\eta>0.\nHere we build on the approach for η=0𝜂0\\eta=0 and carefully make use of the structure of the local neighborhood of the vertex v𝑣v to show that either both terms in (11) are actually smaller than ε2subscript𝜀2\\varepsilon_{2} or that we can use sharper bounds on the marginal probability obtained in Section 6 that are valid in a more restricted setting. In an appendix, we collect an alternative proof of a proposition found in Section 4 that is more hands on, but has the advantage that it gives concrete dependencies on how small ε1subscript𝜀1\\varepsilon_{1} should be in terms of ΔΔ\\Delta.\nWe conclude with some questions and remarks in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: applied to log-ratios of partially q𝑞q-colored graphs obtained from G𝐺G with fewer free vertices.\nWe will next describe some of the technical ingredients that were also used in some form in  [ref]27 and the main new ideas of our proof, after which we will give an overview of the remainder of the paper.
