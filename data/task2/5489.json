      "content": "Paper Title: Geometry-Complete Diffusion for 3D Molecule Generation and Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative modeling has recently been experiencing a renaissance in modeling efforts driven largely by denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). At a high level, DDPMs are trained by learning how to denoise a noisy version of an input example. For example, in the context of computer vision, Gaussian noise may be successively added to an input image with the goals of a DDPM in mind. We would then desire for a generative model of images to learn how to successfully distinguish between the original input image’s feature signal and the noise signal added to the image thereafter. If a model can achieve such outcomes, we can use the model to generate novel images by first sampling multivariate Gaussian noise and then iteratively removing, from the current state of the image, the noise predicted by our model. This classic formulation of DDPMs has achieved significant results in the space of image generation [ref]1, audio synthesis , and even meta-learning by learning how to conditionally generate neural network checkpoints [ref]3. Furthermore, such an approach to generative modeling has expanded its reach to encompass scientific disciplines such as computational biology [ref]4 , computational chemistry , and computational physics . Concurrently, the field of geometric deep learning (GDL)  has seen a sizeable increase in research interest lately, driven largely by theoretical advances within the discipline  as well as by novel applications of such methodology . Notably, such applications even include what is considered by many researchers to be a solution to the problem of predicting 3D protein structures from their corresponding amino acid sequences . Such an outcome arose, in part, from recent advances in sequence-based language modeling efforts   as well as from innovations in equivariant neural network modeling . However, it is currently unclear how the expressiveness of geometric neural networks impacts the ability of generative methods that incorporate them to faithfully model a geometric data distribution. In addition, it is currently unknown whether diffusion models for 3D molecules can be repurposed for important, real-world tasks without retraining or fine-tuning and whether geometric diffusion models are better equipped for such tasks. Toward this end, in this work, we provide the following findings. Neural networks that perform message-passing with geometric and geometry-complete quantities enable diffusion generative models of 3D molecules to generate stable and realistic large molecules, whereas non-geometric message-passing networks fail to do so. Physical inductive biases such as invariant graph attention and molecular chirality both play important roles in enabling diffusion models to generate valid and realistic 3D molecules. Our newly-proposed Geometry-Complete Diffusion Model (GCDM), which is the first diffusion model to incorporate the above insights and achieve the correct type of equivariance for 3D molecules (i.e., SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE(3)} equivariance), establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for conditional and unconditional 3D molecule generation on the QM9 dataset as well as for unconditional molecule generation on the GEOM-Drugs dataset of large 3D molecules, and achieves competitive results for protein pocket-conditioned 3D molecule generation. As a first-of-its-kind result, we further demonstrate that geometric diffusion models such as GCDM can effectively perform 3D molecule optimization for specific molecular properties without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning and can do so better than non-geometric diffusion models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: then iteratively removing, from the current state of the image, the noise predicted by our model.
