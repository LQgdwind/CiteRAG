      "content": "Paper Title: A Study on Training and Developing Large Language Models for Behavior Tree Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA foundation model is a model that is trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) and can be adapted (e.g., fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks [ref]39. These models are based on deep neural networks and self-supervised learning, both of which have existed for decades. However, the recent scale and scope of foundation models have pushed the boundaries of what is possible. Foundation models are typically huge, with billions or even trillions of parameters, which allows them to learn complex language patterns and perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for smaller models. In recent years, several foundation LLMs have been proposed by different organizations, each with its own characteristics. We briefly summarize and introduce three representative foundation LLMs: GPT-series, LLaMA-series, and GLM-series. GPT-Series: \nThe GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series of LLMs developed by OpenAI111https://openai.com/ has undergone significant development over the years. The family of GPT-series models is briefly shown in Figure 2. The first two initial models are GPT-1  and GPT-2 , which can be considered as the foundation for more powerful models subsequently, such as GPT-3 [ref]42 and GPT-4 [ref]29. GPT-1 was introduced in June 2018 and developed based on a generative, decoder-only Transformer architecture with 117 million parameters. It adopts a hybrid approach of unsupervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. GPT-1  set up the core architecture for the GPT-series models and established the underlying principle of modeling natural language text, i.e., predicting the next word. GPT-2 was introduced in February 2019 and increased the parameter scale to 1.5B, trained with a large webpage dataset. As claimed in the paper of GPT-2 , it seeks to perform tasks via unsupervised language modeling, without explicit fine-tuning using labeled data. Based on GPT-2, GPT-3 [ref]42 released in 2020 demonstrated a significant capacity leap by scaling the generative pre-training architecture to an even larger size of 175B parameters. GPT-3 can be viewed as a remarkable landmark in the journey from PLMs to LLMs. It empirically proved that scaling the neural networks to a significant size can lead to a huge increase in model capacity. The conversation model ChatGPT222https://openai.com/chatgpt was released by OpenAI in November 2022, based on the GPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). ChatGPT exhibits superior capacities in communicating with humans, possessing a vast store of knowledge, skill at reasoning on mathematical problems, accurately tracing the context in multi-turn dialogues, and aligning well with human values for safe use. GPT-4 [ref]29, released in March 2023, extends the text input to multimodal signals with more parameters. Overall, GPT-4 has stronger capacities in solving complex tasks than all former GPT-series models, showing a large performance improvement on many evaluation tasks. LLaMA-Series: LLaMA (LLM Meta AI)  is a family of LLMs released by Meta AI starting in February 2023. LLaMA foundational models are trained on a dataset with 1.4 trillion tokens, drawn from publicly available data sources. Four model sizes were trained: 7, 13, 33, and 65 billion parameters. LLaMA uses the transformer architecture with minor architectural differences. Compared to GPT-3, LLaMA uses the SwiGLU  activation function instead of ReLU, rotary positional embeddings  instead of absolute positional embedding, and root-mean-squared layer-normalization instead of standard layer-normalization. LLaMA 2  is trained on a dataset with 2 trillion tokens and increases the context length from 2K tokens to 4K tokens. Three model sizes, 7, 13, and 70 billion parameters, are released. LLaMA 2-Chat is additionally fine-tuned on 27,540 prompt-response pairs created for this project, which performs better than larger but lower-quality third-party datasets. For AI alignment, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is used with a combination of 1,418,091 Meta examples and seven smaller datasets. GLM-Series: GLM (General Language Model)  is pretrained with an autoregressive blank-filling objective. It randomly blanks out continuous spans of tokens from the input text, following the idea of auto-encoding, and is trained to sequentially reconstruct the spans, following the idea of autoregressive pertaining. ChatGLM-6B is a conversational language model that supports bilingual question-answering in Chinese and English. ChatGLM-6B adopts the same model architecture as GLM-130B. As of July 2022, GLM-130B  has only been trained on 400 billion tokens with a 1:1 ratio of Chinese to English. In contrast, ChatGLM-6B utilizes a larger training dataset with up to 1 trillion tokens, consisting solely of Chinese and English text in a 1:1 ratio. These foundation models exhibit strong capacities in the area of natural language after being trained on large unlabeled corpus datasets.\nHowever, the BT generation tasks are more complex compared to text generation.\nAs foundation LLMs, certain basic abilities are needed for BT generation tasks.\nWe categorize the basic abilities of foundation LLMs for BT generation into four principal domains: natural language-related abilities, reasoning-related abilities, tool-related abilities, and code-related abilities, as shown in Table 1.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: A foundation model is a model that is trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) and can be adapted (e.g., fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks [ref]39.
