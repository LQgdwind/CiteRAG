      "content": "Paper Title: Duality-Induced Regularizer for Semantic Matching Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graphs store human knowledge in a structured way, with nodes being entities and edges being relations. In the past few years, knowledge graphs have made great achievements in many areas, such as natural language processing , question answering [ref]2, recommendation systems [ref]3, and computer vision . Some popular knowledge graphs, such as Freebase , Wikidata , and Yago3 , consists of triples (subject, predicate, object). However, in many scenarios, triples cannot well represent knowledge as knowledge may evolve with time. For example, the fact (Donald Trump, president, USA) is only valid at the time interval 2017-2021. Therefore, temporal knowledge graphs that consists of quadruples (subject, predicate, object, timestamp) also attract increasing attention recently.\nAlthough commonly used knowledge graphs usually contain billions of triples or quadruples, they still suffer from the incompleteness problem that a lot of factual triples or quadruples are missing. Due to the large scale of knowledge graphs, it is impractical to find all valid triples or quadruples manually. Therefore, knowledge graph completion (KGC)—which aims to predict missing links between entities based on known links automatically—has attracted much attention. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a powerful technique for KGC, which embeds entities, relations, and possible timestamps in KGs into low-dimensional continuous embedding spaces. KGE models define a score function for each triple/quadruple in embedding spaces. Valid triples/quadruples are expected to have higher scores than invalid ones. The success of many existing KGE models relies on an assumption that entities with similar semantics should have similar representations. For example, the triples (lions,is,mammals)lionsismammals({\\textbf{lions}},{\\textbf{is}},{\\textbf{mammals}}) and (tigers,is,mammals)tigersismammals({\\textbf{tigers}},{\\textbf{is}},{\\textbf{mammals}}) will have similar scores if the entities lions and tiger have similar embeddings. In other words, given a known valid triple (lions,is,mammals)lionsismammals({\\textbf{lions}},{\\textbf{is}},{\\textbf{mammals}}), we can infer that the triple (tigers,is,mammals)tigersismammals({\\textbf{tigers}},{\\textbf{is}},{\\textbf{mammals}}) is also valid with high confidence. Semantic matching (SM) models are an important suite of knowledge graph embedding approaches. They usually model static and temporal knowledge graphs as partially observed third-order and fourth-order binary tensors, respectively. Then, they formulate KGC as a tensor completion problem and try to solve it by tensor factorization.\nFrom the perspective of scoring function, SM models use inner products between embeddings to define the plausibility of given triples and quadruples.\nTheoretically, these models are highly expressive and can well handle complex relation patterns, such as 1-N, N-1, and N-N relations  . However, due to the property of inner products, entities with similar semantics may have dissimilar embeddings. For example, even if the embeddings of lions and tiger are orthogonal, the triples (lions,is,mammals)lionsismammals({\\textbf{lions}},{\\textbf{is}},{\\textbf{mammals}}) and (tigers,is,mammals)tigersismammals({\\textbf{tigers}},{\\textbf{is}},{\\textbf{mammals}}) are likely to have the same scores when the two entity embeddings have proper norms (please refer to Section 4.1 for more detailed explanations). Similarly, we can observe the phenomenon in temporal semantic matching models (please refer to Section 5.3). The performance of SM models suffer from this phenomenon and thus cannot achieve state-of-the-art. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel regularizer for semantic matching KGE models—namely, DUality-induced RegulArizer (DURA)—which effectively encourages entities with similar semantics to have similar embeddings. Specifically, by noticing that entities with similar semantics often connect to the same entity through the same relation, we propose to use a regularizer to constrain these entities’ embeddings. Further, we propose DURA based on the observation called duality—for an existing semantic matching KGE model (primal), there is often another distance based KGE model closely associated with it (dual), which uses Minkowski distances to define score functions. The duality can be derived by expanding the squared score functions of the associated distance based models, where the cross-term in the expansion is exactly a SM model and the squared terms in it give us a regularizer. In other words, adding DURA to a SM model is equivalently to a SM model with its associative distance based model being regularization. Since the minimization of the Minkowski distances between vectors force these vectors to be the same, DURA indeed encourages entities with similar semantics to have similar embeddings. Moreover, we show that when relation embeddings are diagonal matrices, the minimization of DURA has a form of the tensor nuclear 2-norm 0. Experiments demonstrate that DURA is widely applicable to various static and temporal semantic matching KGE models and yields consistent and significant improvements on benchmark datasets. An earlier version of this paper has been published at NeurIPS 2020 1. This journal manuscript significantly extends the initial version in several aspects. First, we propose a temporal version of DURA, named TDURA, which is designed for temporal knowledge graph embeddings. Second, we introduce a general semantic matching temporal KGE model, named TRESCAL, which is an extension of RESCAL to temporal KGs. Third, we rigorously analyze the diagonal relation embedding matrices and show that the minimization of TDURA also has a form of the tensor nuclear 2-norm 0. Finally, we conduct experiments on temporal knowledge graphs and conduct more ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of TDURA.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: way, with nodes being entities and edges being relations.
