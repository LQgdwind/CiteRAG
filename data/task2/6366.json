      "content": "Paper Title: An Efficient and Multi-private Key Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the continued emergence of privacy leaks and data abuse, the flourishing of traditional centralized training, which collects a huge number of training data from distributed data providers, has been gradually impeded. As demonstrated in , data providers are no longer willing to upload local data for the consideration of personal privacy and data control right. Obviously, it is almost impossible to train a high-performance deep model without the huge training data. In order to eliminate privacy concerns of data providers, federated learning , as one of the most important research aspects of private computing , has recently been presented. Federated learning is a distributed framework, where many data providers (also called clients) collaboratively train a shared global model under the orchestration of a central server. Throughout the training processes, training data are always saved locally and clients only send the local gradient to the server. Obviously, under this training framework, the appearance of federated learning can address data abuse and greatly improve the data privacy of clients. Thereby, the research of federated learning has exploded in just a few years. Unfortunately, recent works  [ref]5 [ref]6  disclose that the adversary may still obtain some private information of training data or directly reconstruct training data from interacted model parameters or local gradient. Specifically,  and [ref]5 explore the membership inference attack based on the model parameter to infer if a particular data record was included in the training dataset. [ref]6 and  find that the adversary may reconstruct training data from the local gradient. To improve the security of federated learning, many privacy-preserving federated learning schemes   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 have been presented. These schemes widely adopt two cryptographic techniques to achieve secure aggregation, i.e., the homomorphic encryption technique 7 or (t,n)ùë°ùëõ(t,n)-threshold secret sharing technique 8, which ensures the privacy-preservation of the local gradient for each client. However, these related schemes suffer from the following disadvantages, which impede their application in practice: For the schemes   0 1 2 3 designed by the homomorphic encryption technique, all clients share a pair of public and private keys generated by the trusted third party and encrypt local gradient with the same public key. Obviously, once a client was compromised by the adversary, then this system is no longer secure, and meanwhile, no collusion is allowed in these schemes. Besides, these schemes suffer from a huge computational cost and communication overhead. For the schemes 4 5 6 designed by the (t,n)ùë°ùëõ(t,n)-threshold secret sharing technique, the storage costs of private double-masks for each client is proportional to the number of clients. Meanwhile, for different iterations, all clients have to re-select masked secrets and interactively perform the corresponding secret-sharing operation, which leads to extra interactive time and communication overhead. Besides, there is a trade-off between security (i.e., robustness against client collusion) and fault tolerance. If tùë°t is relatively large (i.e., the robustness against client collusion is relatively high), then n‚àítùëõùë°n-t is small, so the number of dropped clients must be low since n‚àítùëõùë°n-t is small. On the contrary, the security is relatively low, i.e., if tùë°t is small, then the system can only allow t‚àí1ùë°1t-1 clients to collude (For the extreme case of t=2ùë°2t=2, these schemes cannot allow client collusion). Furthermore, these secret sharing-based schemes do not consider the privacy preservation of the aggregated result. That is, any adversary (i.e., not just the server) could obtain the aggregated result once getting the transmitted data. Therefore, designing an efficient secure aggregation scheme that supports client self-selected keys, robustness against collusion attacks, and fault tolerance robustness remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we design an efficient and multi-private key secure aggregation scheme for federated learning, which supports homomorphic encryption with multi-private key, decryption limitation for the aggregated result, robustness against collusion attacks, and fault tolerance robustness. The main contributions of this paper are three aspects: Considering the privacy preservation of the local gradient of each client and the aggregated result, we skillfully design a multi-private key secure aggregation protocol without introducing a trusted third party, which allows the server and each client to freely select a pair of public and private keys. Specifically, this protocol is modified based on the simplest additive homomorphic encryption (i.e., the variant ElGamal cryptosystem 9 and the corresponding encryption operation is (gr,gm‚Äãp‚Äãkr)superscriptùëîùëüsuperscriptùëîùëöùëùsuperscriptùëòùëü(g^{r},g^{m}pk^{r}), where p‚Äãk=gs‚Äãkùëùùëòsuperscriptùëîùë†ùëòpk=g^{sk} is the public key computed by the private key s‚Äãkùë†ùëòsk).\nEach client‚Äôs local gradient is encrypted by its own public key, which can ensure that even if the private keys of some clients are leaked, it will not affect the privacy of other clients. Thus, even if at most |S|‚àí2ùëÜ2|S|-2 clients collude with the server (|S|ùëÜ|S| is the number of online clients), they cannot obtain the respective local gradient of the remaining two clients. Besides, only the server can decrypt the aggregated result with its own private key. In order to ensure efficiency, we introduce a super-increasing sequence to greatly reduce the computational costs and communication overhead. Specifically, instead of encrypting each dimension of multidimensional model parameters one by one, our scheme uses this sequence to compress multidimensional gradients into 1-D and then encrypts this compressed data. Obviously, this design can greatly decrease the number of encryption and decryption operations (i.e., computational costs) and the number of transmitted ciphertexts (i.e., communication overhead). As we know, the variant ElGamal has high decryption complexity and is only suitable for the small message space. However, the introduction of the super-increasing sequence will greatly increase the length of the message space. As a result, we skillfully modify the encryption operation of the variant Elgamal to ensure the efficiency and correctness of the decryption. Detailed security analyses demonstrate that our scheme can ensure the semantic security of the local gradient of each client and the aggregated result, robustness against collusion between the server and no more than |S|‚àí2ùëÜ2|S|-2 clients, fault-tolerant robustness for up to N‚àí2ùëÅ2N-2 clients. At the same time, extensive experiments demonstrate scheme exhibits significantly better communication and computational efficiency than the related secure aggregation work. Besides, the accuracy of our scheme is almost the same as the most popular federated learning scheme that does not consider privacy preservation (e.g., FedAvg 0). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We describe models and design goals in Section 2. Then, we present our scheme in Section 3, followed by its security analysis and performance evaluation in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Related work is discussed in Section 6. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: federated learning can address data abuse and greatly improve the data privacy of clients.
