      "content": "Paper Title: On the Role of Entropy-Based Loss for Learning Causal Structure with Continuous Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRelated to least-square loss:\nBlöbaum et al.  address the problem of inferring the causal relation between two variables using least-square loss under the modularity property, i.e., the independence between the function and the distribution of cause. Peters et al.  prove the full identifiability of the linear Gaussian structural equation in the case that all noise variables have the same variance, which can be recovered by the least-square loss in our analysis. Loh et al.  prove the identification of a linear Gaussian structural causal model with known noise variances. Related to causal discovery: One of the categories of causal discovery approaches is to learn causal structures by iteratively conducting independence tests, such as IC , PC , M2LC , M3B . Another category of approaches is based on causal mechanism assumptions. Shimizu et al.  propose LiNGAM by assuming linearity and non-Gaussianity. Many variants improve the efficiency  , extend to time-series data , or relax the causal sufficiency assumption . Hoyer et al.  propose ANM with additive noise assumption. Peters et al.  study the identifiability of discrete ANM, and Wei et al.  extend the orientation rule of ANM by Wasserstein distance. Zhang et al.   propose PNL causal model with inner additive noise and give its identifiability condition. Bühlmann et al.  propose the causal additive model (CAM) by assuming the structural equations are additive.\nRecently, based on the acyclic constraint, the gradient-based approaches has drawn attention.\nZheng et al.  propose a DAG constraint named NOTEARS for learning causal structure with continuous optimization. Ng et al. [ref]28 apply soft sparsity and DAG constraints to learn linear DAGs based on a likelihood-based score function. Yu et al.  propose an alternative characterization of acyclicity and utilize a generative model to learn the nonlinear causal structure. Ng et al. [ref]12 utilize a graph autoencoder framework to extend the linear SCM to nonlinear SCM. Ng et al. [ref]29 extend to nonlinearity by putting the weighted matrix on the first layer of MLP. Lachapelle et al.  express weighted matrix by neural network paths to deal with the nonlinear case. Zheng et al.  propose a more general acyclicity constraint based on partial derivatives to support nonlinear models. Liang et al.  propose the local structures learning algorithm GraN-LCS based on the DAG constraint. Wren et al. learn discrete DAG using such a constraint. Moreover, many methods combine NOTEARS with other domains. Zhu et al.  use Reinforcement Learning to recover the causal structure with the best scoring under the acyclicity constraint. Pamfil et al.  extend to recovering the causal structure on time-series data. Brouillard et al.  make use of interventional data for differentiable causal discovery. Wehenkel et al.  utilize the normalizing flow to learn the causal mechanism with the DAG constraint. Zeng et al.  extend to learning the causal structure on multi-domain data. Faria et al. learn causal structures under latent intervention based on DAG constraint. Ng et al.  propose a federated Bayesian network structure learning method using such a DAG constraint. Yang et al.  and Mao et al.  apply such a DAG constraint to learn the causal representation. Zhang et al.  apply DAG constraint to learn a forest-structured neural topic model to capture relationships between topics. Our work is different from the works above. Many mentioned works  [ref]28  [ref]12 [ref]29    are based on the least-square loss to orient causal direction. However, our analysis shows that it has no identifiability for causal discovery (see Section IV), and we propose a better entropy-based loss that identifies causal direction correctly (see Section V).\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the acyclic constraint, the gradient-based approaches has drawn attention.\nZheng et al.  propose a DAG constraint named NOTEARS for learning causal structure with continuous optimization.
