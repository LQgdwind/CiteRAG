Indoor Running To evaluate how fast our robot can run in the real world, we ramped the velocity command to 6.0 m/stimes6.0ms6.0\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s}. We conducted this experiment in a motion capture arena to accurately estimate the robot’s running speed (Figure 1, top). We found that policies trained with a system identification module and grid curriculum sustained an average speed of 3.8 m/stimes3.8ms3.8\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} across multiple seeds (Table IV), with the highest sustained speed of 3.9 m/stimes3.9ms3.9\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} among the three seeds. This is higher than the previous record of 3.7 m/stimes3.7ms3.7\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} reported for a model-predictive control algorithm on the same robot . Together with concurrent work , this is substantially faster than previous applications of RL to legged locomotion. The maximum attainable speed is intimately tied to the robot’s hardware properties, such as its weight, motor strength, and leg length. Although there is no perfect way to compare agility across different robot designs, Froude number  normalizes a robot’s speed by its leg length and has been used to measure agility across robot platforms in the past 0.\nTable III compares the Froude numbers across different quadrupeds and controllers. Along with the concurrent work of Ji et al. , our method is substantially more agile than previous applications of reinforcement learning. While our robot successfully performs rapid locomotion in the real world, there exists a sim-to-real gap as reported in Table IV. The results reveal that online system identification leads to better tracking of the velocity command of 6.0 m/stimes6.0ms6.0\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} in simulation (speed of 5.46 m/stimes5.46ms5.46\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} with and 5.07 m/stimes5.07ms5.07\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} without system identification), and also reduces the sim-to-real gap (average speeds of 3.81 m/stimes3.81ms3.81\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} with and 2.49 m/stimes2.49ms2.49\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} without system identification). While prior work demonstrated that sim-to-real gap can be mitigated at low velocities [ref]23 [ref]24, our results show that these findings also hold true at high speeds. Some of the remaining sim-to-real performance gap may result from an inaccurate selection of simulated terrain and robot parameters for evaluation. For example, the configuration used for simulated evaluation might overestimate the robot’s effective motor strength or the ground friction, resulting in a different maximum speed. On the other hand, some aspects of the real-world dynamics are probably not captured under any configuration of the simulator. This type of sim-to-real gap could result in suboptimal real-world top speed. The relative contributions of these factors to the sim-to-real performance gap remains uncertain. Outdoor Running Outdoor terrain presents multiple challenges not present in indoor running, among which are changes in ground height, friction, and terrain deformation. Under these variations, the robot must actuate its joints differently to reach high speed than it would on flat, rigid terrain with high friction, such as a treadmill or paved road.\nTo test if our system can run on outdoor terrains, we conducted an outdoor dash across an uneven grassy patch as shown in Figure 1 (second row). We record an outdoor 101010-meter dash time of 2.942.942.94 seconds, corresponding to an average speed of 3.4 m/stimes3.4ms3.4\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s}. Yaw Control\nWe evaluate our controller’s yaw velocity control in the lab setting as shown in Figure 1 (third row). The robot accelerates to a maximum yaw rate of 5.7 rad/stimes5.7rads5.7\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{rad}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s}, then stops safely. This is 90%percent9090\\% of the fastest yaw rate recorded on the Mini Cheetah using a model-based controller, at 6.28 rad/stimes6.28rads6.28\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{rad}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} . However, the model-based records were achieved using two different controllers for linear  and angular  velocity. In contrast, a single policy achieved all indoor and outdoor running and spinning results in our work. To challenge the controller’s spinning skills, we brought the robot outside after a snowstorm and piloted it onto an icy patch, illustrated in Figure 1 (bottom). The robot maintained stability while spinning as its feet frequently slipped on ice. Response to Terrain Changes and Hardware Failures\nWe tested our system in a diverse set of challenging real-world scenarios: (1) ascending a steep incline made of small pebbles. (2) maintaining balance despite a mechanical blockage to one motor. (3) tripping at high speed, flying upside down, and landing on its feet. (4) recovering via a change in gait after tripping over a small barrier. We present these qualitative results in the accompanying video. We also deployed the model-predictive controller from  in scenarios (1) and (4), which were the most convenient to replicate. Unlike our learned controller, the baseline did not recover from (1) slipping down the gravelly incline and (4) tripping over the barrier. While these results highlight the robustness of policies, we want to emphasize that we are not claiming that such (or even more) robustness cannot be achieved with model-predictive control.\nOur claim is simply that by freeing the human from the tedious task of refining the robot’s model or behavior, the RL paradigm offers a scalable alternative to obtain robust behavior in diverse conditions.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: with and 2.49 m/stimes2.49ms2.49\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} without system identification).
