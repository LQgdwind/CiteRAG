      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing the Deployment of Tiny Transformers on Low-Power MCUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first class of optimizations aims to modify the attention mechanism‚Äôs topology to reduce deployment costs regarding memory footprint or number of operations. These approaches, including linearized attention, usually seek to eliminate the quadratic scaling of memory and computational requirements relative to the sequence length. To linearize models, researchers use either the kernel trick¬† [ref]21 [ref]22  or low-rank approximation¬†. However, linear transformers suffer from performance degradation on various tasks compared to traditional attention¬†[ref]25. Hence, linear attention methods are currently not widely adopted by the research community¬†[ref]25. Consequently, this work focuses on speeding up the traditional attention mechanisms. Another popular topological change to the Attention mechanism is the Multi-Query Attention (MQA)¬†. It reformulates the MHSA to use only one KùêæK and VùëâV head instead of HùêªH heads. This modification drastically reduces the required memory bandwidth and increases data reuse. However, the impact on the output quality is non-negligible¬†. Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) is a variant of MQA proposed to reduce this accuracy drop. Instead of reducing the number of KùêæK and VùëâV heads to one, it groups a certain number of K‚ÄãVùêæùëâKV heads, allowing the programmer to mitigate the accuracy drop. GQA has been successful used in popular Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLama-2 ¬†. However, to the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, these methods have yet to be successfully applied in the TinyML domain. Furthermore, the implementation of GQA kernels can be derived from the basic ones and does not require extra optimization steps.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: attention, usually seek to eliminate the quadratic scaling of memory and computational requirements relative to the sequence length.
