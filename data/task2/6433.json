      "content": "Paper Title: Squeeze, Recover and Relabel: Dataset Condensation at ImageNet Scale From A New Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past few years, the task of data condensation or distillation has garnered significant interest within the domain of computer vision   [ref]5  [ref]7 [ref]1. By distilling large datasets into representative, compact subsets, data condensation methods enable rapid training and streamlined storage, while preserving essential information from the original datasets. The significance of data condensation on both research and applications cannot be understated, as it plays a crucial role in the efficient handling and processing of vast amounts of data across numerous fields. Through the implementation of sophisticated algorithms, such as Meta-Model Matching  [ref]5, Gradient Matching   [ref]7, Distribution Matching  , and Trajectory Matching [ref]1 , data condensation has made remarkable strides. However, prior solutions predominantly excel in distilling small datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet , downscaled ImageNet  featuring low resolution, or a subset of ImageNet [ref]7. This limitation arises due to the prohibitive computational expense incurred from executing a massive number of unrolled iterations during the bilevel optimization process (comprising an inner loop for model updates and an outer loop for synthetic data updates). In our study, employing a meticulously designed decoupling strategy for model training and synthetic data updating (as illustrated in Fig. 1 left), the proposed method is capable of distilling the entire large-scale ImageNet dataset at the conventional resolution of 224×\\times224 while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, our training/synthesis computation outstrips the efficiency of prior approaches, even those utilizing reduced resolution or subsets of ImageNet. A comparison of efficiency is provided in Table 1. To address the huge computational and memory footprints associated with training, we propose a tripartite learning paradigm comprised of Squeeze, Recover, and Relabel stages. This paradigm allows for the decoupling of the condensed data synthesis stage from the real data input, as well as the segregation of inner-loop and outer-loop optimization. Consequently, it is not restricted by the scale of datasets, input resolution, or the size of network architectures. Specifically, in the initial phase, rather than simultaneous sampling of real and synthetic data and its subsequent network processing to update the target synthetic data, we bifurcate this process into Squeeze and Recover stages to distinguish the relationship and reduce similarity between real and synthetic data. In the subsequent phase, we exclusively align the batch normalization (BN)  statistics derived from the model trained in the first phase to synthesize condensed data. In contrast to feature matching solutions that perform the matching process solely on individual batches within each iteration, the trained BN statistics on original data span the entire dataset, thereby providing a more comprehensive and accurate alignment between the original dataset and synthetic data.\nGiven that real data is not utilized in this phase, the decoupled training can considerably diminish computational costs compared to the preceding bilevel training strategy.\nIn the final phase, we employ the models trained in the first phase to relabel the synthetic data, serving as a data-label alignment process. An in-depth overview of this process is illustrated in Fig. 2. Advantages. Our approach exhibits the following merits: (1) It can process large resolution condensation during training effortlessly with a justified computational cost. (2) Unlike other counterparts, we can tackle the relatively large datasets of Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K to make our method more practical for real-world applications. (3) Our approach can directly utilize many off-the-shelf pre-trained large models that contain BN layers, which enables to further save the training overhead. Extensive experiments are performed on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K datasets. On ImageNet-1K with 224×224224224224\\times 224 resolution and IPC 50, the proposed approach obtains a remarkable accuracy of 60.8%, outperforming all previous methods by a large margin.\nWe anticipate that our research will contribute to the community’s confidence in the practical feasibility of large-scale dataset condensation using a decoupled synthesis strategy from the real data, while maintaining reasonable computational costs. Contributions. • We propose a new framework for large-scale dataset condensation, which involves a three-stage learning procedure of squeezing, recovery, and relabeling. This approach has demonstrated exceptional efficacy, efficiency and robustness in both the data synthesis and model training phases. • We conduct a thorough ablation study and analysis, encompassing the impacts of diverse data augmentations for original data compression, various regularization terms for data recovery, and diverse teacher alternatives for relabeling on the condensed dataset. The comprehensive specifications of the learning process can offer valuable insights for subsequent investigations in the domain. • To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables to condense the full ImageNet-1K dataset with an inaugural implementation at a standard resolution of 224×\\times224, utilizing widely accessible NVIDIA GPUs such as the 3090, 4090, or A100 series. Furthermore, our method attains the highest accuracy of 60.8% on full ImageNet-1K within an IPC constraint of 50 using justified training time and memory cost, outperforming all previous methods by a significant margin.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Over the past few years, the task of data condensation or distillation has garnered significant interest within the domain of computer vision   [ref]5  [ref]7 [ref]1.
