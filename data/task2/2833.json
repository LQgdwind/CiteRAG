      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Algorithmic Reasoners are Implicit Planners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our results, we use ‚ÄúXLVIN-CP‚Äù to denote XLVIN executors pre-trained using CartPole-style synthetic graphs (where applicable), and ‚ÄúXLVIN-R‚Äù for pre-training them on random deterministic graphs. ‚ÄúPPO‚Äù denotes our baseline model-free agent; it has no transition/executor model, but otherwise matches the XLVIN hyperparameters. As planning-like computation was shown to emerge in entirely model-free agents [ref]16, this serves as a check for the importance of the VI computation. To analyse the impact of the algorithmic bottleneck, we use ‚ÄúATreeC‚Äù [ref]13 as one of our baselines, capturing the behavior of a larger class of VI-based implicit planners (including TreeQN and VPN ). For maximal comparability, we make ATreeC fully match XLVIN‚Äôs hyperparameters, except for the executor model. Since ATreeC‚Äôs policy is directly tied to the result of applying TD(ŒªùúÜ\\lambda), its ultimate performance is closely tied to the quality of its scalar value predictions. Comparing against ATreeC can thus give insight into negative effects of the algorithmic bottleneck at low-data regimes. CartPole, Acrobot, MountainCar and LunarLander ¬†¬† Results for the continuous-space control environments are provided in Table 1. We find that the XLVIN model solves CartPole from only 10 trajectories, outperforming all the results given in [ref]42 (incl. REINFORCE , Autoencoders, World Models , DeepMDP  and PRAE [ref]42), while using 10√ó10\\times fewer samples. For more details, see Appendix D. Further, our model is capable of solving the Acrobot and MountainCar environments from only 100 trajectories, in spite of sparse rewards. Conversely, the baseline model, as well as ATreeC, are unable to get off the ground at all, remaining stuck at the lowest possible score in the environment until timing out. This still holds when XLVIN is trained on the random deterministic graphs, demonstrating that the executor training need not be dependent on knowing the underlying MDP specifics. Mirroring the above findings, XLVIN also demonstrates clear low-data efficiency gains on LunarLander, compared to the PPO baseline and ATreeC. In this setting, ATreeC even underperformed compared to the PPO baseline, highlighting once again the issues with algorithmic bottlenecks. Freeway, Alien, Enduro and H.E.R.O. ¬†¬†Lastly, the average clipped reward of the Atari agents across the first million transitions can be visualised in Figure 2. From the inception of the training, the XLVIN model explores and exploits better, consistently remaining ahead of the baseline PPO model in the low-data regime (matching it in the latter stages of Enduro). In H.E.R.O., XLVIN is also the first agent to break away from the performance plateau, towards the end of the 1,000,000 transitions. The fact that the executor was transferred from randomly generated graphs (Appendix E) is a further statement to XLVIN‚Äôs robustness. On all four games, ATreeC consistently trailed behind XLVIN during the first half of the training, and on Enduro, it underperformed even compared to the PPO baseline, indicating that overreliance on scalar predictions may damage low-data performance. It empirically validates our observation of the potential negative effects of algorithmic bottlenecks at low-data regimes.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: our baseline model-free agent; it has no transition/executor model, but otherwise matches the XLVIN hyperparameters.
