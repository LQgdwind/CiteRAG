      "content": "Paper Title: An Optimizing Framework on MLIR for Efficient FPGA-based Accelerator Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid growth of computation-intensive applications,\nFPGA-based accelerators are becoming increasingly popular to achieve high processing speeds given limited resource and energy budgets.\nHowever, programming on FPGAs is challenging.\nTo improve productivity, high-level synthesis (HLS) tools are proposed to synthesize behavioral descriptions specified in high-level languages (such as C/C++) into dedicated hardware accelerators . This allows designers to focus on the behavioral implementation of algorithms without dealing with complex and error-prone digital design. However, there are new challenges to overcome. While existing tools such as Xilinx Vitis HLS offer pragmas to guide the hardware code generation, the quality of generated accelerators largely depends on the user’s ability to select appropriate HLS pragmas  . In many cases, it is necessary to restructure source code manually to loosen tight dependencies and achieve high parallelism . This process can be complex and iterative, requiring careful consideration and experimentation, which exacerbates programming and optimization difficulties. Recent years have witnessed multiple compilation frameworks that cope with programming and optimization difficulties for different platforms, including ① general processors like CPUs and GPUs, ② specialized processors with pre-defined hardware like DSAs, and ③ FPGA-based accelerators where data paths can be fully customized and reconfigured. Optimization techniques vary for different hardware and we classify representative frameworks into two categories: Frameworks for non-FPGA back-ends (①②): There is a growing trend towards optimizing applications written in scheduling languages on CPUs, GPUs [ref]29  [ref]9     and specialized processors like DSAs   . Halide [ref]29 proposes a domain-specific language (DSL) with decoupled computation and schedule for image processing. TVM  extends Halide DSL and proposes an optimizing compiler for deep learning. Both of them mainly focus on GPU acceleration. VTA  works as a back-end for TVM and optimizes tensors on an ISA-based DSA processor with pre-defined architecture and FPGA is utilized for prototyping. This is different from commonly used FPGA-based accelerators where the data path is fully customized and reconfigured. Exo  provides an abstract programming model for DSAs, which allows developers to write libraries for emerging accelerators.\nSimultaneously, polyhedral techniques  have shown success in efficient loop analysis and transformation.\nPENCIL [ref]9, Pluto , PolyMage , Tiramisu , and AlphaZ  take high-level languages or DSLs as input and generate optimized code automatically for CPUs/GPUs. AKG  utilizes polyhedral schedulers and accelerates tensors for NPUs.\nDespite the good performance, none of these works target FPGA-based accelerators, and their loop optimization strategies cannot be adopted directly to FPGAs. Take a nested loop as an example, their strategies seek to parallelize outer loop levels for multi-thread computation and process inner loop levels sequentially within each thread. For AI applications on GPUs and NPUs, loop fusion is utilized to improve data locality and reduce the cost of kernel launch. In contrast, FPGA-friendly optimization strategies tend to pipeline outer loop levels and parallelize inner loop levels through unrolling, and loop fusion mainly reduces resource usage. Frameworks for FPGA accelerators with customized data paths (③):\nRecent advances in HLS frameworks have explored optimization methods for FPGAs   [ref]24  . Halide-HLS  and HeteroHalide [ref]24 work as FPGA back-ends for Halide and generate customized pipelines for image processing. HeteroCL  and HeteroFlow  extend TVM DSL and generate spatial architectures on FPGAs. However, these frameworks have limited capabilities in dependence analysis and loop transformation, resulting in a reduced ability to exploit parallelism. All of these works use a single loop-level intermediate representation (IR) for HLS optimization. However, there exist many other schedule methods, and each corresponds to different optimization granularity, which should be applied at or across different abstraction levels for better performance.\nDepending exclusively on a single IR for all optimizations may introduce excessive information into the IR and make debugging an arduous task.\nIn contrast, using multiple layers of IRs to represent schedule methods streamlines the implementation process of different analysis, transformation, and optimization methods, which exhibits greater flexibility and systematicness and allows for more efficient design space exploration.\nMost related tools with multi-level IRs target CPUs, GPUs, and specialized processors     . ScaleHLS  proposes an HLS framework for FPGAs on top of the multi-level intermediate representation (MLIR) compiler infrastructure . It receives C code and expands MLIR with a back-end to generate synthesizable HLS code. However, critical schedule methods and strategies cannot be supported, leading to non-optimal accelerators. Moreover, since the input is C code, designers still need to fully restructure the source code even if the schedule is slightly adjusted. In this paper, we present POM, an open-source optimizing framework on MLIR, which generates efficient FPGA accelerators automatically. POM explicitly divides the compilation process into three layers with hybrid IRs, namely dependence graph IR, polyhedral IR, and annotated affine dialect, which enable various optimizations at appropriate abstraction levels. The dependence graph IR is used for advanced dependence analysis at the graph level of applications. The polyhedral IR is designed to reduce the implementation effort for a wide range of schedule strategies. And the annotated MLIR affine dialect explicitly represents HLS pragmas in loop hierarchies, working as a suitable bridge between polyhedral semantics (the previous layer) and synthesizable HLS code (the output).\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows: Programmability: POM provides a decoupled DSL that enables concise descriptions of functions, loops, and arrays. A rich collection of scheduling primitives is provided for flexible customization, leading to much fewer lines of code while maintaining high performance. Extensibility: POM explicitly introduces three layers of IR to perform operations at suitable abstraction levels in a unified framework, streamlining the implementation and debugging process and reducing the effort of supporting various optimization methods. Quality: POM provides a rich set of optimization methods and performs FPGA-oriented schedule operations at proper levels, relieving tight loop-carried dependence, exploiting parallelism, and improving overall performance. Automation: POM contains a design space exploration (DSE) engine to search for high-performance schedule schemes automatically and efficiently, while also allowing designers to set user-specified schedules. Experimental results show that POM achieves 6.46×6.46\\times average speedup on typical benchmark suites and 6.06×6.06\\times average speedup on real-world applications compared to SOTA .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: classify representative frameworks into two categories: Frameworks for non-FPGA back-ends (①②): There is a growing trend towards optimizing applications written in scheduling languages on CPUs, GPUs [ref]29  [ref]9     and specialized processors like DSAs   .
