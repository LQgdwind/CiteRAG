      "content": "Paper Title: Review-Incorporated Model-Agnostic Profile Injection Attacks on Recommender Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn data poisoning attacks (aka shilling/profile injection attacks) to recommender systems (RSs) [ref]1,\nunscrupulous parties inject a group of fake user profiles including carefully-crafted user-item interaction data (e.g., ratings) to spoof a target RS for malicious purposes, such as promoting their own products or demoting competitors’ products. Such attacks challenge the trustworthiness of RSs and threaten the fairness of the platform.\nHence, more efforts are being devoted to studying how RSs can be attacked to identify potential risks [ref]1 [ref]2       [ref]9. Many RSs have restrictions on accessing the details of their algorithms.\nThe architectures and parameters of the target RS are often not available to attackers in practice [ref]9.\nAttackers often construct attack profiles that are difficult to distinguish from real profiles to increase the impact time and scope . With limited resources to exploit, it is challenging to build high-quality attack profiles that have the following two properties: transferability (i.e., effective against different black-box RSs) and imperceptibility (i.e., difficult to be detected). It is difficult to transfer conventional shilling attacks (e.g., Random [ref]1) and some algorithm-specific poisoning attacks (e.g., PGA [ref]2) to deep learning (DL)-based RSs. On the other hand, many attack methods are poorly imperceptible, due to their optimization goals focus mainly on attack performance.\nTo address these problems, a few recent works (e.g., TrialAttack  and Leg-UP [ref]9) exploit generative adversarial networks (GANs)  to produce effective fake user profiles. However, the existing attack profiles [ref]1 [ref]2      [ref]9  focus only on generating fake ratings to evaluate the robustness of RSs. Textual reviews are increasingly incorporated to boost recommendation performance , meanwhile, fake reviews with textual descriptions can easily influence user decisions and hence help businesses promote their products . How fake review text may affect RSs still remains an open problem. We propose to use publicly available textual reviews to improve the generation quality of fake user profiles under limited available resources.\nCompared to numerical ratings, textual reviews contain rich semantic information , which better reveals user behaviors and properties of their preferred items than a numerical value using the Likert-scale ratings [ref]9. In addition, the review text explains the reasons for the user’s rating, which is more convincing than mere ratings. Specifically, we give a novel review-enhanced attack framework named R-Trojan to optimize attack objectives on transferability and imperceptibility. It uses a tailored transformer-improved GAN that consists of a generation module, a surrogate module and a detection module. The generation module builds high-quality fake user profiles, where fake user ratings are produced by reconstructing sorted real user profile templates. The corresponding fake textual reviews are generated by prompting a fine-tuned language model with given sentiments and topics. The surrogate module is a locally-trained review-based RS used to accurately measure the effectiveness of attacks with limited knowledge, for guiding the generation module to create transferable profiles. The detection module, on the other hand, is used to make the profiles imperceptible. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We introduce textual reviews to reinforce the generation quality of fake user profiles for attacking black-box RSs.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt to introduce the reviews to guide profile generation. We identify a new vulnerability by providing a pioneer study on poisoning attacks to review-based RSs. We propose a novel attack framework R-Trojan to produce transferable and undetectable fake user profiles that contain fake numerical ratings and fake textual reviews. Our experiment results on real-world datasets show that R-Trojan outperforms state-of-the-art attacks against various black-box RSs and has good detection escape ability.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In data poisoning attacks (aka shilling/profile injection attacks) to recommender systems (RSs) [ref]1,\nunscrupulous parties inject a group of fake user profiles including carefully-crafted user-item interaction data (e.g., ratings) to spoof a target RS for malicious purposes, such as promoting\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
