      "content": "Paper Title: On Practical Nearest Sub-Trajectory Queries under the Fréchet Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now discuss Part 222 (lines 888-171717), which abandons the metric pruning of sub-trajectory clusters inherent in Part 111, and instead opts for a freespace pruning method that calls the proposed Algorithm 111 greedy decider with candidates that have decreasing resolutions. The first step (line 888) aggregates existing pairwise candidates into a smaller set that is more fortunate for doing searches in the freespace diagram.\nIn a​g​g​r​e​g​a​t​e​C​(𝒞)𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒𝐶𝒞aggregateC(\\mathscr{C}), the union of candidate intervals is computed, which combines intervals that overlap.\nThe new aggregated candidate set still covers all original intervals, but the aggregation can result in a (much) smaller set of candidates.\nFor example, on a given level, the result of a​g​g​r​e​g​a​t​e​C𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒𝐶aggregateC on {([ref]1 ,[ref]1 ),( [ref]4, ),([ref]5 , )}1313347856910\\{([ref]1 ,[ref]1 ),( [ref]4, ),([ref]5 , )\\} yields the candidate c=([ref]1 , )𝑐13910c=([ref]1 , ) and S​(c)=⟨p1,p3,p4,…,p10⟩𝑆𝑐subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝3subscript𝑝4…subscript𝑝10S(c)=\\langle p_{1},p_{3},p_{4},\\ldots,p_{10}\\rangle.\n(Note that for Part 222, the simplified trajectory S​(c)𝑆𝑐S(c) generated for a given c=([i,j],[u,v])𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑢𝑣c=([i,j],[u,v]) starts at vertex i𝑖i and ends at vertex v𝑣v, unlike during Part 111.)\nThis ‘batching process’ results in fewer calls to the greedy decider, and avoids unnecessary work since overlapping candidate intervals are eliminated. The second step (lines 9−169169-16) loops from the HST resolution l𝑙l, that Part 111 stopped at, down to the leaf level and does the following.\nFirst, in line 101010, for each candidate c∈C𝑐𝐶c\\in C, compute C​FG​D​(S​(c),Q)𝐶subscript𝐹𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄CF_{GD}(S(c),Q) and set α𝛼\\alpha and the sub-trajectory result P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} to the smallest C​FG​D​(S​(c),Q)𝐶subscript𝐹𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄CF_{GD}(S(c),Q), where P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} is the minimal inclusion result.\nIf we are at the leaf level, then the continuous Fréchet distance α𝛼\\alpha and nearest sub-trajectory P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} are returned.\nOtherwise, α𝛼\\alpha plus the resolution error is used as an upper bound to assist in computing a candidate set for the next finer resolution (line 131313), which is then aggregated (line 141414).\nWe describe candidate set generation in detail below, as well as additional heuristics to speed-up the algorithm. There are different ways to compute a candidate set for the next finer resolution (line 131313).\nFor example, one could again simply discard a candidate c∈C𝑐𝐶c\\in C, if α+2​r​(l′)<C​FG​D​(S​(c),Q)𝛼2𝑟superscript𝑙′𝐶subscript𝐹𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄\\alpha+2r(l^{\\prime})<CF_{GD}(S(c),Q).\nHowever, remaining candidates retain their start [i,j]𝑖𝑗[i,j] and end [u,v]𝑢𝑣[u,v] intervals, even if those parts become further from Q𝑄Q as the resolution decreases. Instead, we opt for a candidate set generation method (line 131313) that reduces remaining candidate interval lengths, and prunes away candidates that are too far.\nThis improved pruning method calls D​PG​D​(S​(c),Q,α+r​(l′))𝐷subscript𝑃𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄𝛼𝑟superscript𝑙′DP_{GD}(S(c),Q,\\alpha+r(l^{\\prime})) for each aggregated c∈C𝑐𝐶c\\in C, which returns maximal inclusion paths, i.e. the new candidates for the next lower resolution level.\nThere are three possible outcomes when calling D​PG​D𝐷subscript𝑃𝐺𝐷DP_{GD}:\n(i) c𝑐c is pruned since there is no longer a canonical path in the free space,\n(ii) S​(c)𝑆𝑐S(c) is reduced in length since the maximal inclusion path that is returned is shorter, or\n(iii) c𝑐c is retained and the maximal inclusion path is not reduced in length.\nSince the closest sub-trajectory can be no further than α+r​(l′)𝛼𝑟superscript𝑙′\\alpha+r(l^{\\prime}), the call on a candidate with the closest result will always return a maximal inclusion path and thus remain in the set.\nAs the resolution is reduced in Part 222, the distance α+r​(l′)𝛼𝑟superscript𝑙′\\alpha+r(l^{\\prime}) becomes smaller, hence improving the pruning effectiveness when calling D​PG​D𝐷subscript𝑃𝐺𝐷DP_{GD}.\nIt is important to note that maximal inclusion paths (rather than minimal inclusion) are returned from D​PG​D𝐷subscript𝑃𝐺𝐷DP_{GD}, to ensure that only non-reachable space that is further than α+r​(l′)𝛼𝑟superscript𝑙′\\alpha+r(l^{\\prime}) is pruned. Three additional heuristics are applied to the C​FG​D​(S​(c),Q)𝐶subscript𝐹𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄CF_{GD}(S(c),Q) calls in line 101010 that estimate α𝛼\\alpha: Uniformly randomly choose a small number (≈⌈log⁡|C|⌉absent𝐶\\approx\\lceil\\log|C|\\rceil) of candidates in C𝐶C to call C​FG​D​(S​(c),Q)𝐶subscript𝐹𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄CF_{GD}(S(c),Q) and determine α𝛼\\alpha. Limit decision calls in C​FG​D​(S​(c),Q)𝐶subscript𝐹𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄CF_{GD}(S(c),Q), using the current resolution l′superscript𝑙′l^{\\prime}, to avoid unnecessary precise estimation of α𝛼\\alpha. If L​B2​(S​(c),Q)>α𝐿subscript𝐵2𝑆𝑐𝑄𝛼LB_{2}(S(c),Q)>\\alpha or D​PG​D​(S​(c),Q,α)=f​a​l​s​e𝐷subscript𝑃𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄𝛼𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒DP_{GD}(S(c),Q,\\alpha)=false, then do not check C​FG​D​(S​(c),Q)𝐶subscript𝐹𝐺𝐷𝑆𝑐𝑄CF_{GD}(S(c),Q). The first two heuristics typically perform fewer computations nearer the HST root and more computations nearer the HST leaf level, and can result in a larger α𝛼\\alpha, thus not violating pruning correctness.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: still covers all original intervals, but the aggregation can result in a (much) smaller set of candidates.\nFor example, on a given level, the result of a​g​g​r​e​g​a​t​e​C𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒𝐶aggregateC on {([ref]1 ,[ref]1 ),( [ref]4, ),([ref]5 , )}1313347856910\\{([ref]1 ,[ref]1 ),( [ref]4, ),([ref]5 , )\\} yields the candidate c=([ref]1 , )𝑐13910c=([ref]1 , ) and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
