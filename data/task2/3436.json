      "content": "Paper Title: MetaKG: Meta-learning on Knowledge Graph for Cold-start Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. To evaluate the performance of MetaKG, we use three public and popular benchmark datasets involving different scenarios: Amazon-book, Last-FM, and Yelp2018. These datasets are also adopted in the state-of-the-art methods [ref]45. For each dataset, k𝑘k-core setting is used to ensure the quality of the dataset, meaning that we only keep users and items with at least k𝑘k interactions. Here, we use 10-score setting for all the three datasets. The detailed dataset descriptions are as follows. Yelp2018.111https://www.yelp.com/dataset This is a local business rating dataset collected by Yelp. We use the 2018 edition dataset of the Yelp challenge, and we take the local businesses like restaurants and bars as the items. Last-FM.222https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011 This is a music listening dataset provided by Last.fm online music system, where tracks are identified as items. We follow the work [ref]45  to take the subset of the dataset where the timestamp is from Jan, 2015 to June, 2015. Amazon-book.333http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon We select Amazon-book from Amazon-review, a widely used dataset for product recommendation 3. Here, if a user u𝑢u rates an item i𝑖i, we set it as an observed interaction, which means lu​i=1subscript𝑙𝑢𝑖1l_{ui}=1 in the user-item bipartite graph 𝒢usubscript𝒢𝑢\\mathcal{G}_{u}. In addition, we derive the knowledge graphs from Freebase (for Amazon-book and Last-FM datasets), and the local business information network (for Yelp2018 datasets), which are widely used in preivous studies [ref]45 . The overall statistics of datasets are summarized in Table II. Cold-start Scenarios. We follow the previous work 7 to construct the cold-start scenarios. Specifically, we first divide users and items into two groups (i.e., old ones and new ones) according to user’s joining time (or user’s first action time) and item’s releasing time. Then, we split each dataset into training and testing data sets. For training data set, we only collect old user ratings for old items. For testing data, users and items are partitioned into three scenarios: User Cold-start (UC), (i.e. recommending old items for new users); Item Cold-start (IC), (i.e., recommending new items for old users); and User-Item Cold-start (UIC), (i.e., recommending new items for new users). Meta-learning Settings. We collect the support and query sets following the previous work . Among the items rated by user u𝑢u, we randomly select 10 items as the query set (i.e. |𝒬u|=10subscript𝒬𝑢10|\\mathcal{Q}_{u}|=10), and use the remaining items as the support set. We will also show the impact of the support set size on the model performance in Section 7.6. Evaluation Metrics. We treat all the items that user u𝑢u has not interacted with as the negative items. Then, each method outputs the user’s preference scores over all the items, except for the rated ones in the training set. We adopt two widely-used evaluation protocols [ref]45  , i.e., Recall@K𝐾K and normalized discounted cumulative gain at rank K𝐾K (NDCG@K𝐾K). Here, we set K𝐾K to 20. Compared Methods. We comprehensively compare our proposed MetaKG with traditional methods (FM and NFM), the embedding-based methods (CKE, CFKG and UGRec), the path-based methods (MCRec and RippleNet), the propagation-based methods (KGCN, KGAT and CKAN), and the state-of-the-art meta-learning method (MeLU and MetaHIN). Note that, we omit some methods (e.g., PER  and DKN ), because they have been obviously defeated by recently proposed methods: KGCN  and KGAT [ref]45. FM  is a factorization benchmark, which considers the second-order interactions between users and items. NFM  is the state-of-the-art factorization method which uses MLP to learn nonlinear and high-order interaction signals. CKE  is an embedding-based method, which applies TransR  and CF to combine structural, visual, and textual knowledge in a unified framework. CFKG  applies TransE on the unified graph including users, items, entities, and relations, casting the recommendation task as the prediction of (u,r,v)𝑢𝑟𝑣(u,r,v) triplets. UGRec  is the state-of-the-art embedding-based method which not only models directed knowledge-aware relations with TransD 0, but also utilizes attentive mechanism to model undirected co-occurrence relations among items. MCRec  is a path-based model, which extracts qualified meta-paths as connectivities between users and items. RipppleNet  is the state-of-the-art path-based models, which uses a memory-like network, and propagates users’ potential preferences to enrich user representations. KGCN  is one of the state-of-the-art propagation-based models, which extends GCN to the KG by selectively aggregating neighborhood information, to learn both structure and semantic information of the KG as well as users’ personalized interests. KGAT [ref]45 is also one of the stat-of-the-art propagation-based models, which utilizes an attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of neighbors in CKG. CKAN  is based on KGAT, which utilizes different aggregation schemes on the user-item graph and KG, to encode knowledge association and collaborative signals. MeLU  is a meta-learning method that only leverages interactions to learn embeddings of new users and items. MetaHIN 7 is the stat-of-the-art meta-learning method that captures multifaceted semantics on heterogeneous information networks to address cold-start problems. Parameters Settings. We apply grid search for hyper-parameter tuning. We adopt Adam to optimize MetaKG, and utilize the default Xavier initializer  to initialize the parameters. The embedding size is fixed to 64 for users, entities and relations. For all datasets, we set the global learning rate to 0.0001, local learning rate to 0.01 and scheduler learning rate to 0.001 after tuning amongst {0.1, 0.01, …, 0.0001}. For adaptive scheduler module, the bidirectional LSTM with hidden units set to 10 is used for embedding both the loss and the gradient similarity. To explore the high-order connectivity information, we stack three propagation layers with three fusion gates. Finally, we implement MetaKG in Python and Pytorch444https://pytorch.org. All experiments were conducted on a server with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4216, 2.10GHz CPU, 256GB RAM, and a NVIDIA A100 GPU.\nThe used datasets and source codes of MetaKG are available online555https://github.com/ZJU-DBL/MetaKG. For baselines, we set their parameters under the guidance of literature. The user, item, entity and relation embedding dimensions are fixed to 64 for all baselines. The learning rate is tuned amongst {0.0001, 0.001, 0.01}, and the coefficient of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} normalization is searched in {10−6superscript10610^{-6}, 10−5superscript10510^{-5} , …, 10−1superscript10110^{-1}}. For NFM, we set the MLP layers size to  2  with dropout ratio 0.1. For CKE, CFKG, and KGAT, the KG training batch size is set to 2048, and the learning rate is 0.0001. Specifically, for KGAT, we set the depth to three with the hidden size  2 6, and set dropout ratio to 0.1. For RippleNet, we set the number of hops and the memory size to 2 and 8, respectively. For UGRec, the margin value for hinge loss is set to 1.5. For CKAN, we set the size of triple set for user and item to 16 and 64 respectively. For MeLU and MetaHIN, both of the local and global learning rate are set to 0.0001, and a single local update is applied to this model.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: of MetaKG, we use three public and popular benchmark datasets involving different scenarios: Amazon-book, Last-FM, and Yelp2018.
