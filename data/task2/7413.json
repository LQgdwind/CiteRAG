Generally, reconstruction model and predictive methods are used to verify the normality of the model     [ref]27 [ref]28  [ref]30    . Reconstruction methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  [ref]27, and Autoencoder [ref]28  [ref]30 attempt to distinguish abnormal events by redrawing the input. In particular, the memory module  is introduced to record the prototype of the normal data, which represents the different patterns of the normal video frames for unsupervised anomaly detection. Predictive methods attempt to encode normal events through statistical models. Xu et al.  used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect anomalies after extracting the features. Ruff et al.  utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to map the normal data as the center of the sphere and exclude the abnormal samples outside it. Tian et al.  proposed Multiscale Temporal Network (MTN) to capture the local and global temporal dependencies between video clips, and achieved state-of-the-art results. Inspired by the temporal dependencies of MTN networks, we introduce a framework to capture dependencies between clips: we first optimize the feature encoder in a fine-grained manner by introducing MIL. Then, in order to capture spatio-temporal dependencies between video clips, the spatio-temporal graph module is applied.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: in computer vision, video anomaly detection has been extensively studied for many years.
