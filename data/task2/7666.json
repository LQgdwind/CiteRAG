      "content": "Paper Title: Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset. We evaluate the coding efficiency of our proposed CAMSIC on two public stereo image datasets: Cityscapes 7: A dataset of urban outdoor scenes with distant views. It includes 5000 image pairs at a resolution of 2048√ó\\times1024 pixels. We divide these into 2975 pairs for training, 500 pairs for validation, and the remaining 1525 pairs for testing. InStereo2K : A dataset of indoor scenes with close views. It contains 2060 image pairs at a resolution of 1080√ó\\times860 pixels. We allocate 2010 and 50 stereo image pairs for training and testing, respectively. We randomly crop the images into 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 patches for data augmentation during training, and evaluate different codecs on full-resolution images. When the resolution of the source image is not supported, we apply the replicate padding to the right and bottom sides of the image. Evaluation Metrics. We use bit per pixel (bpp) to measure the number of bits for latent representation compression. Two popular image quality assessment metrics, namely, PSNR and MS-SSIM , are used to evaluate the distortion between the reconstructed and original images. We also report the Bjontegaard Delta bitrate (BD-rate)  results to show average bitrate savings at equivalent distortion levels. In addition, both BD-PSNR and BD-MSSSIM are utilized to indicate average image quality improvements at constant bitrate. Implementation Details. Leveraging CompressAI , we train our models with six different ŒªùúÜ\\lambda values (256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 for the MSE metric; 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 for the MS-SSIM metric). For MSE-optimized models, they are trained for 400 epochs with the Adam optimizer . The batch size is set as 444. The initial learning rate is 1‚Äãe‚àí41superscriptùëí41e^{-4} and decayed by a factor of 222 every 100100100 epochs. To accelerate the experiments, both the image encoder and decoder utilize the pretrained single image compression model ELIC 3 provided by an open-source project‚Ä†‚Ä†https://github.com/VincentChandelier/ELiC-ReImplemetation.git as the initial weights. For MS-SSIM evaluation, the MSE-optimized models are fine-tuned for 300300300 epochs using the MS-SSIM distortion loss with the initial learning rate as 5‚Äãe‚àí55superscriptùëí55e^{-5}. During inference, we set the number of decoding steps as 8. Our experiments are conducted with NVIDIA V100 GPUs using PyTorch. For more details about the network structures, please refer to the supplementary material. Benchmarks. We compare our CAMSIC with a variety of traditional and learning-based codecs. These competitive baselines are roughly split into four categories: single image compression (BPG , ELIC 3), video compression (HEVC , VVC ), multi-view compression (MV-HEVC , LDMIC ) and stereo image compression (DispSIC , SASIC , BCSIC , ECSIC [ref]44). For BPG, we adopt the default x265 encoder without chroma subsampling to independently compress each image. By treating a stereo image pair as a two-frame video sequence, we run HM-18.0  and VTM-23.0  software with lowdelay P configuration and YUV444 format to evaluate the coding efficiency of HEVC and VVC. For MV-HEVC, HTM-16.3  software is used to compress stereo images by setting a two-view intra mode. Unfortunately, it only supports YUV420 format, resulting in inferior compression performance. As for learning-based multi-view and stereo codecs except ECSIC, we implement them using the same training procedure. Since the current SOTA method ECSIC requires training on large-width visible stereo images to achieve the best results, we follow their open source library‚Ä†‚Ä†https://github.com/mwoedlinger/ecsic.git to train the ECSIC models. We refer readers to [ref]44 for more training details about ECSIC.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: four categories: single image compression (BPG , ELIC 3), video compression (HEVC , VVC ), multi-view compression (MV-HEVC , LDMIC ) and stereo image compression (DispSIC , SASIC , BCSIC , ECSIC [ref]44). For BPG, we adopt the default x265 encoder without chroma subsampling to independently compress each image. By treating a stereo image pair as a two-frame video sequence, we run HM-18.0\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
