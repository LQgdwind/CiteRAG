      "content": "Paper Title: Comparing Causal Frameworks: Potential Outcomes, Structural Models, Graphs, and Abstractions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs we saw above (Prop. 1), SCMs can be understood as representations of suitable RCMs. As such, they also suggest further sources of assumptions for deriving causal inferences. In particular, qualitative patterns of functional dependence introduce the possibility of graphical methods: Let ℳ=⟨𝐔,𝐕,{fV}V∈𝐕,P⟩ℳ𝐔𝐕subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑉𝑉𝐕𝑃{\\mathcal{M}}=\\big{\\langle}{\\mathbf{U}},{\\mathbf{V}},\\{f_{V}\\}_{V\\in{\\mathbf{V}}},P\\big{\\rangle} be an SCM.\nThen define the causal diagram 𝒢​(ℳ)𝒢ℳ{\\mathcal{G}}({\\mathcal{M}}) of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} as a graph over nodes 𝐕𝐕{\\mathbf{V}},\nwith mixed directed edges →→\\rightarrow and bidirected arcs ⇠⇢⇠absent⇢{\\dashleftarrow\\dashrightarrow}.\nFor any V,V′∈𝐕𝑉superscript𝑉′𝐕V,V^{\\prime}\\in{\\mathbf{V}}, there is a directed edge V→V′→𝑉superscript𝑉′V\\rightarrow V^{\\prime} if V∈𝐏𝐚V′𝑉subscript𝐏𝐚superscript𝑉′V\\in\\mathbf{Pa}_{V^{\\prime}},\nand there is a bidirected edge V⇠⇢V′V{\\dashleftarrow\\dashrightarrow}V^{\\prime} if 𝐔V,𝐔V′⊂𝐔subscript𝐔𝑉subscript𝐔superscript𝑉′𝐔{\\mathbf{U}}_{V},{\\mathbf{U}}_{V^{\\prime}}\\subset{\\mathbf{U}} are correlated under P𝑃P (including if 𝐔V∩𝐔V′≠∅subscript𝐔𝑉subscript𝐔superscript𝑉′{\\mathbf{U}}_{V}\\cap{\\mathbf{U}}_{V^{\\prime}}\\neq\\varnothing). Letting 𝔐​(𝒢)𝔐𝒢\\mathfrak{M}({\\mathcal{G}}) be the set of SCMs with diagram 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}}, we have 𝔐​(𝒢)⊂𝔐uniq𝔐𝒢subscript𝔐uniq\\mathfrak{M}({\\mathcal{G}})\\subset\\mathfrak{M}_{\\mathrm{uniq}} provided the directed edges in 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} form a dag (see Lem. 3). We thus assume this acyclicity of any 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}}.\nWhen interpreting over an SCM, we include every possible potential outcome in ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}.\nJust as we earlier encoded assumptions about the potential outcomes of an RCM into ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}, we may do the same for SCMs regarding their graphs.\nA first observation is that Def. 11 translates axiom C6 of  to ProbRec of [ref]14, thus rederiving the system AX3subscriptAX3\\textsf{AX}_{3} for the class of all acyclic SCMs, i.e. ⋃𝒢𝔐​(𝒢)subscript𝒢𝔐𝒢\\bigcup_{\\mathcal{G}}\\mathfrak{M}({\\mathcal{G}}), from the latter.\nWe now encode the content of (the assumption of having) a particular diagram 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} into ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}.\nLet 𝐏𝐚V𝒢={V′∈𝐕:V′→V∈𝒢}superscriptsubscript𝐏𝐚𝑉𝒢conditional-setsuperscript𝑉′𝐕→superscript𝑉′𝑉𝒢\\mathbf{Pa}_{V}^{\\mathcal{G}}=\\{V^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbf{V}:V^{\\prime}\\to V\\in{\\mathcal{G}}\\} be the directed parents in a graph 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} of a vertex V𝑉V.\nWe encode by way of two schemas, encapsulating what some  have called “the two fundamental laws of causal inference”: Let the exclusion restriction schema ER𝒢superscriptER𝒢\\textsf{ER}^{{\\mathcal{G}}} be the ℒbasesubscriptℒbase\\mathcal{L}_{\\textnormal{base}} principle y𝐚↔y𝐩↔subscript𝑦𝐚subscript𝑦𝐩y_{\\mathbf{a}}\\leftrightarrow y_{\\mathbf{p}},\nfor all variables Y∈𝐕𝑌𝐕Y\\in\\mathbf{V} and sets of variables 𝐀⊃𝐏𝐚V𝒢superscriptsubscript𝐏𝐚𝑉𝒢𝐀\\mathbf{A}\\supset\\mathbf{Pa}_{V}^{\\mathcal{G}},\nwhere y∈Val​(Y)𝑦Val𝑌y\\in\\mathrm{Val}(Y), 𝐚∈Val​(𝐀)𝐚Val𝐀\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathrm{Val}(\\mathbf{A}), 𝐩=π𝐏𝐚V𝒢​(𝐚)𝐩subscript𝜋superscriptsubscript𝐏𝐚𝑉𝒢𝐚\\mathbf{p}=\\pi_{\\mathbf{Pa}_{V}^{\\mathcal{G}}}(\\mathbf{a}).\nLet the counterfactual independence schema cf-sep𝒢superscriptcf-sep𝒢\\textsf{cf-sep}^{\\mathcal{G}} be, for all pairs of variable sets {Yi}1≤i≤n,{Yj′}1≤j≤n′⊂𝐕subscriptsubscript𝑌𝑖1𝑖𝑛subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑌′𝑗1𝑗superscript𝑛′𝐕\\{Y_{i}\\}_{1\\leq i\\leq n},\\{Y^{\\prime}_{j}\\}_{1\\leq j\\leq n^{\\prime}}\\subset\\mathbf{V} such that there are no Yi,Yj′subscript𝑌𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑌′𝑗Y_{i},Y^{\\prime}_{j} for which Yi=Yj′subscript𝑌𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑌′𝑗Y_{i}=Y^{\\prime}_{j} or Yi⇠⇢Yj′Y_{i}{\\dashleftarrow\\dashrightarrow}Y^{\\prime}_{j} in 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}}, where yi∈Val​(Yi)subscript𝑦𝑖Valsubscript𝑌𝑖y_{i}\\in\\mathrm{Val}(Y_{i}), yj′∈Val​(Yj′)subscriptsuperscript𝑦′𝑗Valsubscriptsuperscript𝑌′𝑗y^{\\prime}_{j}\\in\\mathrm{Val}(Y^{\\prime}_{j}), 𝐩i∈Val​(𝐏𝐚Yi𝒢),𝐩j′∈Val​(𝐏𝐚Yj′𝒢)formulae-sequencesubscript𝐩𝑖Valsubscriptsuperscript𝐏𝐚𝒢subscript𝑌𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝐩′𝑗Valsubscriptsuperscript𝐏𝐚𝒢subscriptsuperscript𝑌′𝑗\\mathbf{p}_{i}\\in\\mathrm{Val}(\\mathbf{Pa}^{\\mathcal{G}}_{Y_{i}}),\\mathbf{p}^{\\prime}_{j}\\in\\mathrm{Val}(\\mathbf{Pa}^{\\mathcal{G}}_{Y^{\\prime}_{j}}) for each Yisubscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i}, Yj′subscriptsuperscript𝑌′𝑗Y^{\\prime}_{j}.\nThen the translation of 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} is the combination of axioms T​(𝒢)=T​(ER𝒢)+cf-sep𝒢T𝒢TsuperscriptER𝒢superscriptcf-sep𝒢\\mathrm{T}({\\mathcal{G}})=\\mathrm{T}(\\textsf{ER}^{\\mathcal{G}})+\\textsf{cf-sep}^{\\mathcal{G}}. Note that while Ex. 3 in no way relies on graphs, if we accept a 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} where Z↛Y↛𝑍𝑌Z\\not\\rightarrow Y, then ER𝒢superscriptER𝒢\\textsf{ER}^{\\mathcal{G}} yields yx↔yz​x↔yz′​x↔subscript𝑦𝑥subscript𝑦𝑧𝑥↔subscript𝑦superscript𝑧′𝑥y_{x}\\leftrightarrow y_{zx}\\leftrightarrow y_{z^{\\prime}x} without further ado. Importantly, however, T​(​6​)Titalic-(6italic-)\\mathrm{T}\\eqref{eq:pomonotonicity} is not valid over 𝔐​(𝒢)𝔐𝒢\\mathfrak{M}({\\mathcal{G}}) for any 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} containing the edge Z→X→𝑍𝑋Z\\rightarrow X, revealing an extra-graphical provenance.\nOn the other hand, cf-sep is inexpressible in ℒbasesubscriptℒbase\\mathcal{L}_{\\textnormal{base}}—inferentially, the two approaches are incomparable. A long-standing question has been whether exclusion restriction and independence axioms together could be complete,\nin that they capture all the inferential content of a given causal diagram 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} (see, e.g.,   ). Answering such questions can help with the development of tractable inference methods.\nPartial completeness results for limited queries are known , and the method from Tian  supplies an algorithm that is complete with respect to all equality constraints .\nPlacing no limitations on queries beyond their expressibility in ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}—and thus including inequality constraints as well—but making certain restrictions on 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}}, we answer this question in the affirmative: For any acyclic diagram 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}}, axioms T​(𝒢)+SCMT𝒢SCM\\mathrm{T}({\\mathcal{G}})+\\textsf{SCM} are sound for ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} over 𝔐​(𝒢)𝔐𝒢\\mathfrak{M}({\\mathcal{G}}),\nand also complete if the bidirected arcs in 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} form a disjoint union of complete graphs. Often the famous d-separation conditional independence criterion (Def. 18) is used in place of our cf-sep. Since all instances of the latter are instances of the former, our Thm. 3 is stronger (see Cor. 3).\nThis completeness result implies that for such a 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}}, any known graphical conclusions—including d​o𝑑𝑜do-calculus, identifiability results, and bounds—can be rederived in our calculus, e.g.: We derive the Verma constraint   over the graph 𝒢𝒢{\\mathcal{G}} of Fig. 2a that ∑w𝐏​(y∣z,w,x)​𝐏​(w∣x)subscript𝑤𝐏conditional𝑦𝑧𝑤𝑥𝐏conditional𝑤𝑥\\sum_{w}\\mathbf{P}(y\\mid z,w,x)\\mathbf{P}(w\\mid x) does not depend functionally on x𝑥x: To summarize, for a wide class of cases, Thm. 3 tells us that the two principles encoded in T​(𝒢)T𝒢\\mathrm{T}(\\mathcal{G}) exhaust the types of algebraic statements that a researcher is committed to when venturing a graphical assumption. Putting this in algebraic terms facilitates a perspective on such assumptions that can be naturally interpreted with respect to RCMs, independent of any representation by an SCM.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: assumptions about the potential outcomes of an RCM into ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}, we may do the same for SCMs regarding their graphs.\nA first observation is that Def. 11 translates axiom C6 of  to ProbRec of [ref]14, thus rederiving the system AX3subscriptAX3\\textsf{AX}_{3} for the class of all acyclic SCMs, i.e. ⋃𝒢𝔐​(𝒢)subscript𝒢𝔐𝒢\\bigcup_{\\mathcal{G}}\\mathfrak{M}({\\mathcal{G}}), from the latter.\nWe now\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
