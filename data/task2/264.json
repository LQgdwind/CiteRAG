      "content": "Paper Title: Bodies at Rest: 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation from a Pressure Image using Synthetic Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCNN - Convolutional Neural Network. Our CNN architecture, depicted in Fig. 14, is similar to that of Clever et al. [ref]14, and uses the same kernel sizes, layers, and dropout. The first layer is a convolutional layer with a 7x7 kernel, and uses a stride of 2 and zero padding of size 3 on the sides of input images. The max pooling layer has a stride of 2 and padding of 0. All other convolutional layers are 3x3 with a stride of 1 and padding of 0. We use 192 channels in the first two convolutional layers and in the max pooling layer, and 384 channels in the last two convolutional layers. This CNN also differs from [ref]14 in that we use tanh activation functions instead of ReLU. Through informal testing on smaller data sizes (e.g. 46K images), we observed that networks with tanh activations had less overfitting. We normalize the input and output of the network. To normalize the input channels, divide by the sum of taxels for each input image, 𝚺Isubscript𝚺𝐼\\bm{\\Sigma}_{I}. To normalize the output, we multiply it by the range of shape, pose, and posture parameters from the synthetic training dataset. We compute the range from the lower and upper limits,𝚿Lsubscript𝚿𝐿\\bm{\\Psi}_{L} and 𝚿Usubscript𝚿𝑈\\bm{\\Psi}_{U}, of all parameters in the training dataset. For joint angle limits (i.e. pose), we use values from [ref]52  . For body shape, we use sampling bounds [−3,3]33[-3,3] from . For global rotation, we use our sampling bounds for roll and yaw of [−π,π]𝜋𝜋[-\\pi,\\pi] and [−π6,π6]𝜋6𝜋6[-{\\pi\\over 6},{\\pi\\over 6}], and for global translation, we use the size of the bed. SMPL - Human Mesh Reconstruction. Following the CNN, we use the human model generative part of the HMR network , which inputs estimated shape, pose, and posture 𝚿^bold-^𝚿\\bm{\\hat{\\Psi}}, and outputs a differentiable human mesh reconstruction 𝑽^bold-^𝑽\\bm{\\hat{V}}, as well as a set of N=24𝑁24N=24 Cartesian joint positions 𝑺^bold-^𝑺\\bm{\\hat{S}}. This generative SMPL model, implemented in PyTorch , along with our modifications, is presented in Fig. 15. In addition to using the generative kinematic SMPL embedding part of the full HMR network, our implementation constrains the input parameters to keep angles within human limits and body shape parameters inside our initial sampling range. To constrain the input parameters, we normalize the parameters to a range [−1,1]11[-1,1] based on the limits 𝚿Lsubscript𝚿𝐿\\bm{\\Psi}_{L}, 𝚿Usubscript𝚿𝑈\\bm{\\Psi}_{U}, and use a tanh function for a soft limit that is more amenable to gradient descent. Then, we perform a reverse normalization to scale back up. To prevent the tanh from clipping feasible values at the angle limits, for example a straight knee that is at 0 degrees, we inflate the angle range by a factor α=1.2𝛼1.2\\alpha=1.2 as shown in the figure. PMR - Pressure Map Reconstruction.\nPMR, a novel component of PressureNet, takes as input a human mesh in global space 𝑽^bold-^𝑽\\bm{\\hat{V}}, and outputs a set of reconstructed spatial maps {𝒬^,𝒞^O}^𝒬subscript^𝒞𝑂\\{\\widehat{\\mathcal{Q}},\\widehat{\\mathcal{C}}_{O}\\}, which resemble a real pressure image and indicate where contact occurs between the estimated mesh and the bed. We reconstruct these maps differentiably as depicted in Fig. 16, meaning that we can backpropagate gradients through PMR to train the CNN. The PMR loss is based on the error between estimated spatial maps {𝒬^,𝒞^O}^𝒬subscript^𝒞𝑂\\{\\widehat{\\mathcal{Q}},\\widehat{\\mathcal{C}}_{O}\\} and ground truth spatial maps {𝒬,𝒞O}𝒬subscript𝒞𝑂\\{\\mathcal{Q},\\mathcal{C}_{O}\\}. PMR works by projecting the mesh onto the surface of the bed and computing the distance that it sinks into the bed over each taxel. This amounts to finding the distance between the lowest vertex within the 2.9×2.92.92.92.9\\times 2.9 cm area of each taxel and the undeformed height of the bed. The PMR input 𝑽^bold-^𝑽\\bm{\\hat{V}} is in units of meters, which we convert to units of taxels (1​ m∼35​ taxelssimilar-to1 m35 taxels1\\text{ m}\\sim 35\\text{ taxels}), so it can be indexed on the scale of the pressure image. We then use a process involving sorting, filtering, and patching to recreate the spatial maps, which is detailed in Fig. 16.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: CNN - Convolutional Neural Network.
