Many recent works have shown that leveraging pre-trained networks trained on large datasets can be effective in the extreme low-data regime.\nFor instance, TGAN  argues that fine-tuning a network from a large source network can lead to effective results in few-shot setting.\nFreezeD  fine-tunes a pre-trained GAN by freezing the earlier layers of the discriminator.\nBSA  fine-tunes the pre-trained network by adapting batch statistics, while EWC [ref]29 uses the Fisher information matrix to prevent changes in important weights.\nCDC  preserves pairwise distances among generated samples, and RSSA  utilizes a self-correlation matrix for structural consistency.\nDCL  maximizes mutual information using contrastive loss . Recent work, AdAM , adopts a modulation-based approach in few-shot image generation, splitting the weights into modulated and fine-tuned components to generate appropriate images in large domain gaps.\nMotivated by AdAM, our proposed approach also employs a modulation-based approach.\nUnlike AdAM, our method shows no forgetting in lifelong few-shot image generation and exhibits superior generation quality and diversity.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Recently, there has been significant progress in few-shot classification tasks  [ref]4 [ref]3 .\nThis has led to a great interest in few-shot image generation, both in conditional and unconditional settings.\nThe goal of few-shot image generation task is to generate realistic and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
