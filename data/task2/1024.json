      "content": "Paper Title: Encoder-decoder semantic segmentation models for electroluminescence images of thin-film photovoltaic modules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn photovoltaics automated image analysis methods aim to solve\ndifferent tasks. Although very different aims are pursued, there are\nsome common methods applied. For this reason we briefly review related\nworks on image analysis which can be roughly categorized as follows;\ndetecting and locating defects and other structures of interest,\nforecasting module performance, and image collection itself. Most work on locating and identifying structures of interest revolves\naround cracks in crystalline silicon solar modules.\n ,\n   used\na pipeline consisting of an anisotropic diffusion and certain shape\nanalysis algorithms to localise cracks in EL images.   consider image\nrepresentation in the Fourier domain to identify position of cracks,\nbreaks and finger interruptions. There the Fourier transformed image\nis filtered by setting high-frequency coefficients associated with\nlines artifacts to zero. Then the defects are identified by comparing\nthe original image and the high-pass filtered image. Due to the\nassumptions on the shape of the defect, the method has difficulties\ndetecting defects of more complex shapes.   introduce a\nsupervised learning method for defect identification that uses\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA). Manually selected defect-free\nsolar cell subimages are used to find a set of independent basis\nimages with an independent component analysis (ICA), that are\nconsequently used in a cosine distance to determine presence of a\ndefect in a test sample image. Some works focus on an automatic visual inspection of very specific\nparts of a PV module.  \nproposed a machine vision algorithm to examine electrical\ncontacts. Whereas \n describe a method for an automatic detection\nof finger interruptions via binary clustering. Infrared imaging is mostly used to detect hot-spots. As IR imaging\nprovides fairly direct information on the local surface temperature of\na module, relatively simple image processing algorithms can be used.\n  uses\nwatershed transform algorithm to identify the hot-spots.\n , and\n  use\nclustering algorithms to segment IR\nimage and identify hotspots.  developed a\nthresholding method for hot spot detection . There are several research directions that have been established in\norder to build models that forecast electrical characteristics from\nimages. 9 9 uses a\nphysical model to calculate the operating voltage of individual\ncrystalline solar cells by EL imaging. More recent works do not rely on a particular physical model and train a\nmachine learning method to extract the required information from the\ndata.  \nproposed a system for forecasting power loss, localisation and type of\nsoiling from RGB images of solar modules. Their approach uses deep\nneural network architectures similar to ones we use in this paper.   train an\nSVM classifier based on the extracted feature descriptors (SURF, KAZE,\nFAST), and a VGG-net based neural network in order to identify\ndefective cells that have an impact on power reduction of the whole\nmodule.   proposes a\nConvolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture to forecast IV\ncharacteristics from a PL image as a production process control\nprocedure. When it comes to an application of these automatic methods to the real\ndata, several practical problems arise. It is often the case that\nimages taken in field conditions suffer from various distortions due\nto the position of a module in front of a camera, lens distortions,\nblurring due to wind and shocks. Such distortions introduce\ncomplications in automatic image processing. Therefore, a certain\namount of work has been done in the direction of EL image\npreprocessing analysis methods  [ref]5 . The preprocessing steps are important for IR images as\nwell. 1\n1 use the grey-level co-occurrence matrix\nto identify the location of the solar panels in IR images of the\noperating photovoltaic plants.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: and shocks.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
