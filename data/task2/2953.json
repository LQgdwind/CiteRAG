Computational problems of interest with time series data include pattern discovery , regression/prediction , forecasting , and clustering    which arises in applications such as anomaly detection .\nThough clustering is a central and well-studied problem in unsupervised learning,\nmost standard treatments of clustering tend to be on static data with one observation per entity [ref]35 .\nTime series clustering introduces a number of additional challenges and is an active area of research, with many types of clustering methods proposed ; direct methods on raw data, indirect methods based on features generated from the raw data, and model based clustering where the data are assumed to be generated from a model.\nFor surveys of time series clustering, see  . We focus on model-based time series clustering using a likelihood framework that naturally extends clustering with static data  to time series data , where each multivariate time series is generated by one of k𝑘k different parametrically specified\nmodels.\nFor a survey of the importance of this sub-literature and its various real-world applications, see .\nA prevalent approach is to assume a finite mixture of data generating models, with Gaussian mixture models being a common specification  .\nRoughly, the problem is to partition 𝒳𝒳{\\mathcal{X}} probabilistically into k𝑘k clusters, grouping those series generated by the same time series model into one cluster.\nGenerically, the model-based k𝑘k-clustering problem can be formulated as: arg⁡maxα,θ(1),…,θ(k)​∑i∈[N]ln​∑l∈[k]αl⋅pi​(𝒳|θ(l))subscript𝛼superscript𝜃1…superscript𝜃𝑘subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑁subscript𝑙delimited-[]𝑘⋅subscript𝛼𝑙subscript𝑝𝑖conditional𝒳superscript𝜃𝑙\\arg\\max_{\\alpha,\\theta^{(1)},\\ldots,\\theta^{(k)}}\\sum_{i\\in[N]}\\ln\\sum_{l\\in[k]}\\alpha_{l}\\cdot p_{i}({\\cal{X}}|\\theta^{(l)}), where αlsubscript𝛼𝑙\\alpha_{l} is the probability of a time series belonging to cluster l𝑙l and pi​(𝒳|θ(l))subscript𝑝𝑖conditional𝒳superscript𝜃𝑙p_{i}({\\cal{X}}|\\theta^{(l)}) is the likelihood of the data of entity i𝑖i, given that the data is generated from model l𝑙l (with parameters θ(l)superscript𝜃𝑙\\theta^{(l)}).\nTemporal relationships in time series are commonly modeled as autocorrelations (AR)/moving averages (MA) 0  that account for correlations across observations, and hidden Markov models (HMM) where the underlying data generating process is allowed to switch periodically 1 .\nThis paper focuses on the\ncase when the data generation model for each segment l∈[k]𝑙delimited-[]𝑘l\\in[k] is a multivariate Gaussian with autocorrelations.\nMore formally, the generative model for each cluster is from a Gaussian mixture: xi​t:=μ(l)+ei​tassignsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑡superscript𝜇𝑙subscript𝑒𝑖𝑡x_{it}:=\\mu^{(l)}+e_{it}, where ei​t=N​(0,Σ(l))+Λ(l)​ei,t−1subscript𝑒𝑖𝑡𝑁0superscriptΣ𝑙superscriptΛ𝑙subscript𝑒𝑖𝑡1e_{it}=N(0,\\Sigma^{(l)})+\\Lambda^{(l)}e_{i,t-1}, where N​(0,Σ(l))𝑁0superscriptΣ𝑙N(0,\\Sigma^{(l)}) captures the mixture of Gaussian distributions from which entity level observations are drawn, and ΛΛ\\Lambda captures the correlation between two successive observations through an AR(1) process   .\nOverall, this model can be represented with cluster level model parameters θ(l)={μ(l),Σ(l),Λ(l)}superscript𝜃𝑙superscript𝜇𝑙superscriptΣ𝑙superscriptΛ𝑙\\theta^{(l)}=\\{\\mu^{(l)},\\Sigma^{(l)},\\Lambda^{(l)}\\} and cluster probability αlsubscript𝛼𝑙\\alpha_{l}. Time series datasets are also much larger than static datasets .\nFor instance, as noted in , ECG (electrocardiogram) data requires 1 GB/hour, a typical weblog requires 5 GB/week.\nSuch large sizes lead to high storage costs and also make it necessary to work with a subset of the data to conduct the clustering analysis to be computationally practical. Further, long time series data on entities also entails significant data security and privacy risks around the entity as it requires longer histories of entity behaviors to be stored and maintained 5 .\nThus, there is significant value for techniques that can produce approximately similar clustering results with smaller samples as with complete data. Coresets have emerged as an effective tool to both speed up and reduce data storage by taking into account the objective and carefully sampling from the full dataset in a way that any algorithm run on the sampled set returns an approximate solution for the original objective with guaranteed bounds on approximation error .\nCoresets have been developed for both unsupervised clustering (e.g., k𝑘k-means, Gaussian mixture models) and supervised machine learning (e.g., regression) methods for static data; for surveys on coresets for static data, see  2.\nA natural question is whether coresets can be also useful for addressing the time series clustering problem.\nRecently, there is evidence that small coresets can be efficiently constructed for time series data, albeit for regressions with time series (panel) data [ref]37.\nHowever, as we explain in Section 2, there are challenges in extending coresets for static data clustering and time series (panel) data regressions for time series clustering.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of time periods corresponding to entity i𝑖i and d𝑑d is the number of features, tracks features of a cross-section of entities longitudinally over time.\nSuch data\nis also referred to as panel data [ref]8 and\nhas seen rapid growth due to proliferation of sensors, IOT and wearables\nthat facilitate real time measurement of various features associated with entities and the rapid drop in storage\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
