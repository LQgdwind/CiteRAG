      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Self-Supervised Barlow Twins from Limited Tissue Slide Cohorts for Colonic Pathology Diagnostics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputational Pathology (CPath) is an innovative field at the intersection of pathology and computer science. It aims to successfully create a framework of digital diagnostics that helps extract meaningful representations from the raw data in the oncology domain. Leveraging tools such as Deep Learning (DL), CPath enhances histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) analysis and provides valuable diagnosis insights . CPath is expected to integrate easily with existing diagnostic workflows, improving diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and disease detection and grading efficiency . The recent advancements in DL methods in CPath have led to enhanced performance, but new challenges have emerged. DL methods in CPath often require large amounts of annotated data. However, annotating data is a time-consuming and expensive task that requires the expertise of pathologists with years of extensive clinical experience. This leads to a scarcity of publicly available, detailed annotated datasets and the need to leverage these limited annotations to train accurate models. As digital pathology expands worldwide, identifying methods less dependent on costly annotations becomes critical. To exploit large unlabeled or weakly annotated datasets, it is crucial to capitalize on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), which trains on large amounts of unlabeled data and can outperform supervised pre-training . Additionally, recent works have shown that SSL pre-training on pathology data can improve performance on downstream pathology tasks [ref]2. This paper focuses on addressing DL challenges in CPath to classify colorectal polyps and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC stands as one of the most prevalent causes of cancer-related mortality, but it is also one of the most preventable cancers. However, bottlenecks in patient screening schedules due to a shortage of pathologists induce delayed diagnoses . Therefore, integrating CPath into clinical workflows could enhance diagnosis and lead to rapid care, increasing survival as deadly diseases, notably cancer, are detected precisely and efficiently. Hence, developing efficient SSL screening tools for accurately classifying colorectal polyps is crucial for effective CRC screening . Integrated into Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer screening, CPath has shown excellent diagnosis accuracy, on par with board-certified pathologists. With the need for precise cancer grading for treatment personalization, DL is now a cornerstone of the fight against cancer and has achieved high Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores above 0.98. Additionally, it was shown that the deepest models obtain the highest performance due to their superior generalization capabilities  . However, such models require more extensive training data . Pathology images are highly specific as they have neither canonical orientations nor high colour variations. The Field of View (FoV) of the patches used for model training is also significant, as different FoV convey varying contextual information [ref]2. Despite advancements in GI and CRC screening, current methods do not adequately study the appropriate FoV for CRC screening. Additionally, they lack a thorough comparison of features learned through supervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches. Furthermore, a more comprehensive analysis is needed on how self-supervised learning methods, originally developed for natural images, can be adapted to the unique characteristics of pathological data, particularly through data augmentation techniques. The future of CPath relies on SSL and its adaptation to the pathology dataâ€™s specific characteristics. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the Barlow Twins  framework and propose to optimize this SSL framework for feature embedding from colorectal polyps for CRC screening. Our study yields several contributions: we propose (1) an enhanced Barlow Twins framework for pathology data by adapting the hyperparameters, augmentation strategy and pretraining strategy, (2) an evaluation of Barlow Twins representations on the patch and slide level introducing this SSL method in a MIL framework, (3) an investigation on the best FoV for CRC screening, (4) quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the SSL and supervised features, and (5) a new benchmark dataset for CRC screening after transferring the weights from our private dataset to MHIST and NCT-CRC-7k   0. Code and pre-trained model weights (in PyTorch) are available at https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/PathBT for further contributions to the research community. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work and discusses the existing approaches to self-supervised learning in CPath. Section 3 describes the proposed methodology, detailing the patch dataset curation and the different techniques used. Section 4 presents the experimental results and analyzes the qualitative and quantitative performance of the proposed methods, including heatmap and UMAP examination. In Section 5, we discuss the implications of our findings and suggest potential directions for future research.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: of unlabeled data and can outperform supervised pre-training .
