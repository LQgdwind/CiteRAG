This literature has explored a wide variety of risk measures, ranging from collision probabilities  used as chance constraints [ref]18, to entropic risk . Interestingly,  took a hybrid approach, coupling deep learning for pedestrian motion prediction with nonlinear MPC,\narguing that only such a hybrid approach allows a robot’s risk-metric parameters to be changed at run-time, unlike approaches relying on RL. To the contrary, the results of our paper demonstrate that such run-time parameter-tuning is straightforward for deep RL. While  recently argued that coherent risk measures are well-suited to robotics, and we use coherent risk measures in this paper,\nthe only work that we are aware of that uses a coherent risk-metric coupled with MPC for robot navigation is , which extends its authors’ previous work , in which risk measures were applied to inventory control.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: there is a vast literature on classical model-predictive-control (MPC) and graph-search approaches.\nThis literature considers diverse sources of risk, ranging from simple sensor noise and occlusion  [ref]14, to\nuncertainty about the traversability of the edges (e.g. doors) of a navigation graph , and the unpredictability of pedestrian movements [ref]16.
