      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Grained Complexity and Algorithms for the Schulze Voting MethodA previous version of this work appears in EC 2021 [44]. In this version we strengthen Theorem 6.2 which now holds also for the problem of finding a Schulze winner.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe study computational aspects of the Schulze method111The method appears under different names such as Beatpath Method/Winner, Path Voting, (Cloneproof) Schwartz Sequential Dropping—see discussion in .,\na single-winner voting rule defined on (weak) ordinal preference ballots.\nThe method was introduced by Markus Schulze   and has been extensively researched over the years—see, e.g., a survey by Schulze . The Schulze voting method definition uses a representation of the votes called the weighted majority graph, a graph whose vertices are the candidates and whose directed weighted edges roughly capture all pairwise comparisons between candidates (see a formal definition in Section 2).\nThe Schulze method computes, in the weighted majority graph, for every pair of candidates u𝑢u and v𝑣v the smallest weight B​(u,v)𝐵𝑢𝑣B(u,v) of an edge on a widest path between u𝑢u and v𝑣v.\nHere a widest path is a u𝑢u-v𝑣v path whose minimum edge weight is maximized over all u𝑢u-v𝑣v paths.\nThen, a Schulze winner is any candidate u𝑢u s.t. for all other candidates v𝑣v, B​(u,v)≥B​(v,u)𝐵𝑢𝑣𝐵𝑣𝑢B(u,v)\\geq B(v,u).\nA Schulze winner always exists , though it may not be unique.\nThe method can be used to provide a (weak) order over alternatives, and hence can be seen as a preference aggregation method or multi-winner voting rule (taking the top candidates in the ranking as winners). Schulze defined this method by modifying the Minimax Condorcet method222\nAlso referred to as the Minimax method and the Simpson-Kramer method .\nto address several criticisms of the Minimax Condorcet method   .\nSchulze’s modified method is Condorcet consistent, i.e., a candidate who is preferred by a majority over every other candidate in pairwise comparisons (a Condorcet winner) is a winner in the Schulze method.\nSchulze’s modification results in satisfying a desired set of axiomatic properties not satisfied by Minimax Condorcet: clone independence: This criterion proposed by Tideman \nrequires that a single-winner voting rule should be independent of introducing similar candidates (see also, e.g.,  [ref]8 ). reversal symmetry: This criterion proposed by Saari  means that if candidate v𝑣v is the unique winner, then v𝑣v must not be a winner in an election with all the preference orders inverted. Smith criterion: The Smith set is the smallest non-empty subset of candidates who (strictly) win pairwise comparison with every candidate not in the subset.\nThe Smith criterion is satisfied when the set of winners is a subset of the Smith set . The Schulze method is a voting rule used broadly in many organizations, e.g.,\nthe Wikimedia Foundation333The Wikimedia Foundation elections to the Board of Trustees (2011), https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/Board_elections/2011/en, [Online; accessed 23-June-2021].,\nDebian Project444Constitution for the Debian Project (v1.7), https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution.en.html, [Online; accessed 23-June-2021]. and, e.g,\nin the software LiquidFeedback [ref]8 (see also a comprehensive list of users in [41, Section 1]). In this paper we focus on computational aspects of the Schulze method.\nIn particular: 1) constructing a weighted majority graph; 2) checking whether a particular candidate is a winner; 3) finding a winner; 4) listing all winners. Indicating a winner or a set of all winners is the main goal of a voting rule (tasks 3 and 4 above).\nThe definition of the Schulze method consists of two steps that can be studied separately—task 1 above is the first of the two steps; it is useful for other voting rules as well.\nThe decision version of the problem (task 2) is useful when considering the computational complexity of the problem , or when considering bribery, manipulation and control issues     where one needs to verify whether a particular candidate would become a winner or non-winner. Given a weighted majority graph, the most general task is to create a (weak) order over the alternatives (as a preference aggregation method).\nThe best known algorithm for this task, and also for tasks 3 and 4 above, has a running time of 𝒪​(m2.69)𝒪superscript𝑚2.69\\mathcal{O}(m^{2.69}) in terms of the number of candidates m𝑚m (see, e.g., ).\nThis algorithm relies on fast matrix multiplication techniques that can be impractical.\nThe fastest algorithm without fast matrix multiplication (i.e. combinatorial) has cubic running time .\nWhile the running time is polynomial, for large-scale data this running time can be too slow.\nTo overcome this issue, parallel algorithms for the Schulze method were proposed, and it turns out that some tasks of the method have efficient parallel solutions (e.g. checking if a candidate is a winner subject to the Schulze method is in NL ). It is an interesting open question whether one can beat the known running time in the sequential setting, in particular without using fast matrix multiplication techniques.\nIt is interesting how fast one can find all winners when the weighted majority graph is given, and whether the majority graph itself can be computed efficiently.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: by Minimax Condorcet: clone independence: This criterion proposed by Tideman \nrequires that a single-winner voting rule should be independent of introducing similar candidates (see also, e.g.,  [ref]8 ). reversal symmetry: This criterion proposed by Saari  means that if candidate v𝑣v is the unique winner, then v𝑣v must not be a winner in an election with all the preference orders inverted.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
