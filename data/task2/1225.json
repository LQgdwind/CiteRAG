      "content": "Paper Title: An Improved Transfer Model: Randomized Transferable Machine\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFeature-based transfer learning methods have been widely studied in the last decade.\nThe underlying intuition is that there exists a domain-invariant feature representation across domains.\nOne typical way of learning domain-invariant feature representation is by constructing subspace.\nIn , Pan et al. propose to learn the transfer component of different domains by minimizing the marginal distribution discrepancies measured by MMD.\nTo model the domain shift dynamically, Gong et al.  propose to generate an\ninfinite number of intermediate subspaces that lie between the source and target domains along the geodesic flow on a Grassmann manifold.\nIn order to alleviate the computational issue of , Fernando et al. develop a subspace alignment method  that directly aligns the subspaces of different domains.\nFollowing studies consider diverse data properties in transfer.\nLong et al.  not only align the marginal distributions of different domains, but also align the conditional ones by using pseudo target labels.\nThey further propose a transfer joint matching  method that jointly matches feature distributions and reweights instances.\nSun et al.  consider the second-order statistics to align domains.\nAiming at benefiting from both the geometric property and the statistical property of data, Zhang et al.  propose a joint geometrical and statistical alignment for visual domain adaptation.\nMost recently, Wei et al.  propose to learn shared feature representations based on a multiple manifolds assumption. With the development of deep neural networks, deep feature learning based transfer method is attracting increasing interests.\nChen et al. [ref]23 propose a marginalized stacked denoising autoencoder to learn deep features by reconstructing the randomly corrupted data.\nDeep nonlinear feature coding  further boosts the transfer performance of [ref]23 by considering the explicit feature alignment and the nonlinearity exploration.\nLong et al. [ref]24 develop a deep adaptation network (DAN) to learn transferable features.\nMultiple kernelized MMD is adopted to reduce domain discrepancies in the last three layers of DAN.\nInstead of focusing on the last three layers, a joint adaptation network (JDN)  is proposed to minimize the joint distribution of full layers of features through MMD.\nConsidering the class weight bias across domains, Yan et al.  develop a weighted domain adaptation network (WDAN), which improves the transfer performance of DAN.\nApart from using MMD as distance metric, Ganin et al. [ref]15 propose an adversarial learning based method for transfer.\nIt builds a domain discriminator to confuse the task of classifying domains.\nFollowing [ref]15, Tzeng et al.  propose to combine discriminative modelling, weight sharing, and generative adversarial learning.\nCai et al.  explore semantic representations by the disentanglement.\nA variational auto-encoder to reconstruct semantic latent variables and domain latent variables is proposed.\nAlthough generally more effective than subspace-based methods, many deep transfer learning methods are actually motivated from subspace-based methods, e.g., DAN [ref]24 is motivated by TCA .\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: representations based on a multiple manifolds assumption. With the development of deep neural networks, deep feature learning based transfer method is attracting increasing interests.\nChen et al. [ref]23 propose a marginalized stacked denoising autoencoder to learn deep features by reconstructing the randomly corrupted data.\nDeep nonlinear feature coding  further boosts the transfer\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
