      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData is naturally distributed around us, commonly made inert by data protection regulations. Classically, to train machine learning models, data is collected centrally – the data is brought to the model. However, such scenarios where data and compute power can be centralised are not archetypal of most of the world around us – where data and processing infrastructure naturally exist in distributed pockets. This segmentation of data can be observed in many areas of modern life and it is common that the data is immovable between segments due to legislative rules. For example, corporations with data centres spread globally may be prevented from cross-border sharing due to regulation. Alternatively, in the UK’s NHS, which consists of thousands of individual practices, patient information is stored on different systems which are not typically interconnected. Segmentation also arises at in personal computing where users are not willing to share their personal data with third parties. These examples only scratch the surface of the possible distributed data scenarios and motivates the idea that many parties could benefit from the application of machine learning and privacy-preserving knowledge-sharing across the different segments, instead of taking the data to the model. \n Federated Learning was proposed in the seminal paper by B. McMahan from Google in 2017[ref]2. It presents the original approach for FL, FedAvg, and offers a privacy-preserving solution to the problem above, whilst being competitive in performance with its centralised counterparts in a set of typical machine learning tasks. Since its inception, FL has been deployed into a wide range of applications with cross-device implementations such as with Google’s GBoard ; it is also rumoured, to be used in detecting the wake-up phrase, ‘Hey Siri’ for Apple’s voice agent. The effectiveness of cross-silo scenarios have also been demonstrated, such as in a case where a small number of UK hospitals collected data and trained a model using FL to screen for Covid-19. \n In recent, general-FL literature, fairness is repeatedly recognised as one of the key open problems. A 2021 review by P. Kairouz and B. McMahan of Google, designates a section to identifying fairness as a key area for future research in FL. Other general surveys, from 2022 and 2023, also draw attention to the potential for heterogeneity to lead to unfairness, motivating further research . Finally, in a talk at the 2024 Flower AI Summit, the Head of Samsung AI Europe, refers to the difficulty managing bias and fairness in FL as “a completely unsolved problem, even in central learning”. For commercial viability of machine learning solutions, compliance with local data protection regulations such as GDPR is essential. As fairness is a core principle of GDPR0, regulation abidance and fairness handling are inherently intertwined. This is threatened by the ’black-box’ nature of many machine learning systems, where outputs are rarely transparent or justified - addressing fairness and explainability are therefore crucial for delivering industry-ready FL solutions. Fairness concerns can arise in scenarios where there are differences between client’s, behaviour, treatment, data or any other characteristic in a system. A thorough definition of fairness in FL is provided later - for now, it can be considered philosophically as equal treatment for all involved. Difference is natural in real-world systems and its effects must be anticipated to appear in many ways; we adopted the definitions of Ye et al. which suggest four flavours of heterogeneity that can impact a system - statistical, model, communication or device centric1. \n Several fairness-specific surveys, published in 2023, offer a general picture of the latest work in the field of FL fairness and evidence the demand for research into how such fairness can be effectively defined and quantified. Each motivates the requirements for fairness, proposes its own set of definitions and discusses the existing frameworks which have been proposed to improve fairness2 3 4. Evidencing scenarios that would benefit from fairer FL frameworks is a strength of the existing literature. For example, FL could be used to process images with the aim of detecting skin cancer, via training a classifier model over a set of globally distributed clients. Clients could range from individuals with single-image datasets, to large hospitals. It is suggested that unfairness may arise if clients achieve different levels of classification accuracy, if the model behaves favourably or unfavourably towards samples with specific characteristics – such as skin colour - or if the system exhibits bias towards certain client’s hardware or network capabilities2. Shi et al. go further, suggesting that it is important for the contribution of the client to be considered in attribution of fairness3. The free-rider problem (also discussed by Rafi et al.4) can emerge if a client does not usefully contribute to the training of the model, but still benefits from the work of other clients when it receives updated global models. This is not a complete description of all the flavours of unfairness that can arise but it demonstrates that fairness in FL is a multi-faceted problem and that mitigation is crucial for real-world systems. It should also be noted, that there is typically a trade-off that must be considered between communication efficiency, privacy, accuracy and fairness4 . \n This work highlights the limitations of the current literature in defining fairness in FL and hence proposes Federated Fairness Analytics, a methodology for quantifying fairness in FL systems. With our modular notions, the fairness performance of existing systems can be evaluated in a repeatable, human-interpretable way – enabling transparency, comparison of different approaches and directed development to improve systems. Quantifying and explaining unfairness is a key, first step towards ensuring future deployments are fair and towards explainable-artificial-intelligence (XAI) in FL. The aim in this work is not to improve fairness, but to offer a platform to interpret and identify unfairness, this entailed: Conceiving succinct, logical definitions for fairness, which are applicable to most typical FL systems. Designing corresponding normalised metrics for quantifying fairness. Developing a framework and pipeline to measure fairness during training and visualise results. Benchmarking and evaluting the fairness performance of Twenty-Four different systems - comparing the effects of differing models and datasets, heterogeneity and FL approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: privacy-preserving knowledge-sharing across the different segments, instead of taking the data to the model. \n Federated Learning was proposed in the seminal paper by B.
