We have also implemented the client and server libraries that interface with applications and storage nodes, respectively, as described in Section 3.\nThe switch data plane is written in P4 and is compiled to the simple software switch BMV2  running on Mininet . The key size of the key-value pair is 16 bytes with total key range spans from 0 to 2128superscript21282^{128}. This range is divided into index records which are saved on the switch data plane. We used 4 register arrays, one for saving the storage nodes’ IP addresses, one for saving the forwarding port of the storage nodes, one for counting the read access requests of the indexing records and the last one for counting the update access requests of the indexing records. The controller is able to update/read the values of these registers through the control plane. It also can add or remove table entries to balance the load of the storage nodes. The switch data plane does not store any key-value pairs as these pairs are saved on the storage nodes. This approach makes TurboKV consumes a small amount of the on-chip memory leaving enough space for processing other network operations. The controller is written in Python and can update the switch data plane through the switch driver by using the Thrift API generated by the P4 compiler. The client and server libraries are written in Python using Scapy  for packet manipulation. The client can translate a generated YCSB [ref]8 workload with different distributions and mixed key-value operations into TurboKV packets’ format and send them through the network. We used Plyvel  which is a Python interface for levelDB  as the storage agent. The server library translates TurboKV packets into Plyvel format and connects to levelDB to perform the key-value pair operations. We used chain replication with chain length equals to 3 for data reliability.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: driver by using the Thrift API generated by the P4 compiler.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
