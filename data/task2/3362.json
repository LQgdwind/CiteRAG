      "content": "Paper Title: CVAE-H: Conditionalizing Variational Autoencoders via Hypernetworks and Trajectory Forecasting for Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAssume a function that takes two inputs X,C𝑋𝐶X,C and outputs Y𝑌Y, i.e., f:(X,C)→Y:𝑓𝑋𝐶→𝑌f\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}(X,C)\\rightarrow Y. Given that f𝑓f is a probabilistic mapping, p​(Y|X,C)𝑝conditional𝑌𝑋𝐶p(Y|X,C) represents a probability distribution of the output Y𝑌Y conditioned on the two inputs. Learning such f𝑓f and the corresponding conditional distribution can be achieved using two different approaches; (1) the embedding and (2) the hypernetwork approach, as depicted in Figure 2. As commonly used in machine learning, the embedding approach is a straightforward way of learning f𝑓f. This approach implies a model that consists of the embedding modules e1​(X)=h​(X)subscript𝑒1𝑋ℎ𝑋e_{1}(X)=h(X) and e2​(C)=h​(C)subscript𝑒2𝐶ℎ𝐶e_{2}(C)=h(C) where the two outputs are concatenated h:=h(X)⊕h(C)h\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}=h(X)\\oplus h(C) and passed to another network f​(h)=Y𝑓ℎ𝑌f(h)=Y. The hypernetwork approach [ref]13 is a less intuitive solution that relies on a hierarchical structure between two models; one called a primary network g𝑔g produces weights of the other separate network f𝑓f. This corresponds to f​(X;θ)=Y𝑓𝑋𝜃𝑌f(X;\\theta)=Y where θ=g​(C)𝜃𝑔𝐶\\theta=g(C). Observe that the embedding approach uses an embedding network e𝑒e and treats C𝐶C equally to X𝑋X as part of the input. On the other hand, the hypernetwork approach models the conditional mapping fC​(X)=Ysubscript𝑓𝐶𝑋𝑌f_{C}(X)=Y, i.e., learning the contributions of X𝑋X to Y𝑌Y via a parameterized function f​(X;θ)𝑓𝑋𝜃f(X;\\theta) where the parameters themselves are the outputs of another network g𝑔g, which is independent of f𝑓f. The ability to effectively learn conditional functions (i.e., model a function that transforms into different functions depending on the condition C𝐶C) corresponding to the property of modularity  is a major benefit of the hypernetwork approach. A recent study showed that hypernetwork exhibits the property of modularity for a large g𝑔g and small f𝑓f and the hypernetwork approach uses much smaller networks compared to the embedding approach to achieve the same performance in modeling conditional distributions . Furthermore, hypernetworks offer excellent generalization capability when it is combined with deep neural networks. This has been demonstrated across diverse tasks in machine learning   [ref]31 [ref]32    . Hypernetwork provides a way to make the unconditional generative models (e.g., vanilla VAE and normalizing flow) conditional without a use of RNN. Hypernetwork is a neural-network that can be modeled using various types of neural networks modules such as CNN, RNN, Residual blocks , and Attention . The flexibility of the hypernetwork allows the generative models to even condition on bigger models such ResNet , BERT , or FPN  by including such models as part of the hypernetwork. In this sense, hypernetworks take diverse types of data including social and spatial data. The effectiveness of the hypernetworks grows with respect to the capacity of its backbone neural network. Upon use of CNN blocks (spatial features) and RNN/Attention modules (social features), the main neural network can become context-driven. This becomes especially useful for the prediction task for autonomous driving. A challenge of the prediction task is that it may involve very large inputs whose dimensions are in the magnitude of millions. This is because the inputs include social features (e.g., labeled states for all road-agents in the vicinity of the AV) and spatial features (e.g., lidar scans, camera images, and/or HD maps) from past to the current moment. Since our prediction model extensively leverages hypernetworks, the high-dimensional information about the driving environment can be effectively encoded and used for contextual prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: where the two outputs are concatenated h:=h(X)⊕h(C)h\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}=h(X)\\oplus h(C) and passed to another network f​(h)=Y𝑓ℎ𝑌f(h)=Y.
