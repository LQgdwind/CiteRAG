      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Memory Relation Network for Workflow Recognition from Surgical Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNote: the ∗∗\\ast means methods of multi-task learning with extra tool labels needed. We compare our proposed method with several well-known or the state-of-the-art approaches for surgical workflow recognition on the two datasets.\nPhaseNet extracts visual features by 9-layer CNN, followed by hierarchical HMM (HHMM) for temporal refinement on the prediction probabilities of whole videos (results quoted from  ).\nSV-RCNet [ref]8 seamlessly integrates 50-layer ResNet and LSTM to jointly learn spatial and temporal features.\nOHFM  also uses 50-layer ResNet to extract features and designs a three-step strategy to alleviate the negative effect of hard samples.\nPredictions of all the previous frames from step-2 classifier are inputted to LSTM for mapping the current hard frame to its correct phase.\nAs Cholec80 dataset simultaneously provides tool presence annotations, the advanced methods on this dataset tend to leverage them to form a multi-tasking paradigm.\nEndoNet  is a 9-layer multi-task CNN and HHMM is also employed for temporal regularization.\nEndoNet+LSTM [ref]38 replaces HHMM by LSTM to enforce the sequential constraints on the visual feature from EndoNet.\nMTRCNet-CL [ref]9 is a multi-task recurrent convolutional network, with a new correlation loss designed to minimize the prediction divergences from phase and tool branches.\nWe implement our TMRNet with 50-layer ResNet  as the backbone following the previous methods  [ref]9 for a fair comparison.\nAlso, we use a more powerful state-of-the-art classification model (ResNeSt)  to establish TMRNet, to investigate how accurate performance can be achieved towards real-world clinical applicability. The results of different methods on M2CAI and Cholec80 datasets are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.\nThe standard deviations show the variation of results on different testing videos.\nWe see that all the other methods including ours outperform PhaseNet, indicating that deeper network with the non-linear temporal modeling of LSTM can extract more discriminative features for accurate workflow recognition.\nWith the same network backbone, OHFM although considers the long-range predictions up to the first frame for current frame recognition, its encoding process of spatial and temporal information is separated in different stages.\nOur TMRNet attains much better performance on both datasets, demonstrating the importance of joint spatio-temporal feature learning for surgical workflow recognition.\nOur TMRNet also outperforms the typical end-to-end training network SV-RCNet, by wisely incorporating longer temporal support.\nTo this end, compared with approaches only using phase label, our method boosts AC of phase recognition from 85.2%percent85.285.2\\% to 86.3%percent86.386.3\\% on M2CAI dataset, and from 87.3%percent87.387.3\\% to 89.2%percent89.289.2\\% on Cholec80 dataset.\nWe also achieve a large gain regarding JA on both datasets (over 5%percent55\\% on M2CAI and 10%percent1010\\% on Cholec80).\nNotably, the accuracy improving scopes of our TMRNet is larger on the Cholec80 dataset than M2CAI. The underlying reason could be that Cholec80 is a larger dataset with more complex and challenging issues, where effectively using long-range support and elaborately analyzing multi-scale compositions are important to recognize such challenging cases. We further compare with the state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods on Cholec80 dataset in Table 2 which requires the extra tool presence labels.\nEndoNet and EndoNet+LSTM perform the separate visual and temporal feature learning.\nAlthough they include additional tool information to do phase recognition, our TMRNet still achieves superior performance.\nBy leveraging high correlation between phase and tool recognition tasks, MTRCNet-CL also achieves high performance of 89.2%percent89.289.2\\% in AC.\nHowever, it utilizes limited temporal information of 10 seconds with the multi-GPU configuration.\nConsidering the longer-range temporal cues from memory bank, our TMRNet demonstrates its efficacy by the improvements on other two essential metrics, i.e., increasing PR from 86.9%percent86.986.9\\% to 89.7%percent89.789.7\\%, RE from 88.0%percent88.088.0\\% to 89.5%percent89.589.5\\%.\nWe also report the performance of our TMRNet with ResNeSt backbone, achieving the consistent improvement on both datasets.\nIt peaks AC performance over 90%percent9090\\% on Cholec80, narrowing gap from clinical usability.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: extracts visual features by 9-layer CNN, followed by hierarchical HMM (HHMM) for temporal refinement on the prediction probabilities of whole videos (results quoted from  ).\nSV-RCNet [ref]8 seamlessly integrates 50-layer ResNet and LSTM to jointly learn spatial and temporal features.\nOHFM  also uses 50-layer ResNet to extract features and designs a three-step strategy to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
