A coarser estimation of ùëªùëª{\\bm{T}} can also be considered in order to initialise tracking by recursion methods or to reduce the search-space in tracking by detection. Generally, global features (e.g.¬†bags of keypoints, shapes, or even raw images) have been preferred for combination with a variety of ML techniques ranging from nearest neighbour search  to unsupervised clustering , principal component analysis [ref]28, Bayesian classification [ref]29, and deep learning [ref]30. The recent prevalence of the latter with respect to the others originated from SPEC in 201920192019. As reported by , the majority of the participating teams used CNNs to directly predict the relative pose of the target in an end-to-end, regressive fashion from each raw image (e.g.¬†). The attitude estimation was noted to be the most challenging, and was improved in approaches which first included a target localisation step (e.g.¬†). However, the best-performing entries, including those who won 111st and 222nd places, followed instead an indirect approach where the role of the CNN was relayed completly towards the prediction of pre-selected keypoints in the image, which were then used with PnùëõnP to recover the pose . After SPEC, published \\glsxtrshortdnn-based work has seldom considered actual rendezvous trajectories , continuing to focus instead on individual greyscale images of SPEED    . In either case, the proposed strategies consist in using a CNN for keypoint detection for use with PnùëõnP. Additionally, the contribution of modalities beyond the visible remains to be fully investigated . Contrary to the above examples, ground-based applications have recently adopted the use of RNNs combined with features extracted by CNN front-ends to model the intrinsic motion dynamics from sequences of imaging data rather than individual inputs  ; more specifically, these proposed \\glsxtrshortlstm-based  DRCNNs for visual odometry (VO) to estimate a car‚Äôs egomotion.  introduced DeepLO, which followed the same philosophy for lidar-based relative navigation with a non-cooperative space target. Lidar data was preprocessed by quantisation and projection onto each plane in the target body frame of reference, thus creating three 2D depth images to be processed by a regular CNN.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: shapes, or even raw images) have been preferred for combination with a variety of ML techniques ranging from nearest neighbour search  to unsupervised clustering , principal component analysis [ref]28, Bayesian classification [ref]29, and deep learning [ref]30.
