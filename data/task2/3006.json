      "content": "Paper Title: Time Discretization-Invariant Safe Action Repetition for Policy Gradient Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinuous-time RL.\nReinforcement learning in continuous-time domains has long been studied with various approaches\n2  [ref]5    .\nBradtke and Duff  extended existing Q-learning and temporal difference methods to semi-MDPs, which can be viewed as a continuous-time generalization of MDPs.\nDoya [ref]5 developed a continuous actor-critic method based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, a continuous-time counterpart of the Bellman equation, approximating policies and value functions with radial basis functions. Time discretization.\nAnother line of research to cope with continuous-time environments is to use finely discretized MDPs. Baird  first informally presented that when δ→0→𝛿0\\delta\\to 0, two different Q values on the same state will eventually collapse to the V value, such that Q​(s,a1)≈Q​(s,a2)≈V​(s)𝑄𝑠subscript𝑎1𝑄𝑠subscript𝑎2𝑉𝑠Q(s,a_{1})\\approx Q(s,a_{2})\\approx V(s), since the influence of each action is vanished by the infinitesimal time scale.\nThey proposed Advantage Updating as a solution to avoid the collapse by appropriately scaling the advantage function A​(s,a)=Q​(s,a)−V​(s)δ𝐴𝑠𝑎𝑄𝑠𝑎𝑉𝑠𝛿A(s,a)=\\frac{Q(s,a)-V(s)}{\\delta}.\nMore recently, Tallec et al. 6 theoretically proved the existence of collapse in low-δ𝛿\\delta settings and extended Advantage Updating for deep neural networks, showing its δ𝛿\\delta-invariance on classic control benchmarks.\nFor PG methods, Munos  first demonstrated that the variance of the policy gradient estimate can be infinite when δ→0→𝛿0\\delta\\rightarrow 0,\nand proposed an algorithm based on pathwise derivatives, in which the variance of the estimator decreases to 0 when δ→0→𝛿0\\delta\\to 0.\nHowever, it assumes that the gradient of the reward function ∇r​(s,a)∇𝑟𝑠𝑎\\nabla r(s,a) is known to the agent.\nWawrzynski 8, Korenkevych et al.  proposed methods based on autocorrelated noise that could prevent the variance explosion.\nNotably, all of these approaches choose an action at every δ𝛿\\delta. However, this makes it infeasible to train when δ𝛿\\delta is nearly zero as the number of decision steps goes to infinity.\nIn our work, we employ durative actions to achieve δ𝛿\\delta-invariance on PG methods,\nwhich could resolve the problem of variance explosion and infinite decision steps. Action repetition.\nOur proposed method is closely related to existing action repetition methods.\nMost works on action repetition let the policy also determine how many times (or how long) an action is repeated.\nDFDQN  doubled the action space by mapping a half of it to actions repeated r1subscript𝑟1r_{1} times and the other half to those repeated r2subscript𝑟2r_{2} times, where r1subscript𝑟1r_{1} and r2subscript𝑟2r_{2} are fixed hyperparameters.\nFiGAR 1 introduced a repetition policy π​(x|s)𝜋conditional𝑥𝑠\\pi(x|s) in addition to the original action policy π​(a|s)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi(a|s) so that the agent repeats the action x𝑥x times,\nwhere x𝑥x is selected from a predefined set W𝑊W; e.g., W={1,2,…,30}𝑊12…30W=\\{1,2,\\ldots,30\\}.\nMetelli et al.  theoretically analyzed the performance of the optimal policy when a fixed action repetition count is given, and proposed a heuristic to approximately choose the optimal control frequency.\nOn the other hand, we take a completely different approach where our policy produces not repetition counts (or action durations) but safe regions,\nwhich enables the agent to adaptively stop action repetition when facing unexpected events in stochastic environments. Finally, action repetition is related to the options framework 4\nin that they both use temporally extended actions.\nIn the options framework, the agent learns both a high-level inter-option policy and a low-level intra-option policy,\nwhere action repetition can be interpreted as a special case of an intra-option policy.\nHowever, one crucial difference between them is that\nwithin the options framework, the agent has to produce each δ𝛿\\delta-discretized low-level action (even with open-loop options),\nwhich makes having δ𝛿\\delta-invariance non-trivial,\nunlike the action repetition approach.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Continuous-time RL.\nReinforcement learning in continuous-time domains has long been studied with various approaches\n2  [ref]5    .\nBradtke and Duff  extended existing Q-learning and temporal difference methods to semi-MDPs, which can be viewed as a continuous-time generalization of MDPs.\nDoya [ref]5 developed a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
