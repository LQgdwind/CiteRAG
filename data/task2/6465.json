      "content": "Paper Title: IIFL: Implicit Interactive Fleet Learning from Heterogeneous Human Supervisors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning from an offline set of human task demonstrations with behavior cloning (i.e., supervised learning) is an intuitive and effective way to train a robot control policy 9   . However, behavior cloning can suffer from distribution shift [ref]9, as compounding approximation errors and real-world data distributions (e.g., variable lighting in a warehouse) can lead the robot to visit states that were not visited by the human. To mitigate distribution shift, Ross et al. [ref]9 propose dataset aggregation (DAgger), an IIL algorithm which collects online action labels on states visited by the robot during task execution and iteratively improves the robot policy. Since DAgger can request excessive queries to a human supervisor, several IIL algorithms seek to reduce human burden by intermittently ceding control to the human during robot execution based on some switching criteria 1 0 0. Human-gated IIL 1 1 2 has the human decide when to take and cede control, while robot-gated IIL 3 0 2 0 has the robot autonomously decide. Hoque et al. 3 propose Interactive Fleet Learning (IFL), which generalizes robot-gated IIL to multiple robots supervised by multiple humans. In this work, we consider the IFL setting. Sun et al. 4 propose a method for interactive imitation learning from heterogeneous experts, but their method is not based on implicit policies and is limited to autonomous driving applications. Gandhi et al. 5 also interactively learn from multiple experts and propose actively soliciting the human supervisors to provide demonstrations that are compatible with the current data. However, this prevents the robot from learning alternative modes and requires the human supervisors to comply with suggestions, which may not occur due to human suboptimality, fatigue, or obstinacy 6.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: demonstrations with behavior cloning (i.e., supervised learning) is an intuitive and effective way to train a robot control policy 9   .
