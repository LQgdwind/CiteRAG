      "content": "Paper Title: Constrained Structure Learning for Scene Graph Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScene graph generation (SGG) task involves building a visually-grounded scene graph to explicitly model objects and their relationships in an input image. Its aim is to facilitate downstream vision tasks such as image captioning [ref]1,  and visual question answering , . As a structured prediction task, SGG is generally NP-hard, owing to the exponential complexity of interactions among the output variables (which are expected to form coherent visual relationships) present a huge challenge for directly computing the desired statistics, i.e. the underlying posterior or the relevant marginals. Currently, only pairwise interactions are considered in the SGG task and they are often formulated as triplet structures, in which each triplet consists of three components: a subject, a predicate and an object. More specifically, given an input image xùë•x, a specific type of approximation strategies - variational Bayesian (VB) , [ref]6 - is often applied to accomplish the SGG generation task in the current methods. In this approach, the variational inference step aims to infer the optimum interpretation z‚àósuperscriptùëßz^{*} by means of a max aposteriori (MAP) estimation strategy, i.e. z‚àó=arg‚Äãmaxz‚Å°p‚Äã(z|x)superscriptùëßsubscriptargmaxùëßùëùconditionalùëßùë•z^{*}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{z}p(z|x), while the variational learning step tries to fit the model posterior p‚Äã(z|x)ùëùconditionalùëßùë•p(z|x) with the underlying ground-truth posterior pr‚Äã(z|x)subscriptùëùùëüconditionalùëßùë•p_{r}(z|x) by maximizing the conditional likelihood. Such a VB framework is implemented in current SGG models , , , , , , , [ref]14 by constructing two fundamental modules, namely: visual perception and visual context reasoning , as shown in Fig.1. For the variational inference step, visual perception initializes the output interpretations, while visual context reasoning refines the interpretations according to certain inference strategies. For the variational learning step, both modules are updated to fit the ground-truth training samples, and the updated modules are applied in the following variational inference step. The resulting optimum interpretation z‚àósuperscriptùëßz^{*} is generated by alternating between the above varitional inference and learning steps. To construct efficient VB frameworks for complex SGG tasks, the variational distribution q‚Äã(z)ùëûùëßq(z) in the current SGG models is often assumed to be fully decomposable. The resulting framework is also known as mean field variational Bayesian (MFVB) , [ref]6. Such formulation ignores the higher-order interactions in the underlying posterior and it is essentially a locally consistent (rather than globally consistent) approximation of the underlying posterior. However, the MFVB framework is easy to scale to huge datasets without sacrificing much performance, especially when used with stochastic learning methods. This explains the facts why almost all the current SGG methods choose this specific type of VB models as their backbone framework. In the current MFVB-based SGG models, almost all of them choose a specific optimization strategy - message passing , , ,  - to infer the optimum interpretations within the variational inference step, and it has became the de facto inference method.Specifically, different message passing neural network structures , [ref]14, 0, 1, 2 have been proposed in recent years to model the above MFVB models and showed to achieve reasonable graph generation performance. However, these methods fail to explore other inference methodologies. More importantly, their variational inference objectives are unconstrained. More generic constrained variational inference objectives have not been properly investigated in the current SGG literature. To this end, a generic and efficient constrained structure learning (CSL) method is proposed in this paper to solve the SGG task. Unlike the previous methods, a MFVB framework with explicit variational inference and learning objectives is constructed. Moreover, the proposed method considers the variatinal inference step as a constrained optimization problem, rather than an unconstrained one as in previous algorithms. Within the variational inference step, a generic constrained optimization method - entropic mirror decent 3 - is applied to infer the underlying posterior rather than the ubiquitous message passing strategy. The experimental results obtained on the popular Visual Genome and Open Images V6 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of the proposed CSL method. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related works. Section 3 introduces the proposed constrained structure learning methodology. The experimental results and the corresponding analysis are elaborated in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: involves building a visually-grounded scene graph to explicitly model objects and their relationships in an input image.
