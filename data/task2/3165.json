      "content": "Paper Title: Hard Sample Aware Noise Robust Learning for Histopathology Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCancer is a serious threat to people’s life and health. The studies  confirmed that the early screening of cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. The pathological examination is the golden standard of early cancer detection, which can determine the tissue source, nature, and scope of the tumor relying on the visual observation of pathologists. However, there are still many challenges to overcome. During the actual diagnosis process, pathologists analyze the overall tissue along with nuclei organization, density, and variability, which requires tedious workloads. The diagnosis accuracy can be negatively affected by many factors, such as pathologist fatigue and distraction, and the complexity of the tissue structure . The deep learning (DL) techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in the fields of histopathology image analysis . These efforts are designed to help physicians in improving the accuracy and promptness of cancer diagnosis. One typical task in the field of histopathology image analysis is image classification. Several works   are developed to build a deep learning model to classify the histopathology images. However,\nall these works assume that the utilized dataset was clean for model training. Actually, it is very expensive and difficult to collect a large dataset with clean labels . In the real medical diagnosis scenarios, noisy labels are often inevitable in manual annotation due to the following reasons: 1) expert domain knowledge is required to perform labeling; 2) manual annotation suffers from large intra- and inter-observer variability even among experts; 3) it is time-consuming and tedious to annotate a large number of patches. Therefore, designing robust algorithms with noisy labels is of great significance . In the literature, a lot of approaches were proposed, which can generally be classified into three categories: estimating the noise transition matrix [ref]9 0 1, designing noise-robust loss functions 2 3 4, and sample correcting/selecting 5 6 7 8 9 0. The schemes based on transition matrix estimating try to capture the transition probability between the noisy label and true label 8.\nDifferent transition matrix estimation methods were proposed in work [ref]9 0 1, such as using additional softmax layer [ref]9, utilizing trusted samples in a data-efficient manner 0, and two-step estimating scheme 1. However, these transition matrix estimations fail in real-world datasets where the utilized prior assumption is no longer valid 8. Being free of transition matrix estimation, the second category targets designing loss functions that have more noise-tolerant power. Work 2 adopted mean absolute error (MAE) function which demonstrates more noise robust ability than cross-entropy loss. In work 3, the authors combined Generalized Cross Entropy (GCE) loss and MAE to address the slow convergence speed of work 2. Recently, the authors in work 4 proposed determinant-based mutual information loss which can be applied to any existing classification neural networks regardless of the noise pattern. However, this kind of method suffers generalization performance loss due to the low quality of the validation sets 1. The third category targets correcting noisy labels or selecting the possibly clean samples. Bootstrap in work 5 adopted the predicted correcting labels together with the raw labels to lower the interference from the noisy samples. In work 6, the authors utilized some clean annotations to reduce the noise in the large dataset. However, it is difficult to obtain the required certain amount of clean data in some cases. In work 7, a joint optimization framework was proposed to gradually estimate the true labels. The self-learning framework was applied to train the label correction network without extra supervision 8. Some works just selected the clean data by dropping the noisy data directly to avoid the estimation of true labels. Co-teaching has appeared in the literature recently 9 0, which trains two deep neural networks simultaneously and makes them teach each other by selecting some data of possibly clean labels. Compared with the first two types of methods, the third category is more general and can be integrated into many image classification tasks. Although many studies are proposed to suppress the noisy labels for the general image classification problem, there are few works on the classification of noised histopathology images. Work 2 proposed online uncertainty sample mining and individual re-weighting methods to train their network. In work3, a double-softmax classification module was adopted to prevent overfitting the noisy labels and a teacher-student module was used to strengthen the effect of clean labels. Unfortunately, almost all these approaches fail in distinguishing informative hard samples from harmful mislabeled ones. Although the work in2 realized the significance of hard samples, their algorithm still didn’t separate hard samples from noisy ones, and thus many important hard samples were mistakenly discarded 4. On the one hand, the hard samples can make training more effective and efficient 5. On the other hand, the deep neural networks can easily overfit to some label noise, and thus cause performance degradation 6. How to involve hard samples for training while reducing noise interference at the same time is of great significance. Many works found that the deep models first memorize the easy training data with clean labels and then memorize the hard or noisy data 7 8. This phenomenon can be used to distinguish the easy clean data from the noise, however how to distinguish the hard clean data from the noise is still not clear. In this work, we strive to reconcile this gap by proposing a hard sample aware noise robust learning algorithm. Our analysis reveals that the prediction history for each sample can be used as guiding information for distinguishing the hard and noisy samples. A deep model for hard and noisy sample detection is thus designed and integrated into our noisy label correction architecture. In the architecture, self-training is applied to conduct the label correction automatically. Based on the corrected data, the noise suppressing and hard enhancing (NSHE) scheme is designed to further enhance the hard sample and weaken the possible noisy sample. Our key contributions are summarized as follows. We proposed a two-phase hard sample aware noise robust learning algorithm for histopathology image classification. Our method can save more clean samples by detecting the hard sample and noise in label correction phase. The hard samples can be further enhanced in our NSHE phase. We built an EHN (easy/hard/noisy) detection scheme and integrated it into our self-learning label correction flow. We found that hard and noisy samples can be recognized using sample prediction history. Different from the previous works, our scheme can save more hard samples and discard more noisy samples. In the NSHE phase, we smoothly trained our model to further suppress the interference from noisy samples and enhance the hard samples based on our proposed co-learning architecture. Our proposed method can be directly applied to the real-world dataset without using clean annotations. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance in our collected clinical pathology data of one top hospital in Beijing, China.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: with noisy labels is of great significance .
