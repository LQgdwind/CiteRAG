Arunachalamet al. [ref]14 showed the hardness of shadow tomography of mixed states ρ𝜌\\rho from access to 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍ρsubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜌\\mathsf{QStat}_{\\rho}. Given access to copies of ρ𝜌\\rho, an efficient algorithm for shadow tomography is known, using a reduction to threshold search   through a mistake-bounded online learning algorithm [ref]43. We recall the algorithm for shadow tomography and then show that the reduction from shadow tomography to threshold search is efficient in 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍ρsubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜌\\mathsf{QStat}_{\\rho} queries. This implies that threshold search itself must be a hard problem to solve with quantum statistical queries. We start by recalling the problems of shadow tomography and threshold search. We also recall the related problem of quantum hypothesis selection which we will discuss later.

Now, we state the result of [ref]14 on the hardness of shadow tomography from 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍ρsubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜌\\mathsf{QStat}_{\\rho} queries. Any algorithm that use 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍ρsubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜌\\mathsf{QStat}_{\\rho} queries of tolerance at least τ𝜏\\tau and predicts T​r​[P​ρ]𝑇𝑟delimited-[]𝑃𝜌Tr[P\\rho] up to error ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon for all 4n−1superscript4𝑛14^{n}-1 non-identity Pauli strings P∈𝒫n\\{I}𝑃\\subscript𝒫𝑛𝐼P\\in\\mathcal{P}_{n}\\backslash\\{I\\} with high probability requires Ω​(τ2​22​n/ϵ2)Ωsuperscript𝜏2superscript22𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\Omega(\\tau^{2}2^{2n}/\\epsilon^{2}) queries. The result of [ref]14 implies that no algorithm can solve shadow tomography significantly more efficiently than simply querying 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍ρsubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜌\\mathsf{QStat}_{\\rho} with every single observable.\n\n\nWe briefly describe the reduction from Shadow Tomography to Quantum Threshold Search as shown in . This algorithm for Shadow Tomography involves multiple rounds of quantum threshold search interleaved with the online learning algorithm. Each round consists of one “mistake”, where the learner outputs an index where the expectation value deviates from the threshold. In such a case, the learner must estimate an ϵ/4italic-ϵ4\\epsilon/4-estimate of the expectation value (which can be done with a single query to 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍ρsubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜌\\mathsf{QStat_{\\rho}}). Such a mistake occurs only 𝒪​((log⁡N)/ϵ2)𝒪𝑁superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}((\\log N)/\\epsilon^{2}) many times. Thus, we obtain the following relation between the QSQ complexity of shadow tomography and quantum threshold search. Let qs​h​a​d​o​wsuperscript𝑞𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑤q^{shadow} and qt​h​r​e​s​hsuperscript𝑞𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎq^{thresh} be the number of 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍ρsubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜌\\mathsf{QStat}_{\\rho} queries needed to solve Problems 1 and 2 respectively for an unknown state ρ∈𝒮N𝜌subscript𝒮𝑁\\rho\\in\\mathcal{S}_{N} and a common list of observables O1,…,OM∈HN,Nsubscript𝑂1…subscript𝑂𝑀subscript𝐻𝑁𝑁O_{1},\\dots,O_{M}\\in H_{N,N}. Then, it holds that Now, using Lemmas 8 and 9 we state the hardness of Threshold Search. Any algorithm that use 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍ρsubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜌\\mathsf{QStat}_{\\rho} queries of tolerance at least τ𝜏\\tau and solves Problem 2 up to error ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon for all 4n−1superscript4𝑛14^{n}-1 non-identity Pauli strings P∈𝒫n\\{I}𝑃\\subscript𝒫𝑛𝐼P\\in\\mathcal{P}_{n}\\backslash\\{I\\} and all choices of θ1,…,θ4n−1subscript𝜃1…subscript𝜃superscript4𝑛1\\theta_{1},\\dots,\\theta_{4^{n}-1} with high probability requires Ω​(τ2​22​n/n)Ωsuperscript𝜏2superscript22𝑛𝑛\\Omega(\\tau^{2}2^{2n}/n) queries. We would like to point out an interesting implication of this result in the context of learning shallow circuits. Zhao et al. [ref]4 showed an algorithm for learning unitaries consisting of G𝐺G two-qubit gates up to average-distance (Definition 9) using 𝒪​(G​log⁡(G))𝒪𝐺𝐺\\mathcal{O}(G\\log(G)) black-box queries. Given that a circuit of constant depth can have at most 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) gates, it is a natural question whether the algorithm of [ref]4 can also be extended to the statistical query setting. A desirable property of this algorithm is that it is nearly query-optimal in the black-box setting. Unfortunately, using Theorem 5, we conjecture that such an extension to the statistical query setting is unlikely.\n\n\nThe algorithm of [ref]4 involves casting out an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-covering net over the space of G𝐺G-gate unitaries with respect to da​v​gsubscript𝑑𝑎𝑣𝑔d_{avg}, followed by quantum hypothesis selection on the output states of the elements of the net. As the number of elements of the net ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} may be exponential in G𝐺G, quantum hypothesis selection must be carried out using 𝒪​(log⁡(ℳ))𝒪ℳ\\mathcal{O}(\\log(\\mathcal{M})) queries. However, the authors in [ref]4 do not show an explicit net for this construction. Further, in [ref]4, quantum hypothesis selection is carried out using classical shadow tomography. From the worst-case hardness of shadow tomography shown in [ref]14, we see that without knowing the additional properties of the net, one cannot use a shadow tomography algorithm for this purpose. The original methods for quantum hypothesis selection in  used either shadow tomography or (a decision variant of) quantum threshold search as subroutines. As a result, the worst-case hardness of threshold search from Theorem 5 and the result of [ref]14 prevent us from showing an efficient algorithm for quantum hypothesis selection. Thus, without considering explicit constructions for covering nets, one cannot extend existing techniques to perform quantum hypothesis selection efficiently with statistical queries. Even with such information, quantum hypothesis selection may prove to be hard. Thus, we conjecture that no efficient QPSQ analogue for the algorithm of [ref]4 exists. As the robustness of our framework does not apply here, it may be interesting to study the noise-tolerance of their algorithm using other methods.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: In this section, we will show the hardness of quantum threshold search and discuss its implications for the learnability of shallow circuits.
