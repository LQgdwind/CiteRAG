      "content": "Paper Title: Topic Modeling on Podcast Short-Text Metadata\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe describe next the evaluation metric, the detailed preprocessing and experimental setup, and the environment we used for running the models. We evaluated topic quality by relying on the widely used topic coherence .\nA set of facts are said to have high coherence if they could support each other.\nIn topic modeling, this translates into mapping terms on facts and measuring the extent to which these terms tend to co-occur in corpora.\nWhile the spectrum of word co-occurrence metrics for topic coherence is quite large , the exhaustive search performed in  shows that CVsubscript𝐶𝑉C_{V} correlates best with human judgement of topic ranking.\nThus, we decided to report CVsubscript𝐶𝑉C_{V} scores in our evaluation.\nGiven a topic k𝑘k defined by its T𝑇T top words t1,t2,…,tTsubscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2…subscript𝑡𝑇t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{T}, CVsubscript𝐶𝑉C_{V} is defined as: vN​P​M​I​(ti)subscript𝑣𝑁𝑃𝑀𝐼subscript𝑡𝑖v_{NPMI}(t_{i}) and vN​P​M​I​(t1:T)subscript𝑣𝑁𝑃𝑀𝐼subscript𝑡:1𝑇v_{NPMI}(t_{1:T}) yield two vectors computed with the Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) metric as follows: where p𝑝p is the probability of a term occurrence or co-occurrence in an external corpus.\nWe use Palmetto  to compute CVsubscript𝐶𝑉C_{V} for each topic k𝑘k on Wikipedia as external corpus, and average over all K𝐾K topics to obtain an aggregated value. In all the reported experiments, we fix the number of top words T𝑇T to 101010 and vary the number of topics K𝐾K between 202020, 505050, 100100100 and 200200200.\nDuring preprocessing, we keep all the linked NEs whose REL confidence score is higher than 0.90.90.9 even if they only appear once in the corpus. For normal words, same as in [ref]33, we filter out from vocabulary those that appear less than 555 times.\nWe also remove stop words using NLTK .\nThe same preprocessing is applied before each topic modeling baseline.\nWe evaluate GPU-DMM , NQTM [ref]33, SeaNMF  and CluWords  with their default hyper-parameters.\nWe assess the original CluWords with both fastText and Wikipedia2Vec embeddings . As discussed in Section 3, NEiCE requires two parameters αw​o​r​dsuperscript𝛼𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑\\alpha^{word} and αe​n​tsuperscript𝛼𝑒𝑛𝑡\\alpha^{ent}.\n motivates the choice of αw​o​r​dsuperscript𝛼𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑\\alpha^{word} between 0.350.350.35 and 0.40.40.4 in CluWords as it allows to select top 2% of most similar pairs of words.\nCompared to this approach which assumes αw​o​r​dsuperscript𝛼𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑\\alpha^{word} mainly dependent on the pre-trained embeddings, we investigate if it varies per dataset.\nThus, we test αw​o​r​dsuperscript𝛼𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑\\alpha^{word} with multiple values (0.20.20.2, 0.30.30.3, 0.40.40.4, 0.50.50.5), where larger the value is, fewer words are selected as being semantically-related to a given term.\nWe proceed similarly for αe​n​tsuperscript𝛼𝑒𝑛𝑡\\alpha^{ent}.\nWe run the experiments on an Intel Xeon Gold 6134 CPU @ 3.20GHz with 32 cores and 128GB RAM.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: and 200200200.\nDuring preprocessing, we keep all the linked NEs whose REL confidence score is higher than 0.90.90.9 even if they only appear once in the corpus. For normal words, same as in [ref]33, we filter out from vocabulary those that appear less than 555 times.\nWe also remove stop words using NLTK .\nThe same preprocessing is applied before each topic modeling baseline.\nWe evaluate\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
