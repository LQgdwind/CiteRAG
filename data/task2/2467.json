      "content": "Paper Title: CFLOW-AD: Real-Time Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Localization via Conditional Normalizing Flows\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnomaly detection with localization (AD) is a growing area of research in computer vision with many practical applications e.g. industrial inspection [ref]4, road traffic monitoring , medical diagnostics  etc. However, the common supervised AD [ref]32 is not viable in practical applications due to several reasons. First, it requires labeled data which is costly to obtain. Second, anomalies are usually rare long-tail examples and have low probability to be acquired by sensors. Lastly, consistent labeling of anomalies is subjective and requires extensive domain expertise as illustrated in Figure 1 with industrial cable defects. With these limitations of the supervised AD, a more appealing approach is to collect only unlabeled anomaly-free images for train dataset 𝒟trainsubscript𝒟train\\mathcal{D_{\\mathrm{train}}} as in Figure 1 (top row). Then, any deviation from anomaly-free images is classified as an anomaly. Such data setup with low rate of anomalies is generally considered to be unsupervised [ref]4. Hence, the AD task can be reformulated as a task of out-of-distribution detection (OOD) with the AD objective. While OOD for low-dimensional industrial sensors (e.g. power-line or acoustic) can be accomplished using a common k𝑘k-nearest-neighbor or more advanced clustering methods [ref]10, it is less trivial for high-resolution images. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained popularity in extracting semantic information from images into downsampled feature maps [ref]4. Though feature extraction using CNNs has relatively low complexity, the post-processing of feature maps is far from real-time processing in the state-of-the-art unsupervised AD methods . To address this complexity drawback, we propose a CFLOW-AD model that is based on conditional normalizing flows. CFLOW-AD is agnostic to feature map spatial dimensions similar to CNNs, which leads to a higher accuracy metrics as well as a lower computational and memory requirements. We present the main idea behind our approach in a toy OOD detector example in Figure 1. A distribution of the anomaly-free image patches 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}} with probability density function pX​(𝒙)subscript𝑝𝑋𝒙p_{X}({\\bm{x}}) is learned by the AD model. Our translation-equivariant model is trained to transform the original distribution with pX​(𝒙)subscript𝑝𝑋𝒙p_{X}({\\bm{x}}) density into a Gaussian distribution with pZ​(𝒛)subscript𝑝𝑍𝒛p_{Z}({\\bm{z}}) density. Finally, this model separates in-distribution patches 𝒛𝒛{\\bm{z}} with pZ​(𝒛)subscript𝑝𝑍𝒛p_{Z}({\\bm{z}}) from the out-of-distribution patches with pZ~​(𝒛)subscript𝑝~𝑍𝒛p_{\\tilde{Z}}({\\bm{z}}) using a threshold τ𝜏\\tau computed as the Euclidean distance from the distribution mean.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Anomaly detection with localization (AD) is a growing area of research in computer vision with many practical applications e.g. industrial inspection [ref]4, road traffic monitoring , medical diagnostics  etc. However, the common supervised AD [ref]32 is not viable in practical applications due to several reasons.
