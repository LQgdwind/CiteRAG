With recent advances in deep neural network, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) — a combination of deep learning and RL, has achieved great successes in many simulated tasks, ranging from games   [ref]5 to complex locomotion behaviors [ref]6  and robotic manipulators . However, shared by RL, DRL is sample inefficient and slow to converge because of the scarce reward signals . It is difficult or even unpractical to design an efficient reward function for each task, which makes applying traditional DRL methods to real-world robots a great challenge 0. Since most robots will operate in human inhabited environments, the ability to interact and learn from human users will be key to their success 1.\nMany approaches for robot learning from interaction with a human user have been proposed. The interactive feedback that the human user provides during such interaction can take many forms, e.g., demonstrations, preferences, evaluative feedback, etc.\nAmong them, imitation learning from demonstrations was proposed and often leads to faster learning than learning from reward signals 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. In addition, it would be much easier to demonstrate behaviors than designing reward functions for robots to learn, though reward functions are commonly used to specify the objective of robots. The simplest approach in this setting is behavioral cloning (BC) 2, in which the goal is to learn the mapping from states to optimal actions as a supervised learning problem. However, BC needs large amounts of data to learn and cannot generalize to unseen states, which is commonly used to initialize policies for RL 9 0.\nAnother approach is inverse reinforcement learning (inverse RL), which learns a policy via RL, using a cost function extracted from expert trajectories 3. Because of the assumption of expert optimality as prior on the space of policies, inverse RL can allow the learner to generalize expert behavior to unseen states more effectively 1. However, many of the proposed inverse RL algorithms need a model to solve a sequence of planning or reinforcement learning problems in an inner loop 2, which is extremely expensive to run and limits their use in large and complex tasks. Moreover, their agents’ performance might significantly degrade if the planning problems are not solved to optimality 1 3. Therefore, by drawing an analogy between imitation learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) 4, Ho et al. proposed Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) — a general model-free framework for directly learning policies from the expert trajectories 2, and extended inverse RL to large environments. However, GAIL shares the limitation of the other imitation learning methods that they can seldom surpass the performance of demonstrations. In many tasks, demonstrations are not always optimal or the optimal demonstrations are hard to obtain practically. If the behavior of the demonstrator is suboptimal or far from optimal, the same will hold for GAIL.\nMoreover, the performance of policies trained through adversarial methods still falls short of those produced by manually designed reward functions, when such reward functions are available 9 5 6. Fortunately, an agent via interactive reinforcement learning (interactive RL) from human evaluative feedback can generally surpass a trainer’s performance in the task 7 1. Based on reward shaping 8 in traditional RL, interactive RL from human evaluative feedback allows even non-technical people to train robots by evaluating their behaviors 9. Hence, in this paper, we propose a model-free framework — GAN-Based Interactive Reinforcement Learning (GAIRL), which combines the advantages of GAIL and interactive RL from human evaluative feedback. We hypothesize agents learn via GAIRL can outperform the demonstration performance and acquire an optimal policy disregarding the quality of demonstrations. We tested our method in six physics-based control tasks from the classic RL literature, ranging from simple low-dimensional control tasks — Cart Pole and Mountain Car, to difficult high-dimensional tasks — Inverted Double Pendulum, Lunar Lander, Hopper and HalfCheetah. Our results suggest that with both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, a GAIRL agent can always learn a more stable policy with optimal or close to optimal performance, while the performance of the GAIL agent is upper bounded by the performance of demonstrations or even worse than it. In addition, our results indicate the reason that GAIRL is superior over GAIL might be because of the complementary effect of demonstrations and human evaluative feedback.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: .
