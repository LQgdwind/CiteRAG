We used LSTM cells to build the decoded stacked architectures (as a way to mitigate the exploding and vanishing gradient problems ), and Adam truncated through time  (i.e., sharing all parameters in the unfolded models) to train the final solutions, with default parameter values . We defined the search space (i.e., the constraints to the RNN architectures) of the three problems studied (Table 1) according to the datasets and the state-of-the-art. Particularly, the sine wave search space is taken from  and the waste search space is copied from  to enable a direct comparison. Also, to ease the visualisation of the results, we defined the following naming scheme to denote different combinations of encoding, warm start, invalid, and the constraint handling method: \n[constraint][warm start][infeasible][encoding]. Specifically, we use a character to denote each variant: Constraint (C), Warm start (w), Infeasible (I), and Encoding (F: flag, S: size, and P: plain). A dash (-) means that the corresponding alternative was not used. For example, -W-F corresponds to the combination of warm data and the flag encoding (i.e., without constraint handling and without invalid solution penalty). Finally, we execute 303030 independent runs for each combination of encoding, warm start, and the constraint handling method on a heterogeneous Linux cluster with more than 200 cores and 700 GB RAM, managed by HTCondor. In these experiments we used the optimization parameter values presented in Table 2. The remainder of this subsection introduces the performance results for the three problems and some insights into the solutions. Note that the parameters presented in Table 1 and 2 were taken from  . We decided to chose these values (instead of performing an hyperparameter tuning) to enable a direct comparison with our competitors.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: We implemented our approach111Code available in https://github.com/acamero/dlopt in Python 3, using DLOPT [ref]6, MIP-EGO , Keras , and Tensorflow .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
