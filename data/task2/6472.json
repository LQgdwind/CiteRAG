      "content": "Paper Title: Cooperation or Competition: Avoiding Player Domination for Multi-Target Robustness via Adaptive Budgets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial Training. Goodfellow et al.4 show that even a small perturbation in the direction of the gradient can fool deep learning models for image classification tasks. This is later extended to a multi-step attack¬† called the Basic Iterative Method, now typically referred to as the PGD attack, which significantly improves the success rate of creating adversarial examples.\nSince then, various variations of the PGD attack¬† [ref]24  have been proposed to overcome heuristic defenses and create stronger adversaries.\nTo defend against these attacks, numerous defense methods¬†[ref]31       4      have been developed. Among these methods, the most successful defense method is adversarial training¬†, which formulates the defense problem as a minimax optimization problem and has become one of the few adversarial defenses that is still robust against stronger attacks¬†  . As a result, empirical robustness¬†  3 7 6 has been significantly advanced over the past few decades. Multi-target Adversarial Training.\nRobustness against multiple types of attacks simultaneously is closely related to our work. Schott et al.  use multiple variational autoencoders to construct an architecture called ‚Äúanalysis by synthesis‚Äù for the MNIST dataset. Their experimental results show that even for MNIST, it is difficult to train a model that is robust to three different adversaries. Following that, Tramer and Boneh 1 investigate the theoretical and empirical trade-offs of adversarial robustness when defending against aggregations of multiple adversaries. Their results show that a model that is robust to the ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty} adversary might not be able to defend against other attacks, such as ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} and ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} attacks, on MNIST. To alleviate this problem, they design an augmentation-based method to achieve ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} robustness. Later, Croce and Hein  propose a provable adversarial defense against all ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} norms for p‚â•1ùëù1p\\geq 1 using regularization methods. From a greedy search perspective, Maini et al.  suggest that taking the worst-case over all steepest descent directions helps achieve better performance than MAX and AVG empirically. Recently, while not studied as a defense method, Kang et al. 8 investigate the transferability of adversarial robustness between models trained against different perturbation models.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Basic Iterative Method, now typically referred to as the PGD attack, which significantly improves the success rate of creating adversarial examples.\nSince then, various variations of the PGD attack¬† [ref]24  have been proposed to overcome heuristic defenses and create stronger adversaries.\nTo defend against these attacks, numerous defense methods¬†[ref]31       4      have been developed.
