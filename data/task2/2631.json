      "content": "Paper Title: Straight-line Drawings of 1-Planar GraphsSupported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Br835/20-1\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is clear that every 1-planar graph is biplanar. In fact, every\n1-planar graph can be decomposed into a planar graph and a forest\n. Towards a straight-line biplanar drawing, we\nfirst consider triconnected 1-planar graphs with a pair of edges\ncrossing in the outer face. These edges must be redrawn. We show\nthat there is a straight-line biplanar grid drawing, which is\n1-planar with the exception of edges incident to the top vertices of\na W-configuration. In general, there is a separation pair if there\nis a pair of crossed edges in the outer face of a component. By\ninduction, every inner component at a separation pair has a\nstraight-line biplanar drawing, which is scaled down, so that it\nfits into the first inner face of the outer component. So we obtain\na biplanar drawing of a 1-planar graph. By upper and lower bounds\non the length of (segments of) edges, we can estimate that a single\ninner component is scaled down at most by c/n5𝑐superscript𝑛5c/n^{5} for some c>0𝑐0c>0. In\nreturn, the outer component is scaled up by O​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}). By induction\non the number of inner components and recursion on separation pairs,\nthe upscaling is bounded by O​(nn)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑛O(n^{n}), so that we use high precision\narithmetic with numbers with O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) many digits. Let G𝐺G be a 3-connected 1-planar graph with a W-configuration\nin the outer face, so that the vertices v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} and v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} from the base\nare the first and the vertices t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} on top are the last two vertices in\na canonical ordering of the planar skeleton of G𝐺G. Then G𝐺G admits\na specialized straight-line biplanar drawing Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) on a grid\nof quadratic size. A segment of an edge e𝑒e has length ℓℓ\\ell with\n1≤ℓ≤8​n−161ℓ8𝑛161\\leq\\ell\\leq 8n-16 in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) if e𝑒e is uncrossed in (the\n1-planar drawing of) G𝐺G. The outer face of the planar skeleton of G𝐺G is a quadrangle with\nvertices v1,v2,t1subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑡1v_{1},v_{2},t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} from the W-configuration. Let\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} be the last vertex and assume that there is no inner\nquadrangle containing v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}. Otherwise, let t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} be the\nlast vertex. The canonical ordering is {v1,v2}<v<t1<t2subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2𝑣subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}<v<t_{1}<t_{2}\nfor any other vertex v𝑣v. A bucket consists of one or two vertices,\nsince the faces of the planar skeleton are triangles or quadrangles.\nThere is a quadrangle if and only if it contains a pair of crossed\nedges in the 1-planar drawing of G𝐺G. Our algorithm uses the shift method and incrementally adds a vertex\nor the pair of vertices with a horizontal edge in between to an\nintermediate drawing.\nSimilar to Alam et al. , we extend the\nalgorithms by de Fraysseix et al.  and Kant\n, so that there are strictly convex inner faces\nfor a planar drawing of the planar skeleton.\nOur algorithm is based on the algorithm for 3-connected planar\ngraphs by Kant , which constructs a drawing with\nconvex inner faces on a grid of size (2​n−4)×(n−2)2𝑛4𝑛2(2n-4)\\times(n-2).\nStrict convexity for inner quadrangles is obtained by extra shifts,\nso that there is a straight-line planar drawing of the planar\nskeleton on a grid of size at most (4​n−8)×(2​n−4)4𝑛82𝑛4(4n-8)\\times(2n-4)\n [ref]45, see Fig. 4. In detail, we construct the biplanar drawing Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) as follows.\nThe planar subgraph of G−{t1,t2}𝐺subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2G-\\{t_{1},t_{2}\\} is\ndrawn as described before with a horizontal line for\n(v1,v2)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2(v_{1},v_{2}). All quadrangles containing\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are prepared for strict convexity, so that edges (a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b)\nand (b,c)𝑏𝑐(b,c) are not in a line for a quadrangle (a,b,c,t2)𝑎𝑏𝑐subscript𝑡2(a,b,c,t_{2}).\nCrossed edges are inserted in the interior of the quadrangle\nfrom which they were removed if they are not incident to t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} or t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}.\nBy Lemma 1, the intermediate drawing is\nstraight-line and 1-planar on a grid of size at most (4​n−16)×(2​n−8)4𝑛162𝑛8(4n-16)\\times(2n-8). The uncrossed edges have length at least one and at most\n4​n−164𝑛164n-16. By the restrictions for a canonical ordering , the\nlast two vertices are placed one after another. First, add t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and\nits incident edges to lower vertices including the crossed\nedge (t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}), so that there is an isosceles right-angled\ntriangle (v1,v2,t1)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2subscript𝑡1(v_{1},v_{2},t_{1}) with t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} on top. Edge (t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}) is colored red,\nso that it is transparent for black edges incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, see\nFig. 5(a).\nThe lower neighbors of t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are on the contour of the drawing of\nG−t2𝐺subscript𝑡2G-t_{2} if edge (t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}) is ignored. Let v𝑣v be the\nrightmost lower neighbor of t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} so that v≠v2𝑣subscript𝑣2v\\neq v_{2}. If v𝑣v is\nx≥0𝑥0x\\geq 0 units to the right of t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}, then shift v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} by 2​x+22𝑥22x+2\nextra units to the right and place t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} at the intersection of the\ndiagonals through v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} and v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}, so that it moves by (x+1,x+1)𝑥1𝑥1(x+1,x+1)\nfrom its former position. Clearly, 2​x+2≤4​n−82𝑥24𝑛82x+2\\leq 4n-8. Thereafter, all\nneighbors of t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are to the left of t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}, except for v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}, which\nis the rightmost vertex.\nAt last, shift v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} one unit to the left and v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} one unit to the right\nand place t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} at the intersection of the diagonals,\nso that t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is one unit vertically above\nt1subscript𝑡1t_{1}, and draw all edges incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} straight line, see Fig. 5(b). All uncrossed edges of G𝐺G are colored black. Edge\n(t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}) is colored red. The edges incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} and\nv2subscript𝑣2v_{2} are colored black, so that all edges crossing an edge incident\nto t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} or v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} in the interior of a quadrangle\nare colored red. Recall that there is no inner quadrangle with t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}\nand v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}. For all other pairs of crossed edges in a quadrangle\nchoose any coloring, so that one crossed edge is red and the other\nis black. By Lemma 1 and the placement of t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}, the\ndrawing of G−t2𝐺subscript𝑡2G-t_{2} is straight-line 1-planar. The red edge\n(t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}) is the leftmost edge when t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} is placed, so that\nit does not cross any red edge. Hence, red edges do not cross, since\nedges incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are black and other red edges are in the\ninterior of strictly convex quadrangles. Black edges do not cross if\nthey are not incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} by Lemma 1. Edges\n(t2,v1)subscript𝑡2subscript𝑣1(t_{2},v_{1}) and (t2,v2)subscript𝑡2subscript𝑣2(t_{2},v_{2}) are in the outer face and\nare uncrossed. Any other edge incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is crossed by the\nred edge (t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}), which is not crossed by other edges, so\nthat (t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}) is crossed by edges of a fan at t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}. Edge\n(t2,v)subscript𝑡2𝑣(t_{2},v) is crossed by an edge (u,u′)≠(t1,v1)𝑢superscript𝑢′subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(u,u^{\\prime})\\neq(t_{1},v_{1}) in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) if and only if edges (t2,v)subscript𝑡2𝑣(t_{2},v)\nand (u,u′)𝑢superscript𝑢′(u,u^{\\prime}) cross in the 1-planar drawing of G𝐺G.\nThen (u,u′)𝑢superscript𝑢′(u,u^{\\prime}) is colored red and there is a\nstrictly convex quadrangle (t2,u,v,u′)subscript𝑡2𝑢𝑣superscript𝑢′(t_{2},u,v,u^{\\prime}) in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G). Edge\n(t2,v)subscript𝑡2𝑣(t_{2},v) is not crossed by any further edge, so that it is\ncrossed at most twice. Hence, Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) is a specialized\nstraight-line biplanar grid drawing. The grid has size at most (8​n−16)×(4​n−8)8𝑛164𝑛8(8n-16)\\times(4n-8), since the size of\nat most (4​n−8)×(2​n−4)4𝑛82𝑛4(4n-8)\\times(2n-4) by Lemma 1 is\nextended by at most 4​n−84𝑛84n-8 additional shifts for vertex t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}.\nClearly, edge (v1,v2)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2(v_{1},v_{2}) is the longest edge in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G)\nwith a length bounded by 8​n−168𝑛168n-16. Uncrossed edges of G𝐺G, that is\nedges of the planar skeleton, are uncrossed in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) if they\nare not incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, and uncrossed edges incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are\nonly crossed by (t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}) in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G). An uncrossed edge\nhas length at least one by Lemma 1. If\n(t2,v)subscript𝑡2𝑣(t_{2},v) is uncrossed in G𝐺G, then it has two segments from\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} to the crossing point with (t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}) and from there to\nv𝑣v, see Fig. 5(c). The first segment has length greater\nthan one, since t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is placed one unit above t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}, and the second\nsegment has length ℓ>1ℓ1\\ell>1, since v𝑣v is\nat least two units below t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and (t1,v1)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣1(t_{1},v_{1}) has slope\n(h−1)/hℎ1ℎ(h-1)/h, where hℎh is the height (or half of the width) of the drawing.\nHence, segments of uncrossed edges of G𝐺G have length at least\none, whereas segments of crossed edges can be very short. We now consider a W-configuration with last vertex t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}, so that\nthe second top vertex t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} cannot be the last but one vertex in the\ncanonical ordering. Then there are separating triangles with\nvertices t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}. We can assume that a flip of the\ncomponent at the base, as in Figs. 1(b) and\n1(c), does not help to avoid a separating\ntriangle with the top vertices. Otherwise,\nLemma 1 or Lemma 2 are\nused for the changed embedding. Every 3-connected 1-planar graph G𝐺G with a pair of crossed edges\nin the outer face admits a specialized straight-line biplanar\ndrawing Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) on a grid of size O​(n7)𝑂superscript𝑛7O(n^{7}). In addition, the outer face is an isosceles\nobtuse angled triangle, and a segment of edge e𝑒e in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G)\nhas length ℓℓ\\ell with 1≤ℓ≤c​n51ℓ𝑐superscript𝑛51\\leq\\ell\\leq cn^{5} for some c>0𝑐0c>0 if e𝑒e is uncrossed in\n(the 1-planar drawing of) G𝐺G. Consider a canonical ordering v1,v2,…,t1subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2…subscript𝑡1v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots,t_{1} of the\nplanar skeleton of G𝐺G, so that there is a W-configuration with base\nv1,v2subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2v_{1},v_{2} and top vertices t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} in G𝐺G with v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} left\nof v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}. There is a separating triangle (s,t1,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2(s,t_{1},t_{2}) if t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}\ncannot be the last but one vertex in a canonical ordering. Choose\ns𝑠s so that (s,t1,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2(s,t_{1},t_{2})\nis maximal in the sense that\nits vertices are not contained in another separating triangle\nwith vertices t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}. In other words,\ns𝑠s is the least vertex in a separating triangle with t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}.\nVertices s𝑠s and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are in the outer face of\nthe planar skeleton of G−t1𝐺subscript𝑡1G-t_{1}. Since there is a W-configuration,\nwe have s≠v1𝑠subscript𝑣1s\\neq v_{1} and s≠v2𝑠subscript𝑣2s\\neq v_{2}.\nAssume s<t2𝑠subscript𝑡2s<t_{2} in the canonical ordering. If this order is impossible,\nthen there is a separating triangle (s′,t1,t2)superscript𝑠′subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2(s^{\\prime},t_{1},t_{2})\ncontaining s𝑠s, so that (s,t1,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2(s,t_{1},t_{2}) is not maximal\nand s𝑠s is not the least such vertex, contradicting our assumption.\nVertex s𝑠s is the leftmost\nlower neighbor of t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, so that t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is first placed at the\nintersection of the diagonals through s𝑠s and v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}, as shown in\nFig. 6(a). Let G−superscript𝐺G^{-} be the subgraph of G𝐺G without the crossed edge\ne=(v1,t2)𝑒subscript𝑣1subscript𝑡2e=(v_{1},t_{2}), drawn black and dotted in Fig. 6(b).\nGraph G−superscript𝐺G^{-} decomposes into four\nsubgraphs. Subgraph G4subscript𝐺4G_{4} consist of the vertices in the interior of\nthe separating triangle (s,t1,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2(s,t_{1},t_{2}) including s,t1𝑠subscript𝑡1s,t_{1} and\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, so that s<t2<v<t1𝑠subscript𝑡2𝑣subscript𝑡1s<t_{2}<v<t_{1} for every vertex v𝑣v in the\nseparating triangle. Subgraph G3subscript𝐺3G_{3} is induced by the vertices v>s𝑣𝑠v>s and v∉G4𝑣subscript𝐺4v\\not\\in G_{4}. Subgraph\nG2subscript𝐺2G_{2} consists of the vertices v<s𝑣𝑠v<s\nunder t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, as described in     , and G1subscript𝐺1G_{1} is the remainder\nwith vertices v<s𝑣𝑠v<s. If s𝑠s is to the left of t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, then G1subscript𝐺1G_{1} is\nto the left of G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} and G3subscript𝐺3G_{3} is to the left of G4subscript𝐺4G_{4}. By the\nshift method, the vertices of G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} are shifted horizontally with\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2}. We first construct a 1-planar drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-} as described in\nLemma 1, with the following modifications for\nhorizontal edges in G4subscript𝐺4G_{4} and vertex t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}.\nVertex t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is first placed at the intersection of the diagonals\nthrough s𝑠s and v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}, so that it is h≥1ℎ1h\\geq 1 units above s𝑠s.\nEvery vertex v𝑣v of G4subscript𝐺4G_{4} with t2<v<t1subscript𝑡2𝑣subscript𝑡1t_{2}<v<t_{1} is placed above\nthe line (s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}), using the shift method as described in\nLemma 1, with the following exception. If there\nis a bucket in the canonical ordering with vertices y𝑦y and z𝑧z, so that t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is the rightmost lower\nneighbor of z𝑧z, then there is a quadrangle (x,y,z,t2)𝑥𝑦𝑧subscript𝑡2(x,y,z,t_{2}) in the\nplanar skeleton, so that x𝑥x is the leftmost lower neighbor of y𝑦y\nand (y,t2)𝑦subscript𝑡2(y,t_{2}) is crossed by (x,z)𝑥𝑧(x,z) in G𝐺G. The previous\nalgorithm  draws edge (y,z)𝑦𝑧(y,z) as a\nhorizontal line of length two. We draw it with slope h/(h+2)ℎℎ2h/(h+2), so\nthat (x,y,z,t2)𝑥𝑦𝑧subscript𝑡2(x,y,z,t_{2}) is a strictly convex quadrangle. This is achieved\nby 2​h2ℎ2h extra shifts for t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, so that y𝑦y is placed at (h,h)ℎℎ(h,h)\nfrom its former position. Edges (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) and (t2,z)subscript𝑡2𝑧(t_{2},z)\nhave slope +1 and -1,\nrespectively, when y𝑦y and z𝑧z are placed. The slope\nof (x,t2)𝑥subscript𝑡2(x,t_{2}) is negative if x≠s𝑥𝑠x\\neq s, since x𝑥x is placed\nafter t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} in this case. If there is a quadrangle (s,y,z,t2)𝑠𝑦𝑧subscript𝑡2(s,y,z,t_{2}) just above\n(s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}), then edge (s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) has slope h/(3​h+4)ℎ3ℎ4h/(3h+4) at\nthe placement of y𝑦y and z𝑧z, which is less than the slope of\nh/(h+2)ℎℎ2h/(h+2) for (y,z)𝑦𝑧(y,z).\nLater on, edges are flattened by the shift method, which reduces the angular\nresolution, whereas a positive angle between adjacent adjacent edges is\npreserved.\nIf there is a triangle (a,b,t2)𝑎𝑏subscript𝑡2(a,b,t_{2}) in the 1-planar drawing of G1subscript𝐺1G_{1},\nthen t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is the rightmost lower neighbor of b𝑏b, so that\n(t2,b)subscript𝑡2𝑏(t_{2},b) has slope -1 when b𝑏b is placed. The slope of\n(a,b)𝑎𝑏(a,b) is at least one if it is positive. It may be negative. Since only techniques from the shift method   are used, there is a straight-line strictly convex\ndrawing of the planar skeleton of G𝐺G (or G−superscript𝐺G^{-}) on a grid of size\nat most h​(4​n−8)×h​(2​n−4)ℎ4𝑛8ℎ2𝑛4h(4n-8)\\times h(2n-4), where hℎh is the vertical distance\nbetween s𝑠s and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}.\nIn this drawing, edge (s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) has slope α𝛼\\alpha\nwith h4​h​n4≤α<1ℎ4ℎsubscript𝑛4𝛼1\\frac{h}{4hn_{4}}\\leq\\alpha<1,\nwhere n4subscript𝑛4n_{4} is the number of vertices of G4subscript𝐺4G_{4} in the interior of the triangle\n(s,t1,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2(s,t_{1},t_{2}), since t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is\nshifted horizontally at most 4​h4ℎ4h units per vertex of G4subscript𝐺4G_{4}\naccording to Lemma 1. The height hℎh is bounded\nby 1≤h≤2​n2−41ℎ2subscript𝑛241\\leq h\\leq 2n_{2}-4, since only vertices of G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} shift\nv2subscript𝑣2v_{2} relative to s𝑠s, where n2subscript𝑛2n_{2} is the set of vertices of G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}.\nThe length of an\nuncrossed edge is at least one and at most h​(4​n−8)<8​n2ℎ4𝑛88superscript𝑛2h(4n-8)<8n^{2}.\nThe crossed edges are inserted into the quadrangles from which they\nwere removed, so that there is a 1-planar drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-}. This drawing is modified by moving t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} above t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}, so that the missing edge\n(v1,t2)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑡2(v_{1},t_{2}) can be added for a\nspecialized straight-line biplanar drawing Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G).\nNote that t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} has further neighbors only in G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} and G4subscript𝐺4G_{4}, since\n(s,t1,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2(s,t_{1},t_{2}) is a separating triangle and s𝑠s is the leftmost\nlower neighbor of t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}.\nExtend edge\n(s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) until it crosses the horizontal line\ntwo units above t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}, and move t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} to the\ngrid point at or next right of the crossing point. Thereby,\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is moved x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} units to the right and y2subscript𝑦2y_{2} units upward.\nEdge (s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) is flattened, since y2/x2≤α≤y2/(x2−1)subscript𝑦2subscript𝑥2𝛼subscript𝑦2subscript𝑥21y_{2}/x_{2}\\leq\\alpha\\leq y_{2}/(x_{2}-1).\nBy the shift method, the vertices of G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}\nare shifted horizontally with t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, that is x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} units to the\nright.\nNext, reroute edge (t2,v1)subscript𝑡2subscript𝑣1(t_{2},v_{1}) from t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} through the grid\npoint one\nabove t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} until it crosses the x-axis, that is the horizontal\nline through v1subscript𝑣1v_{1}\nand v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}, and shift v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} to the grid point at or just left of\nthe crossing point. Edge (t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}) is rerouted and is drawn\nalong a ray through the grid point one unit above G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}, which is\nobtained by the tangent from t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} to the convex hull of the drawing\nof G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}. Then v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} is shifted horizontally to the grid point at or\nnext right of the crossing point of the ray and the x-axis, see\nFig. 6(c). Finally, shift v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} or v2subscript𝑣2v_{2}\nhorizontally so that there is an isosceles triangle with top t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}. Edge (t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}) is colored red. Edges incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are\ncolored black, and their crossing edges are colored red. All\nuncrossed edges and all crossed edges incident to v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} are colored\nblack, whereas the coloring of the remaining pairs of crossed edges\ncan be chosen arbitrarily.\nThis completes the construction of Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G). We claim that Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G)\nis a specialized straight-line biplanar grid drawing. Since there is\na straight-line 1-planar grid drawing for G−superscript𝐺G^{-}, it suffices to\nconsider the modifications for Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G). By construction, all\nedges are drawn straight line and all vertices are placed on grid\npoints. Red edges do not cross, since they do not cross in the\n1-planar drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-} and (t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}) crosses only edges\nincident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, which are black. Such an edge may be crossed by\na red edge in the interior of a convex quadrangle.\nTwo black edges do not cross if none of them is incident to\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, since they are drawn as in Γ​(G−)Γsuperscript𝐺\\Gamma(G^{-}), or a vertex of the\nedge (or both) is shifted horizontally if a vertex is in G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}.\nRecall that horizontal shifts preserve planarity and convexity, as\nobserved at several places   . Clearly, two edges incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} do not cross,\nsince the edges are not drawn on top of one another. It remains to\nconsider a black edge incident to t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} and black edges of G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}\nand G4subscript𝐺4G_{4}, see Fig. 6. Vertex t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} and the vertices of G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} are shifted x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} units to\nthe right, and then t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is shifted y2subscript𝑦2y_{2} units upward to its final\nposition. As observed by de Fraysseix et al. ,\nsuch shifts do not create crossings, and they preserve strict\nconvexity. In particular, a strict convexity of a quadrangle (t2,s,u,u′)subscript𝑡2𝑠𝑢superscript𝑢′(t_{2},s,u,u^{\\prime}) with vertices u,u′∈G2𝑢superscript𝑢′subscript𝐺2u,u^{\\prime}\\in G_{2} is preserved, so that the\ncrossed edge (t2,u)subscript𝑡2𝑢(t_{2},u) is drawn straight-line in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G)\nand is crossed by the red edge (s,u′)𝑠superscript𝑢′(s,u^{\\prime}). Hence, edges\n(t2,v)subscript𝑡2𝑣(t_{2},v) and (u,u′)𝑢superscript𝑢′(u,u^{\\prime}) with u∈G2𝑢subscript𝐺2u\\in G_{2} cross in\nΓ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) if and only if they cross in in the 1-planar drawing of\nG−superscript𝐺G^{-}. At last consider edges (v,t2)𝑣subscript𝑡2(v,t_{2}) with v∈G4𝑣subscript𝐺4v\\in G_{4} in the\n1-planar drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-}. Vertex v𝑣v is placed above t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} in\nΓ​(G−)Γsuperscript𝐺\\Gamma(G^{-}), but it is below t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) after moving\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, so that the slope of (v,t2)𝑣subscript𝑡2(v,t_{2}) changes from negative\nto positive, see Fig. 6. We claim that moving\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} does not create new crossings with edges in G4subscript𝐺4G_{4}, since\n(s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) is flat and horizontal edges in quadrangles with\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are lifted. Consider the drawing of G4subscript𝐺4G_{4} without vertex\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, which is obtained from the 1-planar drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-} by\nremoving t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}. The part of the outer face of Γ​(G−t2)Γ𝐺subscript𝑡2\\Gamma(G-t_{2}) and\nΓ​(G−−t2)Γsuperscript𝐺subscript𝑡2\\Gamma(G^{-}-t_{2}) between s𝑠s and t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} consists of the neighbors\nu0,…,ursubscript𝑢0…subscript𝑢𝑟u_{0},\\ldots,u_{r} of t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} in clockwise order, so that\ns=u0𝑠subscript𝑢0s=u_{0} and t1=ursubscript𝑡1subscript𝑢𝑟t_{1}=u_{r}. These vertices are ordered in the canonical ordering, so that\nuisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} is placed after ui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1}.\nThere are three cases: (1) ui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1} is the leftmost lower neighbor\nof uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i}, (2) there is a quadrangle with vertices ui−2,ui−1,uisubscript𝑢𝑖2subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖u_{i-2},u_{i-1},u_{i}\nand t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, so that (ui−1,t2)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑡2(u_{i-1},t_{2}) is crossed by (ui−2,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖2subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-2},u_{i}) or (3)\nui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1} is in the under-set of uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i}.\nIn case (1), uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} is placed on the +1 diagonal through ui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1},\nso that (ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}) has slope +1 when it is created. In\ncase (2), edge (ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}) is lifted and is not drawn as\na horizontal line, as in . Edge\n(ui,ui−2)subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖2(u_{i},u_{i-2}) is red, since its crossing edge is incident to\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2}. Edge\n(ui−2,ui−1)subscript𝑢𝑖2subscript𝑢𝑖1(u_{i-2},u_{i-1}) has slope +1 and\n(ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}) has slope h/(h+2)ℎℎ2h/(h+2) when\nui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1} and uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} are placed. At this moment, edge\n(s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) has slope h/Wiℎsubscript𝑊𝑖h/W_{i} so that Wi>h+2subscript𝑊𝑖ℎ2W_{i}>h+2. In case (3), vertex ui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1} is in the under-set of uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i},\nso that (the slope of) edge (ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}) is fixed, and is\nonly shifted from now on. Its slope is greater than one or may be\nnegative, which is even simpler, since ui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1} is visible from\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) in the sense that there is an unobstructed\n(uncrossed) line of sight between ui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} if the red\nedge (t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}) is ignored. Consider case (2) for the drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-}. Cases (1) and (3) are\nsimilar. Edge (ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}) has slope h/wiℎsubscript𝑤𝑖h/w_{i} and edge\n(s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) has slope h/Wiℎsubscript𝑊𝑖h/W_{i} with wi<Wisubscript𝑤𝑖subscript𝑊𝑖w_{i}<W_{i}, when edge and\n(ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}) is drawn first.\nEdge (ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}) is flattened if vertices are placed above\nit, so that ui−1subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i-1} and uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} are shifted apart. Vertex t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is\nshifted by the same quantity. Hence, the slope of (s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2})\nremains less than the slope of (ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}), since h/wi<h/Wiℎsubscript𝑤𝑖ℎsubscript𝑊𝑖h/w_{i}<h/W_{i} implies h/(wi+x)<h/(Wi+x)ℎsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑥ℎsubscript𝑊𝑖𝑥h/(w_{i}+x)<h/(W_{i}+x) if there is a horizontal shift by x𝑥x units.\nIn other words, edge (s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) is flatter that\nany edge (ui−1,ui)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖(u_{i-1},u_{i}) for\nwith 1≤i<r1𝑖𝑟1\\leq i<r. By induction, edge (ui,t2)subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑡2(u_{i},t_{2}) with 1≤i<r1𝑖𝑟1\\leq i<r is\nuncrossed in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) if the red edges (t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}) and\n(ui−1,ui+1)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖1(u_{i-1},u_{i+1}) in quadrangles (ui−1,ui,ui+1,t2)subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝑡2(u_{i-1},u_{i},u_{i+1},t_{2}) are ignored. In other words, moving t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} in\ndirection of (s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) preserves the visibility of its\nneighbors in G4subscript𝐺4G_{4}. Hence, the obtained drawing Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) is\nbiplanar.\nIn addition, the edges incident to v1subscript𝑣1v_{1} are black, edge (t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}) is\ncrossed by edges of a fan at t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, and edges incident to\nt2subscript𝑡2t_{2} are crossed twice if they are crossed in the 1-planar drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-}.\nHence, the drawing is specialized. Consider the size of the drawing. The 1-planar drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-} has\nsize at most h​(4​n−8)×h​(2​n−4)ℎ4𝑛8ℎ2𝑛4h(4n-8)\\times h(2n-4), where h≤2​n−4ℎ2𝑛4h\\leq 2n-4 is the difference\nbetween s𝑠s and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} in y-dimension.\nEdge (s,t2)𝑠subscript𝑡2(s,t_{2}) has slope at least 1/4​n14𝑛1/4n. Vertex t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} is at\nmost h​(2​n−4)ℎ2𝑛4h(2n-4) units above t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}.\nHence, t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is shifted at\nmost 16​n316superscript𝑛316n^{3} units to the right. The ray from t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} along t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}\ncrosses the x-axis at most 128​n5128superscript𝑛5128n^{5} units to the left of v1subscript𝑣1v_{1},\nsince its slope is at least 1/16​n3116superscript𝑛31/16n^{3} and t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} is at height at most 8​n28superscript𝑛28n^{2}. Similarly, the ray\nfrom t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} along the top of G3subscript𝐺3G_{3} to v2subscript𝑣2v_{2} crosses the x-axis at\nmost 32​n432superscript𝑛432n^{4} units to the right of t1subscript𝑡1t_{1}. Hence, the width of the\ndrawing is O​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}), and the height is O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}). The upper bound on the length of an edge is O​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}). The lower\nbound is one for an uncrossed edge, since there is a grid drawing.\nAn uncrossed edge of G𝐺G is crossed in Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) if it is incident\nto t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} and is crossed by (t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}), see\nFig. 6(c). The first segment from t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} has length\nat least two, since t2subscript𝑡2t_{2} is two units above t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and the slope of\n(t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}) is negative. The crossing point of\n(t1,v2)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑣2(t_{1},v_{2}) and (t2,v)subscript𝑡2𝑣(t_{2},v) for a vertex in G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} or G4subscript𝐺4G_{4}\nis at least one unit above v𝑣v, where t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} is placed at least two\nunits above the vertices of G4subscript𝐺4G_{4} in the drawing of G−superscript𝐺G^{-}, so that\nthe second segment of (t2,v)subscript𝑡2𝑣(t_{2},v) has length at least one. If ⟨u,v⟩𝑢𝑣\\langle u,v\\rangle is a separation pair with components H0,…,Hrsubscript𝐻0…subscript𝐻𝑟H_{0},\\ldots,H_{r}, then (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is an uncrossed edge if the graph\nis planar-maximal 1-planar or it can be rerouted so that it is\nuncrossed, see Fig. 7. There is a first inner\nface next to (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) for Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i} if the inner components Hjsubscript𝐻𝑗H_{j}\nwith j>i≥0𝑗𝑖0j>i\\geq 0 are removed. Hence, Hi+1,…,Hrsubscript𝐻𝑖1…subscript𝐻𝑟H_{i+1},\\ldots,H_{r} are\ndrawn in the interior of the first inner face for Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}. This face\nis a triangle whose third vertex is a crossing point or the first\nvertex of Hi−superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}^{-}. In a biplanar drawing, the triangle can be\nintersected by a red edge from a previous component, for example if\nv𝑣v is the top of the outer triangle, as stated in\nLemmas 2 and 3 and\nillustrated in Figs. 5(b) and 6(c).\nSince the last vertex can be chosen among the two top vertices of a\nW-configuration, for every inner component Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}, there is a\nspecialized biplanar drawing so that the edges incident to v𝑣v are\nblack. The vertices of an uncrossed edge are a candidate for a separation\npair. In fact, there is a 1-planar drawing if every uncrossed edge\ne𝑒e of a 1-planar drawing is substituted by a 1-planar graph Gesubscript𝐺𝑒G_{e},\nso that e𝑒e is uncrossed in Gesubscript𝐺𝑒G_{e}. For example, edge e𝑒e can be\nsubstituted by K6subscript𝐾6K_{6}, drawn as a W-configuration. In general, this\nproperty does not hold for the vertices of a crossed edge, since the\naddition of a component violates 1-planarity or the edge is\nuncrossed in another drawing. A 1-planar graph admits a specialized straight-line biplanar\ndrawing if it has a single separation pair with an inner and an\nouter component. The drawing of the outer component is scaled by\nO​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}) and segments of uncrossed edges have length at least one. Suppose that ⟨u,v⟩𝑢𝑣\\langle u,v\\rangle is a separation pair so that\nG−{u,v}𝐺𝑢𝑣G-\\{u,v\\} partitions into an outer component H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} and an inner\ncomponent H1subscript𝐻1H_{1}. Edge (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is uncrossed in a 1-planar\ndrawing of G𝐺G. It is the uncrossed base of H1subscript𝐻1H_{1}. It is uncrossed\nin a specialized straight-line biplanar drawing of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} if u𝑢u and\nv𝑣v are not part of a W-configuration of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} by\nLemma 1. Otherwise, there is a red edge\nthat crosses black edges incident to v𝑣v by\nLemmas 2 and 3, see\nFig. 8(a). Independently, compute specialized straight-line biplanar drawings\nΓ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}) and Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}), which each include edge\n(u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v). Let w1subscript𝑤1w_{1} and h1subscriptℎ1h_{1} be the width and the height of\nΓ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}), so that\n(u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is a horizontal line of length w1subscript𝑤1w_{1}.\nIn the drawing of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} it is a line of length w0subscript𝑤0w_{0} with slope\nα𝛼\\alpha. The first inner face of Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}) next to\n(u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is a triangle with height h0subscriptℎ0h_{0}. By\nLemmas 2 and  3, the\nwidth and height of Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}) and Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) is at most 128​n5128superscript𝑛5128n^{5} and 2​n22superscript𝑛22n^{2}, respectively, and the first inner face has height\nh≥1/(256​n5)ℎ1256superscript𝑛5h\\geq 1/(256n^{5}), since it is a triangle (v1,v2,p)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2𝑝(v_{1},v_{2},p), where\n(v1,v2)subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2(v_{1},v_{2}) is a horizontal line of length at most 128​n5128superscript𝑛5128n^{5}\nand p𝑝p is the third vertex one unit above (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) or the\ncrossing point of edges with slope at least 1/(128​n5)1128superscript𝑛51/(128n^{5}). Scale Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) in x-dimension by w0/w1subscript𝑤0subscript𝑤1w_{0}/w_{1} and\nin y-dimension by h0/2​h1subscriptℎ02subscriptℎ1h_{0}/2h_{1}. Then Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) fits into\nthe first inner face of Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}) if it is rotated by α𝛼\\alpha.\nThe line for edge (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) coincides in both drawings and the\nheight of Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) is scaled down to half of the height of the\nfirst inner face. Clearly,\nedges of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} and H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} do not cross. In reverse, the drawing of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} is\nscaled by O​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}) if H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} is drawn as described in\nLemma 3. If (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is crossed in Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}), then there is a\nW-configuration, so that one of u𝑢u and v𝑣v is the top of a\nW-configuration by Lemmas 2 and\n3. Assume that edges incident to v𝑣v are crossed\nby a red edge e𝑒e in Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}), that is v=t2𝑣subscript𝑡2v=t_{2} in\nFigs. 5(c) and 6(c). The edges incident\nto v𝑣v are black in Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}) and Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) by the\nspecialization.\nLet p𝑝p be the crossing point of e𝑒e and (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v). First,\nΓ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) is scaled down so that its base (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is\nmapped onto the line between u𝑢u and a point in the middle between\nu𝑢u and p𝑝p in Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}), see Fig. 8(c). As before,\nΓ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) is compressed, so that it fits into the first inner\nface of Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}), which is a quadrangle with a segment of e𝑒e\nin its boundary. In reverse, the scaling of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} is bounded by\nO​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}). Thereafter, apply the shift method to vertex v𝑣v in\nΓ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) and move it to (the copy of) v𝑣v in Γ​(H0)Γsubscript𝐻0\\Gamma(H_{0}).\nThereby, all edges incident to v𝑣v in Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) cross the red\nedge e𝑒e. The segment of an edge between u𝑢u and the crossing point\nwith e𝑒e has length at least one if Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) is unscaled, since\nv𝑣v is at half the distance between u𝑢u and p𝑝p before its shift. By\nthe previous lemmas, every segment of an uncrossed edge of G𝐺G has\nlength at least one. Since Γ​(H1)Γsubscript𝐻1\\Gamma(H_{1}) is specialized, the edges incident to\nv𝑣v are black. Hence, the combined drawing of H1subscript𝐻1H_{1} and H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} is\nspecialized, straight-line and biplanar. We now proceed by induction on the number of inner components at\nevery separation pair, and by recursion on inner components at\nseparation pairs. Every 1-planar graph has a tri-fan-crossing straight-line biplanar\ndrawing. The drawing uses numbers with O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) many digits and can be computed in linear time. Assume that G𝐺G is planar-maximal 1-planar. Otherwise, use the\nplanarization and compute a planar-maximal augmentation from a\n1-planar drawing.\nDecompose G𝐺G into its 3-connected components and\nstore it in a decomposition tree, which may be an SPQR-tree\n. Let H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} be the outer component which\nremains from G𝐺G if all inner components at separation pairs are\nremoved. Then H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} is triconnected. Compute a straight-line\nspecialized biplanar grid drawing of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0} according to\nLemmas 1, 2 or\n3. Let H1,…,Hksubscript𝐻1…subscript𝐻𝑘H_{1},\\ldots,H_{k} be inner components at a separation pair\n⟨u,v⟩𝑢𝑣\\langle u,v\\rangle of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0}. Then (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v) is an uncrossed edge\nof the 1-planar drawing of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0}. By induction, every Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i} admits a\nspecialized straight-line biplanar drawing with a horizontal line\nfor (u,v)𝑢𝑣(u,v). If Hisubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i} has a pair of crossed edge in its outer\nface, then choose the last vertex so that the edges incident to v𝑣v\nare black. By induction, there are specialized biplanar drawings\nΓ​(H0,…,Hi)Γsubscript𝐻0…subscript𝐻𝑖\\Gamma(H_{0},\\ldots,H_{i}) and Γ​(Hi+1)Γsubscript𝐻𝑖1\\Gamma(H_{i+1}), which can be\ncomposed to a specialized biplanar drawing of H0,…,Hi+1subscript𝐻0…subscript𝐻𝑖1H_{0},\\ldots,H_{i+1}\nby Lemma 4. By induction there is a\ntri-fan-crossing straight-line biplanar drawing for the inner\ncomponents at a separation pair of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0}. Note that two separation pairs are independent in the sense that\nthere are distinct first inner faces, so that the biplanar drawings\nof components at two separation pairs do not interfere. By induction\nand Lemma 4, there is a tri-fan-crossing\nstraight-line biplanar drawing Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G). A 1-planar graph with a single W-configuration can be drawn on a\ngrid of size O​(n7)𝑂superscript𝑛7O(n^{7}) by Lemma 3. For every\nsingle inner component there is a scaling by O​(n5)𝑂superscript𝑛5O(n^{5}) by\nLemma 4. Otherwise, a scaling by O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2})\nsuffices. By induction and recursion this leads to a scaling of\nO​(nn)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑛O(n^{n}), since at least six vertices are necessary for a\nW-configuration. Hence, the coordinates of the drawing have O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) many digits. It takes linear time to compute Γ​(G)Γ𝐺\\Gamma(G) from a 1-planar drawing\nof G𝐺G, since every step can be done in linear time, such as the\nplanar-maximal augmentation, the SPQR-decomposition, the biplanar\ndrawing of single inner components, and the scaling by an affine\ntransformation. Every 1-planar graph has geometric thickness at most two. By a planarity test, we obtain: The thickness and the geometric thickness of a 1-planar graph can be\ncomputed in linear time.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: convexity for inner quadrangles is obtained by extra shifts,\nso that there is a straight-line planar drawing of the planar\nskeleton on a grid of size at most (4​n−8)×(2​n−4)4𝑛82𝑛4(4n-8)\\times(2n-4)\n [ref]45, see Fig. 4.
