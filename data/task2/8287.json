      "content": "Paper Title: Maximal Extractable Value in Decentralized Finance: Taxonomy, Detection, and Mitigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) , powered by blockchain technology, offers financial services, such as investing, lending loans, and trading assets, to various stakeholders without the need for intermediary brokers. This creates a decentralized, secure, transparent, and traceable financial ecosystem. According to a Skyquest report, the DeFi market size is expected to reach 48.02 billion USD by 2031, up from 23.99 billion USD in 2023, a compound annual growth rate of 9.06%111https://www.skyquestt.com/report/decentralized-finance-market, accessed on 19 September 2024. Furthermore, as of September 2022, the total value locked in the DeFi ecosystem exceeded 82 billion USD222https://defillama.com/, accessed on 19 September 2024, with the Ethereum network accounting more than 45 billion USD (approximately 56%). Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) are one of the prominent applications of DeFi, enabling users to directly swap tokens using smart contracts [ref]2. Most DEXes operate on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate trustless and automated transactions. However, in the Ethereum network, transactions are stored in a public mempool before they are included in a block. This creates profitable opportunities for network participants, referred to as searchers, who can submit new transactions by observing pending financial transactions to gain additional revenue. These searchers maximize their profits by manipulating gas prices to influence the order of their transactions within the block. This additional value extracted from the blockchain network is termed Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). MEV searchers can be the block producers (i.e., miners in Proof of Work (PoW) and validators in Proof of Stake (PoS)), other network participants, or a bot. However, block producers have a unique advantage, as they can include transactions in blocks without paying high gas prices . Furthermore, the transition from PoW to PoS in Ethereum has significantly reduced block producer rewards, further luring block producers to engage in MEV activities . MEV could result in major financial losses, network congestion, increased gas prices, and blockchain inefficiency  . Before Ethereum’s transition to PoS in September 2022, around 440,000 ETH in MEV was extracted. Since the transition, approximately 180,000 ETH has been extracted up until May 2023333https://milkroad.com/guide/mev/, accessed on 19 September 2024. However, not all MEV transactions are detrimental to the DeFi ecosystem. Some can destabilize consensus mechanisms and cause economic harm, while others may even stabilize financial markets [ref]6. Therefore, understanding, detecting, and mitigating MEV is critical to ensure the efficiency and stability of the DeFi ecosystem. Several surveys have explored various aspects of MEV, including transaction types and mitigation strategies  [ref]8 [ref]6  . In particular,  classifies MEV transactions, while [ref]8 [ref]6 emphasize on mitigation techniques. In contrast,   cover both transaction types and mitigation strategies. However, none have thoroughly examined all transaction types, detection approaches, and mitigation strategies. This comprehensive survey addresses this gap by presenting a novel taxonomy of MEV transaction types supported by real-world examples from the Ethereum network. It also explores MEV detection approaches and mitigation strategies and examines various simulation and extraction methods. The main contributions of this survey are as follows. We introduce a novel and comprehensive taxonomy of MEV transactions, supported by real Ethereum transaction examples for each identified MEV type. The taxonomy clearly distinguishes between value-diverting MEV transactions, which can lead to financial loss and network instability, and value-creating MEV transactions, which can stabilize markets or enhance efficiency. This distinction provides clarity on the dual nature of MEV activities and lays the foundation for discussions on mitigation and detection strategies. We present a critical comparative analysis of the various MEV detection approaches proposed for different types of MEV transactions, highlighting their effectiveness in identifying these transaction types. We provide an in-depth analysis of various MEV mitigation strategies, such as transaction ordering solutions, privacy-preserving public pools, and private pools. By identifying the specific limitations of these strategies, we offer a critical assessment of their real-world applicability and potential areas for improvement. We explore existing MEV simulation frameworks and extraction methods, offering a comprehensive overview of how these tools model and replicate real-world MEV scenarios. We critically examine the major challenges in MEV mitigation and detection, such as centralization, latency, layer-2 MEV, and multi-address MEV. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions paving the way for a more secure and efficient DeFi system. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides essential background on Ethereum, DEXes, and MEV, enabling readers to gain a clearer understanding of the key concepts. Section 3 reviews existing related surveys on MEV, highlighting gaps in the literature. In Section 4, we describe the methodology used to conduct this survey. Section 5 introduces and synthesizes the proposed taxonomy of MEV transactions. Sections 6 and 7 focus on MEV detection approaches and mitigation strategies, respectively. Section 8 explores MEV simulation and extraction methods. Section 9 addresses the challenges associated with MEV mitigation and detection, along with potential solutions. Finally, Section 10 concludes the survey.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: accounting more than 45 billion USD (approximately 56%).
