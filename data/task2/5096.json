      "content": "Paper Title: TuRaN: True Random Number Generation Using Supply Voltage Underscaling in SRAMs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTrue random number generators (TRNGs) are indispensable parts of various modern security-critical systems, especially cryptographic applications such as session and temporary key generation to initialize secure and private communications, secured servers, VPN access, and authentication-based applications    . These applications base their security on the stability and unpredictability of random numbers. A failure in the RNG part of the devices due to an adversary attack can jeopardize the security of the whole system. Prior works [ref]24  show that systems that have poor-quality (i.e., predictable) RNGs can be significantly affected by RNG attacks. Therefore, high-quality RNGs are essential as a countermeasure against hardware attacks to maintain the security of systems. TRNGs with high-throughput and low-latency are becoming a necessity for modern commodity devices, in particular, secure data-centric systems    . These systems are often equipped with dedicated TRNG hardware to be able to sustain their secure operations without degrading their performance. Many prior works propose different hardware-based TRNGs for such systems, including ring oscillator-based [ref]106 , chaos-based  0 , and delay chain-based  3 TRNGs. However, these hardware-based TRNGs have the following constraints: they (i) are not feasible for commodity systems because they need additional and high-complexity hardware, or (ii) cannot provide random numbers with high-throughput at low-latency. To address these issues several memory-based (e.g., DRAMs, SRAMs, NVMs) TRNGs are proposed  [ref]37   9  as they are prevalently in use throughout a wide range of computing systems. SRAM has two major advantages over other memory devices: (i) it is more secure because it does not require an off-chip transfer to send the generated random bits to the CPU (i.e., SRAM is an on-chip component), and (ii) SRAM is used in every CMOS-based systems and can provide true random numbers in many devices (e.g., RFID tag circuits 9, large-scale systems ). Hence, SRAM-based TRNGs offer a substrate to enable true random number applications for commodity systems. Prior SRAM-based TRNGs    5    9    only use the start-up i.e., initial values in SRAM cells that are observed immediately after the SRAM device is powered on. At the power-up state, the initial value of an SRAM cell may differ due to the process variation. Prior work  shows that 5%-15% of all SRAM cells are partially-skewed and less than 5% of them exhibit high randomness. These cells that behave randomly are used as an entropy source of true random number generation. These works propose viable TRNG mechanisms, however, because they depend on expensive power-up cycles and have low entropy in SRAM cells, they suffer from four major weaknesses that make them impractical for real system integration:\nexisting SRAM-based TRNGs (i) cannot generate true random numbers in a streaming manner, (ii) incur high latency due to the period of power-up cycle (e.g. ∼250​m​ssimilar-toabsent250𝑚𝑠{\\sim}250\\>ms ), (iii) cannot generate true random numbers with high-throughput  and (iv) consume high energy for low-power energy-efficient devices. We posit based on our analysis of prior works that an SRAM-based TRNG needs to satisfy the following properties: It must consistently generate true random numbers in a streaming manner with high-throughput at low-latency for high-performance systems. It needs to consume low energy to generate true random numbers for energy-efficient devices. It must be practical to implement on commodity devices from low-power edge devices to the high-throughput large-scale systems. Our goal in this work is to design an SRAM-based TRNG that meets all the above specifications to generate truly random numbers that are widely available for commodity devices.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: security on the stability and unpredictability of random numbers.
