      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Mitigating Architecture Overfitting in Dataset Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets: The training sets in the experiments are the distilled datasets of CIFAR10, CIFAR100 [ref]49 and Tiny-ImageNet , but the test sets are their respective original test sets. To better validate the effectiveness of our method, we use the distilled images synthesized by different dataset distillation algorithms, e.g., neural Feature Regression with Pooling (FRePo) [ref]17 and Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) [ref]18. In addition, we evaluate the performance of our method in different numbers of instances per class (IPC), e.g., 1, 10 and 50. Models: The networks used to synthesize the distilled images (training networks) in FRePo and MTT are 3-layer CNN. Consistent with the hyperparameters reported in the paper, the output channels of hidden layers of the network used in FRePo are 128, 256 and 512, respectively. However, in MTT, all the output channels of hidden layers are set to 128. ResNet18, ResNet50 , AlexNet  and VGG11  are adopted in the evaluation, they are thereby called test networks. The hyperparameters of networks are the same as those set in [ref]18. Note that when training networks on distilled images of FRePo and MTT, batch and instance normalization layers are adopted in networks following the settings of [ref]17 [ref]18, respectively. DropPath: As shown in Algorithm 1, the decaying factor of keep rate γ=0.1𝛾0.1\\gamma=0.1, minimum keep rate pm​i​n=0.5subscript𝑝𝑚𝑖𝑛0.5p_{min}=0.5, final keep rate pf​i​n​a​l=0.8subscript𝑝𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙0.8p_{final}=0.8, period of decay T=500𝑇500T=500, warmup period W=50𝑊50W=50, stabilization epoch S=3000𝑆3000S=3000. The total epochs N𝑁N is set to 400040004000. In the improved shortcut, the pooling area depends on the stride of 1×1111\\times 1 convolutional layer in the original one. e.g., if the stride of 1×1111\\times 1 convolutional layer in the original shortcut is 222, we use a 2×2222\\times 2 max pooling. Knowledge distillation: As shown in Eq. 2, the temperature factor τ=1.5𝜏1.5\\tau=1.5, and the weight factor α=0.5𝛼0.5\\alpha=0.5. If not specifically indicated, the default teacher model is the 3-layer CNN. Note that the teacher model is trained on the same data set as the student model. Periodical learning rate: In Eq. 3, the maximum learning rate l​rm​a​x=5×10−5𝑙subscript𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥5superscript105lr_{max}=5\\times 10^{-5}, the base decaying factor for learning rate λ=0.8𝜆0.8\\lambda=0.8. The period of the cosine function Tm​a​xsubscript𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥T_{max} and the number of warmup epochs Tw​a​r​msubscript𝑇𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚T_{warm} are 100010001000 and 505050, respectively. Optimizer: Lion  is adopted in our method, where weight decay λw​d=5×10−3subscript𝜆𝑤𝑑5superscript103\\lambda_{wd}=5\\times 10^{-3}, coefficient β1=0.95subscript𝛽10.95\\beta_{1}=0.95, and β2=0.98subscript𝛽20.98\\beta_{2}=0.98. Augmentation: There are color jittering, cropping, cutout, flipping, scaling, and rotating in the augmentation pool, we sample more operations instead of just one as in [ref]18. Training: For CIFAR10, the batch sizes for different IPCs are 10 (IPC=1), 100 (IPC=10) and 128 (IPC=50), respectively. For CIFAR100, the batch sizes are 100 (IPC=1), 256 (IPC=10) and 256 (IPC=50), respectively. Cross-entropy is adopted as the loss function in our experiments. Since the labels of images are learnable in FRePo, we divide them with a temperature factor t=0.3𝑡0.3t=0.3 for CIFAR10, 0.040.040.04 for CIFAR100, and and 0.020.020.02 for Tiny-ImageNet.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: Datasets: The training sets in the experiments are the distilled datasets of CIFAR10, CIFAR100 [ref]49 and Tiny-ImageNet , but the test sets are their respective original test sets.
