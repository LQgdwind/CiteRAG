      "content": "Paper Title: Selective compression learning of latent representations for variable-rate image compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur SCR method can be combined with adaptive quantization such as Cui et al.  and Chen et al. [ref]23, on top of several compression architectures with hyper-encoder and hyper-decoder [ref]6 such as the models in [ref]6      [ref]12, as shown in Figure 1a. In this paper, we apply our SCR method for several reference compression models, Hyperprior [ref]6, Mean-scale , and Context , to show its effectiveness with generality. In the architecture with hyper-encoder and hyper-decoder [ref]6, input image 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} is transformed into a representation 𝒚𝒚\\bm{y} using an encoder network, and the hyper encoder and decoder are used to code the distribution parameters for the quantized representation 𝒚^bold-^𝒚\\bm{\\hat{y}} of 𝒚𝒚\\bm{y} as a side information, with which 𝒚^bold-^𝒚\\bm{\\hat{y}} is entropy-coded and decoded. The representation 𝒚^bold-^𝒚\\bm{\\hat{y}} is then reconstructed into an image 𝒙′superscript𝒙′\\bm{x}^{\\prime} through a decoder network. Upon this base compression architecture, we exploit two additional elements: adaptive quantization and selective compression to enable variable-rate compression. The selection of representation elements in the encoder side is expressed as follows: where 𝒚^qssuperscriptsubscriptbold-^𝒚𝑞𝑠\\bm{\\hat{y}}_{q}^{s} is a set of the selected elements of 𝒚^qsubscriptbold-^𝒚𝑞\\bm{\\hat{y}}_{q} for a given target quality level q𝑞q and A​d​a​Qq​(⋅)𝐴𝑑𝑎subscript𝑄𝑞⋅AdaQ_{q}(\\cdot) is a target quality-adaptive quantization operator where A​d​a​Qq​(𝒚)=R​o​u​n​d​(𝒚/𝑸​𝑽q)𝐴𝑑𝑎subscript𝑄𝑞𝒚𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝒚𝑸subscript𝑽𝑞AdaQ_{q}(\\bm{y})=Round(\\bm{y}/\\bm{QV}_{q}) with a quantization vector 𝑸​𝑽q𝑸subscript𝑽𝑞\\bm{QV}_{q}. M​(⋅)𝑀⋅M(\\cdot) is an element selection operator for 𝒚^qsubscriptbold-^𝒚𝑞\\bm{\\hat{y}}_{q}, and m​(𝒛^,q)𝑚bold-^𝒛𝑞m(\\bm{\\hat{z}},q) represents a generated 3D binary mask for q𝑞q and quantized hyperprior 𝒛^bold-^𝒛\\bm{\\hat{z}} (Sec. 3.2). The representation 𝒚𝒚\\bm{y} is the output E​n​(𝒙)𝐸𝑛𝒙En(\\bm{x}) of the encoder network E​n​(⋅)𝐸𝑛⋅En(\\cdot) for an input image 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} in Figure 1a. It should be noted that 𝒚^qssuperscriptsubscriptbold-^𝒚𝑞𝑠\\bm{\\hat{y}}_{q}^{s} is entropy-coded and entropy-decoded using an entropy model based on a target quality dependent distribution Pqsubscript𝑃𝑞P_{q} (Sec. 3.3). The image reconstruction 𝒙′qsubscriptsuperscript𝒙bold-′𝑞\\bm{x^{\\prime}}_{q} in the decoder side is given as: where 𝒙′qsubscriptsuperscript𝒙bold-′𝑞\\bm{x^{\\prime}}_{q} is a reconstructed image for a given target quality level q𝑞q, as the output of the decoder network D​e​(⋅)𝐷𝑒⋅De(\\cdot), A​d​a​I​Qq​(⋅)𝐴𝑑𝑎𝐼subscript𝑄𝑞⋅AdaIQ_{q}(\\cdot) is an adaptive inverse-quantization operator that multiplies an inverse-quantization vector 𝑰​𝑸​𝑽q𝑰𝑸subscript𝑽𝑞\\bm{IQV}_{q} to input 𝒚˘qsubscriptbold-˘𝒚𝑞\\bm{\\breve{y}}_{q}, and R​e​(⋅)𝑅𝑒⋅Re(\\cdot) is a reshaping operator that converts the selected elements 𝒚^qssuperscriptsubscriptbold-^𝒚𝑞𝑠\\bm{\\hat{y}}_{q}^{s} in a 1D shape into the elements of a 3D-shaped representation in place by using the 3D binary mask m​(𝒛^,q)𝑚bold-^𝒛𝑞m(\\bm{\\hat{z}},q). For the unselected elements, the reshaping operator R​e​(⋅)𝑅𝑒⋅Re(\\cdot) places 00 values in the corresponding positions. It should be noted that the unselected elements are filled with 00 values for the Mean-scale  and Context  models that utilize 𝝁𝝁\\bm{\\mu} estimation as well as for the Hyperprior [ref]6 model. Example source codes for M​(⋅)𝑀⋅M(\\cdot) and R​e​(⋅)𝑅𝑒⋅Re(\\cdot) are provided in Appendix A.1. In Eqs. 1 and 2, the vector dimensionalities of 𝑸​𝑽q𝑸subscript𝑽𝑞\\bm{QV}_{q} and 𝑰​𝑸​𝑽q𝑰𝑸subscript𝑽𝑞\\bm{IQV}_{q} are both C𝒚subscript𝐶𝒚C_{\\bm{y}}, the number of channels in 𝒚𝒚\\bm{y}, so that the quantization of 𝒚𝒚\\bm{y} and the inverse quantization of 𝒚˘qsubscriptbold-˘𝒚𝑞\\bm{\\breve{y}}_{q} are performed channel-wise by the respective elements of 𝑸​𝑽q𝑸subscript𝑽𝑞\\bm{QV}_{q} and 𝑰​𝑸​𝑽q𝑰𝑸subscript𝑽𝑞\\bm{IQV}_{q}, respectively, as in the previous adaptive quantization method .\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Our SCR method can be combined with adaptive quantization such as Cui et al.  and Chen et al. [ref]23, on top of several compression architectures with hyper-encoder and hyper-decoder [ref]6 such as the models in [ref]6      [ref]12, as shown in Figure 1a.
