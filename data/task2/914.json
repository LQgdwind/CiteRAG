Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

In total, WSC has 273 questions888The latest version of WSC has 284 questions, but as all the following works are evaluated based on the 273-question version, we still use the 273-question version in this survey.. Its small size determines that it cannot be used to train a good supervised model and can only be used as the evaluation set. Definite Pronoun Resolution: Another hard pronoun coreference resolution dataset is the definite pronoun resolution dataset (DPR)999This dataset is also referred to as WSCR in some works. [ref]33.\nDifferent from WSC, DPR leveraged undergraduates rather than experts to create the dataset.\nIn total, DPR collected 1,886 questions, which is a slightly larger scale than the official WSC.\nHowever, as DPR could not guarantee that all DPR questions follow the strict design guideline of WSC, questions in DPR are relatively simpler. WinoGrande: One common problem of WSC and DPR is their small scales.\nTo create a larger scale data, WinoGrande  was proposed.\nBy leveraging annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk, WinoGrande collected 53 thousand WSC-like questions.\nMoreover, to make sure of the dataset quality, WinoGrande applied a bias reduction algorithm to filter out examples that may contain annotation bias.\nExperimental results prove that WinoGrande is much more challenging than the original WSC because the SOTA models on WSC only achieve 51% accuracy on WinoGrande, which is similar to the random guess. KnowRef:\nSimilar to WinoGrande, KnowRef [ref]35 also aimed at creating a larger scale WSC dataset but with a different approach.\nInstead of using crowd-sourcing + adversarial filtering framework, KnowRef tried to extract WSC-like questions from raw sentences.\nAs a result, KnowRef collected eight thousand WSC-like questions.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: set. Definite Pronoun Resolution: Another hard pronoun coreference resolution dataset is the definite pronoun resolution dataset (DPR)999This dataset is also referred to as WSCR in some works. [ref]33.\nDifferent from WSC, DPR leveraged undergraduates rather than experts to create the dataset.\nIn total, DPR collected 1,886 questions, which is a slightly larger scale than the official\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
