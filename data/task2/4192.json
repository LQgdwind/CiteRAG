      "content": "Paper Title: DNA: Proximal Policy Optimization with a Dual Network Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCombining deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has produced impressive results on challenging problems, such as playing Chess , Atari games 5, and robotics tasks . However, results have bifurcated between two competing approaches: Q-learning-based approaches that require learning an (action conditioned) value estimate and actor-critic policy gradient (AC-PG, or just PG)111For simplicity, we refer to actor-critic policy gradient as policy gradient, even though some early policy gradient approaches, such as REINFORCE [ref]36, do not learn a value function. approaches that learn both a policy and value estimate. PG offers many theoretical advantages over Q-learning, such as natural support for continuous control problems and the ability to learn stochastic policies. Until recently, PG approaches   , while strong on continuous control problems, have under-performed Q-learning approaches on vision-based tasks 5 [ref]16 , restricting the use of PG in this domain. This paper aims to close the gap between PG and Q-learning methods by showing that the common practice of jointly learning value and policy with shared features negatively affects the algorithmâ€™s performance.222PPO , A3C , and Muslie  all use a joint network when training on vision-based discrete action environments. PPG  uses a dual network with an auxiliary task, which we discuss in more detail in Section 2 We also demonstrate an order-of-magnitude difference in noise levels between these two tasks and argue that this makes these two tasks poorly aligned. In light of this result, we introduce a new algorithm, based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) , called Dual Network Architecture (DNA). We test DNA empirically on a subset of the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) , Atari-5 . Our results show a strong increase in performance on this benchmark compared to both PPO and another dual network model Phasic Policy Gradient (PPG) . Our model also outperforms Rainbow DQN [ref]16 on four of the five games tested, even under more challenging environmental settings. We summarize our contributions. First, we provide empirical results showing an order-of-magnitude difference in the noise scale between the policy gradient and the value loss gradient. Second, we give evidence for the benefit of using low bias value estimates for value learning, but low variance estimates for advantage estimates. Finally, we introduce and justify our dual network constrained distillation algorithm DNA with empirical results on ALE.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: actor-critic policy gradient (AC-PG, or just PG)111For simplicity, we refer to actor-critic policy gradient as policy gradient, even though some early policy gradient approaches, such as REINFORCE [ref]36, do not learn a value function. approaches that learn both a policy and value estimate.
