      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Physical Dynamics with Subequivariant Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe utilize the codebase provided by Physion  for particle-based methods222https://github.com/htung0101/Physion-particles. This repository contains the implementation of GNS [ref]32 and DPI [ref]24. For DPI, we notice that it has been optimized in the RigidFall task by  https://github.com/YunzhuLi/VGPL-Dynamics-Prior, and we thus adopt their optimized version on RigidFall. As for EGNN  and GMN [ref]19, we resort to their original implementations444https://github.com/vgsatorras/egnn555https://github.com/hanjq17/GMN, respectively. The datasets and code repositories are released under MIT license. We basically follow the hyper-parameters suggested by Physion. In detail, for GNS and DPI, we use a hidden dimension of 200 for the node update function ψ𝜓\\psi and 300 for the message computation function ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, each of which consists of 3 layers with ReLU as the activation function. The iteration step is set to 10 for GNS and 2 for DPI due to its multi-stage hierarchical modeling. We use an Adam optimizer with initial learning rate 0.0001, betas (0.9, 0.999), and a Plateau scheduler with a patience of 3 epochs and decaying factor 0.8. For EGNN, GMN, and SGNN, we still build upon the above hyper-parameters with very minor modifications. We adopt hidden dimension 200 uniformly for ψ𝜓\\psi and ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi with SiLU activation function, and 4 iterations in φ1subscript𝜑1\\varphi_{1}, φ2subscript𝜑2\\varphi_{2}, and φ3subscript𝜑3\\varphi_{3} for SGNN, while 10 for EGNN and GMN. We use an early-stopping of 10 epochs.\nWe use a batch size of 1 on Physion due to the large size of each system and 8 on RigidFall due to its relatively small size. Besides, we also inject noise during training for better test-time long-term rollout prediction, exactly following the settings of Physion and RigidFall . The scale is set to 3e-4 in Physion and 0.05 of the std in RigidFall. The cutoff radius γ𝛾\\gamma is set to be 0.08 on both datasets. On both datasets, we only use the state information of last frame t𝑡t as input to predict the information of frame t+1𝑡1t+1. The experiments are conducted on single card NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Notably, for EGNN-S and GMN-S, we make a modification to their updates of the velocity, namely, where the underlined term highlights our adaptation, ϕv,ϕg,ϕxsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑣subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑥\\phi_{v},\\phi_{g},\\phi_{x} are all MLPs, and the superscript l𝑙l indicates the iteration step. The intuition of this term is similar to adding a gravitational acceleration term to the update of velocity. This formulation meets O𝒈→​(3)subscript𝑂→𝒈3O_{\\vec{{\\bm{g}}}}(3)-equivariance. As for the data splits, we strictly follow Physion and RigidFall. In detail, for Physion, the full training set contains 2000 trajectories in each scenario, which is then split into training and validation with the ratio 9:1. The testing set contains 200 trajectories. For RigidFall, the full training set contains 5000 trajectories, which is also split into training and validation with ratio 9:1. Particularly, to study the data-efficiency of different models, we sub-sample multiple training sets with sizes 200, 500, 1000, 5000, as illustrated in Table 3 in the paper. Besides, in the implementation we also employ a normalization before feeding the inner product into the MLP, i.e., we normalize the inner product by 𝒁→⊤​𝒁→/‖𝒁→⊤​𝒁→‖Fsuperscript→𝒁top→𝒁subscriptnormsuperscript→𝒁top→𝒁𝐹\\vec{{\\bm{Z}}}^{\\top}\\vec{{\\bm{Z}}}/\\|\\vec{{\\bm{Z}}}^{\\top}\\vec{{\\bm{Z}}}\\|_{F} in Eq. (3), as suggested in GMN [ref]19 to control the expanding variance in scale brought by the inner product for better numerical stability. This is similarly adopted in Eq. (9) for [𝒁→,𝒈→]→𝒁→𝒈[\\vec{{\\bm{Z}}},\\vec{{\\bm{g}}}], where we also propose to dynamically control the scale of 𝒈→→𝒈\\vec{{\\bm{g}}} by η​(𝒉)∈ℝ𝜂𝒉ℝ\\eta({\\bm{h}})\\in{\\mathbb{R}} where η𝜂\\eta is a lightweight two-layer MLP. We find these considerations generally leads to faster convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: We utilize the codebase provided by Physion  for particle-based methods222https://github.com/htung0101/Physion-particles.
