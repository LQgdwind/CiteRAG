Various advanced techniques have been created, focusing either on adjusting the model itself  or on enhancing the dataset through augmentation  . The connection between flat regions in the loss landscape and the underlying model generalization capability was brought forth back already in 1995  and it has been empirically studied afterward  5. Subsequently, multiple approaches leading to maximally flat regions have been identified, in the seek for better generalization   4 [ref]13. In the last few years, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) was advanced with the goal of being both efficient and effective in enforcing flatness for the achieved solutions, employing a local linear approximation for the loss [ref]13. Starting from this, other variants of SAM have been proposed, achieving outstanding results in several demanding tasks which include continual learning [ref]11 and federated learning  . In our work, we are building on top of [ref]13 for considering the shape of the loss landscape in an efficient way. Specifically, we like to ensure sharpness for a subset of parameters where we embed our watermark. Unlike approaches like 9 that rely on memory and computation-wise expensive sampling process, we leverage the locally linear approximation of the loss to find the “worst-case” direction of the gradient in the watermarked parameters space.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: already in 1995  and it has been empirically studied afterward  5.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
