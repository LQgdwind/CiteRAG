Rather than approximating minimum solutions, we are mainly interested in the discovery\nof minimal dependencies in databases.\nTraditionally, enumeration has been studied via embedded decision problems\nthat are different from those defined in Section 3.1.\nInstead, the Transversal Hypergraph problem (enumerating minimal hitting sets)\nhas been associated with the problem of deciding for two hypergraphs ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} and 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}\nwhether 𝒢=Tr⁡(ℋ)𝒢Trℋ\\mathcal{G}=\\operatorname{Tr}(\\mathcal{H}) or, equivalently, ℋ=Tr⁡(𝒢)ℋTr𝒢\\mathcal{H}=\\operatorname{Tr}(\\mathcal{G}), called the Dual problem.\nEnumerate Minimal UCCs analogously\ncorresponds to decide for a database 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} and hypergraph ℋℋ\\mathcal{H},\nwhether ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} consists of all minimal uniques of 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r}.\nIntuitively, this formalizes the decision whether\nan enumeration algorithm has found all solutions. Both decision problems are in coNP and it was proven\nby Eiter and Gottlob 4 that they are many-one equivalent.\nUsing a lifting result by Bioch and Ibaraki ,\nthis shows that minimal hitting sets can be enumerated in output-polynomial time\nif and only if minimal UCCs can,\nwhich is the case if and only if Dual is in P.\nSuch an equivalence is theoretically appealing and has lead to the quasi-output-polynomial\nupper bound on the running time of hitting set/UCC enumeration\nthat is currently the best known 8.\nThe connection to enumeration has also inspired the intriguing result that Dual is likely not coNP-hard as it can be solved\nin polynomial time when given access to O⁡(log2⁡N/log⁡log⁡N)Osuperscript2𝑁𝑁\\operatorname{O}(\\nicefrac{{\\log^{2}N}}{{\\log\\log N}}) suitably guessed\nnondeterministic bits  5,\nwhere N𝑁N denotes the total input size of the pair (ℋ,𝒢)ℋ𝒢(\\mathcal{H},\\mathcal{G}).\nThere are classes of hypergraphs for which Dual is indeed in P, see for\nexample  0 5 3,\nor at least in FPT with respect to certain structural parameters 7.\nFor a much more thorough overview of decision problems associated with enumeration,\nsee the recent work by Creignou et al. . Unfortunately, the approach described above holds only limited value\nwhen it comes to designing practical algorithms.\nImagine an implementation of the discovery of minimal UCCs of a database 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r}\nvia repeated checks whether the hypergraph ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} of previously found solutions is already complete.\nSuch an algorithm is bound to use an amount of memory that is exponential in the size of 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r}.\nThis is due to the fact that some databases have exponentially many minimal solutions\nand the decision subroutine at least has to read all of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}.\nNote that such a large memory consumption is not at all necessary\nas there are algorithms known for Transversal Hypergraph whose space complexity is only linear in the input size 7 9.\nIn fact, enumeration algorithms are often analyzed\nnot only with respect to their running time, but also in terms of space consumption,\nsee  [ref]14.\nFor data profiling problems like Enumerate Minimal UCCs on the other hand,\nspace-efficient algorithms\nhave only recently started to received some attention   6. In the following, we simplify and at the same time extend the above equivalences\nmaking them usable in practice,\nnamely, we prove 3.\nIt states the existence of parsimonious reductions, in both directions,\nthat relate the input instances directly on the level of the enumeration problems,\nwithout decision problems as intermediaries.\nThis way, we characterize the enumeration complexity of unique column combinations\nas well as functional dependencies, both with fixed and arbitrary right-hand side.\nCuriously, our insights on enumeration also stem from the study of decision problems,\nhowever, the results are entirely lifted. The reductions between the decision problems\nHitting Set, Unique Column Combination, Functional Dependencyfixed RHS, and Functional Dependency (in that order) for minimum dependencies\ndescribed in Lemmas 6 and 7\nare all built on bijective correspondences between the solutions.\nThe running times of the reductions are polynomial and independent of the given budget k𝑘k.\nFinally, the mappings of the solution spaces also preserve set inclusions.\nThis means, the same input transformations applied to the discovery of minimal dependencies\nare in fact parsimonious reductions from Transversal Hypergraph to Enumerate Minimal UCCs and\nfurther to Enumerate Minimal FDs/FDsfixed RHS.\nRegarding the inverse direction, 5\nshows that the enumeration of UCCs is at most as hard as that of hitting sets,\nthat is, Enumerate Minimal UCCs and Transversal Hypergraph are equivalent.\nIt is worth noting that the parsimonious reductions increase the size of the instances\nat most by a polynomial factor (in most case a constant one) in the input size only\nand therefore transfer the space complexity of any enumeration algorithm\nfrom one side to the other. To complete the proof of 3,\nwe still need the following lemma that characterizes the\ncomplexity of functional dependency discovery\nin terms of the Transversal Hypergraph Union problem. The problems Enumerate Minimal FDs and Transversal Hypergraph Union are equivalent under parsimonious reductions.\nMoreover, there is a parsimonious reduction from Enumerate Minimal FDsfixed RHS to Transversal Hypergraph. This proof uses techniques that already helped to establish the previous lemmas of this section.\nLet 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} be a database over schema R𝑅R, a∈R𝑎𝑅a\\in R some attribute,\nr,s∈𝔯𝑟𝑠𝔯r,s\\in\\mathfrak{r} two rows with r​[a]≠s​[a]𝑟delimited-[]𝑎𝑠delimited-[]𝑎r[a]\\neq s[a].\nRecall that their difference set is D​(r,s)={b∈R∣r​[b]≠s​[b]}𝐷𝑟𝑠conditional-set𝑏𝑅𝑟delimited-[]𝑏𝑠delimited-[]𝑏D(r,s)=\\{b\\in R\\mid r[b]\\neq s[b]\\}.\nWe define their punctured difference set to be D​(r,s)∖{a}𝐷𝑟𝑠𝑎D(r,s){\\setminus}\\{a\\}.\nIt is implicit in the proof of Lemma 8 – and\neasy to verify from the definition of functional dependencies – that\na set X⊆R∖{a}𝑋𝑅𝑎X\\subseteq R{\\setminus}\\{a\\} is the left-hand side of a\nvalid, minimal, non-trivial FD X→a→𝑋𝑎X\\,{\\to}\\,a if and only if it is a minimal hitting set\nfor the hypergraph 𝒟a={D​(r,s)∖{a}∣r,s∈𝔯;r​[a]≠s​[a]}subscript𝒟𝑎conditional-set𝐷𝑟𝑠𝑎formulae-sequence𝑟𝑠𝔯𝑟delimited-[]𝑎𝑠delimited-[]𝑎\\mathcal{D}_{a}=\\{D(r,s){\\setminus}\\{a\\}\\mid r,s\\in\\mathfrak{r};r[a]\\,{\\neq}\\,s[a]\\}\nof punctured difference sets. Transforming the input database 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} over schema R={a1,…,a|R|}𝑅subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑅R=\\{a_{1},\\dots,a_{|R|}\\}\ninto the |R|𝑅|R| hypergraphs 𝒟a1,…,𝒟a|R|subscript𝒟subscript𝑎1…subscript𝒟subscript𝑎𝑅\\mathcal{D}_{a_{1}},\\dots,\\mathcal{D}_{a_{|R|}}\nis a parsimonious reduction from the Enumerate Minimal FDs problem to Transversal Hypergraph Union.\nIn the same fashion, fixing the desired right-hand side in the input reduces\nEnumerate Minimal FDsfixed RHS to Transversal Hypergraph. The opposite reduction is the main part of the lemma.\nWe are given hypergraphs ℋ1,…,ℋdsubscriptℋ1…subscriptℋ𝑑\\mathcal{H}_{1},\\dots,\\mathcal{H}_{d},\nwithout loss of generality all on the same vertex set V𝑉V\\!,\nand we need to compute some database 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} such that its valid, non-trivial\nfunctional dependencies are in one-to-one correspondence with the hitting sets\nof the ℋisubscriptℋ𝑖\\mathcal{H}_{i}.\nAn example can be seen in Figure 4.\nAs the relational schema, we take the set R=V∪{x1,…,xd}𝑅𝑉subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑑R=V\\cup\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{d}\\},\nwhere the xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} are attributes not previously appearing in V𝑉V\\!.\nThe construction of 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} starts similarly to Lemma 6.\nWe first add the all-zeros row r0subscript𝑟0r_{0} (with r0​[a]=0subscript𝑟0delimited-[]𝑎0r_{0}[a]=0 for every a∈R𝑎𝑅a\\in R).\nLet m=∑i=1d|ℋi|𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑑subscriptℋ𝑖m=\\sum_{i=1}^{d}|\\mathcal{H}_{i}| be the total number of edges\nand E1,E2,…,Emsubscript𝐸1subscript𝐸2…subscript𝐸𝑚E_{1},E_{2},\\dots,E_{m} an arbitrary numbering of them.\nNote that if the same set of vertices is an edge of multiple hypergraphs,\nit appears in the list with that multiplicity.\nFor every edge Ejsubscript𝐸𝑗E_{j}, we add the following row rjsubscript𝑟𝑗r_{j}, In other words, the subtuple rj​[V]subscript𝑟𝑗delimited-[]𝑉r_{j}[V] is the characteristic vector of Ejsubscript𝐸𝑗E_{j}\nonly that its non-zero entries are j𝑗j instead of 111;\nthe subtuple rj​[{x1,…,xd}]subscript𝑟𝑗delimited-[]subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑑r_{j}[\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{d}\\}] has exactly one 111 at the position\ncorresponding to the hypergraph containing Ejsubscript𝐸𝑗E_{j}.\nThe remaining construction of database 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r}\nuses an idea of Lemma 7 2.\nLet ×\\times be a new symbol.\nFor every vertex v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, we add the row rvsubscript𝑟𝑣r_{v}\nwith rv​[v]=×subscript𝑟𝑣delimited-[]𝑣r_{v}[v]=\\times and rv​[a]=0subscript𝑟𝑣delimited-[]𝑎0r_{v}[a]=0\nfor all other attributes a∈R∖{v}𝑎𝑅𝑣a\\in R{\\setminus}\\{v\\}.\nThe database 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} can be obtained in time poly​(m,|V|)poly𝑚𝑉\\textsf{poly}(m,|V|). We claim that the minimal, valid, non-trivial functional dependencies of 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r}\nare exactly those having the form T→xi→𝑇subscript𝑥𝑖T\\,{\\to}\\,x_{i} with T∈Tr⁡(ℋi)𝑇Trsubscriptℋ𝑖T\\in\\operatorname{Tr}(\\mathcal{H}_{i}).\nThe existence of a parsimonious reduction from Transversal Hypergraph Union to Enumerate Minimal FDs easily follows from that.\nLet X⊆R𝑋𝑅X\\subseteq R and a∈R∖X𝑎𝑅𝑋a\\in R{\\setminus}X be such that\nthe FD X→a→𝑋𝑎X\\,{\\to}\\,a holds in 𝔯𝔯\\mathfrak{r} and is minimal.\nFor any v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, the rows r0subscript𝑟0r_{0} and rvsubscript𝑟𝑣r_{v} differ only in attribute v𝑣v,\ntherefore v𝑣v is not the right-hand side of any non-trivial FD,\nwhence a=xi𝑎subscript𝑥𝑖a=x_{i} for some 1≤i≤d1𝑖𝑑1\\leq i\\leq d.\nAs seen above,\nthe set X𝑋X must be a minimal transversal of the hypergraph\n𝒟xi={D​(r,s)∖{a}∣r,s∈𝔯;r​[xi]≠s​[xi]}subscript𝒟subscript𝑥𝑖conditional-set𝐷𝑟𝑠𝑎formulae-sequence𝑟𝑠𝔯𝑟delimited-[]subscript𝑥𝑖𝑠delimited-[]subscript𝑥𝑖\\mathcal{D}_{x_{i}}=\\{D(r,s){\\setminus}\\{a\\}\\mid r,s\\in\\mathfrak{r};r[x_{i}]\\,{\\neq}\\,s[x_{i}]\\}.\nWe are left to prove that 𝒟xisubscript𝒟subscript𝑥𝑖\\mathcal{D}_{x_{i}} has the same minimal transversals as ℋisubscriptℋ𝑖\\mathcal{H}_{i}.\nLet r,s∈𝔯𝑟𝑠𝔯r,s\\in\\mathfrak{r} be rows that differ in attribute xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i},\nsay, r​[xi]=1𝑟delimited-[]subscript𝑥𝑖1r[x_{i}]=1 and s​[xi]=0𝑠delimited-[]subscript𝑥𝑖0s[x_{i}]=0.\nWe thus have r=rj𝑟subscript𝑟𝑗r=r_{j} for some 1≤j≤m1𝑗𝑚1\\leq j\\leq m.\nThe rows r𝑟r and s𝑠s share only the value 00, if any.\nTherefore, In the second case, note that ℓ≠iℓ𝑖\\ell\\neq i since s​[xi]=0𝑠delimited-[]subscript𝑥𝑖0s[x_{i}]=0.\nThe above implies that ℋi⊆𝒟xisubscriptℋ𝑖subscript𝒟subscript𝑥𝑖\\mathcal{H}_{i}\\subseteq\\mathcal{D}_{x_{i}};\nmoreover, all edges in 𝒟xi∖ℋisubscript𝒟subscript𝑥𝑖subscriptℋ𝑖\\mathcal{D}_{x_{i}}{\\setminus}\\mathcal{H}_{i} are supersets of ones in ℋisubscriptℋ𝑖\\mathcal{H}_{i}.\nThe respective minimizations min⁡(𝒟xi)=min⁡(ℋi)subscript𝒟subscript𝑥𝑖subscriptℋ𝑖\\min(\\mathcal{D}_{x_{i}})=\\min(\\mathcal{H}_{i}) are thus equal and,\nby duality, also their transversal hypergraphs Tr⁡(𝒟xi)=Tr⁡(ℋi)Trsubscript𝒟subscript𝑥𝑖Trsubscriptℋ𝑖\\operatorname{Tr}(\\mathcal{D}_{x_{i}})=\\operatorname{Tr}(\\mathcal{H}_{i})\nare the same.\n∎ It is known that Enumerate Minimal FDs can be solved in output-polynomial time\nif and only if Transversal Hypergraph can 4,\nthis has been established along the same lines as discussed in the remarks\npreceding Lemma 9.\nNotably, Eiter and Gottlob additionally presented an alternative construction\nin the extended version of 4\nthat is almost parsimonious.\nThe only condition they needed to relax is the bijection between the solution spaces.\nThey transform a database over schema R𝑅R into some hypergraph (R2,ℱ)superscript𝑅2ℱ(R^{2},\\mathcal{F})\nsuch that the majority of its minimal hitting sets indeed\ncorrespond to the functional dependencies with arbitrary right-hand side.\nHowever, ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} has some O⁡(|R|4)Osuperscript𝑅4\\operatorname{O}(|R|^{4}) excess solutions (that is,\npolynomially many in the input size only),\nwhich do not have an FD counterpart, but are easily recognizable.\nWe leave it as an open problem to give a fully parsimonious reduction between the problems.\nWe have shown above that this is equivalent to encoding\nthe hitting set information of |R|𝑅|R| different hypergraphs into a single one.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: space complexity is only linear in the input size 7 9.\nIn fact, enumeration algorithms are often analyzed\nnot only with respect to their running time, but also in terms of space consumption,\nsee  [ref]14.\nFor data profiling problems like Enumerate Minimal UCCs on the other hand,\nspace-efficient algorithms\nhave only recently started to received some attention   6.
