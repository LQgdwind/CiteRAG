      "content": "Paper Title: Oscar: Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training for Vision-Language Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning cross-modal representations is fundamental to a wide range of vision-language (V+L) tasks, such as visual question answering, image-text retrieval, image captioning. Recent studies 2 8 [ref]5     on vision-language pre-training (VLP) have shown that it can effectively learn generic representations from massive image-text pairs, and that fine-tuning VLP models on task-specific data achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on well-established V+L tasks. These VLP models are based on multi-layer Transformers .\nTo pre-train such models, existing methods simply concatenate image region features and text features as input and resort to the self-attention mechanism to learn semantic alignments between image regions and text in a brute force manner.\nHowever, the lack of explicit alignment information between the image regions and text poses alignment modeling a weakly-supervised learning task. In addition, visual regions are often over-sampled , noisy and ambiguous, which makes the task even more challenging. In this study, we show that the learning of cross-modal representations can be significantly improved by introducing object tags detected in images as anchor points to ease the learning of semantic alignments between images and texts.\nWe propose a new VLP method Oscar, where we define the training samples as triples, each consisting of a word sequence, a set of object tags, and a set of image region features. Our method is motivated by the observation that the salient objects in an image can be accurately detected by modern object detectors 8, and that these objects are often mentioned in the paired text.\nFor example, on the MS COCO dataset 1, the percentages that an image and its paired text share at least 111, 222, 333 objects are 49.7%percent49.749.7\\%, 22.2%percent22.222.2\\%, 12.9%percent12.912.9\\%, respectively. Our Oscar model is pre-trained on a large-scale V+L dataset composed of 6.56.56.5 million pairs, and is fine-tuned and evaluated on seven V+L understanding and generation tasks. The overall setting is illustrated in Fig 1. Although the use of anchor points for alignment modeling has been explored in natural language processing e.g.,  , to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that explores the idea for VLP. There have been previous works that use object or image tags in V+L tasks for the sake of enhancing the feature representation of image regions, rather than for learning image-text alignments. For example, Zhou et al.   uses the object prediction probability as a soft label and concatenate it with its corresponding region features. Wu et al.   and You et al.   introduce image-level labels or attributes to improve image-level visual representations. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n(i)i(\\textup{\\it i}) We introduce Oscar, a powerful VLP method to learn generic image-text representations for V+L understanding and generation tasks.\n(ii)ii(\\textup{\\it ii}) We have developed an Oscar model that achieves new SoTA on multiple V+L benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin;\n(iii)iii(\\textup{\\it iii}) We present extensive experiments and analysis to provide insights on the effectiveness of using object tags as anchor points for cross-modal representation learning and downstream tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Learning cross-modal representations is fundamental to a wide range of vision-language (V+L) tasks, such as visual question answering, image-text retrieval, image captioning.
