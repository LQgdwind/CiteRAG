      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Conditional Instrumental Variable Representation for Causal Effect Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is a fundamental task to query or estimate the causal effect of a treatment (a.k.a. exposure, intervention or action) on an outcome of interest in causal inference. Causal effect estimation has wide applications across many fields, including but not limited to, economics , epidemiology  [ref]28, and computer science . The gold standard method for causal effect estimation is randomised controlled trials (RCT), but they are often impractical or unethical due to cost restrictions or ethical constraints  . Instead of conducting an RCT, estimating causal effects from observational data offers an alternative to evaluate the effect of a treatment on the outcome of interest. Confounding bias is a major obstacle in estimating causal effects from observational data. It arises from confounders that affect both the treatment variable W𝑊W and the outcome variable Y𝑌Y. When all confounders are measured (i.e., the unconfoundedness assumption   is satisfied), adjusting for the set of all measured confounders is sufficient to obtain an unbiased estimation of the causal effect from observational data  . For example, in the causal graph of Fig. 1(a), the unconfoundedness is satisfied when given 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}. Nevertheless, the unconfoundedness assumption is untestable, and there exists a latent (a.k.a. unobserved, unmeasured) confounder affecting both W𝑊W and Y𝑌Y in many real-world applications, e.g. the latent confounder U𝑈U affects both W𝑊W and Y𝑌Y in the causal graph in Fig. 1(b). In such a situation, the causal effect of W𝑊W on Y𝑌Y is non-identification . Most existing data-driven methods rely on the unconfoundedness assumption and thus it becomes challenging and questionable for them to obtain unbiased causal effects from data with latent confounders. The instrumental variable (IV) approach is a practical and powerful technique for addressing the challenging problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of latent confounders. The IV approach requires a valid IV for eliminating the confounding bias caused by latent confounders  9. Valid IVs are exogenous variables that are associated with W𝑊W but not directly associated with Y𝑌Y  . A valid IV S𝑆S needs to satisfy three conditions: (1) S𝑆S is correlated to W𝑊W; (2) S𝑆S and Y𝑌Y do not share confounders (i.e. unconfounded instrument); and (3) the effect of S𝑆S on Y𝑌Y is entirely through W𝑊W (i.e. exogenous)  . However, the last two conditions are too strict and not testable in real-world applications. Therefore, in many existing IV-based methods, an IV is nominated based on prior or domain knowledge. However, in many real-world applications, the nominated IVs based on domain knowledge could violate one of the three conditions, resulting in a biased estimate and potentially leading to incorrect conclusions  . It is a challenging problem to discover a valid IV directly from data. Investigators usually collect as many covariates as possible, but few of them are valid IVs that satisfy the three conditions. Instead of discovering a valid IV, Kang et al.  proposed a data-driven method, referred to as sisVIVE, based on the assumption of some invalid and some valid IVs (i.e. more than half of candidate IVs are valid IVs ) to provide a bound of causal effect estimations. Hartford et al. 5 proposed DeepIV, a deep learning based IV approach for counterfactual predictions, but it requires a nominated IV and the corresponding conditioning set. Kuang et al.  developed a method to model a summary IV as a latent variable based on the statistical dependencies of the set of candidate IVs. Yuan et al. 7 proposed a data-driven method to automatically generate a synthetic IV for counterfactual predictions, but the method does not consider the confounding bias between the IV and the outcome, and the condition of unconfounded instrument may be violated in many cases. Therefore, it is desirable to develop an algorithm for learning a valid IV that considers the unconfounded instrument for causal effect estimations, especially conditional average causal effect estimations, from data with latent confounders. To provide a practical solution for conditional average causal effect estimations, in this work, we focus on conditional IV (CIV), which can be considered as an IV with relaxed conditions and a CIV requires a conditioning set to instrumentalise it to function as an IV (details see Definition 1). We propose to leverage disentangled representation learning technique to learn from data the representations of a CIV and its conditioning set. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1(c), we assume that the observed covariates are learned through three representations, 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S}, 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} and 𝐅𝐅\\mathbf{F}. Here, 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} affects both treatment W𝑊W and 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C}, 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} represents the confounding factor affecting both W𝑊W and the outcome Y𝑌Y, and 𝐅𝐅\\mathbf{F} represents the risk factor affecting both 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} and Y𝑌Y. We then establish a theorem that 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} is a valid CIV that is instrumentalised by {𝐂,𝐅}𝐂𝐅\\{\\mathbf{C,F}\\}, meaning that {𝐂,𝐅}𝐂𝐅\\{\\mathbf{C,F}\\} is the conditioning set of 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S}. Supported by this theorem, we design and develop a novel disentangled representation learning algorithm called DVAE.CIV model, which is based on the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) model [ref]23. This model allows us to obtain the representations of the CIV 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} and its conditioning set {𝐂,𝐅}𝐂𝐅\\{\\mathbf{C,F}\\}, enabling us to use 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} as a valid IV conditioning on {𝐂,𝐅}𝐂𝐅\\{\\mathbf{C,F}\\} for estimating the conditional average causal effects of W𝑊W on Y𝑌Y from data when there are latent confounders. The main contributions of the paper are summarised as follows. We address a challenging problem in conditional average causal effect estimations from data with latent confounders by utilising the CIV approach and VAE models. We propose a novel disentanglement learning model based on the conditional VAE model to learn and disentangle the representations of covariates into the representations of a CIV 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} and its conditioning set {𝐂,𝐅}𝐂𝐅\\{\\mathbf{C,F}\\} for conditional average causal effect estimations from data with latent confounders. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to show the performance of the DVAE.CIV model, w.r.t. causal effect estimations from data with latent confounders.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: intervention or action) on an outcome of interest in causal inference.
