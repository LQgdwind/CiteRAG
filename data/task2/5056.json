      "content": "Paper Title: NAR-Former: Neural Architecture Representation Learning towards Holistic Attributes Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs an ever increasing variety of deep neural network models are widely adopted in academic research and real applications, neural architecture representation is emerging as an universal need to predict model attributes holistically. For example, modern neural architecture search (NAS) methods can depend on the neural architecture representation to build good model accuracy predictors[ref]30 [ref]22  [ref]20  , which estimate model accuracies without running the expensive training procedure. In order to find faster execution graphs when deploying models to neural network accelerators, neural network compilers   need it to build network latency predictors, which estimate the real time cost without running it on the corresponding real hardware. As a straightforward approach to solve these holistic prediction tasks, a neural architecture representation model should be built to take the symbolic description of the network as input, and generate its numerical representation which can be easily used with existing modeling tools to perform the desired downstream tasks. There are some neural architecture representation models proposed in solving the individual tasks mentioned above, but we find they are rather application specific and have obvious drawbacks when used in new tasks. For example, the early MLP, LSTM based accuracy prediction approaches  [ref]30 [ref]22 improve the efficiency and performance of NAS, while there is a limitation of prediction performance resulting from the the nonexistent or implicit topology encoding.\nSome later proposed GCN based methods 5 6 achieve better performance of accuracy prediction than the above methods. However, due to the use\nof adjacency matrix, the encoding dimension of these methods\nscales quadratically with the depth of the input architecture,\nmaking them difficult to model large networks.\nNNLQP implements latency prediction at the model level, but GNN-based encoding scheme makes it inadequate in modeling long range interactions between nodes. Inspired by the progress in natural language understanding, our network uses a hand designed yet general and extensible token encoding approach to encode the topology information and key parameters of the input neural network. Specifically, we design a generic real value tokenizer to encode neural network nodes’ operation type, location, and their inputs into vectors using the positional embedding approach that is widely used in transformers and NERF0.\nThis fixed length node encoding scheme makes the network encoding scale linearly with the size of the input network rather than quadratically as in models that rely on taking adjacency matrix as input. Based on the tokenized input sequence, we design a transformer based model to further encode and fuse the network descriptions to generate a compact representation, e.g. a fixed length feature vector. Therefore, long range dependencies between nodes can be established by transformer. Besides the conventional multi-head self attention based transformers, we propose to use a multi-stage fusion transformer structure at the deep stages of the model to further fuse and refine the representation in a cascade manner. For the network representation learning task, we also propose a data augmentation method called information flow consistency augmentation. The augmentation permutes the encoding order of nodes in the original network under our specified conditions without changing the structure of the network. We find it empirically improves the performance of our method for downstream tasks. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as the following points: We propose a simple and effective neural network encoding approach which tokenizes both operation and topology information of a neural network node into a sequence. When it is used to encode the entire network, the tokenized network encoding scheme scales better than adjacency matrix based ones, and builds the foundation for seamlessly using transformer structures for network representation learning. We design a multi-stage fusion transformer to learn feature representations. Benefiting from the proposed tokenizer, a concise pure transformer based neural architecture representation learning framework (NAR-Former) is proposed for the first time. Our NAR-Former makes full use of the capacity of transformers in handling sequence inputs, and gets promising performance. To facilitate efficient model training, we propose an information flow consistency augmentation and correspondingly design an architecture consistency loss, which brings more benefits with less augmentation samples compared with the existing random augmentation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on accuracy prediction, neural architecture search as well as latency prediction. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed representation model on processing both cell leveled network components and whole deep neural networks. Specifically, our accuracy predictor based on this representation achieves highly competitive accuracy performance on cell-based structures in NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-2019 datasets. Compared with other predictor-based NAS methods [ref]20, we efficiently find the architecture with 97.52% accuracy in DARTS by only querying 100 neural architectures. We also conduct latency prediction experiments on neural networks deeper than 200 layers to demonstrate the universality of our model.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: to predict model attributes holistically.
