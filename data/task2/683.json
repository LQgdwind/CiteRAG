      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Forward Reuse Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe exponential increase in computing capabilities in hardware has greatly advanced various applications of deep neural networks, such as speech recognition  0, visual object recognition  , and natural language processing [ref]3 .\nThe great success of these real-world applications has inspired this line of research using deep neural networks upon classical research problems. Cache is a universal and indispensable component in computer science. In a computer, a CPU cache addresses the memory wall  problem in von Neumann computers: Computation is orders of magnitude faster than memory access. In a Web server, accessing back stores suffers a long latency due to low network bandwidth. A Web server mitigates this problem by caching frequently accessed items in a Web cache. 1% increase of cache hit rate could result in 35% reduction of latency . In content delivery networks, cache storage at routers becomes of utmost importance to handle the exponential increase in video streaming services  . To implement a cache with ultra-high performance, the data locality characterization of programs becomes critical. The target cache in this paper is a general cache in theory. Peter Denning, who found the working-set theory , defined the principle of locality as “the tendency for programs to cluster references to subsets of address space for extended periods,” called phases . Reuse distance is the de facto metric to quantify data locality in a program. In this paper, we define reuse distance as “the number of accesses between two consecutive accesses to the same datum” 111Other works define it as “the number of unique accesses between two consecutive accesses to the same datum”. For example, stack distance is called reuse distance.. The definition is trace-based. A cache trace is a sequence of cache accesses. In a CPU cache, a trace is a memory access trace; in a Web cache, a trace is a series of Internet data objects.\nThere are two types of reuse distance, backward reuse distance and forward reuse distance, as shown in Figure 1. The second access of “b” has forward reuse distance of 3 and backward reuse distance of 2. The backward reuse distance is often referred to as reuse distance for simplicity. The first access of any data has ∞\\infty reuse distance; the last access has ∞\\infty forward reuse distance. Being aware of forward reuse distance on-line is greatly beneficial. The Belady’s optimal algorithm  (OPT) discards the data that will not be needed for the longest time in the future for a cache eviction event. Forward reuse distance just foresees the future access time. By it, we can derive the eviction candidate at an eviction event for implementing the OPT policy. To be aware of forward reuse distance for all data accesses is theoretically equivalent to know of the future.\nThe online computation is easy for reuse distance resulting from the past accesses (explained in Section II-A), but is impossible for the forward reuse distance, because the future has not been “seen” yet. This paper strives to predict forward reuse distance based on only the past cache trace by applying a novel learning-aided approach. In addition, we demonstrate the strength of our approach by leveraging it to advance the state-of-the-art in the area of cache replacement. Recently, the compute architecture community has applied machine learning techniques to predict the next memory address for the CPU caches 1  with the assistance of program context such as program counters. In particular, program counters are a dominant factor in prior work , and they format a sequence of pairs of program counter and memory address as a trace. As a result, their methods cannot adapt to other use cases that do not have program counters (such as Web caches). Novelty. In this paper, we study the prediction based on only a cache trace, which is built on a theoretical foundation that a cache trace is not a random sequence of accesses, and instead contains locality insights inside . Any cache replacement policy would otherwise be useless. We will discuss cache trace patterns in Section III. No any prior arts ever made predictions based on only a cache trace. To tackle the challenge, we take advantage of the powerful intelligent capability of deep neural networks to understand cache traces, by integrating locality insights in the model design. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: We design a powerful, unconstrained multi-LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN), inspired by recent success of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) RNN4 3 in sequence modeling tasks   [ref]3, as the first work to apply deep learning to predict forward reuse distance and demonstrate its high accuracy and availability. We explore to make use of a set of locality intrinsic features in the training design to verify that the prediction based on only a cache trace is highly viable. Therefore, the proposed techniques are widely applicable for extensive cache application scenarios. We propose to utilize the classical K-means algorithm to cluster data address deltas in the training process to improve prediction accuracy. We present a novel prediction-based pseudo OPT cache replacement policy, inspired by the good prediction results by the proposed neural network model. We measure our model and the new cache replacement policy on 13 Microsoft storage traces, which reveal a broad range of cache access patterns. Results demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-art practical policies by up to 19.2% and incurs only 2.3% higher miss ratio than OPT on average.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: in computing capabilities in hardware has greatly advanced various applications of deep neural networks, such as speech recognition  0, visual object recognition  , and natural language processing [ref]3 .\nThe great success of these real-world applications has inspired this line of research using deep neural networks upon classical research problems.
