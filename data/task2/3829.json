      "content": "Paper Title: Enabling High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Databases with Hardware/Software Cooperation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSingle-instance HTAP systems [ref]115    [ref]122  maintain a single instance of the data\nthat both analytics and transactions work on, ensuring that\nanalytical queries access the most recent version of data. While single-instance design enables high data freshness, it suffers from three major challenges: (1) High Cost of Consistency and Synchronization.\nSingle-instance-based HTAP systems\nneed to ensure that the data is consistent and synchronized, since analytical and transactional workloads\nwork on the same instance of data concurrently. One approach to consistency is to let both transactions and analytics work on the same copy of data, and use locking\nprotocols  to maintain consistency across the system. However,\nlocking protocols lead to throughput bottlenecks for both transactional and analytical workloads  .\n\nTo avoid the throughput bottlenecks\nincurred by locking protocols ,\nsingle-instance HTAP systems resort to either\nsnapshotting [ref]115 [ref]122   or multi-version concurrency\ncontrol (MVCC)  . Unfortunately, both solutions have significant drawbacks. Snapshotting: Several HTAP systems (e.g., [ref]115  [ref]122)\nuse a variation of multiversion synchronization, called snapshotting, to\nprovide consistency via snapshot isolation  .\nSnapshot isolation guarantees that all reads in a\ntransaction see a consistent snapshot of the database state, which is\nthe last committed state before the transaction started. We analyze the effect of state-of-the-art snapshotting  [ref]122\non the throughput of an HTAP system with two transactional and two analytical\nthreads (each running on a separate CPU; see section 9 for our evaluation methodology). Fig. 1 (left)\nshows the transactional throughput with snapshotting, normalized to a\nzero-cost snapshot mechanism (i.e., a hypothetical ideal baseline where snapshotting operations incur zero delay during execution), for three analytical query counts.\nWe make two observations.\nFirst, at 128 analytical queries, snapshotting reduces transactional throughput by 43.4%.\nSecond, the throughput loss increases as more analytical queries are being performed, with a loss of\n74.6% for 512 analytical queries.\nWe find that the majority of this throughput loss occurs because memcpy is\nused to create each snapshot, which introduces significant interference among the\nworkloads and generates a large amount of data movement between the CPU and main\nmemory [ref]35 .\nThe resulting high contention for shared hardware resources directly hurts the throughput. MVCC: In MVCC, instead of replacing the old data in a tuple when updates happen (as in the snapshotting approach), the system creates a new timestamped version of the data that is chained together with old versions of the data, forming a pointer-based version chain. During execution, instead of reading a separate snapshot, an analytical query can simply use a timestamp to read the most up-to-date version of the data at the time the query starts. Concurrently, a transactional query can insert transactional updates at the end of the version chain with more recent timestamps, without affecting the consistency of the analytical query. As a result, updates never block reads, which is the main reason why many transactional DBMSs have adopted MVCC (e.g.,   ). However, MVCC is not a good fit for mixed analytical and transactional workloads in HTAP. We study the effect of MVCC on system throughput, using\nthe same hardware configuration that we used for snapshotting. Fig. 1 (right) shows\nthe analytical throughput of MVCC, normalized to a zero-cost version of MVCC (i.e., a hypothetical ideal baseline where MVCC operations incur zero delay during execution),\nfor three transactional query counts. We observe that the analytical throughput significantly decreases (by 42.4% on average across the three transactional query counts) compared to zero-cost MVCC. The root cause is the long version chain caused by frequent updates from the transactional workload. Each version chain is organized as a linked list, which grows with the number of updates from transactional queries. When accessing data in a tuple, the analytical query needs to traverse a lengthy version chain, checking the timestamp in each element of the linked list to locate the most recent version of the data. As analytical queries touch large\nvolumes of data, this generates a large number of random memory accesses, leading to the large throughput loss. (2) Limited Workload-Specific Optimizations.\nA single-instance design severely limits workload-specific optimizations, as the instance cannot have different optimizations for each workload. For example, relational transactional\nengines use a row-wise or N-ary storage model (NSM) for data layout , while relational analytics engines employ a column-wise or decomposition storage model (DSM)  . It is inherently impossible for a single-instance-based system to efficiently implement both\ndata layouts simultaneously, and many such systems simply choose one of the\nlayouts [ref]115  [ref]122. (3) Limited Performance Isolation.\nWe evaluate  performance\ninterference using the same system configuration that we used for snapshotting and MVCC. Each transactional thread executes\n2M queries, and each analytical thread runs 1024 analytical queries.\nWe assume that there is no cost for consistency and synchronization.\nCompared to running transactional queries in isolation, the transactional throughput\ndrops by 31.3% when the queries run alongside analytics. This is because analytics are very data-intensive and generate a large\namount of data movement, which leads to significant\ncontention for shared resources (e.g., the memory system                     ). Note that the problem worsens with realistic consistency mechanisms, as they also generate a large amount of data movement.\n\nReference markers found: [115]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]115: Single-instance HTAP systems [ref]115    [ref]122  maintain a single instance of the data\nthat both analytics and transactions work on, ensuring that\nanalytical queries access the most recent version of data.
