      "content": "Paper Title: On Finding Small Hyper-Gradients in Bilevel Optimization: Hardness Results and Improved Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere have been many works studying bilevel optimization. Here we only review related works focusing on non-asymptotic analysis. Many existing works for non-asymptotic analysis for bilevel optimization assume the lower-level function is strongly convex. A natural method is to estimate ∇y∗​(x)∇superscript𝑦𝑥\\nabla y^{*}(x), and plug into Equation 4 to get an estimator of ∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) to apply gradient descent.\nITD (ITerative Differentiation) 9 5 [ref]48  approximates ∇y∗​(x)∇superscript𝑦𝑥\\nabla y^{*}(x) by ∂yK​(x)/∂xsuperscript𝑦𝐾𝑥𝑥{\\partial y^{K}(x)}/{\\partial x}, where yK​(x)superscript𝑦𝐾𝑥y^{K}(x) is K𝐾K-steps of gradient descent.\nAID (Approximate Implicit Differentiation)         explicitly solve ∇y∗​(x)=[(∇y​y2g)−1​∇y​x2g]​(x,y∗​(x))∇superscript𝑦𝑥delimited-[]superscriptsuperscriptsubscript∇𝑦𝑦2𝑔1superscriptsubscript∇𝑦𝑥2𝑔𝑥superscript𝑦𝑥\\nabla y^{*}(x)=\\left[(\\nabla_{yy}^{2}g)^{-1}\\nabla_{yx}^{2}g\\right](x,y^{*}(x)) as a linear equation. However, both AID and ITD require Hessian-vector product oracles, and their convergence analysis is typically restricted to the case when the lower-level function is strongly convex.\nArbel and Mairal  extended implicit differentiation to the parametric Morse-Bott function, a class of nonconvex functions with local PL properties. They also proposed an\nalgorithm that combines AID and ITD and showed its limit points must be an equilibrium of the concept of BGS (Bilevel Game with Selection) that they introduced. Recently, F2BA (Fully First-order Bilevel Approximation) has gained widespread attention. This method uses the value-function-based reformulation 3 of Problem (1): and\napplies gradient descent on the penalty function. Several studies have demonstrated two notable advantages of this method over AID and ITD: Firstly, it only requires gradient oracles which are much cheaper than Hessian-vector product oracles . Secondly, it performs well empirically even in cases where the lower-level function is nonconvex  . By establishing the equivalence between the KKT (Karush–Kuhn–Tucker) point of Problem (10) and the stationary point of Problem (2), Kwon et al. 8 showed that F2BA can find an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-stationary point of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) with 𝒪~​(ϵ−3)~𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ3\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-3}) first-order oracle calls\nwhen the lower-level function is strongly convex.\nChen et al.  further improved the rate to\n𝒪~​(ϵ−2)~𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-2}) by a more careful landscape analysis of the penalty function.\nLater, Kwon et al. 9 proposed a proximal variant of F2BA with a 𝒪~​(ϵ−3)~𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ3\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-3}) complexity when the penalty function satisfies the PL condition. GALET (Generalized\nALternating mEthod for bilevel opTimization) by Xiao et al. 2 can also tackle nonconvex-PL bilevel optimization problems. It uses Hessian-vector-product oracles to solve the following gradient-based reformulation of Problem (1): Xiao et al. 2 showed GALET can converge to a KKT point of Problem (11) with a rate of 𝒪~​(ϵ−2)~𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-2}).\nIn Appendix C, we show that this also implies the same convergence rate to\nthe stationary point of φ​(x)𝜑𝑥\\varphi(x) under the assumptions of Kwon et al. 9.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: method is to estimate ∇y∗​(x)∇superscript𝑦𝑥\\nabla y^{*}(x), and plug into Equation 4 to get an estimator of ∇φ​(x)∇𝜑𝑥\\nabla\\varphi(x) to apply gradient descent.\nITD (ITerative Differentiation) 9 5 [ref]48  approximates ∇y∗​(x)∇superscript𝑦𝑥\\nabla y^{*}(x) by ∂yK​(x)/∂xsuperscript𝑦𝐾𝑥𝑥{\\partial y^{K}(x)}/{\\partial x}, where yK​(x)superscript𝑦𝐾𝑥y^{K}(x) is K𝐾K-steps of gradient descent.\nAID\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
