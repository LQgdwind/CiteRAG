      "content": "Paper Title: Category Query Learning for Human-Object Interaction Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs shown in Fig. 2, our method is ready to integrate with any baseline HOI method that provides image feature 𝐈𝐈\\mathbf{I} and human-object instance feature {Fi}subscript𝐹𝑖\\{F_{i}\\}. The integration is simple. During inference, the human-object instance interaction classification part is replaced by our method in Sec. 3.2, the top and bottom right block in Fig. 2. During training, the original loss in the baseline HOI method ℒb​a​s​esubscriptℒ𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{base} is added to our image classification loss in Eq. 3. The final loss ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} for training is where the weight λ𝜆\\lambda is 1.01.01.0 by default. All other hyper parameters and details during training remain the same as in the baseline HOI method. Thus, our method is general and applicable to most existing HOI methods. In this work, we select three representative yet different baseline methods to verify the effectiveness of our approach, as described below. QPIC  is the first to introduce transformer method into HOI task. It is also the baseline for many recent works [ref]41    . Its performance is much better than early one-stage    and two-stage  [ref]7  methods while keeping a simple and end-to-end architecture. It consists of a CNN backbone as well as a transformer encoder and decoder. During our integration, the feature map in its transformer encoder is used as the image feature 𝐈𝐈\\mathbf{I}. The human-object feature {Fi}subscript𝐹𝑖\\{F_{i}\\} is the query feature in its decoder. SCG  is a traditional two-stage method and the best in this category. It is also one of the best method that does not use transformer. It uses a multi-stream graph neural network(GNN) for interaction classification. In our experiment, the detection boxes are from a fine-tuned detector provided by DRG [ref]7 for HICO-DET and a fine-tuned DETR for V-COCO. During our integration, the CNN feature map in the backbone of SCG is used as image feature 𝐈𝐈\\mathbf{I}. The human-object feature {Fi}subscript𝐹𝑖\\{F_{i}\\} is generated through RoI pooling with detected human and object boxes and fused with the GNN. GEN-VLKT [ref]22 is also transformer-based, but not end-to-end as pairwise NMS [ref]41 is used for post-processing.\nIt is the current state-of-the-art method. It uses two parallel decoders for object detection and interaction classification, namely instance decoder and interaction decoder. During our integration, the feature map in its transformer encoder is used as image feature 𝐈𝐈\\mathbf{I}. The query feature in the interaction decoder is used as the human-object feature {Fi}subscript𝐹𝑖\\{F_{i}\\}. Note that, unlike the majority of HOI detection methods, the original GEN-VLKT uses HOI categories rather than interaction categories during interaction classification. Our experiments still use interaction categories, in order to be consistent with most other methods. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault\nKnown Object\n\nMethod\nDetector\nBackbone\nFull\nRare\nNon-rare\nFull\nRare\nNon-rare\n\nDRG[ref]7\nHICO-DET\nResNet50-FPN\n24.53\n19.47\n26.04\n27.98\n23.11\n29.43\n\nGG-Net\nHICO-DET\nHourglass104\n23.47\n16.48\n25.60\n27.36\n20.23\n29.48\n\nIDN \nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n26.29\n22.61\n27.39\n28.24\n24.47\n29.37\n\nQPIC\nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n29.07\n21.85\n31.23\n31.68\n24.14\n33.93\n\nSCG \nHICO-DET\nResNet50-FPN\n31.33\n24.72\n33.31\n34.37\n27.18\n36.52\n\nCDN[ref]41\nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n31.78\n27.55\n33.05\n34.53\n29.73\n35.96\n\nDT \nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n31.75\n27.45\n33.03\n34.50\n30.13\n35.81\n\nSTIP \nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n31.60\n27.75\n32.75\n34.41\n30.12\n35.69\n\nHQM \nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n32.47\n28.15\n33.76\n-\n-\n-\n\nMSTR \nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n31.17\n25.31\n32.92\n34.02\n28.83\n35.57\n\nRLIP \nCOCO+VG\nResNet50\n32.84\n26.85\n34.63\n-\n-\n-\n\nIF \nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n33.51\n30.30\n34.46\n36.28\n33.16\n37.21\n\nGEN-VLKT-B [ref]22\nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n33.75\n29.25\n35.10\n36.78\n32.75\n37.99\n\nGEN-VLKT-M [ref]22\nHICO-DET\nResNet101\n34.78\n31.50\n35.77\n38.07\n34.94\n39.01\n\nGEN-VLKT-L [ref]22\nHICO-DET\nResNet101\n34.95\n31.18\n36.08\n38.22\n34.36\n39.37\n\nBodyPartMap \nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n35.15\n33.71\n35.58\n37.56\n35.87\n38.06\n\nGEN-VLKT-B + Ours\nHICO-DET\nResNet50\n35.36\n32.97\n36.07\n38.43\n34.85\n39.50\n\nGEN-VLKT-M + Ours\nHICO-DET\nResNet101\n35.83\n32.91\n36.70\n38.79\n35.28\n39.84\n\nGEN-VLKT-L + Ours\nHICO-DET\nResNet101\n36.03\n33.16\n36.89\n38.82\n35.51\n39.81\n\n \n\n\n\nMethod\nBackbone\nScenario #1\nScenario #2\n\nDRG [ref]7\nR50FPN\n51.0\n-\n\nSCG \nR50\n54.2\n60.9\n\nGG-Net \nHG104\n54.7\n-\n\nQPIC \nR50\n58.8\n61.0\n\nHQM \nR50\n63.6\n-\n\nCDN [ref]41\nR50\n61.7\n63.8\n\nGEN-VLKT-B [ref]22\nR50\n62.4\n64.5\n\nGEN-VLKT-M [ref]22\nR101\n63.3\n65.6\n\nGEN-VLKT-L [ref]22\nR101\n63.6\n65.9\n\nMSTR \nR50\n62.0\n65.2\n\nBodyPartMap \nR50\n63.0\n65.1\n\nIF \nR50\n63.0\n65.2\n\nDT \nR50\n66.2\n68.5\n\nSTIP \nR50\n65.1\n69.7\n\nGEN-VLKT-B + Ours\nR50\n66.4\n69.2\n\nGEN-VLKT-M + Ours\nR101\n66.8\n69.8\n\nGEN-VLKT-L + Ours\nR101\n66.5\n69.9\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: baseline methods to verify the effectiveness of our approach, as described below.
