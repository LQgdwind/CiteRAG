      "content": "Paper Title: Conditional Generators for Limit Order Book Environments: Explainability, Challenges, and Robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper deals with the construction of robust and realistic limit order book (LOB)\nenvironments for the training and evaluation of trading strategies.\nLOBs  are a fundamental market mechanism,\nwhich are used across a significant proportion of financial markets, including\nall major stock and derivatives exchanges.\nThe benefits of having robust and realistic simulators for these markets are\nnumerous.\nFor example, they would allow the study of markets under different assumptions, and\nthe investigation of AI techniques for training trading strategies.\nIn a LOB market, matched orders result in trades and unmatched\norders are stored in the two parts of the LOB, a collection of buy\norders called bids (the bid book), and a collection of sell orders called\nasks (the ask book).\nTypically, each side of the LOB will contains hundreds of\nindividual orders, and a real market would be updated at micro-second time\nresolution, driven by a wide range of market participants and facilitated\nby “high-frequency” market makers [ref]45. The development of AI-based automated trading strategies for LOB\nmarkets has been a growth area in recent years, both within academia and\nindustry, spurred on in part by developments in deep learning and reinforcement\nlearning.\nTwo typical LOB trading problems that have been investigated are\nmarket making, where the goal is to provide liquidity to the market by\nbeing continually willing to buy and sell an\nasset (see, e.g., Spooner et al. , Jerome et al. , Gasperov and Kostanjcar ),\nand optimal execution where the goal is to execute a pre-determined\namount in the most cost efficient manner possible (see,\ne.g. Nevmyvaka et al. [ref]34, Ning et al. ). The ultimate test of the efficacy of a trading strategy – be it a hand-crafted one\nor one developed using AI – is to trade it live in a real market [ref]38.\nHowever, this testing approach is rarely feasible for academic researchers, and\neven for industry practitioners it is potentially very costly to evaluate\nstrategies this way.\nThus effective simulation-based evaluation frameworks are highly desirable both\nto drive academic and commercial research.\nIn Section 3.2, we discuss in detail desiderata that a\nsimulation-based strategy evaluation framework should have. By far the most prevalent choice is market replay, but simulators based on this\napproach have no reactivity .\nThus, one implicitly makes the assumption that the financial market does not\nreact to the presence of the trading agent which is being tested. Needless to\nsay, this is an unrealistic assumption.\nConditional generative models provide a solution to the issue of reactivity, and\nfor this reason – and others that we discuss in Section 3 –\nthey have recently attracted a lot of attention in the AI community (see, e.g.,\nLi et al. , Kuo et al. , Coletta et al.  , Shi and Cartlidge ).\nWith a deep conditional generative model,\na deep neural network is used to generate the next state of\nthe world, conditioned upon the current state of the world.\nThe two most popular such models are Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks\n(CGANs)  and Conditional Variational Autoencoders\n(CVAEs) .\nAll of the main experiments in this paper use a specific class of CGANs\nintroduced in the paper by Coletta et al. .\nWe refer to this CGAN as LOBGAN. Training of the LOBGAN model works as follows.\nThe generator neural network takes as its conditioning input a set of features that describe\nboth the recent state of the order book and recent trade action, as well as –\nas in a non-conditional GAN – a random noise vector to add variability.\nIt then outputs a vector that represents the predicted next order to arrive in the\nbook.\nThen a discriminator neural network takes the synthetic order vector as well as\nthe true order vector (from the historical training data) and aims to\ndistinguish (conditional upon the input to the generator) which is real.\nFor more details on training conditional GANs see, e.g.,\nGoodfellow et al. , Mirza and\nOsindero , Gulrajani et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: hundreds of\nindividual orders, and a real market would be updated at micro-second time\nresolution, driven by a wide range of market participants and facilitated\nby “high-frequency” market makers [ref]45.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
