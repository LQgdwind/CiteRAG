      "content": "Paper Title: Supported Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work belongs to the family of policy constraint methods in offline RL, where parameterization or regularization is typically utilized. Comparison between previous policy constraint methods and ours has been summarized in Table 1. In addition to the policy constraint methods, we also review behavior policy modeling in offline RL, which is commonly necessary to both parameterization and regularization methods. Lastly, we briefly discuss a broader range of competitive offline RL approaches. Policy constraint via parameterization. Careful parameterization of the learned policy can naturally satisfy the support constraint. For example, BCQ [ref]10 learns a generative model of the behavior policy and trains the actor to perturb randomly generated actions. The policy parameterized by BCQ is to greedily select the one maximizing Q function among a large number of perturbed sampled actions. EMaQ [ref]12 simplifies BCQ by discarding the perturbation models. PLAS  learns a policy in the latent space of the generative model and parameterizes the policy using the decoder of the generative model on top of the latent policy. Policy constraint via regularization. An alternative approach is to use a divergence penalty in order to compel the learned policy to stay close to the behavior policy, such as KL-divergence  , maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) [ref]26, Fisher divergence  and Wasserstein distance . Using divergence penalties alleviates the hard constraint of explicit parameterization but may bear the risk of out-of-distribution actions. Although BEAR [ref]26\nattempts to constrain the policy to the support of the behavior policy, it heavily relies on the empirically-found approximate property of low-sampled MMD. TD3+BC  simply adds a behavior cloning (BC) term to the policy update and presents competitive performance on simple locomotion tasks.\nNote that recent SBAC  proposes a new policy learning objective based on performance difference lemma , along with a density-based regularization term similar to ours, but our work simply plugs the term into the standard policy training objective to enjoy minimal algorithmic modifications. Behavior policy modeling in offline RL. Most policy constraint methods need to fit an accurate generative model of the behavior policy, to sample in-distribution actions or estimate behavior density. Conditional variational auto-encoders (CVAE)   are typically used by past works [ref]10  to sample actions, while EMaQ [ref]12 opts for using an autoregressive model  which enables more accurate sampling.\nOn the other hand, policy class of Gaussian [ref]26  or Gaussian mixture models  are commonly used to fit and estimate the density of behavior policy.\nInstead of explicitly fitting the behavior policy, recent approaches have utilized implicit constraint without ever querying the values of any out-of-sample actions  .\nAlthough MBS-QL  uses ELBO to estimate marginal state distribution, to the best of our knowledge, we are unique in estimating the density of behavior policy based on VAE, for its flexibility to capture almost arbitrary class of distributions . Broader range of offline RL approaches. Besides policy constraint methods based on parameterization or regularization, there exist more types of competitive offline RL approaches. IQL  designs a multi-step dynamic programming procedure based on expectile regression, which completely avoids any queries to values of out-of-sample actions. Pessimistic value methods, such as CQL , produce a lower bound on the value of the current policy to effectively alleviate overestimation, but their performance may suffer from excessive pessimism. Advantage-weighted regression    improves upon behavior policy, while simultaneously enforcing an implicit KL-divergence constraint. Recent sequence modeling methods based on Transformers  also show competitive performance in both model-free  or model-based  paradigm.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: range of competitive offline RL approaches.
