Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

The method is based on a textual modeling syntax and describes what should be learned, how and from which attributes and relations. Additionally, templates are given to render code based on the model. However, the open-source framework seems to be out of maintenance since the repository is not updated since 2017555https://github.com/dukeboard/kevoree-modeling-framework. An active maintained framework family with means to model machine learning is shown in [ref]31. The method is based on the MontiAnna framework [ref]32 and focuses on modeling artificial neural networks. The MoniAnna framework is part of the MontiCore Workbench Family.\nSimilar to , textual modeling is used to formalize the learning units and related input and output. The formalization is used as input for template-based code generation. However, the method does not reflect domain-specific (business) knowledge from an engineering perspective. In , focus is put on the integration of executable machine learning units modeled on a cloud platform, enabling the fast deployment of distributed systems. However, the method is stiff regarding extendability and advanced data preparation as of the current development state.Additionally, the integration of domain knowledge is hardly given and the focus on the formalisation of data-driven algorithms is not present. The integration of ML in CPS modeling is supported by the textual modeling framework ThingML+. The method extends the ThingML  modeling method, intended to support the development of IoT devices. As with the other methods, focus is put on machine learning modeling without considering domain knowledge. The method allows deriving executable code based on model transformation using xtext.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: various methods supporting the formalization of data-driven engineering or machine learning using modeling languages, are given.\nThe method of  is based on the Kevoree Modeling Framework KMF [ref]30, which is similar to the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) that is the basis for the open source modeling framework Papyrus444https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/.  proposes to model the domain\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
