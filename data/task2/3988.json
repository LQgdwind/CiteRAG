      "content": "Paper Title: MDMLP: Image Classification from Scratch on Small Datasets with MLP\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer  with attention mechanism has become the dominant architecture in natural language processing (NLP). As a successful application of the attention mechanism to the computer vision (CV), Vision Transformer (ViT), and its variations     , has gained popularity in many fields. Lately, the MLP-Mixer model , which is purely based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), has achieved a powerful performance compared to state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating a new probable research trend. However, there are still many problems to be resolved. First, MLP-Mixer and its variations  [ref]8  0 1 2 3 encode spatial information by flattening the spatial dimensions to the channel dimension (i.e. reshaped to \"tokens×\\timeschannels\"), resulting in the loss of positional and channel information. The Vision Permutator (ViP) [ref]8, which is closest to our work,\nsplits image to non-overlapping patches and permutes along height, width, and channel to apply MLP. However, this loses relation and continuity information between patches. Imaging pixels around a split boundary are highly correlated and continuous, but the model has no clue about it after splitting. Second, MLP-Mixer requires an immense amount of training dataset (14M-300M images), suffering the dilemma which cannot be trained in mid-size (1-10M images) or small-size datasets from scratch, and existing MLP models 4 5 6 7 have low accuracy for small-size datasets, compared to ConvNets. There has been a lot of work 2 0 8 that attempts to apply the MLP architecture to mid-size datasets. For small-size datasets, however, only the vision transformer variant 9 achieves fairly good results compared to ConvNets like ResNet.\nAlthough transfer learning is a good therapy for small-size datasets, on largely shifted domains, it may not be effective.\nIt remains a problem whether MLP-based architecture can be trained well from scratch on a small-size dataset. Third, MLP-Mixer uses non-overlap patch embedding, which loses potential positional information. Much work 0 1 2 3 has been done to explore this phenomenon. Our experiment has shown that the use of overlapped patches significantly improves performance by approximately 3%. Fourth, MLP-Mixer lacks an effective means of explanation. For ViT, attention visualization and interpretability 4 are important factors in its success, but for MLP-Mixer and similar methods, it’s unclear what are learned from training. EAMLP 5 uses linear layers to realize the multi-attention mechanism, but this is not a general approach (as applied to ConvNets) and is still limited to the self-attention mechanism. In view of the above problems, we propose an efficient architecture called multi-dim MLP (MDMLP). It accepts a sequence of linearly projected image patches (i.e. tokens) with overlap as input, keeping its dimensionality for not losing any information. MDMLP uses four types of MLP layers: height-mixing, width-mixing, channel-mixing, and token-mixing MLPs with normalization. In addition, for visualization, we propose a multi-dim MLP Attention Tool (MDAttnTool). It consists of two layers of MLPs with eight hidden units and an average pooling layer to get weights. Despite its simplicity, MDMLP with MDAttnTool has achieved excellent performance. Without strong augmentations, MDMLP achieves 90.90% on CIFAR10 along with 0.30M parameters and 0.28G flops, while MLP-Mixer 1 can only achieve 85.45% together with 17.1M parameters and 1.21G flops, and Neyshabur’s model 4 only achieves 85.19%. MDAttnTool successfully visualizes the attention area as well as the object boundary not only on MDMLP but also on ResNet 6, which proved to be a general visualization method, breaking through the existing self-attention mechanism. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We propose multi-dim MLP (MDMLP) to train from scratch on small-size datasets and gain the highest accuracy, with yet extremely low parameters and flops which are comparable to ConvNets. We propose overlap patch embedding to make up for the loss of adjacent information caused by the split of neighboring image blocks. We propose MLP Attention Tool (MLPAttnTool) to visualize the feature learned by the neural network, which is a general tool applicable not only to our model but also to other models such as ConvNets.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: performance compared to state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating a new probable research trend.
