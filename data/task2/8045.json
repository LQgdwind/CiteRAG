      "content": "Paper Title: Size Should not Matter: Scale-invariant Stress Metrics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen computing a drawing of a graph, the positions of vertices are typically represented by Cartesian coordinates with respect to some abstract axes. There exists a large and diverse set of graph drawing algorithms, but they all differ in their treatment of coordinate units - some algorithms aim for unit-length edges [ref]24, while others may treat vertices as objects with width in an n𝑛n-body simulation . It is intuitively understood by visualization designers that whatever units the output of a layout algorithm is, one must “scale” (stretch or shrink) the coordinates of the vertices uniformly, so that it visually fits the desired computer window or canvas. However, when applying evaluation metrics to compare two or more algorithms, this difference in units may have a drastic, out-sized effect on the results. In the literature, this effect is typically glossed over in a few sentences   if it is accounted for at all. The stress of the graph embedding aims to capture how well the graph distances are captured as Euclidean distances in the layout. Stress is the third most frequently used layout evaluation metric (after runtime and crossings)  . While there are many stress variants, one of the most frequently used ones, Normalized Stress (N​S𝑁𝑆NS)  [ref]24   , is severely affected by scale: Here, Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} and Xjsubscript𝑋𝑗X_{j} are the positions of vertices visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and vertex vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j}, di​jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{ij} is the length of the shortest path between them, and D={di​j|∀vi,vj∈V}𝐷conditional-setsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗for-allsubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑣𝑗𝑉D=\\{d_{ij}\\;|\\;\\forall v_{i},v_{j}\\in V\\}.\nThe normalization factor di​j−2superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗2d_{ij}^{-2} balances the influence of short and long distances: the greater the graph-theoretic distance, the more tolerance we allow in the difference between the two distances. Despite the name and presence of this normalization factor, the N​S𝑁𝑆NS metric is not normalized with respect to the scale of the positions of vertices, X𝑋X, nor is it normalized to a range (which is unbounded). Fixing X𝑋X and D𝐷D as constants, we can observe the behavior of the function N​S​(α​X,D)𝑁𝑆𝛼𝑋𝐷NS(\\alpha X,D) when varying the scaling factor α>0𝛼0\\alpha>0. Visually, there is no meaningful difference between drawings corresponding to different values of α𝛼\\alpha (e.g. α=1,α=2,formulae-sequence𝛼1𝛼2\\alpha=1,\\alpha=2, or α=0.5𝛼0.5\\alpha=0.5),\nas this just uniformly scales the drawing up or down by α𝛼\\alpha.\nScaling by α𝛼\\alpha does not change the geometric relationship between the vertices at all, and is an implicit step one must take when performing graph visualization (e.g., to fit in a predefined window size).\nHowever, as we can see from Figure 1, such scaling affects the value of N​S𝑁𝑆NS drastically. This makes N​S𝑁𝑆NS a poor measure to compare any two layout algorithms whose outputs might differ in scale. Further, when scale is not accounted for when comparing drawing algorithms, one cannot say where on the N​S𝑁𝑆NS-scale plot a drawing might fall. In Figure 1, this amounts to picking any point on the blue line for Neato, any point on the red line for SFDP, and again any point on the green line for the random algorithm. By doing this, any desired order of the drawing algorithms could be obtained, either by accident or intentionally choosing desirable scale factors. Our Contributions:\nIn this paper, we begin by considering several stress-based graph layout metrics and the impact on the value when scaling the layout.\nNotably, we show that the values of N​S𝑁𝑆NS (and two other commonly used ones) change by orders of magnitude with even small changes in scale.\nThis creates a major obstacle to fairly comparing graph layouts obtained by different algorithms, which usually produce layouts at different scales. Specifically:\n We show that comparing stress values and not accounting for scale can result in clearly incorrect conclusions. We review 6 existing methods and propose 2 new ones for evaluating stress and experimentally verify them. We propose a “gold standard” measure of stress, scale-normalized stress, that can be used to fairly compare the result of different graph layout algorithms. We provide open source implementations of all metrics, along with efficient computations thereof, as well as all the datasets, results, and analysis at our repository, https://github.com/JacobLMiller/graph-layout-metrics\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: to some abstract axes.
