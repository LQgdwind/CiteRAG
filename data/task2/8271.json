      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Learned Image Compression via Cross Window-based Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur evaluation involves benchmarking our method against state-of-the-art learned image compression models proposed by Ballé et al. [ref]3, Minnen et al. , Lee et al. , Hu et al. , and Cheng et al. . We gather their respective rate-distortion data points from published papers and official GitHub repositories. Additionally, we compare our approach with widely used traditional image compression codecs including JPEG , JPEG2000 , WebP , BPG , and VVC , assessing their performance using the CompressAI evaluation platform. In case of VVC, we utilize the latest VVC official Test Model VTM 12.1 with an intra-profile configuration sourced from its official GitHub page. We also evaluate BPG using the BPG software configured with YUV444 subsampling, the HEVC x265 implementation, and an 8-bit depth for image testing. We measure image distortion using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and MS-SSIM 3, and rate performance using bits per pixel (bpp). We generate rate-distortion (RD) curves based on their performance to compare the coding efficiency of different methods. Fig. 4 shows the RD curve on the Kodak and CLIC datasets. We convert MS-SSIM to -10 log10 (1- MS-SSIM) for clarity in comparison, which is similar to the previous work . Our method exhibits a slight edge over VVC (VTM 12.1) and demonstrates markedly superior performance compared to both established learned methods and traditional image compression standards. For the CLIC dataset, we compare our MSE optimized results with traditional compression standards and the learned methods with official testing results available in their paper or their official GitHub pages. The RD curves on the CLIC dataset are illustrated in Fig. 4. It is evident that our MSE-optimized approach outperforms all other methods. It is worth noting that the majority of images in the CLIC dataset have high resolutions, indicating that our method is more robust for compressing high-resolution images.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Our evaluation involves benchmarking our method against state-of-the-art learned image compression models proposed by Ballé et al.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
