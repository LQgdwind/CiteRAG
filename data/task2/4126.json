      "content": "Paper Title: Intrinsically motivated option learning: a comparative study of recent methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn [ref]6  the initial empowerment principle is modified in two significant ways. Firstly, the controllability distribution is no longer learned and is kept uniform to maximize the term ‚Ñã‚Äã(Œ©|s0)‚ÑãconditionalŒ©subscriptùë†0\\mathcal{H}(\\Omega|s_{0}) in objective (1). Secondly, options uninterruptedly execute for the entire duration of episodes, allowing them to maximize the diversity of options with respect to all states, as indicated by the term qœï‚Äã(Œ©|s)subscriptùëûitalic-œïconditionalŒ©ùë†q_{\\phi}(\\Omega|s) of (3). The efficiency of [ref]6  is brought into question in [ref]9 . Aubret et al.¬†[ref]9 state that it is not apparent how these algorithms can learn meaningful policies on tasks where terminating states are distinguishable, or simply do not exist. Namely, since the entropy over the controllability distribution is already preemptively maximized from the start, these agents essentially only optimize for the diversity of states that options visit. If a certain environment does not indeed have similar terminating states which indicate agent‚Äôs failure to learn meaningful behavior, then optimizing purely for state diversity may not be enough to learn such behavior. Here, we fully acknowledge that the term ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù may be vague, and discuss it in more detail in the following sections. Campos et al.¬† outline severe exploration problems demonstrating that these agents fail to leave the initial room in a maze-like setting. More specifically, they show that agents proposed by [ref]6  exhibit behavior similar to a random exploratory policy, but are good at partitioning states such policy visits into separate options. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we aim to test the claims made by [ref]9  and to that end we implement DIAYN [ref]6, verify our implementation against the original one, and run experiments on continuous control tasks . Secondly, we analyze the modifications made in [ref]6  through the lens of the original empowerment principle, and try to determine whether effects outlined in [ref]9  may be caused by these changes.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: In [ref]6  the initial empowerment principle is modified in two significant ways.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
