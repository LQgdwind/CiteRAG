      "content": "Paper Title: Self-healing Dilemmas in Distributed Systems: Fault Correction vs. Fault Tolerance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral complex systems in nature and society often exhibit striking reliability, a result of timely choosing, applying and orchestrating multiple self-healing and adaptation strategies. For instance, effectively mitigating blackouts in power grids requires several tailored fault-correction and fault-tolerance mechanisms, whose coordination is way more sophisticated than simply repairing the originating fault of a power line. These include resilient topological design, load-shedding, operating reserves, islanding and active devices among others [ref]1. While a level of sophisticated self-healing in natural systems is usually a result of self-adaptation and evolution, in artificial socio-technical systems with central control such as power grids, reliability remains to a high extent a result of planning based on past experience, adaptations based on precomputed simulations and manual human interventions by system operators. Decentralized autonomous systems recently witness a phenomenal rise with the applicability of distributed ledgers, edge computing, multi-agent systems and the Internet of Things in several sectors of society, e.g. energy, transport, health, agriculture, etc . Large-scale asynchronous distributed environments experience unprecedented network/system uncertainties that challenge the orchestration of self-healing strategies: Fault detection inherits these uncertainties that can make a faulty remote process indistinguishable from a slow process  . As a result, a reactive system recovery may turn into an undesirable fault correction of a non-faulty system, which in turn may cause an actual fault that could be prevented instead with fault tolerance, i.e. a more proactive and preventive system maintenance. Figure 1 illustrates the self-healing dilemma problem studied in this paper. The effective resolution of such fault-correction vs. fault-tolerance dilemmas promises more effective self-healing mechanisms for large-scale decentralized networked systems with uncertainties. A more informed and timely application of fault correction and fault tolerance has the potential to decrease the likelihood of new faults by self-healing itself, against which decentralized systems remain more resilient with a lower communication and processing cost. This paper models and classifies the possible outcomes of self-healing dilemmas between pairs of agents, where one monitors the health status of the other, while both can arbitrary defect. These outcomes are possible desirable and undesirable states (inconsistencies) into which self-healing can fall. The cost of these inconsistencies by undesirable outcomes is further formalized and distinguished within fault scenarios during system runtime. These fault scenarios have the novelty of predicting the performance of self-healing mechanisms without knowledge of the computational/application scenario, overlying algorithms or application data. The modeled fault scenarios are applied and studied to the computational case study of decentralized dynamic in-network aggregation  by introducing a new prototyped fault-detection mechanism based on gossip-based communication  and agent migrations . Fault correction and fault tolerance are employed to improve the estimates of aggregation functions made by each node in the network. These estimations approximate, for instance, the total power demand based on which decentralized demand-response programs and power markets operate . To preserve accuracy, fault correction performs risky recomputations of the total power demand reactively when faults are detected with uncertainty, while fault tolerance relies entirely on occasional proactive recomputations to capture changes. A rigorous experimental methodology is introduced to tackle three objectives: (i) Profiling of the inconsistency cost generated by the modeled fault scenarios across 696 experimental settings with varying fault scales, fault profiles and fault-detection thresholds. (ii) Validation of whether the inconsistency cost measured by the modeled fault scenarios is a good general predictor of the accuracy observed in the application scenario of decentralized aggregation of real-world power consumption data. (iii) Comparison of different model calibrations for the prediction of aggregation accuracy by relying on application-independent features. The findings of the experimental evaluation have significant implications and impact for system designers and operators: By (re)using the general-purpose fault scenarios for vulnerability analysis, the resilience of different system designs can be assessed at an early stage with low cost and under different fault characteristics, while fault-detection mechanisms can be parameterized more effectively. Application developers can improve the self-healing capabilities of applications at the design phase by predicting the impact of faults and tuning appropriately the application before deployment to lower its cost. They can also plan computational resources for self-healing more effectively. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (i) The modeling of possible outcomes in agents’ self-healing dilemmas. (ii) The modeling of application-independent fault scenarios during system runtime that sufficiently formalize the overall heath status of decentralized systems and their impact on self-healing performance. (iii) A general-purpose novel fault-detection mechanism based on gossip-based communication and migrating agents. (iv) The applicability of the fault-detection mechanism to the Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service (DIAS)  for the improvement of its aggregation accuracy. Self-corrective operations of DIAS are expanded when nodes massively fail . (v) The profiling of the predicted inconsistencies that different fault scenarios cause under different fault scales, profiles and fault-detection thresholds. (vi) Three model calibration methods to improve the accuracy of the predicted inconsistencies that rely entirely on application-independent features. This paper is organized as follows: Section II positions and compares this study with related work. Section III models the uncertainties in fault detection for large-scale asynchronous decentralized systems and introduces the possible outcomes in agents’ self-healing dilemmas. Section IV formalizes fault scenarios that predict the cost of inconsistencies caused by faults. Section V illustrates the applicability of the proposed model in a case study of decentralized aggregation. The mechanisms for fault detection, fault correction and fault tolerance to improve aggregation accuracy are outlined. Section VI introduces the experimental methodology that addresses the objectives of this study and Section VII illustrates the findings of the experimental evaluation. Finally, Section VIII concludes this paper and outlines future work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: sophisticated than simply repairing the originating fault of a power line.
