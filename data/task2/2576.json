To improve an agent’s generalization to unseen environments, data augmentation is performed by using a speaker model [ref]11 that generates instructions for random paths in seen environments, and environment dropout [ref]40 is used to mimic new environments.\nWhile pretraining LSTMs for transferable representations is adopted by [ref]16, recently, there has been a shift towards transformer models  to learn generic multimodal representations.\nThis is further extended to a recurrent model that significantly improves sequential action prediction .\nHowever, the limited environments in pretraining  [ref]16 constrain the generalization ability to unseen scenarios.\nMost related to this work, VLN-BERT  transfers knowledge from abundant, but out-of-domain image-text data to improve path-instruction matching.\nIn this work, we not only create a large-scale, in-domain BnB dataset, but also propose effective pretraining strategies to mitigate the domain-shift between webly crawled image-text pairs and VLN data. Large-scale visio-linguistic pretraining.\nThanks to large-scale image-caption pairs automatically collected from the web  2 5 6, visio-linguistic pretraining (VLP) has made great breakthroughs in recent years.\nSeveral VLP models    9 have been proposed based on the transformer architecture .\nThese models are often pretrained with self-supervised objectives akin to those in BERT :\nmasked language modeling, masked region modeling and vision-text pairing.\nFine-tuning them on downstream datasets achieves state-of-the-art performance on various VL tasks    .\nWhile such pretraining focuses on learning correlations between vision and text, it is not designed for sequential decision making as required in embodied VLN.\nThe goal of this work is not to improve VLP architectures but to present in-domain training strategies that lead to performance improvements for VLN tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: followup tasks introduced in recent years     0 1 4 7 .\nEarly days of VLN saw the use of sequence-to-sequence LSTMs to predict low-level actions  or high-level directions in a panoramic action space [ref]11.\nDifferent attention mechanisms  3 are proposed to improve cross-modal alignment.\nVarious reinforcement learning based training algorithms [ref]40    and searching algorithms in inference\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
