      "content": "Paper Title: Rewards Encoding Environment Dynamics Improves Preference-based Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe quality of a reinforcement learned (RL) policy depends directly on the quality of the reward function used to train it. However, hand-crafting reward functions is very challenging, even for experts. A poorly specified reward can result in sub-optimal behaviors, with reward exploitation frequently leading to undesired behaviors [ref]3  . Therefore, methods for specifying robust, non-hackable reward functions are critical to correctly and efficiently train policies with RL. One such method is to teach an agent to align its policy with human preferences by distilling reward functions from feedback on sets of trajectories [ref]1        . Learning from preference labels over sets of trajectories is promising as it empowers non-experts to provide such feedback, especially compared to providing corrections (e.g. DAgger  and related approaches) or providing real-valued rewards (e.g. TAMER [ref]14 and related approaches). Still, the majority of existing preference-based deep RL methods require either a dataset of demonstrations  or thousands of preference labels to recover optimal policy performance [ref]1  . In this paper, we target efficient reward function learning by introducing Rewards Encoding Environment Dynamics (REED) (Section 4.1). Given the difficulty people face when providing feedback for a single state-action pair (e.g. [ref]14), and the importance of defining preferences over transitions instead of single state-action pairs , it is likely that people’s internal reward functions are defined over outcomes not state-action pairs. We hypothesize that: (1) modelling the relationship between state, action, and next-state triplets is essential for learning preferences over transitions, (2) encoding environment dynamics with a temporal consistency objective will allow the reward function to better generalize over states and actions with similar outcomes, and (3) exposing the reward model to all transitions experienced by the policy during training will result in more stable reward estimations during reward and policy learning. Therefore, we incorporate a self-supervised temporal consistency task using self-predictive representations (SPR)  into preference-based RL frameworks. REED reward functions lead to faster policy training and reduce the number of preference samples needed (as we will show in Section 5). We demonstrate the benefits of REED using the current state-of-the-art in preference learning ([ref]1, ). In our experiments, which follow those outlined in , REED reward functions outperform non-REED reward functions across different preference dataset sizes, quality of preference labelling strategy, and tasks (Section 5.2). The improvements in policy learning and preference sample efficiency represent a significant step towards enabling end-users to naturally adjust the behavior of agents in their environment with their own feedback.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: reward functions is very challenging, even for experts.
