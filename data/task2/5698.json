      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer-based Planning for Symbolic Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is essential to highlight that the implementation of the MCTS approach in TPSR differs from the standalone MCTS algorithm for SR. In a recent work, Sun et al. [ref]26 shows that Monte Carlo Tree Search can be effective for exploring the optimal expression trees that govern nonlinear dynamical systems. This work introduces several adjustments to the conventional MCTS to enable the recovery of equations as expression trees. However, we would like to remark that using MCTS as a standalone algorithm for SR is a single-instance SR method, meaning that it requires searching from scratch for a new function or measurement data, and does not leverage pre-trained SR priors.\nTo highlight the role of pre-trained transformer in our TPSR framework, we compare the MCTS-guided decoding algorithm in TPSR (Fig. 9, replicated from the main body for ease of comparison) with a standard MCTS algorithm (Fig. 8) which can be used in a similar fashion but without sharing information with the transformers. During the expansion phase, standard MCTS chooses the next accessible action from the action set (i.e., the vocabulary of tokens) and appends the state that can be reached through the chosen action. In this example, action x1subscriptùë•1x_{1} is selected, and the new state appended to the tree is [s‚Äãi‚Äãn,x1]ùë†ùëñùëõsubscriptùë•1[sin,x_{1}]. Subsequently, during the evaluation phase, MCTS assesses the new state by implementing a random policy from the new state and calculating the policy‚Äôs value. Applying the standard MCTS algorithm to domains characterized by extensive state or action spaces, such as SR with a combinatorial optimization space that exponentially grows with the number of input variables, is highly impractical. This is because attempting all possible actions in the expansion phase is infeasible. Furthermore, the random policy employed in the evaluation phase exhibits significant variance when estimating the new state‚Äôs value, and may result in invalid equations that are unsuitable for proper evaluation (e.g., accurately assessing fitting performance). To overcome these limitations, TPSR employs the pre-trained Transformer SR model. This approach leverages the semantic knowledge embedded in large-scale pre-trained priors, while conducting lookahead planning to optimize equation generation for the equation discovery non-differentiable objectives. By integrating the pre-trained Transformer SR model, TPSR can effectively navigate the vast search space, reducing complexity and enhancing fitting performance, thus offering a more viable solution for the domain of SR. It is also crucial to emphasize how the integration of MCTS in TPSR differentiates from others, particularly from works like Kamienny et al. , which also pairs MCTS with pre-trained Transformers.\nKey differentiators include: General Approach.\nUnlike  that exploits a pre-trained mutation policy MùëÄM to generate the expression by following a series of mutations from an empty expression (root), TPSR follows the seq2seq approach of E2E [ref]18 to generate the expression token-by-token. Consequently, TPSR uses the pre-trained E2E as its backbone but  pre-trains the mutation policy from scratch. MCTS and Search Strategy.\nIn , the search tree consists of full mathematical equations, with each node representing a distinct equation and edges corresponding to mutations between equations. In contrast, TPSR employs MCTS as a decoding strategy in the context of the transformer model. Each node in the search tree of TPSR represents the current state of generated tokens, potentially forming non-complete sequences, with edges corresponding to mathematical operators or variables. So, the search tree of  with ‚Äún‚Äù nodes includes ‚Äún‚Äù different equations, while the TPSR search tree includes partial decoded sequences, and completed equations only exist at the terminal nodes. This distinction inherently leads to major differences in selection, expansion, and back-propagation mechanisms within the MCTS algorithm. Parameter Update and Learning.\n utilizes MCTS to update and learn the distribution of mutations for a group of out-of-distribution datasets. The approach involves fine-tuning an actor-critic-like model to adjust the pre-trained model on a group of symbolic regression instances. On the other hand, TPSR uses the pre-trained transformer‚Äôs learned distribution to guide the expansion during the search process, without updating any specific parameters for in-domain or out-of-domain datasets (without fine-tuning). Consequently, the same settings and pre-trained model are applied to both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations in TPSR. Computation Time.\n involves pre-training a mutation policy, a critic network, and performing fine-tuning stages for these networks, leading to significantly higher computation time (a limit of 242424hrs and 500500500K equation candidate evaluations as stated in ). In contrast, TPSR has substantially lower computation time and the number of equation candidate evaluations, typically in the order of 102superscript10210^{2} equations, taking approximately 102superscript10210^{2} seconds (as shown in Fig.¬†5 and 7). This renders TPSR more suitable for applications where fast yet accurate equation discovery is critical.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: It is essential to highlight that the implementation of the MCTS approach in TPSR differs from the standalone MCTS algorithm for SR.
