      "content": "Paper Title: Analog fast Fourier transforms for scalable and efficient signal processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe increasing deployment of remote and inter-connected sensors and actuators is leading to the collection of ever larger volumes of data from the physical world. Acting on this information in real time requires computation to be done on the data where it is sensed ‚Äì at the ‚Äúedge‚Äù of the network ‚Äì and the raw sensed signals often must be processed by linear transforms to be made suitable for further processing, communication, or storage. One of the most ubiquitous transforms is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which converts a spatial or temporal digital signal to its frequency representation. When used in an edge or Internet-of-Things (IoT) device, the DFT can form images of the sensed environment from radar data    , filter and amplify audio signals to aid in hearing  , and modulate signals for broadband wireless communication with other IoT devices  [ref]8 . An indispensable instrument for real-time signal processing on power-starved systems is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which reduces the computational complexity of the DFT 0. Despite the efficiency of this algorithm, the end of Dennard scaling means that there will no longer be improvements to the energy per arithmetic operation using CMOS logic 1. Therefore, conventional digital processors may soon prove inadequate for the large-scale data processing capabilities that are desired in future edge or IoT devices. Analog in-memory computing (IMC) systems are a potential solution to overcome these scaling limits. These systems exploit analog circuit laws to rapidly and efficiently compute matrix operations inside non-volatile memory arrays, while greatly reducing the crippling energy overhead of data movement between the memory and processor in traditional von Neumann architectures 2 3 4. These advantages enable analog IMC to process machine learning (ML) inference workloads with potentially orders-of-magnitude greater performance per watt, as explored in numerous recent works 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2. However, the same benefits have yet to materialize for executing the important DFT operations that often come before or after the ML algorithm in edge systems, and would thus become the bottleneck. This is because while the DFT can be expressed as a matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), it can be computed using far fewer mathematical operations by using the FFT algorithm. While this enormous advantage has been enjoyed by digital processors for decades, analog IMC systems have yet to capitalize on the benefits of the FFT, severely limiting their efficiency and scalability. Analog IMC systems to date have relied exclusively on a direct MVM mapping of the DFT and its real-only counterpart, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) 3. With this approach, analog IMC retains its low energy-per-operation only up to DFT sizes that can fit within a single memory array. Therefore, the largest experimentally demonstrated analog DFTs and DCTs are on signals containing only 64 points per dimension 4 5 6. Relying on these prior methods would preclude analog processing from scaling to the much larger DFT sizes needed for many practical applications. In this article, we propose and demonstrate a new, more scalable mapping of the Fourier transform onto analog IMC architectures that is based on the classic Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm 7. This method factorizes large DFTs into smaller elementary DFTs that are then computed by analog MVMs, which enables a single modestly sized memory array to efficiently process arbitrarily large DFTs when accompanied by a small amount of digital processing. Compared to prior analog IMC approaches, the analog FFT reduces the energy and area scaling of the DFT from O‚Äã(N2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëÅ2O(N^{2}) to O‚Äã(N‚Äãlog‚ÄãN)ùëÇùëÅlogùëÅO(N\\text{log}N), just as the original FFT algorithm reduced the complexity of the DFT on digital processors. However, the optimal analog implementation of the FFT has essential differences from the optimal digital implementation, and achieves its O‚Äã(N‚Äãlog‚ÄãN)ùëÇùëÅlogùëÅO(N\\text{log}N) scaling in a different way. Along with higher efficiency, the analog FFT can also yield more accurate DFTs than prior analog IMC approaches, independently of the memory technology used for computing. As a proof-of-concept, we have implemented analog FFTs on a large array of charge-trapping flash memory devices based on the silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) material stack, and experimentally computed the frequency spectra of 1D audio and 2D image signals. The subthreshold operation and precise analog programmability of this memory enables half a million devices to simultaneously participate in a single analog MVM while retaining high accuracy. Leveraging the scalability of both the FFT and the SONOS memory technology, we compute analog DFTs of up to 65,536 points, three orders of magnitude larger than any prior DFT computed using analog hardware. We also show that while the energy of both analog and digital FFTs fundamentally scales as ùí™‚Äã(N‚Äãlog‚ÄãN)ùí™ùëÅlogùëÅ\\mathcal{O}(N\\text{log}N), analog FFTs can have a 15√ó\\times to 60√ó\\times energy advantage at all practical DFT sizes over digital FFTs. This is benchmarked by simulating 40-nm node SONOS analog IMC circuits and by executing FFT designs on the 7-nm node AMD Xilinx Versal chip, which contains dedicated accelerators for signal processing. Our results demonstrate the versatility of analog accelerators to reach the scale and accuracy needed for practical workloads, not just in ML but across a wide range of signal processing applications.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: can form images of the sensed environment from radar data    , filter and amplify audio signals to aid in hearing  , and modulate signals for broadband wireless communication with other IoT devices  [ref]8 .
