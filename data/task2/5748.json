      "content": "Paper Title: Logic of Differentiable Logics: Towards a Uniform Semantics of DL\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have presented a general language (LTL) for expressing properties of neural networks. Our contributions are: 1) LDL generalises other known DLs and provides a language that is rich enough to express complex verification properties; 2) with LDL we achieved the level of rigour that allows to formally separate the formal language from its semantics, and thus opens a way for systematic analysis of properties of different DLs; 3) by defining different DLs in LDL, we proved properties concerning their soundness and resulting loss functions, and opened the way for uniform empirical evaluation of DLs. We now discuss related work. There are many methods of passing external knowledge in the form of logical constraints to neural networks. The survey by Giunchiglia et al. 6 discusses multitude of approaches including methods based on loss functions   , to which LDL belongs, but also others such as tailoring neural network architectures , or guaranteeing constraint satisfaction at the level of neural network outputs 9 . As Giunchiglia et al. 6 establish, the majority of approaches are tailored to specific problems, and only Fischer et al.  and van Krieken et al.  go as far as to include quantifiers. LDL generalises both. Analysis of properties of loss functions. Property analysis, especially of smoothness  or bilateral properties , is a prominent field [ref]42. One of LDL’s achievements is to expose trade-offs between satisfying desired geometric and logic properties of a loss functions. Neural Network Verification. While this work does not attempt to verify neural networks, we draw our motivation from this area of research. It has been observed in verification literature that neural networks often fail to satisfy logical constraints . One of proposed solutions is training the NN to satisfy a constraint prior to verifying them  . This belongs to an approach referred to as continuous verification   which focuses on the cycle between training and verification. LDL fits into this trend. Indeed, the tool Vehicle that implements LDL is also built to work with NN verifiers . Logics for Uncertainty and Probabilistic Logics. LDLs have a strong connection to fuzzy logic . Via the use of probability distributions and expectations, we draw our connection to Probabilistic Prolog and similar languages  . We differ as none of those approaches can be used to formulate loss functions, which is the main goal of LDL. Adversarial training. Starting with the seminal paper by Szegedy et al. , thousands of papers in machine learning literature have been devoted to adversarial attacks and robust training of neural networks. Majority of those papers does not use a formal logical language for attack or loss function generation. LDL opens new avenues for this community, as allows one to formulate other properties of interest apart from robustness, see e.g.  . We intend to use LDL to further study the questions of a suitable semantics for DL, both proof-theoretic and denotational, possibly taking inspiration from . For proof-theoretic semantics, we need to find new DLs with tighter correspondence to LJ; and moreover new calculi can be developed on the basis of LJ to suit the purpose. Since loss functions are used in computation, we conjecture that constructive logics (or semi-constructive logics as in ) will be useful in this domain. For denotational semantics, we intend to explore Kripke frame semantics.\nFuture work could also include finding the best combination of logical and geometric properties in a DL and formulating new DLs that satisfy them. Thorough evaluation of performance of all the DLs is also left to future work: it includes formulating heuristics for finding local/global maxima for quantifier interpretation, and evaluation of LDL effectiveness within the continuous verification cycle. Finally,\nfinding novel ways of defining quantifiers that commute with DL connectives is an interesting challenge.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: go as far as to include quantifiers.
