      "content": "Paper Title: Objective and Interpretable Breast Cosmesis Evaluation with Attention Guided Denoising Diffusion Anomaly Detection Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe cosmetic outcome after breast cancer surgery carries considerable significance in relation to the quality of life experienced by patients  . It is recognized as a crucial aspect impacting patients’ well-being, considering breast cancer’s status as the most prevalent cancer affecting women, with approximately 2.26 million new cases reported globally in 2020 [ref]3.\nIndividuals who have undergone breast cancer surgery often express concerns regarding the shape, size, and overall appearance of their breasts. These concerns can exert a detrimental impact on their psychological and social well-being   [ref]27.\nVarious methods exist for evaluating the cosmetic outcome of breast cancer surgery. The modified Harvard-Harris cosmetic scale is a commonly employed subjective scoring system used to assess the cosmetic outcome following breast-conserving surgery . This scale focuses on aspects such as symmetry, general appearance, shape, size, color, and nipple position of both breasts, categorizing the cosmesis into four groups: excellent, good, fair, and poor.\nHowever, the modified Harvard-Harris cosmetic scale is subject to subjective interpretation and suffers from low inter-rater reliability. To overcome these limitations, BCCT.core, a software tool, has been developed for the objective evaluation of cosmetic outcomes in BCS using digital photographs . BCCT.core automatically measures various features in the photographs, including symmetry, shape, size, consistency, color, and nipple position. These measured features are then utilized to calculate a single score through a rule-based approach. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the utilization of deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) models for the assessment of cosmetic outcomes in breast conserving surgery. [ref]18 demonstrated the potential of DL algorithms in evaluating breast cosmesis by accurately detecting and delineating the breast contour using expert-labeled data. However, this approach is inherently limited by the constraints of traditional supervised learning-based DL algorithms.\nFirstly, these approaches heavily rely on the availability of data and the accuracy of ground truth labels for effective training. The dependence on expert annotation necessitates a labor-intensive process of individually annotating images, incurring significant costs and impeding the construction of large-scale datasets. Furthermore, models trained using this approach are constrained by the performance limitations of the ground truth labels, which may contain inherent inaccuracies and possibilities of inherent biases, especially in cases where subjective evaluation is involved during the labeling process, as in the assessment of breast cosmesis. Additionally, traditional DL methods are susceptible to overfitting issues when confronted with limited data, hindering their ability to generalize well across diverse scenarios . Lastly, conventional supervised DL models often lack interpretability, as they have limited capacity to generate high-quality visualizations for comprehensive understanding.\nIn contrast,  explored the feasibility of utilizing an anomaly score for breast cancer patients with reconstruction, indicating its potential as a valuable tool for predicting cosmetic outcomes. However, this study primarily focused on the analysis of 3-dimensional simulation CT images and primarily concentrated on comparing cosmesis before and after radiation therapy, rather than directly evaluating cosmesis through high-quality visualizations. To overcome these challenges, we put forth an innovative architecture named the Attention-Guided Denoising Diffusion Anomaly Detection (AG-DDAD), which harnesses both the high-quality generation capability of diffusion models and the salient feature discernment ability provided by DINO vision transformer (ViT) attention (Supplementary Information).\nOur model can be trained in an unsupervised manner, utilizing readily available and unlabeled data from 1,237 patients with predominantly normal cosmesis (excellent to good), which account for the majority of patient population. This eliminates the need for expert annotation and manual delineation during evaluation. AG-DDAD provides direct and exceptional visualization outcomes by comparing the expected restoration results in cases of normal cosmesis, offering valuable insights into the factors contributing to poor cosmesis. To validate the performance of our model, we conducted experiments using a well-curated dataset comprising 300 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer, alongside consensus labels obtained from clinical experts. The results demonstrated the superiority of our model over conventional rule-based methods and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly detection approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: a crucial aspect impacting patients’ well-being, considering breast cancer’s status as the most prevalent cancer affecting women, with approximately 2.26 million new cases reported globally in 2020 [ref]3.\nIndividuals who have undergone breast cancer surgery often express concerns regarding the shape, size, and overall appearance of their breasts.
