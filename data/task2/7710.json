      "content": "Paper Title: Cost-sensitive computational adequacy of higher-order recursion in synthetic domain theory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSynthetic domain theory (SDT) as a field started when Dana Scott conjectured that one ought to be able to reason about domains as if they were just sets provided that one employs a constructive ambient metalanguage. In technical terms, this metalanguage can be construed as the internal languages of a topos, i.e. an extensional dependent type theory. In general it is difficult to reconcile the domain-theoretic structure with the rich logical structure of dependent type theory, so the quest for SDT was in essence about constructing full subcategories of topoi that supported domain-theoretic constructions. Fullness is a critical property ‚Äî it means that every map definable in type-theoretic language is a domain morphism, which absolves one from checking onerous side conditions when working internally. Today there are two kinds of synthetic domain theory that are mutually incompatible: one based on realizability (Hyland¬†, Phoa¬†, Reus¬†) and one based on sheaf topoi (Rosolini¬†, Fiore and Rosolini¬†[ref]6, Fiore and Plotkin¬†, Matache et al.¬†[ref]15). In this paper we will construct a sheaf model of SDT, so we take a moment to recall the basic ideas, mainly drawing from the work of Fiore and Plotkin¬†. Sheaf models of SDT. The intuition behind (pre)sheaf models of synthetic domain theory is to use the Yoneda embedding to embed a category of predomains as a full subcategory of an ambient category whose internal language is dependent type theory. Thus given a (small222The fact that natural categories of predomains are rarely small can be overcome by means of Grothendieck universes or a small dense subcategory (e.g. {œâ}‚Ü™fullœâ‚ÄãCPOfull‚Ü™ùúîùúîCPO\\{\\omega\\}\\xhookrightarrow{\\text{full}}\\omega\\textbf{CPO}{}).) category of predomains Gùê∫G, the category of presheaves on Gùê∫G presents the original category of predomains as a full subcategory, which constitutes a simple model of SDT. However there are some strange properties of this model from an internal perspective. For example, because the ‚àÖ\\emptyset is the initial object in Gùê∫G, it is a sub-predomain of every other predomain. But because the embedding does not preserve colimits, the subcategory of predomains does not contain an initial object from the perspective of G^^ùê∫\\widehat{G}; in other words, this means that while the empty set is a subset of every predomain, it is not a sub-predomain, which obstructs the use of the ambient logic to reason about (pre)domains. We may repair the model by imposing a nontrivial topology on Gùê∫G that ensures that the empty predomain is preserved by the embedding into the category of sheaves on Gùê∫G. In practice one may choose to preserve additional colimits as the application demands ‚Äî for instance in Section¬†9 we will construct a model of SDT in which discrete finite predomains are preserved.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Today there are two kinds of synthetic domain theory that are mutually incompatible: one based on realizability (Hyland¬†, Phoa¬†, Reus¬†) and one based on sheaf topoi (Rosolini¬†, Fiore and Rosolini¬†[ref]6, Fiore and Plotkin¬†, Matache et al.¬†[ref]15).
