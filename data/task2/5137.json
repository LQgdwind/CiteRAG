      "content": "Paper Title: DGEKT: A Dual Graph Ensemble Learning Method for Knowledge Tracing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the statistics of UNESCO111https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse/globalcoalition, more than 1.5 billion students worldwide have been affected by school and university closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn response to this crisis, online learning, which serves as an alternative to traditional face-to-face learning, is developing on an unprecedented scale.\nIt is increasingly accessible for students to study on all sorts of online learning platforms, including Coursera, Udacity, and edX. In the meantime, it has become crucial for online learning platforms to automatically estimate students’ knowledge states, i.e., their mastery level of different knowledge concepts (e.g., the concepts of linear equation, power function, and inequality in mathematics) .\nThis enables a personalized learning experience to be provided for each student, such as learning resource recommendation , adaptive testing , and student profiling . Knowledge tracing is one of the major research directions to address this problem.\nAlthough the mission is to monitor students’ evolving knowledge states during the learning process, it is difficult to dynamically obtain the true knowledge states of students .\nAs an alternative, knowledge tracing predicts students’ future performance on concept-related exercises based on their past interactions.\nIn this way, students’ knowledge states of each concept can be indirectly traced by observing their answers on the exercises related to the concept.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, knowledge tracing models take the exercise-answering sequence of a student as the input.\nGenerally, most models simplify the learning environments by assuming that the student’s answers are only binary (i.e., correct or incorrect responses).\nGiven a new exercise, the output of knowledge tracing models is the probability that the student correctly answers the exercise. In the literature, knowledge tracing has been investigated for decades.\nAt the early stage, some studies adopted the hidden Markov model to capture how students’ knowledge state changes, among which the most popular method is bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) [ref]6 [ref]7.\nWith the rise of deep learning, deep knowledge tracing (DKT) introduced recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to knowledge tracing and achieved promising results due to its ability to model long dependencies between learning interactions .\nAfter that, more types of neural networks were used to improve knowledge tracing, such as memory-augmented neural networks [ref]9 0 and transformer networks 1 2.\nRecently, motivated by the observation that knowledge concepts are not isolated but interrelated to each other, the relationship information was incorporated as an inductive bias to improve knowledge tracing.\nEspecially with the popularity of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) 3, different exercises and their dependencies are typically viewed as nodes and edges in a graph, and the influence between exercises is modeled via the node representation learning applied on the graph. In spite of the encouraging progress, graph-based knowledge tracing methods remain unsatisfactory, and the technology is still in its infancy.\nA major limitation of existing research is the focus on a single type of relationship information, and the oversight of the fact that exercises are broadly connected via a variety of relationships.\nThe potential benefits of integrating different relationship information for knowledge tracing are under-explored.\nIn addition, only the exercise embeddings are generated through GCNs in existing research, which need to be further concatenated with the corresponding answer embeddings to represent students’ learning interactions before they are fed into knowledge tracing models 4 5.\nAs pointed out in , the separate embeddings of exercises and answers may be incompatible and degrade the performance. In this paper, distinguished from prior studies relying on the dependencies between exercises, we investigate the relational graph of students’ learning interactions, in which each node directly represents the combination of which exercise is answered and whether it is answered correctly or not.\nAs a result, the intermediate step of separately acquiring and integrating the exercise and answer embeddings is skipped.\nMore importantly, we establish a dual graph structure of learning interactions to capture their heterogeneous relationships.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, a concept association hypergraph (CAHG) is constructed to reveal the associated knowledge concepts of learning interactions.\nIntuitively, a group of learning interactions can be made due to the mastery or non-mastery of the same knowledge concept.\nIn the hypergraph 6, a hyperedge expresses a group-wise relationship linking multiple nodes simultaneously.\nMeanwhile, a directed transition graph (DTG) is used to describe the directed transitions from one learning interaction to another according to the learning sequences of all students.\nThis is inspired by the observation that owing to the relatively short time interval between them, two consecutive interactions are more likely to be triggered in students’ knowledge states with little change.\nIn this way, the underlying collaborative effects across students are implicitly exploited.\nBy propagating and aggregating the information over the dual graph structure, the hypergraph convolutional networks 7 and directed graph convolutional networks 8 are deployed to learn the node embeddings, respectively.\nFurthermore, the hidden representations of students’ knowledge states can be expressed in CAHG and DTG from two independent perspectives.\n For a comprehensive framework, it is logical to combine the dual graph models.\nThe most straightforward way may be the concatenation- or adding-based fusion of their outputs.\nBut in this study, we innovatively introduce the idea of online knowledge distillation 9 to achieve this end.\nRecall that knowledge tracing models aim to assess a student’s knowledge state by predicting the student’s performance on the exercises related to different concepts.\nHowever, due to the use of the student’s unique historical learning sequence, knowledge tracing models can only be trained with respect to the prediction accuracy of the response to a single exercise at each step.\nWith online knowledge distillation, we regard the dual graph models as peer student models and adaptively ensemble them to build a stronger teacher model using a gating mechanism 0.\nBoth student and teacher models are trained as usual by optimizing the prediction on the next exercise.\nAdditionally, the teacher’s predictions on all exercises are distilled back to student models as extra supervision, leading to more powerful modeling capacity.\nDuring training, the dual graph models can exchange their information and learn from each other via the ensemble teacher model;\nin testing, the stronger teacher model is deployed to achieve better prediction accuracy. In a nutshell, we present a Dual Graph Ensemble learning method for Knowledge Tracing (DGEKT), which makes three main contributions: We propose a novel dual graph structure of students’ learning interactions for knowledge tracing, based on which DGEKT captures the heterogeneous exercise-concept associations and interaction transitions via hypergraph modeling and directed graph modeling, respectively. We leverage online knowledge distillation to form an ensemble teacher model by adaptively combining the dual graph models, which in turn provides its predictions on all exercises as extra supervision for higher modeling capacity.\nTo the best of our knowledge, DGEKT is the first effort to incorporate knowledge distillation techniques to knowledge tracing. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets in comparison with eight previous methods.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that DGEKT achieves state-of-the-art performance for knowledge tracing. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.\nSection 2 reviews the related work.\nSection 3 presents the proposed method for knowledge tracing.\nExperimental results and analysis are reported in Section 4, followed by the conclusion in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: decades.\nAt the early stage, some studies adopted the hidden Markov model to capture how students’ knowledge state changes, among which the most popular method is bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) [ref]6 [ref]7.\nWith the rise of deep learning, deep knowledge tracing (DKT) introduced recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to knowledge tracing and achieved promising results due to its ability to model\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
