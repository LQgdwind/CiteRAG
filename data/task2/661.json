Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

For the models that output 3D positions, we report the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE)  in millimeter, which is commonly used in human pose estimation. For those that predict angles, we follow the standard evaluation protocol  [ref]17 [ref]20 and report the Euclidean distance in Euler angle representation. Baselines. We compare our approach with two RNN-based methods, Res. sup.  and MHU [ref]30, and two feed-forward models, convSeq2Seq [ref]17 and LTD [ref]20, which constitutes the state of the art. The angular results of Res. sup. , convSeq2Seq [ref]17 and MHU on H3.6M are directly taken from the respective paper. For the other results of Res. sup.  and convSeq2Seq [ref]17, we adapt the code provided by the authors for H3.6M to 3D and AMASS. For LTD [ref]20, we rely on the pre-trained models released by the authors for H3.6M, and train their model on AMASS using their official code. While Res. sup. , convSeq2Seq [ref]17 and MHU [ref]30 are all trained to generate 25 future frames, LTD [ref]20 has 3 different models, which we refer to as LTD-50-25 [ref]20, LTD-10-25 [ref]20, and LTD-10-10 [ref]20. The two numbers after the method name indicate the number of observed past frames and that of future frames to predict, respectively, during training. For example, LTD-10-25 [ref]20 means that the model is trained to take the past 10 frames as input to predict the future 25 frames.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: we report the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE)  in millimeter, which is commonly used in human pose estimation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
