As shown in TABLE II, the SOTA STL supervised model is 3D ResNeXt-50 , which has WAR performance difference of 20.70% (83.69% vs. 62.99%) with our MTCAE-DFER model. Compared to the SOTA STL self-supervised model, MTCAE-DFER outperforms the MAE-DFER  model by 8.13% (83.69% vs. 75.56%) in terms of WAR. Furthermore, our proposed MTCAE-DFER model achieves performance by 9.50% (83.69% vs. 74.19%) WAR over the SOTA MTL supervised model MTL-ER . When compared to the SOTA MTL self-supervised model MTFormer [ref]17, the MTCAE-DFER model increases WAR by 4.01% (83.69% vs. 79.68%). The previous SOTA model results on CREMA-D  are presented in TABLE III. We observed that the MTCAE-DFER model surpasses the 3D ResNeXt-50  STL supervised model by 15.89% (85.03% vs. 69.14%) in WAR. Compared to the STL self-supervised model MAE-DFER , it improves performance by 7.65% (85.03% vs. 77.38%) in terms of WAR. Additionally, in the field of MTL, the MTCAE-DFER model outperforms the MTL-ER  supervised learning model by 9.41% (85.03% vs. 75.62%) WAR, while compared to the self-supervised learning model MTFormer [ref]17, it achieves WAR performance increase of 4.29% (85.03% vs. 80.74%). In TABLE IV, we compare the results of the current SOTA models on the MEAD . The results show that the MTCAE-DFER outperforms both the STL supervised model 3D ResNeXt-50  and the STL self-supervised model MAE-DFER , increasing the WAR results by 15.88% (88.44% vs. 72.56%) and 7.49% (88.44% vs. 80.95%), respectively. Moreover, compared with the MTL model results, the MTCAE-DFER model improves WAR by 10.08% (88.44% vs. 78.36%) over the MTL-ER  supervised model, and outperforms the MTFormer [ref]17 self-supervised model by 3.7% (88.44% vs. 84.74%) WAR.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: our proposed MTCAE-DFER model achieves performance by 9.50% (83.69% vs. 74.19%) WAR over the SOTA MTL supervised model MTL-ER .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
