      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Diffusion-based Image Translation using Asymmetric Gradient Guidance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage translation is a task that aims to convert an image from a source domain to a target domain while preserving the structural attributes of the source image. In the past, image translation methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN)  were mainly used, ranging from unimodal image-to-image translation (I2I)  [ref]3 [ref]4  to multimodal I2I models   . While these methods showed good performance, they had the disadvantage of being unable to perform image-to-image translation for arbitrary domains and conditions. Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve this problem.\nParticularly notable are the methods that manipulate the generation process of a pre-trained generative model by applying modifications to generate images with desired conditions. This approach has the advantage of using the superior generation performance of the pre-trained model while being able to generate the desired images. Specifically, previous methods mainly used pre-trained GAN models to enable image manipulation  . Recently, the use of large foundation models, especially text-to-image embedding models such as CLIP 0, has been introduced for image editing based on text conditions 1 2. However, these methods show limited performance due to the limitations of GAN models, such as limited domains and the cumbersome process of embedding real images into the latent space. With the development of diffusion models and the combination of text encoder models, text-to-image diffusion models 3 4 have been developed, and research on image translation and image editing using diffusion models has become more active 5 6. In particular, various methods have been proposed based on cross-attention with text conditions 7 8, allowing for image-to-image translation. However, the text-to-image model requires an inversion process that accurately embeds the source image to latent space, which consumes additional time for optimization.\nMoreover, they have difficulty applying to image translation cases where the source image is provided as condition. To address this,\na recent approach of DiffuseIT 9 uses gradient guidance during the generation process to preserve the structural attributes of the source image while disentangling and changing the target style.\nWhile these models have shown good performance, they still requires extensive use of slicing ViT network 0\nand its computationally expensive gradient computation. To address the limitations of existing methods, here we present a novel sampling approach using so-called\nAsymmetric Gradient Guidance (AGG), which amalgamates the strengths of various models.\nSpecifically, the gradient update by AGG is composed of two step:\na single MCG framework 1 to compute the initial update, which is followed by\ncomputationally efficient Decomposed Diffusion Sampling (DDS) update from the denoised signal by Tweedie’ fomula, which can\nbe efficiently computed by Adam optimizer.\nFurthermore, in contrast to DiffuseIT that relies on slicing ViT based structural preservation loss,\nwe use much simpler structural regularization term using the intermediate product stored during the forward DDIM step.\nCombined with simpler regularization loss and efficient gradient update, our\nmethod can provide much faster and effective image translation under text- and one-shot image conditions.\nMoreover, this integration provides a significant advantage as it enables our sampling approach to operate in both traditional image diffusion models and latent diffusion models 4. Our contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose Asymmetric Gradient Guidance method, which\nis composed of two step:\na single MCG framework 1 followed by\ncomputationally efficient Adam optimization from the denoised signal by Tweedie’ fomula. We introduce a simpler structural loss function which utilizes the intermediate products saved during the DDIM forward step, allowing for faster and efficient gradient\nguidance in both image diffusion models and latent diffusion models. Our method is so efficient and flexible that it can be integrated with arbitrary loss functions, making it suitable for a wide range of applications such as text-guided image translation, image-guided appearance transfer, artistic style transfer, image editing, etc.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: attributes of the source image.
