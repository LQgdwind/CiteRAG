Fast Outpainting-based Partial Autoregressive Sampling (FOPPAS). As illustrated in Figure 3, starting from the second clip, we can fix the initial frames to be the same as the last frames of the previous clip and then outpaint the remaining frames in this clip. This method conditions the current clip only on the part of the previous clip frames; therefore, we call it partial autoregressive sampling via outpainting. Unlike the RNN-based methods [ref]26 or train-time autoregressive diffusion models  , the number of overlapping frames of FOPPAS can be flexibly set and changeable anytime instead of being required and fixed once trained. Those methods [ref]26   also require an initial ”seed motion” to generate the first clip. However, it is not convenient for users to find such seed sequences or they just want to generate the first clip randomly. In contrast, we can generate the first clip with the overlapping number set as 0. In our experiment, we choose Repaint  to perform diffusion-based outpainting. Shorter Clip Sampling. When using Transformer without positional embedding, it becomes a point-wise set function. Therefore, the length of an ordered sequence that a Transformer can process in one pass only depends on the length of the positional embedding used during training. Thanks to this property of the Transformer, our framework can infer any clip that is shorter than the training clip, which is achieved by dropping the remaining positional embedding. This is particularly useful when inferring the last clip, as demonstrated in Figure 3. Towards Real-time Sampling.\nThe original DDPM has 1000 steps to generate a clip, which is very slow in practice. Moreover, the total denoising steps would be further increased due to the re-sampling operation in Repaint .\nTo enable real-time generation for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents, we adapt the Repaint  algorithm to DDIM  sampling. We use 25-step DDIM to replace the 1000-step DDPM, with a speedup of about 40 times during inference. Last-steps Refinement with Blending. Although applying outpainting already gets a very smooth transition between clips, we occasionally observe slight inconsistency at the boundary. To refine and facilitate the consistency at the clip boundary, we perform a linear blending at the overlapping part of clips at the last two sampling steps. For the details of our fast outpainting algorithm, please refer to Algorithm 1 in the Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Instead of conditioning the model on previous frames during training   [ref]26, we propose to realize the arbitrary long sampling via outpainting at the test time without training, which has more flexibility and less computation waste.
