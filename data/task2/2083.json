      "content": "Paper Title: NVC-Net: End-to-End Adversarial Voice Conversion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVoice conversion consists in changing the speech of a source speaker in such a way that it sounds like that of a target speaker while keeping the linguistic information unchanged  [ref]41. Typical applications of voice conversion include speaker conversions, dubbing in movies and videos, speaking aid systems [ref]35, and pronunciation conversion . Despite much success in this field, several issues remain to be addressed for voice conversion. Early voice conversion methods require parallel training data, which contain utterances of the same linguistic content spoken by different speakers. A drawback of these methods is their sensitivity to misalignment between the source and target utterances . Time alignment and manual correction are typically performed as a pre-processing step to make these methods work more reliably . Nevertheless, collecting parallel training data is still a time-consuming and can be even an infeasible task in many situations . This has motivated growing research interest in developing voice conversion methods on non-parallel training data by using generative adversarial networks (GANs)  and its variants. Although GAN-based methods provide a promising solution by learning a mapping through non-parallel training data    , designing such a method that yields a competitive performance compared to parallel methods still remains to be solved. Another common problem in voice conversion is modeling the raw audio waveform. A good model should capture the short and long-term temporal dependencies in audio signals, which is not trivial due to the high temporal resolution of speech (e.g., 16k samples per second). A simple solution is to reduce the temporal resolution into a lower-dimensional representation (e.g., acoustic features). In such a case, one needs a vocoder that reconstructs the waveform representation from acoustic features. Traditional vocoders like WORLD  or STRAIGHT  often introduce artifacts (metallic sounds). To overcome this issue, more sophisticated neural vocoders such as autoregressive   and non-autoregressive   [ref]51 models have been proposed. Autoregressive models such as WaveNet  and WaveRNN  are slow at inference, therefore, they are not well suited for real-world applications. Although non-autoregressive models like WaveGlow  yield faster inference, the waveform reconstruction still dominates the computational effort as well as the memory requirements. Lightweight vocoders like MelGAN  or Parallel WaveGAN [ref]51 can alleviate the memory issue, however, the feature mismatch problem between the training and inference remains unsolved. Indeed, as observed by Wu et al. , the feature mismatch problem may cause the vocoder to produce noisy or collapsed speech in the output, especially when training data are limited. While many research efforts have focused on converting audio among speakers seen during training, little attention has been paid to the problem of converting audio from and to speakers unseen during training (i.e., zero-shot voice conversion). Qian et al.  proposed to use a pre-trained speaker encoder on a large data set with many speakers. With carefully designed bottleneck layers, the content information can be disentangled from the speaker information, allowing it to perform zero-shot voice conversion. However, under the context of limited data and computational resources, the speaker encoder cannot generalize well on unseen speakers since the speaker embeddings tend to be scattered. In this paper, we tackle the problem of voice conversion from raw audio waveform using adversarial training in an end-to-end manner. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. We introduce NVC-Net, a many-to-many voice conversion method trained adversarially, which does not require parallel data. Our method aims to disentangle the speaker identity from the speech content. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GAN-based method that explicitly performs disentanglement for voice conversion directly on the raw audio waveform. Unlike other GAN-based voice conversion methods, NVC-Net can directly generate raw audio without training an additional vocoder. Thus, the feature mismatch problem when using an independent vocoder can be avoided. The absence of a vocoder also allows NVC-Net to be very efficient at inference time. It is capable of generating audio at a rate of more than 3600 kHz on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. NVC-Net addresses the zero-shot voice conversion problem by constraining the speaker representation. We apply the Kullback-Leibler regularization on the speaker latent space, making the speaker representation robust to small variations of input. This also allows stochastic sampling at generation. During inference, one can randomly sample a speaker embedding from this space to generate diverse outputs or extract the speaker embedding from a given reference utterance.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Voice conversion consists in changing the speech of a source speaker in such a way that it sounds like that of a target speaker while keeping the linguistic information unchanged  [ref]41.
