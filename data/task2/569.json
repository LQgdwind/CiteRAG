Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Our particular focus on data science research and innovation concerns the type of scenario we call an extreme data challenge in data science and analytics. The extreme data challenge as illustrated in Fig. 1, seeks to discover and deliver complex knowledge in complex data taking into account complex behavior within a complex environment to achieve actionable insights that will inform and enable decision action-taking in complex business problems that cannot be better handled by other methods. The critical future directions of data science research and innovation in this case are focused on Complex data with complex characteristics and various complexities (as discussed above on data complexity and intelligence; for more, see  and [ref]8), Complex behaviors with complex relationships and dynamics (as discussed above on behavior complexity and intelligence; for more, see  and [ref]8), Complex environment in which complex data and behaviors are embedded and interacted with (as discussed above on domain-specific, organizational, social and environmental complexities and intelligence; for more, see  and [ref]8), Complex models to address the data and behavior complexities in complex environment (as discussed about learning complexities and decision complexities), Complex findings to uncover hidden but technically interesting and business-friendly observations, indicators or evidence, statements or presentations, and Actionable insights to evidence the next best or worst situation and inform the optimal strategies that should be taken to support effective business decision-making (see more discussion on actionability in  . Many real-life problems fall into this level of complexities and challenges, as shown in the extreme data challenge, and they have not been addressed well; for example, Understanding group behaviors by multiple actors where there are complex interactions and relationships, such as in the manipulation of large-scale cross-capital markets pool by internationally collaborative investors , each of whom plays a specific role by connecting information from the underlying markets, social media, other financial markets, socio-economic data and policies ; Predicting local climate change and effect by connecting local, regional and global climate data, geographical data, agricultural data and other information .\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: research and innovation in this case are focused on Complex data with complex characteristics and various complexities (as discussed above on data complexity and intelligence; for more, see  and [ref]8), Complex behaviors with complex relationships and dynamics (as discussed above on behavior complexity and intelligence; for more, see  and [ref]8), Complex environment in which complex data\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
