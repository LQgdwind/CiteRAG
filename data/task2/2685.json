      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Framework for Biphasic Facial Age Translation with Noisy-Semantic Guided Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBiphasic facial age translation, also known as face progression and regression, aims at rendering age-changing effects on the input face image at any age (or age group).\nHigh-fidelity face age generation can arouse people’s good memories of their youth and beautiful expectations for the future.\nDue to the broad applications of facial age translation in various domains such as cross-age face recognition and digital entertainment, a great number of studies have been put forward in the last two decades -.\nHowever, due to the lack of paired age datasets and the intrinsic complexity of age translation task (involving changes in both shape and appearance of different facial components), age progression and regression is still a challenging problem.\nMeanwhile, limited by the learning abilities and computing costs of the current algorithms, age translation tasks are mostly implemented through single-direction generation between single age pair (or age group pair) [ref]4-, which will bring huge complexity to the training of the model among all ages (or age groups).\nTherefore, a Unified High-fidelity Biphasic age translation method is indispensable.\nThe illustration of biphasic face progression and regression is shown in Fig. 1. The study of age progression and regression could be dated back to the 1980s, where researches mainly relied on model-based methods to simulate the profile growth of human faces.\nTodd et al.  have modeled the change of facial appearance about time by a variant of cardioidal-strain transformation.\nLanitis et al.  and Wang et al.  have proposed structural strategies to study the problem from other biological aspects such as muscles and the structure of facial components.\nHowever, these methods are computationally expensive and difficult to generalize high-fidelity faces, since detailed empirical aging rules are used to build the models. With the increasing amount of available face age data, prototype-based methods have been developed.\nAs one of the pioneering works, Burt et al.  have divided the face images into several groups according to age annotations.\nThen, the average face (i.e., prototype) has been computed for each age group.\nThe mappings between prototypes are considered as age transformations for corresponding age groups.\nBased on this scheme, more approaches have been proposed to improve the quality of generated face images 0-3 with various prior knowledge.\nHowever, computing average faces would blur the image content heavily and thus could damage both the texture related to age changes and the personalized identity information. Inspired by the remarkable development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 4, most recent works have resorted to conditional GAN-based methods to solve the problem of age progression and regression.\nSignificant improvements have been achieved in the realism of generation results , [ref]4-[ref]5, 5-7.\nZhang et al.  have proposed a manifold learning approach to model the identity and age changes simultaneously.\nYang et al. [ref]4 have employed a pre-trained age estimation network in discriminator to enhance age-related features.\nTang et al. 5 and Liu et al. [ref]5 have introduced identity consistency supervisions and wavelet-domain constraint for improving fidelity respectively.\nHowever, these methods model age changes as mappings between images of holistic faces and propose various global constraints to regulate the training process.\nThey lost the control of the details in different semantic components, since the aging patterns for different facial components have little in common in terms of both geometry and appearance.\nTherefore, Li et al. 6 have proposed a patch-based method. Liu et al.7 has introduced the spatial attention mechanism to restrict manipulations on age-related regions.\nAlthough some effects have been improved, their results still show blurred areas and artifacts. To tackle the above-mentioned issues, we propose a unified framework for biphasic facial age translation with noisy-semantic guided generative adversarial networks.\nDifferent from existing methods which focus on global image generation, we project the class-aware noisy semantic layouts to a group of “soft” latent maps and then inject these maps into the generator to guide detailed age translation on the individual facial parts.\nSpecifically speaking, we introduce two sub-networks to explore low-level structural information and high-level features, which are ProjectionNet and ConstraintNet.\nProjectionNet combines the low-level structural semantic layouts with the “soft” age condition and projects them to “soft” latent maps.\nConstraintNet disentangles the high-level spatial features to constrain the “soft” latent maps, which endows more age-related context into the “soft” latent maps.\nWe employ the attention mechanism in the ConstraintNet for feature disentanglement.\nFor further promoting the training procedure, we also embed two types of learning strategies, supervised self-driven generation and unsupervised condition-driven cycle-consistent generation. The main contributions are summarized as follows: A unified framework is proposed for biphasic facial age translation with noisy-semantic guided generative adversarial networks.\nNoisy-Semantic layouts are injected into the generator as the guidance of age transformation. Two sub-networks, ProjectionNet and ConstraintNet are proposed to introduce low-level structural semantic information and high-level spatial features for fine-grained high-fidelity age translation before latent map injection.\nAttention mechanism is used in ConstraintNet for feature disentanglement.\n Two types of learning strategies are jointly employed to promote the training procedure, supervised self-driven generation and unsupervised condition-driven cycle-consistent generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on MORPH and CACD datasets.\nBoth qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method which achieves state-of-the-art performance. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:\nSection II presents a brief description of the related works.\nSection III introduces our proposed network architecture in detail.\nSection IV introduces the face datasets, evaluation metrics used in this paper and describes the implementation details.\nMeanwhile, the experimental results and ablation analysis are reported.\nFinally, in Section V, we conclude this work and further give some detailed discussions about age synthesis.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: by the learning abilities and computing costs of the current algorithms, age translation tasks are mostly implemented through single-direction generation between single age pair (or age group pair) [ref]4-, which will bring huge complexity to the training of the model among all ages (or age groups).\nTherefore, a Unified High-fidelity Biphasic age translation method is indispensable.\nThe\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
