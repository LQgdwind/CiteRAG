      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Model-Based Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWorld models were first introduced in the titular paper [ref]18. Built on the recurrent state space model (RSSM) [ref]20, world models are trained to learn a compact latent representation of the environment state and dynamics. Once the dynamics are learnt the world model can be used to ‘imagine’ possible future trajectories. We leverage DreamerV3  as our stand-in dynamics model for look-ahead shielding and policy optimisation. DreamerV3 consists of the following components: (1) the image encoder zt∼qθ​(zt∣ot,ht)similar-tosubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑞𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑜𝑡subscriptℎ𝑡z_{t}\\sim q_{\\theta}(z_{t}\\mid o_{t},h_{t}) that learns a posterior latent representation given the observation otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t} and recurrent state htsubscriptℎ𝑡h_{t}. (2) The recurrent model ht=fθ​(ht−1,zt−1,at−1)subscriptℎ𝑡subscript𝑓𝜃subscriptℎ𝑡1subscript𝑧𝑡1subscript𝑎𝑡1h_{t}=f_{\\theta}(h_{t-1},z_{t-1},a_{t-1}), which computes the next deterministic latents given the past state st−1=(ht−1,zt−1)subscript𝑠𝑡1subscriptℎ𝑡1subscript𝑧𝑡1s_{t-1}=(h_{t-1},z_{t-1}) and action at−1subscript𝑎𝑡1a_{t-1}. (3) The transition predictor z^t∼pθ​(z^t∣ht)similar-tosubscript^𝑧𝑡subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript^𝑧𝑡subscriptℎ𝑡\\hat{z}_{t}\\sim p_{\\theta}(\\hat{z}_{t}\\mid h_{t}), which is used as the prior distribution over the stochastic latents (without otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t}). (4) The image decoder o^t∼pθ​(o^t∣ht,zt)similar-tosubscript^𝑜𝑡subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript^𝑜𝑡subscriptℎ𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡\\hat{o}_{t}\\sim p_{\\theta}(\\hat{o}_{t}\\mid h_{t},z_{t}) which is used to provide high quality image gradients by minimising reconstruction loss. (5) The prediction heads r^t∼pθ​(r^t∣ht,zt)similar-tosubscript^𝑟𝑡subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript^𝑟𝑡subscriptℎ𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡\\hat{r}_{t}\\sim p_{\\theta}(\\hat{r}_{t}\\mid h_{t},z_{t}) and γ^t∼pθ​(γ^t∣ht,zt)similar-tosubscript^𝛾𝑡subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript^𝛾𝑡subscriptℎ𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡\\hat{\\gamma}_{t}\\sim p_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{t}\\mid h_{t},z_{t}) trained to predict reward signals and episode termination respectively. In DreamerV3 the latents represent categorical variables and the reward and image prediction heads both parameterise a twohot symlog distributions . All components are implemented as neural networks and optimised with straight through gradients. In addition, KL-balancing  and free-bits [ref]19 are used to regularise the prior and posterior representations and prevent a degenerate latent space representation. Policy optimisation is performed entirely on experience ‘imagined’ in the latent space of the world model. We refer to πtasksuperscript𝜋task\\pi^{\\text{task}} as the task policy trained in the world model to maximise expected discounted accumulated reward, that is, optimise the following, In addition to the task policy πtasksuperscript𝜋task\\pi^{\\text{task}}, a task critic denoted vtasksuperscript𝑣taskv^{\\text{task}}, is used to construct TD-λ𝜆\\lambda targets  which are used to help guide the task policy πtasksuperscript𝜋task\\pi^{\\text{task}} in a TD-λ𝜆\\lambda actor-critic style algorithm. We refer the reader to  for more precise details.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: World models were first introduced in the titular paper [ref]18.
