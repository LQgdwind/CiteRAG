      "content": "Paper Title: Syntax-Aware On-the-Fly Code Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCode completion is a task to suggest the next code token from a given context. More formally, given a sequence of mùëöm tokens x1‚Äã‚Ä¶‚Äãxmsubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëöx_{1}...x_{m} as a context, code completion aims to predict the next nùëõn tokens to complete a sentence x1‚Äã‚Ä¶‚Äãxm+nsubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëöùëõx_{1}...x_{m+n}.\nThe learning objective of a language model for code completion is to minimize a conditional probability distribution of the following function: Statistical language models. Previously, several studies proposed code completion approaches using various types of techniques (e.g., heuristic, statistical, and deep learning).\nHeuristic-based approaches aim to recommend source code based on rules¬†, program history¬†, and code examples¬†.\nHowever, heuristic-based approaches are heavily based on rules and patterns that researchers need to develop, which is time-consuming and expensive.\nTherefore, statistical language models have been proposed to automatically learn the naturalness of source code based on a probabilistic of the occurrence of source code.\nFor example, Hindle¬†et al.¬† [ref]19 argued that source code is natural and repetitive (similar to natural language) and found that an n-gram approach can accurately predict the next code token based on a given context.\nRaychev¬†et al.¬† proposed TGEN, a probabilistic-based learning approach with decision tree structures.\nHowever, the statistical language models are able to learn only the limited number of nùëõn consecutive tokens (according to the nùëõn-gram algorithm), which does not reflect the nature of the source code that is usually long (i.e., long-term dependencies). LSTM-based language models. To address the limitation of the statistical language models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning approaches are applied to the code completion task.\nHowever, existing LSTM-based language models can only learn the semantic information of the source code, without considering its syntactic structure.\nThus, to ensure that the LSTM-based code completion models recognize the syntactic information, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is widely used by the previous work.\nFor example, Li¬†et al.¬†[ref]9 proposed Pointer Mixture Networks, which is an LSTM-based architecture for predicting the AST node.\nSimilarly, Svyatkovskiy¬†et al.¬†[ref]10 proposed Pythia, which is an LSTM-based approach that incorporates ASTs information through the Word2Vec embedding approach.\nWhile such RNN-based and LSTM-based are able to handle longer sequences of source code than statistical language models, the approach remain inaccurate due to the sequential nature of source code processing, the limited ability to capture long-term dependencies, and the limited ability to recognize the importance of different code tokens. Transformer-based language models.\nTo address the limitations of LSTM-based language models, the Transformer architecture is introduced for the code completion task.\nGenerally, the development of Transformer-based language models consists of two steps: pre-training and fine-tuning.\nPre-training is a process to train a Transformer-based language model in a self-supervised manner (i.e., without labels), allowing the language models to self-understand given data by itself (i.e., natural language or programming languages).\nNormally, the language models for code completion are trained using a Causal Language Model (CLM) (i.e., predicting the unknown token after a sequence of known tokens).\nOnce a language model is pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned on a specific dataset (e.g., PY150¬†) with the same learning objective as the pre-training process (i.e., CLM).\nFor example, Lu¬†et al.¬† proposed CodeGPT-based models, which is based on a GPT-2 architecture¬† that is pre-trained on both Natural Language (NL) corpus (i.e., WebText) and/or Programming Language (PL) corpus (i.e., CodeSearchNet)‚Äîi.e., PL only for CodeGPT, and NL+PL for CodeGPT-adapt. To ensure that the Transformer-based language models recognize the syntactic structure of source code, Kim¬†et al.¬†proposed TravTrans¬†, a vanilla Transformer-based language model that incorporates ASTs information through different encoding styles.\nSimilarly, Wang¬†et al.¬† leverages AST information with a vanilla Transformer-based language model, but using a different AST encoding technique (i.e., by flattening the ASTs nodes).\nHowever, these AST-based code completion approaches\nalso leverage AST information at the inference phase, which requires source code to be completed at the inference time so the AST information can be parsed and obtained from the source code.\nTherefore, in practice, source code is often incomplete and not compilable (e.g., syntax errors), making the existing AST-based code completion approaches not applicable in real-world scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: statistical language models have been proposed to automatically learn the naturalness of source code based on a probabilistic of the occurrence of source code.\nFor example, Hindle¬†et al.¬† [ref]19 argued that source code is natural and repetitive (similar to natural language) and found that an n-gram approach can accurately predict the next code token based on a given\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
