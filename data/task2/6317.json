      "content": "Paper Title: Automating Model Comparison in Factor Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section discusses related work and aims at providing a clear positioning of this paper for our contributions that follow in the upcoming sections. The task of model comparison is widely represented in the literature , for example concerning hypothesis testing  .\nBayesian model averaging  can be interpreted as the simplest form of model comparison that uses the Bayesian formalism to retain the first level of uncertainty in the model selection process .\nBayesian model averaging has proven to be an effective and principled approach that converges with infinite data to the single best model in the set of candidate models   .\nWhen the true underlying model is not part of this set, the data is often better represented by ad hoc methods 4, such as ensemble methods.\nIn  the idea of Bayesian model comparison is introduced, which basically performs Bayesian model averaging between mixture models comprising the candidate models, with different weights.\nAnother ensemble method is proposed in   which uses (hierarchical) stacking  to construct predictive densities whose weights are data-dependent. Automating the model design cycle  under the Bayesian formalism has been the goal of many probabilistic programming languages  [ref]10     .\nThis paper focuses on message passing-based approaches, which leverage the conditional independencies in the model structure for performing probabilistic inference, e.g. 7 8 9 , which will be formally introduced in Section 3.2.\nContrary to alternative sampling-based approaches, message passing excels in modularity, speed and efficiency, especially when models submit to closed-form (variational) message computations.\nThroughout this paper we follow the spirit of , which showed that many probabilistic inference algorithms, such as (loopy) belief propagation  , variational message passing  , expectation-maximization , expectation propagation  can all be phrased as a constrained Bethe free energy  minimization procedure.\nSpecifically, in Section 5 we aim to phrase different Bayesian model comparison methods as automatable message passing algorithms.\nNot only has this the potential to shorten the design cycle, but also to develop novel model comparison schemes. The connection between (automatable) state and parameter inference, versus model comparison has been explored recently by  , who frame the problem of model comparison as a \"mixture model estimation\" task that is obtained by combining the individual models into a mixture model with weights representing the model selection variable.\nThe exposition in   is based on relatively simple examples that do not easily generalize to more complex models for the model selection variable and for the individual cluster components.\nIn the current paper, we aim to generalize the mixture model estimation approach by an automatable message passing-based inference framework.\nSpecifically, we build on the results of the recently developed scale factors [38, Ch. 6], , which we will introduce in Section 3.3.\nThese scale factors support efficient tracking of local summaries of model evidences, thus enabling model comparison in generic mixture models, see Sections 4 and 5. The approach we present in the current paper is also similar to the concept of ‘gates’, introduced in .\nGates are factor nodes that switch between mixture components with which we can derive automatable message passing procedures.\nMathematically, a gate represents a factor node of the form f​(s,m)=∏k=1Kfk​(sk)mk𝑓𝑠𝑚superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑘1𝐾subscript𝑓𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑘subscript𝑚𝑘f(s,m)=\\prod_{k=1}^{K}f_{k}(s_{k})^{m_{k}}, where the model selection variable m𝑚m is a one-of-K𝐾K coded vector defined as mk∈{0,1}subscript𝑚𝑘01m_{k}\\in\\{0,1\\} subject to ∑k=1Kmk=1superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝐾subscript𝑚𝑘1\\sum_{k=1}^{K}m_{k}=1.\nThe variables s=⋃k=1Ksk𝑠superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝐾subscript𝑠𝑘s=\\bigcup_{k=1}^{K}s_{k}.\nDespite the universality of the Gates approach, the inference procedures in  focus on variational inference    and expectation propagation .\nThe mixture selection variable m𝑚m is then updated based on “evidence-like quantities”.\nIn the variational message passing case, these quantities resemble local Bethe free energy contributions, which only take into account the performance around the gate factor node, disregarding the performance contributions of other parts in the model.\nBecause of the local contributions, the message passing algorithm can be very sensitive to its initialization, which has the potential to yield suboptimal inference results. In the current paper we extend gates to models submitting to exact inference using scale factors, which allows for generalizing and automating the mixture models of  .\nWith these advances we can automate well-known Bayesian model comparison methods using message passing, enabling the development of novel comparison methods.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: to construct predictive densities whose weights are data-dependent.
