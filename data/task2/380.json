      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning with Feedback Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere have been many empirical successes of reinforcement learning (RL) in tasks where an abundance of samples is available  [ref]39.\nHowever, for many real-world applications the sample complexity of RL is still prohibitively high. It is therefore crucial to simplify the learning task by leveraging domain knowledge in these applications.\nA common approach is imitation learning where demonstrations from domain experts can greatly reduce the number of samples required to learn a good policy¬†. Unfortunately, in many challenging tasks such as drug discovery or tutoring system optimization, even experts may not know how to perform the task well. They can nonetheless give insights into the structure of the task, e.g., that certain actions yield similar behavior in certain states. These insights could in principle be baked into a function class for the model or value-function, but this is often non-trivial for experts and RL with complex function classes is still very challenging, both in theory and practice  [ref]14 [ref]17 . A simpler, often more convenient approach to incorporating structure from domain knowledge is to provide additional observations to the algorithm. In supervised learning, this is referred to as data augmentation and best practice in areas like computer vision with tremendous performance gains  . Recent empirical work    suggests that data augmentation is similarly beneficial in RL. However, to the best of our knowledge, little is theoretically known about the question: How do side observations in the form of transition samples (e.g. through data augmentation) affect the sample-complexity of online RL? In this paper, we take a first step toward answering this question and study RL in finite episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) where, at each step, the agent receives some side information from an online data augmentation oracle, in addition to the reward and next state information (rh,sh+1)subscriptùëü‚Ñésubscriptùë†‚Ñé1(r_{h},s_{h+1}) directly supplied by the environment (Figure¬†1). This side information is a collection of observations, pairs of reward and next state, for some state-action pairs other than the one taken by the agent in that round. What can be observed is specified by a feedback graph  over state-action pairs: an edge in the feedback graph from state-action pair (s,a)ùë†ùëé(s,a) to state-action pair (s¬Ø,a¬Ø)¬Øùë†¬Øùëé(\\bar{s},\\bar{a}) indicates that, when the agent takes action aùëéa at state sùë†s, the oracle also provides the reward and next-state sample (r‚Ä≤,s‚Ä≤)superscriptùëü‚Ä≤superscriptùë†‚Ä≤(r^{\\prime},s^{\\prime}) that it would have seen if it would have instead taken the action a¬Ø¬Øùëé\\bar{a} at state s¬Ø¬Øùë†\\bar{s}. Specifically, at each time step, the agents not only gets to see the outcome of executing the current (s, a), but also an outcome of executing all the corresponding state-action pairs that have an edge from (s, a) in the feedback graph. To illustrate this setting, consider a robot moving in a grid world. Through auxiliary sensors, it can sense positions in its line of sight. When the robot takes an action to move in a certain direction, it can also predict what would have happened for the same action in other positions in the line of sight. The oracle formalizes this ability and provides the RL algorithm with transition observations of (hypothetical) movements in the same direction from nearby states.\nHere, the feedback graph connects state-action pairs with matching states and actions in the line of sight (Figure¬†2). For another illustrative example where feedback graphs occur naturally, consider a robot arm grasping different objects and putting them in bins. In this task, the specific shape of the object is relevant only when the robot hand is close to the object or has grasped it. In all other states, the actual shape is not significant and thus, the oracle can provide additional observations to the learning algorithm by substituting different object shapes in the state description of current transition. In this case, all such state-action pairs that are identical up to the object shape are connected in the feedback graph. This additional information can be easily modeled using a feedback graph but is much harder to incorporate in models such as factored MDPs  or linear MDPs .\nRL with feedback graphs also generalizes previously studied RL settings, such as learning with aggregated state representations¬† and certain optimal stopping domains¬†. Furthermore, it can also be used to analyze RL with auxiliary tasks (see Section¬†5). In this paper, we present an extensive study of RL with MDPs in the presence of side observations through feedback graphs. We prove in Section¬†4 that optimistic algorithms such as Euler or ORLC   augmented with the side\nobservations\nachieve significantly more favorable regret guarantees: the dominant terms of the bounds only depend on the mas-number111mas-number of a graph is defined as the size of its largest acyclic subgraph. MùëÄM of the feedback graph as opposed to an explicit dependence on SùëÜS and Aùê¥A, the number of states and actions of the MDP, which can be substantially larger than MùëÄM in many cases (See Table¬†1 for a summary of our results). We further give lower bounds which show that our regret bounds are in fact minimax-optimal, up to lower-order terms, in the case of symmetric feedback graphs (see Section¬†7). While learning with feedback graphs has been widely studied in the multi-armed bandit setting [e.g. 33, 1, 9, 10, 2], the corresponding in the MDP setting is qualitatively different as the agent cannot readily access all vertices in the feedback graph (see section¬†6). A vertex (s,a)ùë†ùëé(s,a) of the feedback graph may be very informative but the agent does not know how to reach state sùë†s yet. To formalize this, we prove through a statistical lower bound that leveraging a small dominating set222Dominating set of a graph (D) is defined as a subset of the vertices of a graph such that every vertex is either belongs to D or has an edge from a vertex in D. In our problem setting, the dominating set reveals information about the entire MDP. to improve over the sample complexity of RL is fundamentally harder in MDPs than in multi-armed bandits.\nFinally, we propose a simple algorithm to addresses the additional challenges of leveraging a small dominating set in MDPs when learning an œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-optimal policy and prove that its sample complexity scales with the size of the dominating set in the main 1/œµ21superscriptitalic-œµ21/\\epsilon^{2}- term only.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: There have been many empirical successes of reinforcement learning (RL) in tasks where an abundance of samples is available  [ref]39.\nHowever, for many real-world applications the sample complexity of RL is still prohibitively high.
