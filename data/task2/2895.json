      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Skills for Efficient Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe success of macro-operators and abstraction in classic planning systems   has inspired a large body of works on hierarchical approaches to reinforcement learning     3 9.\nWhile the decomposition of control across multiple levels of abstraction provides intuitive benefits such as easier individual learning problems and long-term decision making, recent work found that a primary benefit of HRL, in particular for modern, neural-network based learning systems, stems from improved exploration capabilities  5.\nFrom a design perspective, HRL allows for separate acquisition of low-level policies (options; skills), which can dramatically accelerate learning on downstream tasks.\nA variety of works propose the discovery of such low-level primitives from random walks  ,\nmutual information objectives   [ref]43 , datasets of agent or expert traces 7 [ref]2 , motion capture data 6 1 , or from dedicated pre-training tasks  . In order to live up to their full potential, low-level skills must be useful across a large variety of downstream tasks.\nIn practice, however, a trade-off between generality (wide applicability) and specificity (benefits for specific tasks) arises.\nA large portion of prior work on option discovery and HRL resolved this trade-off, explicitly or implicitly, in favor of specificity.\nThis can be exemplified by the choice of test environments, which traditionally revolve around navigation in grid-world mazes   .\nIn recent work on simulated robotics, navigation problems that are similar in spirit remain the benchmarks of choice  3   [ref]2.\nIn these settings, directed locomotion, i.e., translation of the robot’s center of mass, is the main required motor skill, and the resulting algorithms require a corresponding prior.\nThis prior is made explicit with skills partitioning the state space according the agent’s position  [ref]43, or is implicitly realized by high contribution of position features to reward signals 3 4 [ref]2 (Appendix G).\nSimilarly, works that target non-navigation environments acquire skills with tailored pre-training tasks 8 or in-domain motion capture data 6 1 2.\nIn contrast, our work is concerned with learning low-level skills without extra supervision from traces or pre-training task design, and which do not prescribe a fixed trade-off towards a particular type of behavior.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: skills), which can dramatically accelerate learning on downstream tasks.\nA variety of works propose the discovery of such low-level primitives from random walks  ,\nmutual information objectives   [ref]43 , datasets of agent or expert traces 7 [ref]2 , motion capture data 6 1 , or from dedicated pre-training tasks  . In order to live up to their full potential, low-level skills must be useful\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
