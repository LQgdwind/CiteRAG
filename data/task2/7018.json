      "content": "Paper Title: Heterogeneous Generative Knowledge Distillation with Masked Image Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-supervised learning is a method of learning labels derived from data. Visual self-supervised work has achieved comparable or even better results than pretraining on downstream tasks such as supervised/semi-supervised classification and object detection. The initial application of self-supervised learning was to learn data representations through a pretext task, including rotation prediction [ref]9, an exemplar-based method [ref]30, and a jigsaw . Recently, contrastive learning    has become popular, such as methods that model the correlation  (or uncorrelated) and dependency between two or more images. Contrastive learning methods are mainly based on data augmentation. Compared to contrastive methods that rely on training strategies, generative methods only rely on unlabeled data. Mask image modeling learns knowledge from images corrupted by masking. The DAE  is a pioneering MIM method that uses masking as a type of noise. The Context Encoder  uses a convolutional neural network to complete missing areas. Inspired by NLP, transformer-based methods   have become popular, such as iGPT , ViT , which studies masked patch prediction, and BEiT , which predicts discrete tokens. The MAE  paper studies masking ratio and visible patches, while CAE  focuses on learning capability. Unlike exploring Transformers, SparK 2 explores the potential of CNN in MIM methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is first introduced in the work of Hinton et al. . Initial research focused on using the softmax output of the teacher network as additional supervision to train the student network. However, the output of high-capacity networks was found to have little difference from the ground-truth labels. Additionally, the softmax output contains less information than the representation from the second-to-last layer due to the classifier layer. Such highly abstract latent knowledge from the last layer loses much encoding information in the hidden layers. Thus, the distillation of features has gained increasing attention, such as attention maps 7, activation boundaries , Gram matrix , and information from multiple intermediate layers 9. Some studies also focus on feature transfer in intermediate layers 9, such as pairwise relationships 3 and the distillation of knowledge between layers . A reasonable explanation of the success of feature-based transferring intuitively lies in that the learning process of intermediate layers represents the inference direction and inductive bias of the final result. Recent research has focused more on adjusting training strategies (such as data augmentation 7, label smoothing 1), multi-teachers 5 8 5, and extracting information from different layers 6 6). DIST 7 uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to narrow the gap between teacher and student. Self-Supervised Distillation methods mainly generate auxiliary labels through image transformations, such as rotation 6, and coloring 7. Inspired by contrastive learning, recent work (such as SSKD 0) explore cross-sample contrast relations through image rotation and augmentation. HSAKD 2 learns augmented data distributions between different layers through an auxiliary classifier. CompRess 9 and SEED 4 explore the importance of developing better self-supervised distillation for small models. However, the success of contrastive learning often relies on dataset-specific data augmentation strategies and carefully designed additional training strategies. These strategies are difficult to apply to general tasks. In contrast, generative learning aims to reconstruct the features and information of the sample itself, avoiding dependence on strategies. This paper proposes masked generative modeling with distillation to extract more rich image knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: classification and object detection.
