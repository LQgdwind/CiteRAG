      "content": "Paper Title: How Far Can I Go ? : A Self-Supervised Approach for Deterministic Video Depth Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompetitors: For comparative comparison, we consider a multi-scale instance segmentation model [ref]42, a unsupervised depth estimation model [ref]14 and the latest depth forecasting approaches [ref]17 . Because [ref]14 is not designed for forecasting task, we add a basic F2F before the decoder of the depth network. Since KITTI does not have vehicle control data, we cannot train [ref]17 on KITTI, instead we compare another similar approach  for both short and mid-term forecast. Following  [ref]17, we report the accuracy of oracle as a upper bound and we use a trivial copy baseline as a lower bound. Results: The short-term forecast results are compared in Tab 1. Refer to appendix for mid-term forecast results. It is evident that our method outperforms unsupervised approaches alongside performing competitively with existing supervised approaches for both the forecasts. This suggests the superiority of our forecasting model design over existing approaches.\nAs illustrated in fig 4., in short-term forecast on KITTI our method gains by ∼1−5%similar-toabsent1percent5\\sim 1-5\\% in Abs Rel over a supervised methods  [ref]17 which is a significant contribution while beating strongly customised unsupervised baseline by ∼5−8%similar-toabsent5percent8\\sim 5-8\\%.\nFor mid-term forecasts, [ref]17 [ref]14 performs competitively as they use convLSTMs however being second-best to ours in most of the metrics. Our method performs better in mid-term forecast probably due to the PCAB block and multi-scale features. Interestingly, the variant of Ours without PCAB and Automask (last row of Tab 1) performs worse than adapted baseline of [ref]14. This indicates that vanilla PoseCNN along with cGRU cannot boost the performance alone. In cityscapes, we similarly observe that our method still gains over other approaches by ∼8%similar-toabsentpercent8\\sim 8\\% while [ref]42 performs the worst among all. This is because of the challenging scenes in the dataset and inability to handle occlusion. On the other hand, [ref]17 performs better than  [ref]14 suggesting that probabilistic modeling of harder scenes is a solution. Our variant without the flow forecast shows a sharp decrease (∼8%/11%similar-toabsentpercent8percent11\\sim 8\\%/11\\%) in performance for short/mid-term forecasts suggesting that 2D motion is useful in refining the depth in occluded scenes particularly in mid-term forecast.
