      "content": "Paper Title: DiffSketcher: Text Guided Vector Sketch Synthesis through Latent Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSketch Synthesis. Free-hand drawings convey abstract concepts through human visual perception with minimal abstraction. Unlike purely edge-map extraction methods , free-hand sketching aims to present sketches that are abstract in terms of structure  and semantic interpretation5. Therefore, computational sketching methods that aim to mimic human drawing consider a wide range of sketch representations, ranging from those grounded in the edge map of the input image      to those that are more abstract    [ref]7 6 5, which are normally in vector format. Among the works synthesizing vector sketches, CLIPasso 5 and CLIPascene 4 are conditioned on an input image, while the rest are unconditional. Until now, no prior work has explored synthesizing a sketch based on text. Vector Graphics. Our work builds upon the differentiable renderer for vector graphics introduced by Li et al 6. While image generation methods that operate over vector images traditionally require a vector-based dataset, recent work has shown how the differentiable renderer can be used to bypass this limitation 6 4 1 9 9. Furthermore, recent advances in visual text embedding contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP)7 have enabled a number of successful methods for synthesizing sketches, such as CLIPDraw [ref]7, StyleCLIPDraw 2, CLIP-CLOP 1, and CliPascene 4. A very recent work VectorFusion 3 combine differentiable renderer with diffusion model for vector graphics generation, e.g., iconography and pixel art. Our proposed algorithm, DiffSketcher, shares a similar idea with VectorFusion, but our focus is generating object- and scene-level sketches from a natural language prompt. Diffusion Models. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) 7 9 1 0, particularly those conditioned on text, have shown promising results in text-to-image synthesis. For example, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) 2 has improved sample quality and has been widely used in large-scale diffusion model frameworks, including GLIDE 3, Stable Diffusion 0, DALL·E 2 8, and Imagen 1. However, the majority of images available in web-scale datasets are rasterized, and this work follows the framework of synthesis through optimization, in which images are generated through evaluation-time optimization against a given metric. Our proposed algorithm, DiffSketcher, uses a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to synthesize free-hand sketches from natural language input. This is achieved by transferring image synthesis prior information into a differentiable renderer.xc\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: methods that aim to mimic human drawing consider a wide range of sketch representations, ranging from those grounded in the edge map of the input image      to those that are more abstract    [ref]7 6 5, which are normally in vector format.
