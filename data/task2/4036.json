      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-scale Wasserstein Shortest-path Graph Kernels for Graph Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRandom walk graph kernels  [ref]3 decompose graphs into their substructures random walks and compute the number of matching random walks from two graphs, which can be transformed to perform random walks on the direct product graph of two input graphs. Gärtner et al.  introduce the concept of direct product graph and derive two closed-form random walk graph kernels, which are called the geometric kernel and the exponential kernel, respectively. The former kernel is based on the personalized PageRank diffusion 3 while the latter kernel is based on the heat kernel diffusion 4. RetGK  proposes a random walk graph kernel that is applicable on both attributed and non-attributed graphs. Each graph is represented by a multi-dimensional tensor that is composed of the return probability vectors of random walks starting and ending with the same nodes and other discrete or continuous attributes of nodes. The multi-dimensional tensor is embedded into the Hilbert space by maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) 5 and the random walk graph kernels are computed. Borgwardt et al.  propose the shortest-path graph kernel (SP) that decomposes graphs into shortest paths between each pair of nodes in graphs. SP counts the number of pairs of matching shortest paths that have the same source and sink node labels and the same length in two graphs. The graphlet kernel (GK)  decomposes graphs into substructures called graphlets 6. The number of nodes a graphlet can have is restricted to five for the efficiency of enumeration. Even by this restriction, exhaustive enumeration of all graphlets in a graph is still prohibitively expensive. Thus, Shervashidze et al.  propose to speed up the enumeration by using the method of random sampling. Costa et al.  develop a graph kernel called the Neighborhood Subgraph Pairwise Distance Kernel (NSPDK) that decomposes a graph into all pairs of neighborhood subgraphs of small radium at increasing distances. To speed up the Gram matrix computation, they use a fast graph invariant string encoding for the pairs of neighborhood subgraphs. Kondor et al.  propose a multiscale Laplacian graph kernel for capturing the graph structure at multiple different scales. To solve the graph invariance problem, the feature space Laplacian graph kernel (FLG) is developed. Then, each node is associated with a subgraph centered around it, and the FLG kernel between each pair of these subgraphs is computed. To compute graph similarity at multiple different scales, the size of subgraphs is increased and the FLG kernel is recursively applied on these larger subgraphs. Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel (WL)   augments each node using the first-order Weisfeiler-Lehman test of graph isomorphism 0. It concatenates the labels of a node and all its neighboring nodes into a string and hashes the concatenated labels into new labels, aggregating neighborhood information around a node. WWL  extends WL to graphs with continuous attributes by considering each graph as a set of node embeddings and using the Wasserstein distance to compute the similarity between the two sets of node embeddings. Each node is associated with two kinds of features, one of which is the subtree feature map generated by WL and the other of which is continuous attributes. The continuous attributes of each node are propagated to its neighboring nodes by an average aggregation operator, which is similar to the layer-wise propagation rule of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) 7. Our method MWSP also uses the Wasserstein distance to compute the similarity between the shortest-path node feature maps of two graphs. OA 8 develops base kernels that generate graph hierarchies, from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed and guaranteed positive semidefinite. The optimal assignment kernels provide a more valid notion of graph similarity, which is integrated into the WL to improve its performance. FWL 9 is based on a filtration kernel that compares Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree feature occurrence distributions (filtration histograms) over sequences of nested subgraphs, which are generated by sequentially considering all the edges whose weights are less than a changing threshold. This strategy not only provides graph features on different levels of granularities but also considers the life span of graph features. FWL’s expressiveness is more powerful than the ordinary WL. DGK utilizes word2vec  to learn latent representations for substructures, such as graphlets, shortest paths, and subtree patterns. The similarity matrix between substructures is computed and integrated into the computation of the graph kernel matrix. Nikolentzos et al.  use the eigenvectors of the graph adjacency matrices as graph embeddings and propose two graph kernels to compute the similarity between two graph embeddings. The first graph kernel uses the Earth Mover’s Distance  to compute the distance between two graph embeddings; and the second one uses the Pyramid Match kernel   to find an approximate correspondence between two graph embeddings. HTAK  transitively aligns the vertices between graphs through a family of hierarchical prototype graphs, which are generated by the k-means clustering method. Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK)  is inspired by the connections between over-parameterized neural networks and kernel methods  . It inherits both the advantages of GNN and graph kernels, i.e., extracting powerful features from graphs as GNN and being easy to train and analyze as graph kernels. It is equivalent to an infinitely wide GNN trained by gradient descent. GNTK is proven to learn a class of smooth functions on graphs. GraphQNTK  is an extension of GNTK by introducing the attention mechanism and quantum computing into GNTK’s structure and computation.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Random walk graph kernels  [ref]3 decompose graphs into their substructures random walks and compute the number of matching random walks from two graphs, which can be transformed to perform random walks on the direct product\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
