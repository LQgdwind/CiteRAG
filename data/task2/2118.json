      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Iterative Amortized Inference for Learning Symmetric and Disentangled Multi-Object Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we provide arguments as to why models that learn unordered (i.e., permutation equivariant) latents might be preferred over those that learn ordered latents.\nMany of the discussion points here are adapted from Appendix A.3 of¬†Greff et¬†al. [ref]18.\nWe also empirically show one key advantage using a variant of the Multi-dSprites dataset. GENESIS¬†[ref]12 is a generative model for multi-object representation learning that, like MONet, uses sequential attention over the image to discover objects.\nIts design is motivated by efficiency and the task of unconditional scene generation.\nIt uses an autoregressive prior and autoregressive posterior to induce an ordering on its KùêæK object-centric latent variables which enables fast inference and generation.\nThe authors demonstrate that the autoregressive prior also facilitates coherent generation of multi-object scenes. On biased decomposition However, GENESIS is not equivariant to permutations applied to the KùêæK latents.\nThat is, GENESIS infers a ordered scene decomposition.\nDue to the autoregressive prior and posterior, the pixels assigned to the iùëñith latent depends on latents <iabsentùëñ<i, which biases the model towards specific decomposition strategies that incorporate global scene information (Figure¬†11).\nGENESIS uses a deterministic stick-breaking process to implement sequential attention, which encourages it to learn fixed strategies such as always placing the background in the first or last component.\nAdditionally, this can occasionally lead the model towards learning poor strategies that are overly dependent on color. On ambiguity Only updating each object-centric latent once makes GENESIS potentially less capable of handling ambiguous and complex cases.\nEfficientMORL assigns pixels to latents across multiple iterations, which can facilitate disambiguating parts of a scene that are difficult to parse. On multi-stability GENESIS also does not share the multi-stability property enjoyed by EfficientMORL and IODINE.\nThat is, running inference multiple times with EfficientMORL can produce different scene decompositions, particularly for ambiguous cases, due to randomness in the iterative assignment (see Figure 10 of¬†Greff et¬†al. [ref]18). On sequential extensions Finally, we highlight that IODINE has been demonstrated to be straightforward to extend to sequences, and we expect EfficientMORL could be similarly applied to sequences since it shares with IODINE the use of adaptive top-down refinement.\nThis has been accomplished in a few different ways.\nOne way is to simply pass a new image at each step of iterative inference¬†[ref]18.\nOr, initialize the posterior at each time step with the posterior from the previous time step before performing IùêºI refinement steps¬†[ref]31.\nIn the model-based reinforcement learning setting, a latent dynamics model has been used to predict the initial posterior at each time step using the posterior from the previous time step, followed by IùêºI refinement steps¬†.\nOrdered models have been used for sequential data by adding an extra matching step to align the object latents over time, resembling unsupervised multi-object tracking¬†. GENESIS-v2 We note that the authors of GENESIS recently released GENESIS-v2¬†, which appeared after the initial submission of this work.\nWe comment briefly on it here.\nGENESIS-v2 appears to remove GENESIS‚Äôs autoregressive posterior and adds a non-parametric randomized clustering algorithm to obtain an ordered set of of attention masks.\nThese attention masks are then mapped in parallel to KùêæK latents (GENESIS-v2 is able to adjust KùêæK on-the-fly via early-stopping of the clustering algorithm).\nDue to the random initialization of the clustering algorithm, the model cannot learn a fixed sequential decomposition strategy.\nWe highlight that GENESIS-v2 keeps GENESIS‚Äôs autoregressive prior and that GENESIS-v2 is not equivariant with respect to permutations applied to the set of cluster seeds used to obtain attention masks.\nLike GENESIS, GENESIS-v2 uses a stick-breaking process such that the last (KùêæKth) component is assigned the remaining scope; this suggests that global information may still be leaking into the representations (see Figure¬†11).\nThe authors note that on some training runs, the model learns to always place the background into the last component.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: learn unordered (i.e., permutation equivariant) latents might be preferred over those that learn ordered latents.\nMany of the discussion points here are adapted from Appendix A.3 of¬†Greff et¬†al.
