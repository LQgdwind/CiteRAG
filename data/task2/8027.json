      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Comparison of Video Frame Sampling Methods for Multi-Modal RAG Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideo frame sampling involves selection of distinct frames that capture the essence of a video and eliminate any redundant frames. Selection of such key frames through video shot boundary detection  is a very well researched task. Video can be segmented into frames through quantification of differences between two image frames . Classic pixel comparison-based methods employ the likelihood ratio    for sampling. The consecutive frames can be partitioned into smaller regions  to calculate individual likelihood ratios. The consecutive frame can be included in the sample when the aggregated likelihood ratio of regions exceeds a preset threshold value. Similarly, the histogram-based   techniques allocate each image pixel to a predefined bin according to the pixel intensity value. Changes in adjacent video frames are identified by taking histogram difference  between consecutive frames. Image quality assessment methods have been developed to calculate the structural similarity index measure  between two images by combining luminance, contrast and structure components into a single metric that can identify changes between frames. Gradual shot boundary detection  method leverages the variance distribution of edge information in frame sequences to identify transitions. Computationally expensive composite methods have been proposed which use blend of mathematical and machine learning capabilities for video shot boundary detection [ref]18. The notion of harnessing neural networks for feature extraction originated in earlier years. The similarity coefficients [ref]20 between two frames can be obtained by comparing their semantic representations. Semantic space representations can be extracted [ref]21 from pre-trained Convolutional neural networks . Other popular choice to acquire the semantic representations of frames include models that jointly train an image encoder and a text encoder . Like the pixel, histogram and structural index measure methods mentioned earlier, semantic representation comparison for change detection techniques requires the establishment of similarity coefficient thresholds. Selection of appropriate threshold values is a key challenge  for these methods. The work has been conducted to analyse several key frame extraction algorithms for tunnel traffic videos, however does not provide an exhaustive comparative analysis. Recent work on shot boundary detection  leverage the progress of 3D Convolutional Networks , Transformers  and Neural architecture search  while improving upon the past work  for video shot boundary detection. Advancements in transformer-based models   offer comprehensive video encoding for text-to-video retrieval tasks however, these approaches lack a mechanism for key frame extraction, which is essential for Video RAG.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: sequences to identify transitions.
