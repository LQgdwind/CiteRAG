      "content": "Paper Title: Paco: Provocation Involving Action, Culture, and Oppression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe considered our problem a multiclass classification task. For multiclass classification, we\nexplored multiple training approaches on Paco. Each sentence was input to a model and the output was one of the four classes: (i) religious culture, (ii) religious oppression, (iii) action, and (iv) none. We discuss multiple approaches and compare their performances below. weighs each word in the corpus according to its Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) [ref]8. Based on the number of unique tokens in Paco, TF-IDF yielded a 11,441-dimensional embedding for each sentence of this dataset. We provided these embeddings as input to multiple classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR) 8, Random Forest (RF) , and Support Vector Machine (SVM) , and compared their performance. converted each word in Paco into a 300-dimensional embedding . In our case, we obtained such word embeddings using the Word2Vec model pretrained on the Google News dataset. To form a sentence embedding, we averaged Word2Vec embeddings for all words present in that sentence. Further, sentence embeddings were provided as inputs to LR, RF, and SVM. yields an embedding for each word in the corpus . We used Stanford’s GloVe model, which is trained on the Wikipedia dataset and returns a 100-dimensional word embedding.\nWe averaged these word embeddings in the same way as we did in Word2Vec. Finally, we trained the above three classifiers on GloVe sentence embeddings. leverages Deep Averaging Network (DAN) to extract 512-dimensional embeddings for each sentence . We leveraged these embeddings as features of the above classifiers. We leveraged modern transformer-based approaches such as BERT , RoBERTa , and XLNet . We fine-tuned all these models on our dataset by adding a layer (with softmax activation) in the forward direction, containing four output units (one for each class). Further, these models were trained using a batch size of 32, the maximum sequence length of 256, for five epochs to minimize the cross-entropy loss. All the above approaches were evaluated on Paco for five-fold cross-validation. Moreover, Paco was divided into five folds in a stratified manner, leading to the same class distribution in each fold. For evaluation, prior works on hate and fear speech    leveraged the AUC-ROC metric because it measures the goodness of fit, especially appropriate for imbalanced datasets. Paco also suffers from imbalanced class distribution (Figure 2). Hence, we also leveraged AUC-ROC score for evaluation. Table 1 shows AUC-ROC score (obtained by one versus one method ) achieved by each of the above approaches in five folds. Among embeddings-based methods, TF-IDF with LR achieved 0.818 as the average AUC-ROC score, followed by Word2Vec with SVM (0.815), USE with SVM (0.812), and GloVe with SVM (0.800). However, all transformer-based approaches such as BERT (0.832 average AUC-ROC), RoBERTa (0.851 average AUC-ROC), and XLNet (0.845 average AUC-ROC) outperformed embedding-based approaches. Overall, RoBERTa achieved the highest average AUC-ROC score and was chosen as the best model. On Paco, we checked the performance of existing approaches     for fear and hate speech. To do so, we followed three steps. First, in Paco, we considered sentences of three provoking categories (action, religious culture, and religious oppression) as relevant (positive class) and others as irrelevant (none category as the negative class). Second, we leveraged the hate lexicon-based method , state-of-the-art hate speech models  , and fear speech model  to identify relevant sentences from Paco. We implemented Saha et al.’s  fear speech model using the Simple Transformers library 8 with the same hyperparameters that they used. Moreover, hate speech models   were available on the Hugging Face platform   and Bohra et al.’s  hate lexicons were available on their Github repository . Third, we computed the AUC-ROC score for each of these approaches. Table 2 shows the AUC-ROC scores of hate and fear speech models. Among them, the highest AUC-ROC score was achieved by Das et al.’s  hate speech model (0.726), followed by Aluru et al.’s  model (0.668), Saha et al.’s  fear identifying approach (0.643), and Bohra et al.’s  hate speech lexicons (0.602). In identifying provoking sentences, all these approaches perform worse than our RoBERTa model (average AUC-ROC score of 0.851 on five-fold cross-validation). Moreover, even while using these hate or fear speech models, there is no means of knowing the category of provocation, as opposed to our RoBERTa model.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: action, and (iv) none.
