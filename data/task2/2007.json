      "content": "Paper Title: Intriguing Properties of Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA unique characteristic of ViT models is that each block within the model generates a class token which can be processed by the classification head separately (Fig. 17).\nThis allows us to measure the discriminative ability of each individual block of an ImageNet pre-trained ViT as shown in Fig. 17.\nClass tokens generated by the deeper blocks are more discriminative and we use this insight to identify an effective ensemble of blocks whose tokens have the best downstream transferability. Transfer Methodology:\nAs illustrated in Fig. 17, we analyze the block-wise classification accuracy of DeiT models and determine the discriminative information is captured within the class tokens of the last few blocks.\nAs such, we conduct an ablation study for off-the-shelf transfer learning on fine-grained classification dataset CUB , Flowers 8 and large scale iNaturalist  using DeiT-S  as reported in Table 5.\nHere, we concatenate the class tokens (optionally combined with average patch tokens) from different blocks and train a linear classifier to transfer the features to downstream tasks.\nNote that a patch token is generated by averaging along the patch dimension.\nThe scheme that concatenate class tokens from the last four blocks shows the best transfer learning performance.\nWe refer to this transfer methodology as DeiT-S (ensemble).\nConcatenation of both class and averaged patch tokens from all blocks helps achieve similar performance compared to the tokens from the last four blocks but requires significantly large parameters to train. We find some exception to this on the Flower dataset 8 where using class tokens from all blocks have relatively better improvement (only 1.2%), compared to the class tokens from the last four blocks (Table  5). However, concatenating tokens from all blocks also increases the number of parameters e.g., transfer to Flowers from all tokens has 3 times more learnable parameters than using only the last four tokens.\nWe conduct further experimentation with DeiT-S (ensemble) across a broader range of tasks to validate our hypothesis.\nWe further compare against a pre-trained ResNet50 baseline, by using features before the logit layer. Visual Classification:\nWe analyze the transferability of off-the-shelf features across several datasets including Aircraft , CUB , DTD , GTSRB , Fungi , Places365 [ref]44 and iNaturalist .\nThese datasets are developed for fine-grained recognition, texture classification, traffic sign recognition, species classification and scene recognition with 100, 200, 47, 43, 1394, 365 and 1010 classes respectively.\nWe train a linear classifier on top of the extracted features over the train split of each dataset, and evaluate the performance on their respective test splits.\nThe ViT features show clear improvements over the CNN baseline (Fig. 18).\nWe note that DeiT-T, which requires about 5 times fewer parameters than ResNet50, performs better among all datasets.\nFurthermore, the model with the proposed ensemble strategy achieves the best results across all datasets. Few-Shot Learning: We consider meta-dataset [ref]45 designed as a\nlarge-scale few-shot learning (FSL) benchmark containing a diverse set of datasets from multiple domains. This includes letters of alphabets, hand-drawn sketches, images of textures, and fine-grained classes making it a challenging dataset involving a domain adaption requirement as well. We follow the standard setting of training on ImageNet and testing on all other datasets which are considered as the downstream tasks. In our experiments, we use a network pre-trained for classification on ImageNet dataset to extract features. For each downstream dataset, under the FSL setting, a support set of labelled images is available for every test query. We use the extracted features to learn a linear classifier over the support set for each query (similar to ), and evaluate using the standard FSL protocol defined in [ref]45. This evaluation involves a varying number of shots specific for each downstream dataset. On average, the ViT features transfer better across these diverse domains (Fig. 18) in comparison to the CNN baseline. Furthermore, we note that the transfer performance of ViT is further boosted using the proposed ensemble strategy. We also highlight the improvement in QuickDraw, a dataset containing hand-drawn sketches, which aligns with our findings on improved shape-bias of ViT models in contrast to CNN models (see Sec. 3.2 for elaborate discussion).\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: features before the logit layer.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
