      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Objective Optimization for Sparse Deep Multi-Task Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-Task Learning can be viewed as a form of Multi-Objective Optimization in which the goal is to simultaneously optimize several main tasks\n. In this approach, the DNN is trained to jointly optimize the loss functions of all the tasks, while learning shared representations that capture the common features across the tasks, and task-specific representations that capture the unique features of each task . This optimization technique is known as hard parameter sharing . Other strategies include soft parameter sharing , loss construction 9, and knowledge distillation [ref]28.\n introduced a Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) for Multi-Task Learning.\nThe suggested method learns shared representations that capture common properties across all the tasks while also optimizing task-specific objectives, using a Deep Neural Network architecture with shared and task-specific layers.\nTo enable a balanced parameter sharing across tasks, [ref]26 suggested a knowledge distillation-based MTL technique that learns to provide the same features as the single-task networks by minimizing a linear sum of task-specific losses. This technique then relies on the assumption of simple linear relationships between task-specific networks. Moreover, this method requires learning a separate task-specific model for every individual task and subsequently presents a significant challenge, particularly in scenarios involving a substantial number of tasks. In robotic grasping, [ref]48 proposed Fast GraspNeXt, a fast self-attention neural network architecture designed for embedded Multi-Task Learning in computer vision applications. A simple weighted sum of task-specific losses has been used to train the model. To enable user-guided decision-making, 0 developed an Exact Pareto optimum (EPO) search approach for Multi-Task Learning. This method applies gradient-based multi-objective optimization to locate the Pareto optimal solutions. The suggested technique provides scalable descent towards the Pareto front and the user’s input preferences within the restrictions imposed. When dealing with disconnected Pareto fronts, EPO search can only fully approximate a single component unless new initial seed points are used.\n recommended using COSMOS, a technique that generates qualitative Pareto front estimations in one optimization phase, instead of identifying one Pareto optimal point at a time.\nThrough a linear scalarization with penalty term, the algorithm learns to adapt a single network for all trade-off combinations of the preference vectors.\nHowever, COSMOS cannot handle objectives that do not depend on the input, such as an objective function for sparsity based on model weights, as investigated in our work.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the unique features of each task .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
