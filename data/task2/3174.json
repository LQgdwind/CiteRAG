      "content": "Paper Title: On visual self-supervision and its effect on model robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs LeCun et al. [ref]18 point out, “self-supervised learning obtains supervisory signals from the data itself, often leveraging the underlying structure in the data.” Imagine we are given an input image x𝑥x and we apply to it a transformation T​(⋅)𝑇⋅T(\\cdot) that gives us the a transformed version of the image xS​Ssubscript𝑥𝑆𝑆x_{SS} and label yS​Ssubscript𝑦𝑆𝑆y_{SS}: In our experiments, we study the following self-supervised task: rotation prediction [ref]9, and solving a jigsaw puzzle 0  (see Figure 2). Both of these tasks are implemented as a supervised task with multi-class cross-entropy loss as a criterion to be optimized. This allows us to easily incorporate rotation prediction as a auxiliary task to be optimized in addition to classification. In case of rotations predictions, the transformation T​(⋅)𝑇⋅T(\\cdot) consists of rotating the image by a multiple of 90​deg90degree90\\deg, and returning a rotated image xS​Ssubscript𝑥𝑆𝑆x_{SS} and a label yS​Ssubscript𝑦𝑆𝑆y_{SS} assigned to the particular rotation. In case of the jigsaw puzzle, the task of consists of dividing the image into n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n grid, and randomly picking a set of J𝐽J permutations (each assigned its own label). The transformation T​(⋅)𝑇⋅T(\\cdot) then consists of scrambling the image parts according to the randomly chosen permutation, returning the scrambled image and label associated with the permutation. The task of the network is then to either predict the rotation of the image, or the permutation that would unscramble the image.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: As LeCun et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
