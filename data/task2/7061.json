      "content": "Paper Title: On the Length of Strongly Monotone Descending Chains over \"ERROR \\mathbbb\"⁢ℕ^𝒅\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n(wqo for short) are a\nnotion from order theory [ref]28  that has proven\nvery effective in many areas of mathematics, logic,\ncombinatorics, and computer science in order to establish finiteness\nstatements. For instance, in the field of formal verification, they\nprovide the termination arguments for the generic algorithms\nfor well structured transition\nsystems  , notably the backward\ncoverability algorithm for deciding safety\nproperties   . In full generality, one cannot extract complexity bounds from\nwqo-powered termination proofs. Nevertheless, in an algorithmic\nsetting, one can “instrument” wqos by considering\nso-called controlled sequences  8, and\nnew tight complexity upper bounds for wqo-based algorithms now appear\non a regular basis [e.g., 39, 4, 6, 5, 25, for a few recent\nexamples]. Those complexity upper bounds are however astronomically high, and\nsometimes actually way too high for the problem at hand. An\nemblematic illustration of this phenomenon is the backward\ncoverability algorithm for vector addition systems (VAS), which was\nshown to run in double exponential time by Bozzelli and Ganty 2 based on\nan original analysis due to Rackoff 6: the corresponding\nbounds over the wqo ℕdsuperscriptℕ𝑑\\mathbb{N}^{d} are Ackermannian 9. One way pioneered by Lazić and Schmitz 1\nto close such complexity gaps while retaining some of the wide\napplicability of wqos and well structured transition systems is to\nfocus on the descending chains of downwards closed sets over the wqo\nat hand. Indeed, one of the equivalent characterisations of wqos is\nthe descending chain condition [ref]28 , which\nguarantees that those descending chains are finite. In themselves, descending chains are no silver bullet: e.g., the\ncontrolled descending chains over ℕdsuperscriptℕ𝑑\\mathbb{N}^{d} are also of Ackermannian\nlength [31, Thm. 3.10]. Nevertheless, these chains\nsometimes exhibit a form of “monotony,” which yields vastly improved\nupper bounds. When applied to a dual version of the backward\ncoverability algorithm in well structured transition systems, this\nallows to recover the same double exponential time upper bound as\nin 2 6 for the VAS coverability problem,\nalong with tight upper bounds for coverability in several VAS\nextensions. The same framework was also the key to establishing tight\nbounds for coverability in ν𝜈\\nu-Petri nets 0. As a\nfurther testimony to the versatility of the approach,\nBenedikt, Duff, Sharad, and Worrell use it in [ref]7 to derive\noriginal upper bounds for problems on invertible polynomial automata\nand invertible affine nets, in a setting that is not strictly speaking\none of well structured transition systems. The coverability\nproblem in VAS is well-known to be \\EXPSPACE-complete, thanks\nto Rackoff’s 1978 upper bound matching\na 1976 lower bound by Lipton 3. The main\nparameter driving this complexity is the dimension of the system: the\nproblem is in pseudo-polynomial time in fixed dimension d𝑑d; more\nprecisely, Rackoff’s analysis yields a n2O​(d​lg⁡d)superscript𝑛superscript2𝑂𝑑lg𝑑n^{2^{O(d\\lg d)}} deterministic time upper bound for d𝑑d-dimensional VAS encoded\nin unary 7, by proving the same bound on the length of\na covering execution of minimal length. Here, there is a discrepancy\nwith the n2Ω​(d)superscript𝑛superscript2Ω𝑑n^{2^{\\Omega(d)}} lower bound on the length of that\nexecution in Lipton’s construction—a discrepancy that\nwas already highlighted as an open problem in the early 1980’s\nby Mayr and Meyer 4, and settled in the specific case of reversible\nsystems by Koppenhagen and Mayr . The upper bounds of\nboth Bozzelli and Ganty 2 and Lazić and Schmitz 1 on the complexity of the\nbackward coverability algorithm inherit from Rackoff’s\nn2O​(d​lg⁡d)superscript𝑛superscript2𝑂𝑑lg𝑑n^{2^{O(d\\lg d)}} bound and suffer from the same discrepancy. This was the situation until Künnemann, Mazowiecki,\nSchütze, Sinclair-Banks, and Wegrzycki showed an\nn2O​(d)superscript𝑛superscript2𝑂𝑑n^{2^{O(d)}} upper bound on the length of minimal covering executions of\nunary encoded d𝑑d-dimensional VAS, matching Lipton’s\nlower bound [29, Thm. 3.3]. This directly translates\ninto a deterministic time algorithm with the same upper bound\nbound [29, Cor. 3.4]. Furthermore, assuming the\nexponential time hypothesis, Künnemann et al. also show that\nthere does not exist a deterministic no​(2d)superscript𝑛𝑜superscript2𝑑n^{o(2^{d})} time algorithm\ndeciding coverability in unary encoded d𝑑d-dimensional\nVAS [29, Thm. 4.2]. The improved upper bound relies on the notion\nof a thin vector in ℕdsuperscriptℕ𝑑\\mathbb{N}^{d} [29, Def. 3.6]\n(somewhat reminiscent of the “extractors” of Leroux 2). The\nproof of [29, Thm. 3.3] works by induction on the\ndimension d𝑑d. By splitting a covering execution of minimal length at\nthe first non-thin configuration, Künnemann et al. obtain a\nprefix made of distinct thin configurations (which must then be of\nbounded length), and a suffix starting from a configuration with some\ncomponents high enough to be disregarded, hence that can be treated as\nan execution in a VAS of lower dimension, on which the induction\nhypothesis applies. In this paper, we show that the improved\nn2O​(d)superscript𝑛superscript2𝑂𝑑n^{2^{O(d)}} upper bound of Künnemann et al.  also applies to the\nnumber of iterations of the backward coverability algorithm for\nd𝑑d-dimensional VAS encoded in unary (see Theorem 4.2). In order to\ndo so, one could reuse the approach of Bozzelli and Ganty 2 to lift the\nimproved bound from the length of minimal covering executions to the\nrunning time of the backward coverability algorithm, but here we aim\nfor the generality of the framework of 1. Our main contribution is thus to show in \\defaultS​ 3 that the\nupper bounds on the length of strongly monotone controlled descending\nchains of downwards closed sets over ℕdsuperscriptℕ𝑑\\mathbb{N}^{d}—which include those\nconstructed during the running of the backward coverability algorithm\nfor VAS—can be improved similarly (see Theorem 3.6) when focusing\non a suitably generalised notion of thinness. As a byproduct, we\nobserve that thinness is an inherent property of such chains\n(see Corollary 3.7), rather than an a priori condition\nthat—almost magically—yields the improved bound. In addition to the application in \\defaultS​ 4.2 to the coverability\nproblem in vector addition systems, where we show that the\nbackward coverability algorithm runs in\ntime n2O​(d)superscript𝑛superscript2𝑂𝑑n^{2^{O(d)}} (see Corollary 4.5) and is therefore\nconditionally optimal by [29, Thm. 4.2], and\nas a further demonstration of the\nversatility of our results, we show in \\defaultS​ 4.3 how to apply them\nto invertible affine nets, a generalisation of vector addition systems\nintroduced by Benedikt et al. [ref]7. We obtain the same bounds for their\ncoverability problem as in the case of vector addition systems\n(see theorems 4.11 and 4.11), and thereby improve on\nthe \\ComplexityFont2EXPSPACE upper bound of [ref]7 by\nshowing that the problem is\nactually \\ComplexityFontEXPSPACE-complete (see Theorem 4.11).\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: (wqo for short) are a\nnotion from order theory [ref]28  that has proven\nvery effective in many areas of mathematics, logic,\ncombinatorics, and computer science in order to establish finiteness\nstatements.
