      "content": "Paper Title: Spiker+: a framework for the generation of efficient Spiking Neural Networks FPGA accelerators for inference at the edge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the past, SNNs were primarily implemented using software frameworks like Brian/Brian2 . However, their unique features, including high parallelism, temporal evolution, and event-driven computation, are ill-suited for dominant Von-Neumann Central Processing Unit (CPU) architectures with one or a few powerful computational units. Unfortunately, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectures, such as General Purpose Graphic Processing Units (GPGPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), optimized for standard ANNs workloads, are also not well-equipped for efficiently processing event-driven information across multiple timesteps . Furthermore, the binary spike encoding of SNNs does not align with the typical 64, 32, or 16-bit numeric representations of these SIMD architectures.\nTherefore, dedicated neuromorphic hardware is crucial for ensuring the widespread adoption of SNNs. Figure 2 provides an overview of state-of-the-art accelerators for SNNs, offering a general perspective rather than an exhaustive list of available solutions. For more detailed information, refer to , . Contributions in this domain span various design dimensions, including application-driven solutions focused on specific applications and those aimed at modeling biological neuron dynamics. However, this paper primarily emphasizes the hardware technology dimension. The research effort is divided between analog solutions based on emerging technologies and efficient digital implementations . In the digital realm, presented solutions differ on the target platform (ASIC or FPGA) and accelerator size, tailored for either large-scale systems or smal applications. Examining large network models, the SpiNNaker system developed at Manchester University is implemented using standard 32-bit ARM M4F CPUs simulating neuron activity. It optimizes spike routing between units . Promisingly, major computer companies invest in developing their neuromorphic accelerators, such as Intel Loihi  and IBM True-North . These accelerators provide additional optimizations using specialized hardware to execute the neuron model. Another solution, Tianjic [ref]21 from the University of Beijing, aims to implement a hybrid SNN/ANN model, benefiting from both domains. An alternative design approach is recognizing that real biological neural networks function as analog physical systems. Emulating their efficiency involves using hardware components that approximate biological elements. Chips like Dynap-se2  by SynSense, a spinoff of the Institute of Neuro-Informatics (INI) in Switzerland, exemplify this concept. Neurogrid [ref]23 from Stanford University and the European project BrainscaleS  focus on faithfully simulating portions of a biological brain. Due to their complexity, these systems have programming tools for automatic SNN configuration. Tools like Rockpool  by SynSense and Nengo  facilitate automatic configuration and acceleration of SNNs on neuromorphic hardware based on Python model descriptions. While these accelerators suit large-scale neuromorphic systems with good programmability, applications like the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices, and biomedical sensors demand smaller sizes and lower power consumption. In such cases, designing specialized hardware accelerators to execute specific tasks, such as classification or regression, efficiently becomes a viable solution. To pursue this direction, the first option is designing a compact, programmable ASIC supporting various architectures and models. The focus is on digital solutions for networks ranging from hundreds to a few thousand neurons. A preliminary comparison with non-spiking hardware accelerators, dedicated to efficient convolution execution in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is discussed in , highlighting the energy efficiency of SNNs. These accelerators often use the Address Event Representation (AER) protocol for compatibility with neuromorphic sensors. An example is found in , developed at Zhejiang University. Charlotte Frenkel’s work at the University of Delft and Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich introduces three chips — MorphIC[ref]29, ODIN , and ReckOn — exploring online learning on small, low-power, and efficient accelerators. The final digital accelerator option, central to this paper, involves developing a specialized FPGA-based accelerator, offering advantages like cost reduction and increased flexibility by bypassing tape-out design needs. Many IoT edge systems now integrate FPGA s for task acceleration, potentially expanding the application of neuromorphic processors. An early example is the event-driven Minitaur , and subsequent alternatives feature diverse update policies, neuron models, architectural choices, and network sizes           . Another key advantage of using an FPGA is its intrinsic reconfigurability. It allows hardware reprogramming to modify the network architecture or neuron model, tailoring the accelerator to specific application requirements. However, existing accelerators still need to exploit this characteristic efficiently. The first example of FPGA-oriented Design Space Exploration (DSE) is found in , focusing on the best encoding technique for input data translation into spike sequences. Conversely, E3​N​Esuperscript𝐸3𝑁𝐸E^{3}NE provides a block library to configure networks for specific applications, optimizing data movement and hardware utilization, with a dedicated section for input encoding. In this scenario, there is still a lack of a comprehensive framework that conceals the internal details of the architecture, enabling the user to operate at higher abstraction levels. For instance, a Python description of the model could be automatically translated into custom blocks. Spiker+ moves in this direction, trying to address this challenge.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: accelerators, such as Intel Loihi  and IBM True-North .
