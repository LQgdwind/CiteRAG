      "content": "Paper Title: Semantic Information Recovery in Wireless Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNow, we will define our information-theoretic system model of semantic communication. Fig. 1 shows the schematic of our model. We assume the existence of a semantic source, described as a hidden target multivariate Random Variable (RV) 𝐳∈ℳzNz×1𝐳superscriptsubscriptℳ𝑧subscript𝑁𝑧1\\mathbf{z}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{z}^{N_{z}\\times 1} from a domain ℳzsubscriptℳ𝑧\\mathcal{M}_{z} of dimension Nzsubscript𝑁𝑧N_{z} distributed according to a probability density or mass function (pdf/pmf) p​(𝐳)𝑝𝐳p(\\mathbf{z}). To simplify the discussion, we assume it to be discrete and memoryless.111For the remainder of the article, note that the domain of all RVs ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} may be either discrete or continuous. Further, we note that the definition of entropy for discrete and continuous RVs differs. For example, the differential entropy of continuous RVs may be negative whereas the entropy of discrete RVs is always positive . Without loss of generality, we will thus assume all RVs either to be discrete or to be continuous. In this work, we avoid notational clutter by using the expected value operator: Replacing the integral by summation over discrete RVs, the equations are also valid for discrete RVs and vice versa. This approach is similar to that of  : In  , the semantic source222Note that in  the semantic information source is defined as a tuple (𝐳,𝐬,p​(𝐳,𝐬),L)𝐳𝐬𝑝𝐳𝐬𝐿(\\mathbf{z},\\mathbf{s},p(\\mathbf{z},\\mathbf{s}),L). In this original notation, 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} is the model, 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} the message, p​(𝐳,𝐬)𝑝𝐳𝐬p(\\mathbf{z},\\mathbf{s}) the joint distribution of 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} and 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s}, and L𝐿L is the deterministic formal language. is described by “models of the world”. In , a semantic channel then generates messages through entailment relations between “models” and “messages”. We will call these “messages” source signal and define it to be a RV 𝐬∈ℳsNs×1𝐬superscriptsubscriptℳ𝑠subscript𝑁𝑠1\\mathbf{s}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{s}^{N_{s}\\times 1} as it is usually observed and enters the communication system. In classic Shannon design, the aim is to reconstruct the source 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} as accurately as possible at the receiver side. Further, we note that the authors in  considered the example of a semantic channel with deterministic entailment relations between 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} and 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} based on propositional logic. In this article, we go beyond this assumption and consider probabilistic semantic channels modeled by distribution p​(𝐬|𝐳)𝑝conditional𝐬𝐳p(\\mathbf{s}|\\mathbf{z}) that include the entailment in  as special cases, i.e., p​(𝐬|𝐳)=δ​(𝐬−f​(𝐳))𝑝conditional𝐬𝐳𝛿𝐬𝑓𝐳p(\\mathbf{s}|\\mathbf{z})=\\delta(\\mathbf{s}-f(\\mathbf{z})) where δ​(⋅)𝛿⋅\\delta(\\cdot) is the Dirac delta function and f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f(\\cdot) is any generic function. Our viewpoint is motivated by the recent success of pattern recognition tools that advanced the field of AI in the 201020102010s and may be used to extract semantics . Our approach also extends models as in [ref]19. There, the authors design a semantic communication system for the transmission of written language/text similar to  using transformer networks. In contrast to our work, [ref]19 does not define meaning as RV 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}. The objective in [ref]19 is to reconstruct 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} (sentences) as well as possible, rather than the meaning (RV 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}) conveyed in 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s}. Optimization is done w.r.t. to a loss function consisting of two parts: Cross entropy between language input 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} and output estimate 𝐬^^𝐬\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}, as well as a scaled mutual information term between transmit signal 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and receive signal 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}. After optimization, the authors measure semantic performance by some semantic metric ℒ​(𝐬,𝐬^)ℒ𝐬^𝐬\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{s},\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}). We now provide an example to explain what we understand under a semantic source 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} and channel p​(𝐬|𝐳)𝑝conditional𝐬𝐳p(\\mathbf{s}|\\mathbf{z}): Let us assume a biologist who has an image of a tree. The biologist wants to know what kind of tree it is by interpreting the observed data (image). In this case, the semantic source 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} is a multivariate RV composed of a categorical RV with M𝑀M tree classes. For any realization (sample value) 𝘇isubscript𝘇𝑖\\bm{\\mathsf{z}}_{i} of the semantic source, the semantic channel p​(𝐬|𝐳)𝑝conditional𝐬𝐳p(\\mathbf{s}|\\mathbf{z}) then outputs with some probability one image 𝘀isubscript𝘀𝑖\\bm{\\mathsf{s}}_{i} of a tree conveying characteristics of 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}, i.e., its meaning. Note that the underlying meaning of the same sensed data (message) can be different for other recipients, e.g., humans or tasks/applications, i.e., in other semantic contexts. Imagine a child, i.e., a person with different characteristics (personality, expertise, knowledge, goals, and intentions) than the biologist, who is only interested if he/she can climb up this tree or whether the tree provides shade. Thus, we include the characteristics of the sender and receiver in RV 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z} and consider it directly in compression and encoding. Compared to , we, therefore, argue that we also include level C by semantic source and channel since context can be included on increasing layers of complexity. First, a RV 𝐳1subscript𝐳1\\mathbf{z}_{1} might capture the interpretation, like the classification of images or sensor data. Moving beyond the first semantic layer, then a RV 𝐳2subscript𝐳2\\mathbf{z}_{2} might expand this towards a more general goal, like keeping a constant temperature in power plant control. In fact, we can add or remove context, i.e., semantics and goals, arbitrarily often according to the human or application behind, and we can optimize the overall (communication) system w.r.t. 𝐳1,𝐳2,…,𝐳isubscript𝐳1subscript𝐳2…subscript𝐳𝑖\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\mathbf{z}_{2},\\dots,\\mathbf{z}_{i}, respectively. As a last remark, we note that we basically defined probabilistic semantic relationships, and it remains the question of how exactly they might look. In our example, the meaning of the images needs to be labeled into real-world data pairs {𝘀i,𝘇i}subscript𝘀𝑖subscript𝘇𝑖\\{\\bm{\\mathsf{s}}_{i},\\bm{\\mathsf{z}}_{i}\\} by experts/humans, since image recognition lacks precise mathematical models. This is also true for NLP [ref]19: How can we measure if two sentences have the same meaning, i.e., how does the semantic space look like?\nIn contrast, in , the authors are able to solve their well-defined technical problem (motion detection) by a model-driven approach. We can thus distinguish between model and data-driven semantics, which both can be handled within Shannon’s information theory.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: is motivated by the recent success of pattern recognition tools that advanced the field of AI in the 201020102010s and may be used to extract semantics .
