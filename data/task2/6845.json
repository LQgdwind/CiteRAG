      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithm-assisted discovery of an intrinsic order among mathematical constants\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAp√©ry‚Äôs celebrated proof of the irrationality of Œ∂‚Äã(3)ùúÅ3\\zeta(3) relies on producing an efficient approximation of this number via the continued fraction formula Truncating such an infinite continued fraction at a finite number of steps yields a sequence of rational numbers approximating the target constant. In this way, the exploration of continued fractions offers an approach for estimating irrationality measures. Within the class of continued fractions, formulas like Eq. 1 constitute the distinguished subclass of polynomial continued fractions, for which the partial numerators and denominators are defined by polynomials with integer coefficients as a function of the depth nùëõn. The study of polynomial continued fractions is particularly attractive due to their broad mathematical scope and computational simplicity [11, ¬ßVI] (see also    [ref]15). Remarkably, these continued fractions encompass a broad range of mathematical functions including trigonometric, Bessel, gamma, and hypergeometric functions; they represent a large collection of constants ;\nthey generalize a wide class of infinite sums ; and they represent linear recurrence formulas with polynomial coefficients . The computational simplicity of polynomial continued fractions stems from two key aspects. Firstly, the space of polynomial continued fractions is countable, which enables its systematic exploration and analysis. Secondly, the rational approximation by a polynomial continued fraction can be evaluated very efficiently [18, ¬ß5.2]. Those two facts make this space a fitting candidate for computer-supported research. The Ramanujan Machine project , named to honor Srinivasa Ramanujan‚Äôs unique contributions to mathematics , proposed to automate the process of discovery of formulas via an algorithmic approach. The project developed algorithms to find formulas for constants numerically, yielding many new ones such as notable formulas for Catalan‚Äôs constant. The most successful algorithm employed there relied on a brute-force search over the space of polynomial continued fractions. To broaden the exploration beyond the space that can be covered by brute-force searches,\none is confronted with the necessity to develop a more sophisticated exploration strategy.\nIt was through the analysis of the database of formulas obtained in  that we were able to identify an intriguing numerical property in the space of formulas. This property, called factorial reduction (defined in Section 2.1), guided the development of a more efficient algorithm for formula discovery. Our novel algorithm is thus designed to search for formulas based on factorial reduction,\ndiscovering hundreds of polynomial continued fraction formulas for well-known mathematical constants.\nThis output significantly exceeds what has been manually discovered in the past (e.g., ).\nThe algorithm is heuristic in nature, as it prunes the search space based on the conjecture that continued fractions representing known constants tend to have factorial reduction. At any rate,\nthe actual formulas that the algorithm discovers can be and are independently verified.\nA search utilizing the factorial reduction property makes the algorithm conducive to distributed computing, enabling us to implement a massively parallel search, with which we covered a significantly larger space of formulas than what was possible before. Our algorithm-driven approach exemplifies the vision of experimental mathematics    ‚Äîleveraging algorithms at scale to generate new insights in mathematics (see, e.g.,    [ref]27).\nThrough the generation of large amounts of data, algorithms offer valuable hints about patterns and behaviors of mathematical structures that would be otherwise imperceptible within a reasonable timeframe. These hints guide mathematicians in formulating stronger conjectures and even provide a blueprint for rigorous proofs and generalizations. This process can be regarded as a cycle: the results of algorithmic experiments create new conjectures that themselves inspire new algorithmic experiments, leading to further discoveries and a deeper understanding of the original problem.\nOur work executes two cycles of an algorithmic-driven scientific method (Fig. 1),\nleading to the discovery of an underlying model‚Äîa novel mathematical structure. We see a parallel between the relationship of algorithms to mathematics and that of experiments to theoretical physics. Computational frameworks can serve as virtual laboratories for mathematicians, enabling systematic exploration of mathematical hypotheses on a large scale. The greater computational power available, the more precise and comprehensive the experiments, providing potential breakthrough opportunities. This collaborative approach between algorithms and experts facilitates the exploration and testing of hypotheses, leading to an accelerated understanding of unsolved problems and augments the serendipitous insights of brilliant mathematicians.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: as a function of the depth nùëõn.
