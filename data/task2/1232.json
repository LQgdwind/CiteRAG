      "content": "Paper Title: A Boundary Regression Model for Nested Named Entity Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBecause the BR model is motivated by object detection from computer vision, in the following, we divide the related work into two parts: object detection and NE recognition. Object detection is implemented in a multistage pipeline in the early stage. A typical object detection model is often composed of three stages: segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Segmentation is implemented to generate possible object locations for prediction. Generic algorithms (e.g., selective search) are often adopted to avoid exhaustive searching. Feature extraction is implemented to extract higher-order abstract features from raw input images. The output of this process is often denoted as feature maps. The feature extraction process can be encapsulated as a basic network truncated from a standard architecture for high-quality image classification, including the VGG-16 network , GoogLeNet , etc. Finally, an output layer (e.g., a linear SVM or a softmax layer) is used to predict confidence scores for each proposed region. End-to-end object detection models can be optimized globally and share computation between inputs. These models are often similar in the feature extraction layer and output layer, where a basic network is adopted to generate conv feature maps, and two fully connected layers synchronously output class probabilities and object locations. The main difference is the strategy to generate the region proposal. For example, Faster R-NN adopts anchor boxes to generate region proposals per feature map . Erhan et al.  use a single deep neural network to generate a small number of bounding boxes. Redomon et al. [ref]33 divide an image into grids associated with a number of bounding boxes. Liu et al.  use a basic network that maps an image into multiple feature maps for generating default boxes with different aspect ratios and scales. In the field of NE recognition, neural networks have also received great attention. Early models usually adopt a sequence model to output flattened NEs (e.g., LSTM, Bi-LSTM or Bi-LSTM-CNN). To handle the nesting problem, the sequence model is redesigned. It has three variants: the layering, cascading and joint models . Parsing trees are also widely used to represent nested NEs in a tree structure 0. For example, Finkel et al.  use internal and structural information of parsing trees to flatten nested NEs. Zhang et al.  adopted a transition-based parser. Jie et al. 7 tried to capture the global dependency of a parsing tree. Recently, many models have been designed to recognize nested NEs directly. Lu et al.  resolve nested NEs into a hypergraph representation. Xu et al. 8 and Sohrab et al.  verify every possible fragment up to a certain length. Wang et al.  map a sentence with nested mentions to a designated forest. Ju et al. 8 proposed an iterative method that implements a sequence model in the output of a previous model. Lin et al.  propose a head-driven structure. Li et al.  combined outputs of a Bi-LSTM-CRF network with another Bi-LSTM network. Strakova et al.  proposed a sequence-to-sequence model. Zheng et al.  proposed an end-to-end boundary-aware neural model. In Chen et al. , a boundary assembling (BA) model is designed to recognize nested NEs. The BA model identifies NE boundaries, assembles them into NE candidates, and picks the most likely ones. For a broad understanding of the NER problem, the interested reader can refer to the survey paper  for deep neural network based NE recognition.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: example, Faster R-NN adopts anchor boxes to generate region proposals per feature map .
