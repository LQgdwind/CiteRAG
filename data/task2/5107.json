      "content": "Paper Title: Taming Reachability Analysis of DNN-Controlled Systems via Abstraction-Based Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their remarkable capability of driving systems to perform specific tasks intelligently in open environments. They determine optimal actions during interactions between the hosting systems and their surroundings.\nFormally verifying DNNs can\nprovide safety guarantees   , which is, however,\ndifficult in practice due to their black-box nature and\nlack of interpretability  .\nFurthermore, their hosting systems aggravate the difficulty\nsince determining system actions requires computations over nonlinear system dynamics  . Reachability analysis, one of the powerful formal methods, has been widely applied to the verification of continuous and hybrid systems   .\nIts successful applications include\ninvariant checking  , robust control  , fault detection  , set-based predication  , etc.\nThe essence of reachability analysis is to compute all reachable system states from given initial state(s), which can be used in various verification tasks such as model checking .\nAs an emerging approach to verifying DNN-controlled systems,\nreachability analysis has already been shown to be promisingly effective 1  . The Problem. Compared to continuous hybrid systems, it is significantly more challenging to compute reachable states for DNN-controlled systems due to the embedded complex and inexplicable DNNs.\nIn addition to over-approximating nonlinear system dynamics   , one also has to over-approximate the embedded DNNs for computing overestimated action sets [ref]30  of such systems. Specifically, given a set Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} of continuous system states at time step i𝑖i,111Continuous time is uniformly discretized into time steps. one first\noverestimates a set A~isubscript~𝐴𝑖\\tilde{A}_{i} of actions that will be applied to\nSisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} by over-approximating the neural network on Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i}, and then\noverestimates a set S~i+1subscript~𝑆𝑖1\\tilde{S}_{i+1} of successors by applying A~isubscript~𝐴𝑖\\tilde{A}_{i} to Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} using over-approximated system dynamics.\nWe consider such dual\nover-approximations as white-box approaches since all the information of DNNs, such as architectures, activation functions, and weights, shall be known before defining appropriate over-approximated models 1  . Consequently, these approaches are restricted to certain types of DNNs.\nFor instance,\nVerisig 2.0  does not support neural networks with the ReLU activation functions; Sherlock 1 is only applicable to ReLU-based networks; ReachNN*  is not scalable against the network size and introduces more overestimation; Polar [ref]30 also suffers from the efficiency problem when dealing with networks with differentiable activation functions (e.g., Tanh).\nMoreover, dual over-approximations introduce large overestimation accumulatively, which results in a considerable number of unreachable states in the overestimated sets. Our Approach.\nWe present a novel abstraction-based approach for bypassing the over-approximation of DNNs in computing the reachable states of DNN-controlled systems. Our approach introduces an  abstraction layer into the neural network before training, which abstracts concrete system states into abstract ones. This abstraction ensures that concrete states that are abstracted into the same state share the same action determined by the trained DNN.\nLeveraging this property, we can therefore compute the actions of a set of concrete states by mapping them to the corresponding abstract states and by feeding the abstract states into the trained DNNs to query for the output action. As DNNs are used as black-box oracles during the entire process, it suffices to know how system states are abstracted and to query the trained DNNs with the abstract states for the actions. Hence, the over-approximation of DNNs for computing actions is decently bypassed. Consequently, the overestimation due to the embedded network is avoided and no assumption is made on a network including its size, weight, architecture, and activation function. The abstraction-based training also allows us to avoid state explosion during the computation of reachable states. This is because adjacent abstract states, e.g., the two intervals [ref]0 1[ref]0  and   , can be efficiently aggregated, e.g., to [ref]0 02[ref]0 , which substantially restrains the exponential growth in the number of computed reachable states. Additionally, we propose a parallel optimization via initial-set partitioning, which\nfurther accelerates the process of computing reachable states. We have implemented our proposed approach into a tool called BBReach and extensively evaluated over a wide range of benchmarks. The experimental results show that DNNs trained by using our abstraction-based approach achieve competitive performance in terms of system cumulative reward. Our approach provides a black-box alternative to the reachability analysis of DNN-controlled systems, which bypasses the crux of DNN over-approximation and significantly improves the\nstate-of-the-art white-box counterparts with respect to\nthe tightness and efficiency in reachable state computation. Contributions. Overall, we provide: a novel abstraction-based training approach of DNNs, which\nmitigates the limitation of DNN over-approximation in the reachability analysis of DNN-controlled systems, without sacrificing the performance of trained DNNs (Section 4); the first, sound black-box approach for the reachability analysis of trained DNN-controlled systems, which not only enhances computational tightness and efficiency, but also are compatible with various DNNs (Section 5); and a prototype BBReach and an extensive assessment, which shows that BBReach improves existing white-box tools with respect to both the precision of results and the computational efficiency (Section 6).\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: the embedded complex and inexplicable DNNs.\nIn addition to over-approximating nonlinear system dynamics   , one also has to over-approximate the embedded DNNs for computing overestimated action sets [ref]30  of such systems.
