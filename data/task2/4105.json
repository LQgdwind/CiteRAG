      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian calibration of coupled computational mechanics models under uncertainty based on interface deformation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn efficient approach is needed to approximate the unnormalized posteriors of the Bayesian calibration problem (1), (3b) and their normalization. While a grid-based approximation of the posterior is feasible for low dimensional parameters 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x}, the necessary amount of grid-based evaluations grows exponentially with the dimension of 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x} and SMC methods become significantly more efficient as they exploit regions of high density. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are popular sampling methods to efficiently explore a probability distribution π𝜋\\pi for which no closed expression exists. The result of the SMC sampler is a particle representation δ𝒙(i)subscript𝛿superscript𝒙𝑖\\delta_{{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\left(i\\right)}} of π𝜋\\pi with associated weights w(i)superscript𝑤𝑖w^{\\left(i\\right)} in the form of Therein every particle has a location and weight {𝒙(i),w(i)}i=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝒙𝑖superscript𝑤𝑖𝑖1𝑁\\left\\{{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\left(i\\right)},w^{\\left(i\\right)}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}. It is further known   that with this approximation any integral over an integrable function h​(𝒙(i))ℎsuperscript𝒙𝑖h\\left({\\boldsymbol{x}}^{\\left(i\\right)}\\right) can be approximated by a sum that converges to the integral Specifically, we use an SMC method  which sequentially blends over from a particle representation of a predefined prior distribution to a particle representation of the actual posterior distribution. A convenient aspect of the particle representation in (12) is that they allow for a straightforward approximation of integrals (13), as they appear in marginal distributions (2). This is especially useful for Bayesian calibration under uncertainty and the associated integration in (3b). Here, the numerical integration is conducted by simply ignoring the dependency on 𝜽𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta} in the particle representation. The SMC algorithm we use in this work uses an adaptive step length based on   . Herein, a control parameter ζ𝜁\\zeta for the effective sample size (ESS) is used to control step length. The ESS is defined as and is a measure for the current weight distribution. The ESS represents how well the probability density mass is distributed amongst the used particles. The presentation of the SMC algorithm is compactly demonstrated in the pseudo-algorithm Algorithm 1 and described in remark 5. For more details, the interested reader is referred to  [ref]30 . An SMC algorithm generally starts with the steps to draw an initial set of particles from the prior distribution and initially equally weigh them. Then it needs to iteratively find a suitable step size and reweigh the particles. Resampling becomes necessary if too few particles carry too much weight of the distribution and likewise many particles lose significance. The particles are sequentially rejuvenated according to the new control parameter γ𝛾\\gamma and therefore new intermediate distribution (15). The rejuvenation step is carried out with a scaled covariance of the current step as demonstrated in  based on the acceptance rate of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm used for rejuvenation. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler , of which we omit the presentation for the sake of compactness. It is used to move the particles according to the new intermediate distribution. Reweighting, rejuvenation and possibly resampling are iteratively repeated until the intermediate distribution blends into the posterior, i.e. γ=1𝛾1\\gamma=1, which is the necessary last step if no other suitable γ𝛾\\gamma can be found. For the sake of a proper probability density, i.e. integration to 1, the resulting weights are finally normalized. The so-called tempering strategy that defines the transition from the prior to the posterior as a sequence is written as with the logarithmic likelihood 𝔏​(𝒙)𝔏𝒙\\mathfrak{L}\\left({\\boldsymbol{x}}\\right) as introduced in (5) and the prior p​(𝒙)𝑝𝒙p\\left({\\boldsymbol{x}}\\right). Finally, after reaching γ=1𝛾1\\gamma=1 the particle approximation has blended over into one for the posterior distribution.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: used particles.
