      "content": "Paper Title: NPENAS: Neural Predictor Guided Evolution for Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the case of open domain search, we utilize the DARTS [ref]13 search space to compare algorithms.\nThe search budgets of NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP are set at 150 and 100, respectively. Both algorithms employ the same search setting as DARTS [ref]13. During the search, a small macro network with eight cells is trained on CIFAR-10 for 505050 epochs with batch size 646464. The CIFAR-10 training dataset is divided into two parts, each containing 252525k images. One part is used for training and the other part for validation. The test images of the CIFAR-10 dataset are not used during the architecture search. Like DARTS, we use momentum SGD with initial learning rate 0.025, momentum 0.9, and weight decay 3×10−43superscript1043\\times 10^{-4} to train the macro network. A cosine learning rate schedule  without restart is adopted to annealed down the learning rate to zero. Training enhancements like cutout 5, path dropout, and auxiliary loss are not used during the architecture search. We record the validation accuracies of the sampled architectures at each training epoch. The average validation accuracy is calculated based on the highest validation accuracy and the last five validation accuracies. After the search is completed, only the architecture with the best average validation accuracy is selected to evaluate. The evaluation setting of searched architecture is the same as DARTS [ref]13. Based on the searched normal cell and reduction cell, a network of 202020 cells with 363636 initial channels is constructed. The network is randomly initialized and trained for 600 epochs with batch size 96. Training enhancements like cutout 5, path dropout, and auxiliary loss are used during architecture evaluation. It takes around 1.51.51.5 GPU days on an Nvidia RTX 2080Ti GPU. The network is trained five times independently with different seeds, and the mean and standard deviation of the test error on CIFAR-10 are reported. A comparison of the performance of our NEPNAS method with existing NAS algorithms on the DARTS search space is summarized in Table II. The search speed and performance of our proposed NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP outperform most of the existing NAS algorithms. NPENAS-NP costs 1.8 GPU days.Its speed is 6.5 times faster than the baseline algorithm BANANAS and is comparable with some gradient-based methods, such as DARTS (first-order) 1.5 GPU days. The best architecture found by NPENAS-NP achieves the state-of-the-art test error of 2.44%percent2.442.44\\%. NPENAS-BO is 4.7 times faster than the baseline algorithm BANANAS, and the best-searched architecture achieves a test error of 2.52%percent2.522.52\\%. It is worth pointing out that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance with a much smaller search budget compared to other algorithms (100 for NPEANS-NP and 150 for NPENAS-BO). The searched normal cells and reduction cells by NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP are visualized in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, respectively. In order to verify the stability of our proposed algorithms, we carry out four independent experiments on NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP, and the results are presented in Appendix D. Our methods can produce stable results over multiple runs.
