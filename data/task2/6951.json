      "content": "Paper Title: Generalized Simplicial Attention Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past few years, the rapid and expansive evolution of deep learning techniques has significantly enhanced the state-of-the-art in numerous learning tasks. From Feed-Forward  to Transformer , via Convolutional  and Recurrent  Neural Networks, increasingly sophisticated architectures have driven substantial advancements from both theoretical and practical standpoints. In today’s world, data defined on irregular domains (e.g., graphs) are ubiquitous, with applications spanning social networks, recommender systems, cybersecurity, sensor networks, and natural language processing. Since their introduction  , Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in learning tasks involving data defined over a graph domain. Here, the versatility of neural networks is combined with prior knowledge about data relationships, expressed in terms of graph topology. The literature on GNNs is extensive, with various approaches explored, primarily grouped into spectral   and non-spectral methods   . In a nutshell, the idea is to learn from data defined over graphs by computing a principled representation of node features through local aggregation with the information gathered from neighbors, defined by the underlying graph topology. This simple yet powerful concept has led to exceptional performance in many tasks such as node or graph classification ,, and link prediction , to name a few. At the same time, the introduction of attention mechanisms has significantly enhanced the performance of deep learning techniques. Initially introduced to handle sequence-based tasks ,, these mechanisms allow for variable-sized inputs and focus on the most relevant parts of them. Attention-based models (including Transformers) have a wide range of applications, from learning sentence representations  to machine translation , from machine reading  to multi-label image classification , achieving state-of-the-art results in many of these tasks. Pioneering works have generalized attention mechanisms to data defined over graphs  0 1. However, despite their widespread use, graph-based representations can only account for pairwise interactions. As a result, graphs may not fully capture all the information present in complex interconnected systems, where interactions cannot be reduced to simple pairwise relationships. This is particularly evident in biological networks, where multi-way links among complex substances, such as genes, proteins, or metabolites exist 2. Recent works on Topological Signal Processing (TSP) 3 4 5 6 7 have shown the advantages of learning from data defined on higher-order complexes, such as simplicial or cell complexes. These topological structures possess a rich algebraic description and can readily encode multi-way relationships hidden within the data. This has sparked interest in developing (deep) neural network architectures capable of handling data defined on such complexes, leading to the emergence of the field of Topological Deep Learning 8 9. In the sequel, we review the main topological neural network architectures, with emphasis to those built to process data on simplicial complexes (SCs). Related Works. Recently, several neural architectures for simplicial data processing have been proposed. In 0, the authors introduced the concept of simplicial convolution, which was then exploited to build a principled simplicial neural network architecture that generalizes GNNs by leveraging on higher-order Laplacians. However, this approach does not enable separate processing for the lower and upper neighborhoods of a simplicial complex. Then, in 1, message passing neural networks (MPNNs) were adapted to simplicial complexes 2, and a Simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) coloring procedure was introduced to differentiate non-isomorphic SCs. The aggregation and updating functions in this model are capable of processing data exploiting lower and upper neighborhoods, and the interaction of simplices of different orders. The architecture in 1 can also be viewed as a generalization of the architectures in 3 and 4, with a specific aggregation function provided by simplicial filters 5. In 6, recurrent MPNNs architectures were considered for flow interpolation and graph classification tasks. The works in 7 8 introduced simplicial convolutional neural networks architectures that explicitly enable multi-hop processing based on upper and lower neighborhoods. These architectures also offer spectral interpretability through the definition of simplicial filters and simplicial Fourier transform 5, leveraging the interaction of simplices of different orders 8. Then, the work in 9 introduced equivariant message passing simplicial networks; finally, in 0, the authors proposed a multi layer perceptron (MLP)-based simplicial architecture. Self-attention schemes for simplicial neural networks were initially proposed in [ref]1, which is the preliminary (preprint) version of this paper. Also, in a completely parallel and independent fashion, the paper in 1 proposed an attention mechanism for simplicial neural networks similar to the one in [ref]1. However, as we will elaborate later, in this paper we generalize the approach in [ref]1, diverging also from the one in 1 in several key aspects. Our work, along with the one in 1, paved the way for the development of the topological attention framework in 2. Finally, a simplicial-based attention mechanism for heterogeneous graphs was presented in 3. Contribution. The primary objective of this paper is to propose Generalized Simplicial Attention Neural Networks (GSANs), a novel topological architecture that exploits masked self-attention mechanisms to process data defined on simplicial complexes. Extending our preliminary work in [ref]1, and hinging on the Dirac operator and its Dirac Decomposition 4 5, GSANs process simplicial data through (data-driven) anisotropic convolutional filtering operations that consider the various neighborhoods defined by the simplicial topology. Notably, GSANs enable joint processing of data defined on different simplex orders through a weight-sharing mechanism, induced by the Dirac operator, thus making it both theoretically justified and computationally efficient. A sparse projection operator is also specifically designed to process the harmonic component of the data, i.e. to properly leverage its topological invariants (holes). From a theoretical perspective, we prove that GSANs are permutation equivariant and simplicial-aware. Interestingly, GSANs largely extend the preliminary SAN approach from [ref]1 in terms of architecture design, theoretical justifications and results, and different processing tasks they can be applied to. Finally, we illustrate how GSANs compares favorably with other available methods when applied to several learning tasks such as: (i) Trajectory prediction on ocean drifters tracks data 1; (ii) Missing data imputation in citation complexes 0,7;\n(iii) Molecular graph classification 1; (iv) Simplex prediction in citation complexes 8. To summarize, the contribution of this paper is threefold: We introduce GSANs, a novel topological architecture that hinges on Dirac operator using masked self-attention mechanisms to process data defined on simplicial complexes. GSANs enable joint processing of data defined on different simplex orders through a weight-sharing mechanism induced by the Dirac decomposition. We derive a rigorous theoretical analysis illustrating the permutation equivariance and the simplicial awareness of the proposed GSAN architecture. We provide a detailed implementation of GSAN 111https://github.com/luciatesta97/Generalized-Simplicial-Attention-Neural-Networks for reproducibility, also illustrating their excellent performance on several available simplicial and graph benchmarks. With respect to the aforementioned literature, the closest works are 8, 2 and 1, but there are significant differences with our approach. Specifically, the convolutional architecture that we propose as a building block for GSAN (cf. (III-A)) can be seen as a novel, principled, low-complexity, specific case of the general convolutional architecture of 8. However, there are two main differences: i) The architecture in 8 does not leverage any attention mechanism; ii) Even when comparing just the two convolutional architectures, the work in 8 does not employ the Dirac operator nor the harmonic projection. As a result, there is no weight-sharing in their case, leading to a larger number of parameters that, as we will demonstrate later in the numerical experiments, does not necessarily lead to better learning performance. Regarding the work in 1, the authors propose a simplicial attention mechanism, which however deeply differs from our approach. Indeed, unlike the MPNN architecture in 1, we employ a convolutional architecture grounded in TSP theory. Our model handles the interplay between different simplex orders, enabling multi-hop processing over the complex’s neighborhoods and a tailored processing of the harmonic data component. Also, we develop distinct attention mechanisms for different adjacencies, as opposed to the single attention function in 1. Finally, even if our method can be cast into the general topological attentional framework in 2 (just as any GNN can be see as a particular case of the message passing framework 2), our principled derivation based on formal arguments from TSP leads to a unique architecture and a novel theoretical analysis that is not readily derivable from 2.
