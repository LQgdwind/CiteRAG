      "content": "Paper Title: kTrans: Knowledge-Aware Transformer for Binary Code Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBinary code embedding (BCE), also known as binary code representation learning, aims to map unstructured binary code into a low-dimensional space where the binary code is represented as embeddings. Through binary code embedding, numerous traditional binary code analysis tasks can be improved using deep learning methods, such as binary code similarity detection    [ref]5  [ref]28  [ref]35 , function boundary recognition  , function signature recovery , value set analysis , and indirect call identification , etc.\nWith the development of large language models, the Transformer  has been proven to be an efficient language representation model and has also achieved excellent performance in various binary code analysis tasks. Existing binary code embedding methods can be roughly divided into two categories: manual embedding and learning-based embedding.\nManual embedding involves representing binary code with manually constructed numerical features, such as Gemini , Instruction2Vec [ref]28, etc. However, such methods require extensive domain expertise and are often task-specific, resulting in poor transferability.\nOn the other hand, learning-based embedding automates the process of generating embeddings for binary code using representation learning methods, such as Asm2Vec , SAFE [ref]35, etc. These methods learn features automatically from data, avoiding biases introduced by manual feature engineering.\nFurthermore, with the widespread application of Transformers, many Transformer-based approaches have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, such as PalmTree , jTrans , COMBO , etc.\nDespite the success of existing approaches in binary code analysis tasks, they still have several limitations. Firstly, existing approaches lack the utilization of prior knowledge inherent in binary code.\nMost approaches treat binary code as natural language and directly apply natural language models to assembly language [ref]5 . However, assembly language contains knowledge about instruction set architectures (ISAs), including the types of instruction opcodes, operand types, relationships between opcodes, and other information.\nFor example, for rax, eax, ax, al, a natural language model would consider them as independent tokens, but in fact, the latter three are all part of rax.\nTherefore, if the model could understand the relationship between eax and al, it would be able to capture the data-flow relationship between instructions when modeling sequences such as movzx eax, byte [r8]; cmp byte [rdx], al. Secondly, existing approaches lack understanding of instructions and thus are unable to model program execution behavior.\nInstructions are the fundamental units of program execution, but most approaches directly apply natural language models to assembly language without a clear understanding of instruction boundaries. For example, PalmTree requires users to provide instruction boundaries, while BinBert [ref]5 lacks information about instruction boundaries altogether.\nWithout a proper understanding of instructions, the model may not differentiate between [’pop’,’rbp’] and [’rbp’,’pop’]. Moreover, existing approaches lack modeling of implicit dependencies in binary code. Assembly instructions are not independent entities but have implicit dependencies, such as the global flag register EFLAGS.\nCurrent approaches partially address implicit dependencies through manual design. For example, jTrans models instruction jump relationships by sharing parameters between token embeddings and position embeddings, but it lacks consideration for other dependencies. PalmTree models data dependencies by constructing Next Sequence Prediction (NSP) tasks on data flow graphs, but it sacrifices the ability to model complete assembly language context.\nAs for the masking strategy of Transformers  itself, a simple token-level mask can only model dependencies between individual tokens and cannot capture dependencies between instructions.\nConsider the assembly snippet test eax, eax; mov rcx, qword [rbp-num]; jne addr. In cases like test eax, [MASK] or jne [MASK], the model can accurately predict the masked tokens without contextual information. However, the model fails to learn the relationship between instructions test eax, eax and jne addr, which actually implies a conditional branch dependency.\nIn conclusion, as shown in Table 1, There is still a lack of a comprehensive binary code embedding solution. In this paper, we propose kTrans, a novel Transformer-based binary code embedding approach.\nkTrans incorporates prior knowledge of assembly language into a Transformer model, and meanwhile is able to model the implicit dependencies between instructions with a novel pre-training task. kTrans incorporates explicit and implicit knowledge in two different ways respectively: Explicit injection of token knowledge. This type of knowledge is generated based on the definition of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), such as the instruction type and the relationship between registers rax, eax, ax, al, and is fed into the Transformer as additional inputs. By injecting this type of knowledge, the model gains the potential to learn token properties and instruction boundaries. Implicit injection of instruction knowledge. This type of knowledge is implicitly injected using instruction-level masks. By masking the entire instruction, the model gains an understanding of instruction boundaries and can model implicit relationships between instructions, such as conditional branch dependencies. We conducted pre-training of kTrans on a large-scale binary code dataset and evaluated its performance\non intrinsic tasks and real-world binary code analysis tasks.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that kTrans surpasses previous approaches in modeling assembly language with the lowest perplexity (1+3.3​e−413.3𝑒41+3.3e-4) and produces high-quality binary code embeddings with the highest outlier detection accuracy (86.6%percent86.686.6\\%). Through ablation experiments, we validated the effectiveness of the knowledge-aware design.\nFurther, on 3 downstream tasks, i.e, binary code similarity detection, function type recovery, and indirect call recognition, kTrans outperforms state-of-the-art solutions with 0.745 MRR@10000 (↑5.2%↑absentpercent5.2\\uparrow 5.2\\%), 0.876 accuracy (↑6.8%↑absentpercent6.8\\uparrow 6.8\\%) and 0.28 MRR@32 (↑12.6%↑absentpercent12.6\\uparrow 12.6\\%) respectively. Overall, we demonstrate that injecting knowledge can effectively enhance the capabilities of assembly language models, providing a new direction for the development of language models for binary code. And with the advance of general-purpose large-scale models that offers new insights for domain models in the field of binary code embedding, we discuss three future research directions for binary code embedding: larger domain models, cost-effective models, and combination with general large language models. In summary, this work makes the following contributions: We propose a novel approach to incorporate prior knowledge into Transformers, able to model implicit dependencies in assembly language.\nIt significantly improves the predictive capability of assembly language models, showing the promising prospects of knowledge fusion. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate that the embeddings generated by our pre-trained model outperform previous works and significantly enhance the performance of downstream tasks. We discuss several future research directions for binary code embedding. We open-source kTrans to facilitate future research.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: is represented as embeddings.
