Replicating these capabilities in machine learning models has been a major focus in computer vision and related fields  [ref]22 , yet the classical paradigm of supervised learning poses several challenges: explicit supervision requires carefully annotated data at a large scale, and is subject to obstacles such as rare or novel object categories.\nFurther, obtaining accurate ground-truth 3D scene and object geometry is challenging and expensive.\nLearning about compositional geometry merely by observing scenes and occasionally interacting with them—in the simplest case by moving a camera through a scene—without relying on direct supervision is an attractive alternative. As objects in the physical world are situated in 3D space, there has been a growing interest in combining recent advances in 3D neural rendering  and representation learning   with object-centric inductive biases to jointly learn to represent objects and their 3D geometry without direct supervision  [ref]33 .\nA particularly promising setting for learning both about objects and 3D scene geometry from RGB supervision alone is that of novel view synthesis (NVS), where the task is to predict a scene’s appearance from unobserved view points.\nThis task not only encourages a model to learn a geometrically-consistent representation of a scene, but has the potential to serve as an additional inductive bias for discovering objects without supervision. Prior methods combining object-centric inductive biases with 3D rendering techniques for NVS  [ref]33  however fail to generalize to scenes of high visual complexity and face a significant shortcoming in terms of computational cost and memory requirements:\ncommon object-centric models decode each object independently, adding a significant multiplicative factor to the already expensive volumetric rendering procedure which requires hundreds of decoding steps.\nThis requirement of executing thousands of decoding passes for each rendered pixel is a major limitation that prohibits scaling this class of methods to more powerful models and thus to more complex scenes. In this work, we propose Object Scene Representation Transformer (OSRT), an end-to-end model for object-centric 3D scene representation learning.\nThe integrated Slot Attention  module allows it to learn a scene representation that is decomposed into slots, each representing an object or part of the background.\nOSRT is based on SRT, utilizing a light field parameterization of space to predict pixel values directly from a latent scene representation in a single forward pass.\nInstead of rendering each slot independently, we introduce the novel Slot Mixer, a highly-efficient object-aware decoder that requires just a single forward pass per rendered pixel, irrespective of the number of slots in the model.\nIn summary, OSRT allows for highly scalable learning of object-centric 3D scene representations without supervision. Our core contributions are as follows: We present OSRT, a model for 3D-centric representation learning, enabling efficient and scalable object discovery in 3D scenes from RGB supervision.\nThe model is trained purely with the simple L2 loss and does not necessitate further regularizers or additional knowledge such as depth maps [ref]33 or explicit background handling . As part of OSRT, we propose the novel Slot Mixer, a highly efficient object-aware decoder that scales to large numbers of objects in a scene with little computational overhead. We study several properties of the proposed method, including robustness studies and advantages of using NVS to facilitate scene decomposition in complex datasets. In a range of experiments from easier previously proposed, to complex many-object scenes, we demonstrate that OSRT achieves state-of-the-art object decomposition, outperforming prior methods both quantitatively and in terms of efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: physical entities such as embodied agents. situated in 3D environments.\nThe development of an object-centric, geometric understanding of the world is considered a cornerstone of human cognition [ref]32: we perceive scenes in terms of discrete objects and their parts, and our understanding of 3D scene geometry is essential for reasoning about relations between objects and for skillfully\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
