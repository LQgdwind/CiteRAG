      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Deep GNNs: Rethinking Residual Connection in GNNs from a Path Decomposition Perspective for Preventing the Over-smoothing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of graph applications, including social networks¬†, traffic prediction¬†, knowledge graphs¬†, drug reaction¬† and recommendation system¬†.\nThe behavior of most GNNs is similar to a Laplacian smoother¬†[ref]25 or low-pass filter¬†, which learns node representation by recursively aggregating neighbor information.\nDespite the remarkable success, such a recursive smoothing process of GNNs usually results in the over-smoothing problem, i.e., all node representations will converge to indistinguishable¬† [ref]25 1 . The following two issues are crucial among the limitation of GNNs caused by over-smoothing.\nFirst, the performance of GNNs usually degenerates when more graph convolution operations are applied¬†[ref]25  . As a result, recent GNNs often use shallow architectures (e.g., 2 or 3 stacked convolution operations)¬†  , which ignore distant connections and can only exploit local structural information¬† [ref]42. Second, in some heterophily graphs that contain non-smooth signals, i.e., many connected nodes belonging to different classes, the performance of both shallow and deep GNNs is usually inferior to that of simple MLPs without neighbor aggregation¬† 3 . One straightforward way to alleviate over-smoothing is to use the residual connection, as in ResNet¬†4 5.\nUnfortunately, researchers found that simple residual connections only partially relieve the over-smoothing problem, and the performance of the model still degrades as more layers are stacked¬†   1 5, as shown in Figure¬†1.\nThe convergence of GNNs with residual connections has been analyzed using lazy random walk¬† [ref]42 or the subspace perspective¬†1, and variants of JK connections¬†[ref]42 and initial connections¬† were proposed for training DeepGNNs.\nHowever, as those convergence analysis of residual connections in GNNs ignores the optimization process of the weight matrix, their convergence conditions are usually not guaranteed in real applications¬†, and thus it cannot be well explained why residual connections fail for GNNs. In this paper,\nwe first present a novel forward and backward analysis of the stacking graph convolution layer with various kinds of skip connections, as shown in Figure¬†1(a), from a path decomposition perspective.\nThis perspective views GNNs with skip connections as a collection of many propagation paths instead of a single deep network.\nTo explain why residual connections fail in DeepGNNs, we systematically analyze the behavior from both the forward path decomposition and backward gradient optimization. Then, we find that:\n1) Due to the recursive aggregation process, the binomial distribution of residual connection paths causes the medium-length path to dominate the output representation, which results in over-smoothing when the GNNs become deeper.\n2) The weight matrix in each graph convolution layer may provide a path selection ability. Compared with the SGC with residual connections, the ResGNNs can deactivate longer paths in the ideal scenario by adequately setting the weight matrix to learn identity mapping.\n3) However, unlike ResNet, the entanglement of the propagation matrix and weight matrix would cause the phenomenon of gradient smoothing, which would prevent the GNNs with residual connections from optimizing to identity mapping.\nTherefore, we speculate that the reason why the residual connections fail to learn identity mapping in DeepGNNs lies in the optimization process of the weight matrix. Building on the aforementioned analysis from the path decomposition view, we propose a simple yet effective colD staRt adaptIVe rEsidual (DRIVE) connection for GNNs to prevent over-smoothing and effectively scale up the depth. It multiplies a trainable coefficient Œ±ùõº\\alpha to the graph convolution unit at each residual connection to control the smoothness.\nMoreover, we impose the direct pass identity mapping for the entire network at the beginning by initializing Œ±ùõº\\alpha with 0. This would lead to favorable forward and backward propagation properties, i.e., prevent over-smoothing at initialization, which can solve the gradient smoothing problem and accelerate model training.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel Universal Deep GNNs (UDGNN) framework that applies the DRIVE connection on both the GraphConvolution and the following FeedForward module. The UDGNN framework is GraphConv agnostic and can give the freedom of any standard GNNs to learn identity mapping or DeepMLP mapping and become deeper and more powerful.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: of graph applications, including social networks¬†, traffic prediction¬†, knowledge graphs¬†, drug reaction¬† and recommendation system¬†.\nThe behavior of most GNNs is similar to a Laplacian smoother¬†[ref]25 or low-pass filter¬†, which learns node representation by recursively aggregating neighbor information.\nDespite the remarkable success, such a recursive smoothing process of GNNs usually\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
