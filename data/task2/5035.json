Learning reward functions from preference-based feedback         has been used to address the limitations of learning policies directly from human feedback 3   by inferring reward functions from either task success    or real-valued reward labels  . Learning policies directly from human feedback is time inefficient for the human as near constant supervision is frequently assumed. Inferring reward functions from task success feedback requires examples of task success, which can be difficult to acquire in complex and multi-step task domains. Finally, people are not able to reliably provide real-valued reward labels. Preference-based RL was extended to deep RL domains in  then made more efficient and improved in  and 2. To reduce the feedback complexity of preference-based RL, Lee et al.  sped up policy learning via (1) intrinsically-motivated exploration and (2) relabelling the experience replay buffer. These two techniques aimed to improve both the sample complexity of the policy, and the trajectories generated by the policy, which are then used to seek feedback. Park et al. 2 reduced feedback complexity by incorporating augmentations and pseudo-labelling into the reward model learning. Additionally, preference-learning has also been incorporated into data-driven skill extraction and execution in the absence of a known reward function . Encoding Environment Dynamics. Prior work has demonstrated the benefits of encoding environment dynamics in the state-action representation of a policy 5 [ref]32 [ref]33. We instead encode environment dynamics in the reward function which, as far as we are aware, has not been done before. It is nonetheless common for dynamics models to predict both the next state and the environment’s reward [ref]32 which suggests it is important to imbue the reward function with some understanding of the dynamics. The primary self-supervised approach to learning a dynamics model is to predict the latent next state 5 [ref]32  . Indeed, the current state-of-the-art in data efficient RL 5 [ref]33 for encoding dynamics via latent next-state predictions uses a self-predictive representation (SPR) 5 task, an approach we follow in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: in the absence of a known reward function .
