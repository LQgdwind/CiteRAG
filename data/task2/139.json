Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

After that, we apply DGCNN [ref]34 - the state-of-the-art method for point cloud classification and segmentation - to extract hierarchical point-wise features, which are able to encode both local and global intrinsic geometry information of an input patch. The hierarchical feature learning module extracts features from low- to high-levels. Intuitively speaking, as the receptive fields increase, skip-connection [ref]41, , , a widely-used technique in 2D vision task for improving the feature quality and the convergence speed, can help preserve details in all levels. To this end, as illustrated in Fig. 3(c), instead of concatenating the obtained features directly, we perform feature re-calibration by a self-gating unit ,  to enhance them, which is computationally efficient.
