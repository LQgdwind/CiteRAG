      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Global Diversity and Local Context for Video Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the proposed SUM-DCA with several state-of-the-art methods including both supervised and unsupervised approaches in terms of three settings described in Table I. For SumMe and TVSum, we compare our SUM-DCA with supervised approaches including Bi-LSTM [ref]1, DPP-LSTM [ref]1, SUM-GANsup , DR-DSNsup [ref]3, SUM-FCN , HSA-RNN , VASNet , CSNetsup , HMT , M-AVS , SUM-GDA , and MHANet [ref]7, while the unsupervised methods include SUM-GAN, DR-DSN, CSNet, Cycle-SUM , UnpairedVSN , and SumGraph . Especially, these compared methods can be categorized in three aspects, i.e., RNN-based methods, GAN-based methods, and attention-based methods. Table II summarizes the experimental results of different supervised approaches. We can find that our model achieves the best performance on the SumMe data set in all three settings, while obtaining the best generalization performance in terms of Transfer setting on both data sets. In particular, our method yields a better performance at least by 6.1% higher than the RNN-based method (i.e., Bi-LSTM [ref]1, DPP-LSTM [ref]1, DR-DSNsup [ref]3, HSA-RNN , and CSNetunsup ) on SumMe under canonical setting and 9.0% under the augmented setting. This is because the RNN-based methods fail to model the long-term dependency, thus cannot capture the long-term context information for effectively summarizing the video. Besides, we can observe that SUM-DCA outperforms the attention-based methods (i.e., M-AVS , VASNet , HMT , SUM-GDA , and HMANet [ref]7) by a large margin due to the proper choice of the pairwise similarity measurement ùê¨‚Äã(‚ãÖ,‚ãÖ)ùê¨‚ãÖ‚ãÖ\\mathbf{s}(\\cdot,\\cdot). We demonstrate attention mechanism is crucial for modeling the global information of the video in terms of summarization. For example, M-AVS  utilizes the encoder-decoder structure to model the additive attention for measuring the similarity, and VASNet  adopts the pure self-attention mechanism for encoding the global similarity information. These approaches, however, solely model the similarity among video frames resulting in the discriminative video features. SUM-GDA  models the global dissimilarities of the video frames instead of the similarity, and achieves a relative gain of 3.1 % on SumMe with the canonical setting. Our proposed SUM-DCA not only yields the diversified frame features but also captures the local context among several frames, therefore leading to the higher performance than SUM-GDA in all aspects. Table III presents the the experimental results of unsupervised methods. It can be observed that our method is able to achieve the comparable performance among competing unsupervised approaches. Typically, compared to the GAN-based methods (i.e., SUM-GAN , Cycle-SUM , and UnpairedVSN ), our pure attention model achieves a relative gain of 2.9% on SumMe data set and 1.6% on TVSum with the canonical setting. In addition, we also notice that the difference of performance over three settings on TVSum is relatively smaller among all of the methods than on SumMe. This might be due to the fact that SumMe is more challenging and adopts the highest F-score among several users which shows more targeted when doing evaluation, while TVSum adopts the average F-scores among several users, and the users are not likely to make the consistent agreement. Moreover, we evaluate the summarization performance by the rank-based evaluation, which compute the correlation between the predict probabilities and the annotated importance scores by human. Two rank-based metrics are employed in this paper, i.e.Kendall‚Äôs œÑùúè\\tau and Spearman‚Äôs œÅùúå\\rho. The results are summarized in the Table IV. As we can observe in the table, the performance of random selection and human annotation are the lowest and the highest respectively. In particular, our SUM-DCA surpasses other state-of-the-art method by a significant margin. Besides, with the help of annotation, the SUM-DCA performs better than SUM-DCAunsup in terms of both œÑùúè\\tau and œÅùúå\\rho. Overall, the results in Table IV indicate the advantages of the proposed SUM-DCA with the following aspects: 1) The proposed global diverse attention mechanism can capture the global dependencies among frames while model the diversified frame representation. 2) The local contextual attention is able to integrate the local information over consecutive frames, which is useful for avoiding the duplication during summary generation.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: including both supervised and unsupervised approaches in terms of three settings described in Table I.
