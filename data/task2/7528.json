      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting Neural Representations for Videos with a Conditional Decoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplicit neural representations (INRs) are gaining widespread interest for their remarkable capability in accurately representing diverse multimedia signals, including audios  , images  , and 3D scenes   . They typically use a compactly parameterized neural network to learn an implicit continuous mapping that translates coordinates into target outputs (e.g., RGB values, density). This new-fashioned neural representation has opened up a plethora of potential applications, ranging from data inpainting    and signal compression    to advanced generative models  . Given their simplicity, compactness and efficiency, several studies have suggested applying INRs to video compression. Unlike traditional   and recent neural     video codecs that rely on a complex predictive coding paradigm with separate encoder and decoder components, NeRV  pioneers in representing videos as a function of the frame index tùë°t and formulating video compression as model-based overfitting and compression. This innovative method significantly simplifies the encoding and decoding processes. Built on this paradigm, a series of subsequent works 9  [ref]7 1 7 have devoted to designing more meaningful embeddings to improve the quality of video reconstruction. However, there are several vital limitations hindering the potential of existing implicit video representations. Firstly, when decoding the tùë°t-th frame, the identity information in most works only relies on the tùë°t-th temporal embedding. This approach often struggles to align the intermediate features with the target frame. Although a few works 9  1 introduce the AdaIN 3 module to modulate intermediate features, this couples normalization and conditional affine transform. Its normalization operation might reduce the over-fitting capability of the neural network, resulting in limited performance gains (See Table¬†8). Secondly, while there are several studies 9 7 [ref]7 in refining NeRV‚Äôs upsampling block for a more streamlined convolutional framework, the impact of activation layers on the model‚Äôs representational ability remains under-explored.\nMoreover, most previous methods rely on the L2 loss [ref]7 1 or a combination of L1 and SSIM losses  9  7 to overfit videos, but they often fail to preserve high-frequency information (e.g., edges and fine details within each frame), thereby degrading the reconstruction quality (See Table¬†8). Finally, most video INRs follow NeRV to employ a three-step model compression pipeline (i.e., pruning, quantization, and entropy coding) in the video compression task. Nevertheless, these components are optimized separately, which prevents INRs from achieving optimal coding efficiency. Although a few works 1  have explored the joint optimization of quantization and entropy coding, they face critical challenges arising from inconsistencies in the entropy models employed during both training and inference stages, leading to sub-optimal rate-distortion (RD) performance (See Table¬†1 and Fig.¬†8). Hence, we argue that there is great potential to boost the performance by overcoming the challenges we mentioned above. To this end, we propose a universal boosting framework based on a conditional decoder to deeply explore the representation performances of existing video INRs.\nFirstly, we introduce a temporal-aware affine transform (TAT) module that discards normalization to better align intermediate features with the target frame. It is achieved by using a pair of affine parameters (ùú∏,ùú∑)ùú∏ùú∑(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) derived from temporal embeddings. We further incorporate a residual block with two TAT layers to facilitate both feature alignment and information retention. By strategically alternating upsampling blocks and TAT residual blocks, our conditional decoder significantly boosts the model‚Äôs representation capabilities.\nSecondly, as shown in Fig.¬†4, we find that the GELU layer in the NeRV-like block activates only a limited number of feature maps. To address this issue, we introduce a sinusoidal NeRV-like (SNeRV) block to replace the GELU layer with a SINE layer to generate more diverse features. By using a small kernel size in the SNeRV block and placing more SNeRV blocks in later upsampling stages, we achieve a more balanced parameter distribution across the network, which helps improve the model‚Äôs capacity.\nMoreover, we integrate L1, MS-SSIM, and frequency domain losses as our optimization objectives during overfitting a video. This trio of loss functions promises to preserve intricate details in the reconstructed videos.\nFinally, we advocate a consistent entropy minimization (CEM) technique based on a network-free Gaussian entropy model with tiny metadata transmission overhead, which not only ensures the consistency of training and inference, but also captures the interrelationships between elements in each weight or embedding to accurately estimate the probability distribution. In summary, our main contributions are three-fold:\n(1) We develop a universal boosting framework based on a novel temporal-aware conditional decoder to effectively improve the representation capabilities and accelerate the convergence speed compared to existing video INRs, shown in Fig.¬†1.\n(2) We further design a consistent entropy minimization scheme based on a parameter-efficient Gaussian entropy model to eliminate the discrepancy between training and inference.\n(3) Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our boosted video INRs achieves a remarkable performance improvement against various baselines on multiple tasks, including video regression, compression, inpainting and interpolation. Comprehensive ablations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: compression as model-based overfitting and compression.
