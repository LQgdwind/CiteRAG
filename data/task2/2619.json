      "content": "Paper Title: An Ensemble Approach for Annotating Source Code Identifiers with Part-of-speech Tags\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nButler’s work   extends their previous work on Java class identifiers  to show that flawed method identifiers are also associated with low-quality code according to static analysis-based metrics. Caprile and Tonella  analyze the syntax and semantics of function identifiers. They create classes which can be used to understand the behavior of a function; grouping function identifiers by leveraging the words within them to understand some of the semantics of those identifiers. They also use the classes identified in this prior work to propose methods for restructuring program identifiers . Fry and Shepherd   study verb-direct objects to link verbs to the natural-language-representation of the entity they act upon in order to assist in locating action-oriented concerns. Butler  studied class identifier names and lexical inheritance; analyzing the effect that interfaces or inheritance has on the name of a given class. For example, a class may inherit from a super class or implement a particular interface. Sometimes this class will incorporate words from the interface name or inherited class in its name. His study builds on work by Singer and Kirkham , who identified a grammar pattern for class names of (adjective)* (noun)+ and studies how class names correlate with micro patterns. Butler also studied Java field, argument, and variable naming structures . Among other results, they identify noun phrases as the most common pattern for field, argument, and variable names. Verb phrases are the second most common. Høst and Østvold study method names as part of a line of work discussed in Høst’s disseration . This line of work starts by analyzing a corpus of Java method implementations to establish the meanings of verbs in method names based on method behavior, which they measure using a set of attributes which they define . They automatically create a lexicon of verbs that are commonly used by developers and a way to compare verbs in this lexicon by analyzing their program semantics. They build on this work in  by using full method names which they refer to as phrases and augment their semantic model by considering a richer set of attributes. They extend this use of phrases by presenting an approach to debug method names . In this work, they designed automated naming rules using method signature elements. They use the phrase refinement from their prior paper, which takes a sequence of part-of-speech tags (i.e., phrases) and concretes them by substituting real words. (e.g., the phrase <<verb>>-<<adjective>> might refine to is-empty). They connect these patterns to different method behaviors and use this to determine when a method’s name and implementation do not match. They consider this a naming bug. Finally, in , Høst and Østvold analyzed how ambiguous verbs in method names makes comprehension of Java programs more difficult. They proposed a way to detect when two or more verbs are synonymous. Binkley et al. [ref]38 study grammar patterns for attribute names in classes. They come up with four rules for how to write attribute names: 1) Non-boolean field names should not contain a present tense verb, 2) field names should never only be a verb, 3) field names should never only be an adjective, and 4) boolean field names should contain a third person form of the verb “to be” or the auxiliary verb “should”. Our work is complementary to the research above in that our improved tagger can be used to increase the quality of tools and techniques they present.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Høst and Østvold analyzed how ambiguous verbs in method names makes comprehension of Java programs more difficult.
