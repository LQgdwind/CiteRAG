In practice, graphs with hundreds of vertices can be solved with\ntraditional branch-and-bound\nmethods [ref]7   . However,\nuntil recently, even for medium-sized synthetic instances, the maximum\nweight independent set problem remained largely infeasible. In stark\ncontrast, the unweighted variants can be quickly solved on large real-world instances—even with millions of\nvertices—in practice, by using\nkernelization   \nor the branch-and-reduce paradigm .\nKernelization iteratively applies reduction rules, thereby\nreducing the size of the input graph until an irreducible graph is\nobtained. This irreducible graph is usually called a kernel if it has\nsize bounded by a function of a specified input\nparameter.\nA solution is then calculated on this irreducible graph and extended\nto a solution of the original instance by undoing the reduction rules.\nBranch-and-reduce takes this process to the extreme: reduction rules\nare exhaustively applied before branching in a branch-and-bound\nalgorithm. Branching then changes the remaining instance, opening up\nthe reduction space, allowing further reduction rules to be applied\nbefore the next branching step. For those instances that can’t be\nsolved exactly, high-quality (and often exact) solutions can be found\nby combining kernelization with either local\nsearch   or evolutionary\nalgorithms 4. Recently, Lamm et al. 5 discovered new reduction rules for the weighted problem that, in practice, are often able to calculate very small irreducible graphs on a wide number of instances.\nSurprisingly, the branch-and-reduce algorithm is able to solve a large number of instances up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing (inexact) local search algorithms.\nHowever, the algorithm still fails to compute small reduced graphs on some instances 5.\nThis is mainly due to their very specialized nature that searches the graph for specific subgraphs that can be removed. Unlike narrowly-defined data reduction rules, we engineer new generalized data\nreduction and transformation rules. The transformation rules, in\ncontrast to data reduction rules, can also increase the size of\nthe input. Surprisingly, this can simplify the problem and also open\nup the reduction space to yield even smaller irreducible graphs later\nthroughout the algorithm . More precisely, we engineer practically efficient variants of the stability number data reduction rule (called struction).\nTo the best of our knowledge, these are the first practical\nimplementations of the weighted struction rule that are able to handle a large variety of real-world instances.\nOur algorithm exploits the full potential of the struction rule by also allowing the application of structions that may increase the number of vertices.\nThese new rules are integrated in the state-of-the-art branch-and-reduce algorithm by Lamm et al. 5 – with and without the property that a data transformation rule can increase the size of the input.\nExtensive experiments indicate that our algorithm calculates significantly smaller irreducible graphs than current state-of-the-art approach and, preprocessing with our transformations enables branch-and-reduce to solve many instances that were previously infeasible to solve to optimality.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: of the maximum weight independent set (MWIS) problem is to compute a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices I⊆V𝐼𝑉I\\subseteq V, whose total weight is maximum.\nThe problem is 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{NP}-hard [ref]17, and has a wide-range of practical applications in areas such as map labeling  , coding theory  , combinatorial auctions , alignment of biological networks , workload scheduling for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
