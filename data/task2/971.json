DeepLabV3+ achieves high and robust performance with atrous spatial\npyramid pooling for multiscale feature maps and\nencoder-decoder modules for deep features with\ndifferent output strides.\nIt is widely used as a network backbone for semantic segmentation due to these\nwell-studied modules evaluated by empirical experiments.\nResNeSt [ref]54 replaces ResNet with multiscale scores using softmax-based feature map attention and achieves the new state-of-the-art.\nThe loss function for semantic segmentation is the standard\ncross-entropy loss of predicted logits and ground truth labelling.\nReaders can refer  [ref]54 for more details. Superpixel with FCN [ref]52 is the current state-of-the-art superpixel network.\nThe core idea is to construct a distance-based loss function with\naggregations of neighbouring pixel and superpixel properties and\nlocations.\nThis is similar to the SLIC method , where the property\nvectors can be CIELAB colors or one-hot semantic encoding.\nThe loss function for superpixel network with FCN [ref]52\nis in Eq. (1). Given an image with Npsubscript𝑁𝑝N_{p} pixels and Nssubscript𝑁𝑠N_{s} superpixels,\nwe denote the subsets of pixels as\n𝒫={𝒫0,…,𝒫Ns−1}𝒫subscript𝒫0…subscript𝒫subscript𝑁𝑠1\\mathcal{P}=\\{\\mathcal{P}_{0},...,\\mathcal{P}_{N_{s}-1}\\}, where\n𝒫isubscript𝒫𝑖\\mathcal{P}_{i} is a subset of pixels belonging to superpixel i𝑖i.\nWith pixel property 𝐟∈ℝNp×K𝐟superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑝𝐾\\mathbf{f}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{p}\\times K}\n(K𝐾K features for each pixel)\nand probability map 𝐪∈ℝNs×Np𝐪superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑠subscript𝑁𝑝\\mathbf{q}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{s}\\times N_{p}},\nthe loss function is with where m𝑚m is a weight balancing the effects of property and coordinates\non loss, D𝐷D is a superpixel sampling interval in proportion to superpixel\nsize, 𝐜​(i)=[xi,yi]T𝐜𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑇\\mathbf{c}(i)=[x_{i},y_{i}]^{T} for all i∈{1,…,Np}𝑖1…subscript𝑁𝑝i\\in\\{1,...,N_{p}\\} are\npixel coordinates, E​(⋅,⋅)𝐸⋅⋅E(\\cdot,\\cdot) is a distance measure function\ninvolving l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} norm or cross-entropy, qs​(p)∈𝐪subscript𝑞𝑠𝑝𝐪q_{s}(p)\\in\\mathbf{q} is the\nprobability of pixel p𝑝p belonging to superpixel s𝑠s, and 𝒩psubscript𝒩𝑝\\mathcal{N}_{p}\nis a set of superpixels surrounding pixel p𝑝p.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
