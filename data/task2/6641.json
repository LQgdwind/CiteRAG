      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Forecasting with Coherent Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere, we compare our method with coherent probabilistic forecasting baselines. We consider the two coherent, end-to-end trainable methods in¬†Rangapuram et¬†al.  and Olivares et¬†al. .\nFor completeness, we also consider an ARIMA-based model with reconciliation implemented in [ref]36 . From our perspective, the first method of¬†Rangapuram et¬†al.  is ‚Äútoo general.‚Äù It consists of a neural network model¬† which produces probabilistic forecasts for all time-series in the hierarchy. This method is in fact more general than hierarchical forecasting, since it is designed to enforce any convex constraint satisfied by the forecasts; due to the constraining operation in the method, it has to revise the optimized forecasts. It does not leverage specifics of the hierarchical constraints, which are more structured than a general convex constraint.\nThe model predicts parameters of Gaussian distributions for each time-series in the hierarchy, without coupling.\nSince the forecasts are not guaranteed to be hierarchically coherent, the model then couples samples from these Gaussian distributions by projecting them on the space of coherent probabilistic forecasts.\nBoth the sampling operation¬† and the projection are differentiable, allowing the method to be trained end-to-end.\nThis model allows different modeling choices, although they are not explored in the initial paper, since Gaussians can be replaced by any distribution which can be sampled in a differentiable way, i.e., almost any continuous distribution¬† [ref]12 . In¬†Rangapuram et¬†al. , the projection operator ensures coherence, and correlations between base-levels are learned only by optimizing the neural network. In contrast, our proposed method produces forecasts for base-level series only, while relying on common factors to encode correlations. This removes the need to forecast at all levels simultaneously, therefore reducing computational requirements if we are only interested in a subset of the aggregates. On the other hand, the method described in¬†Olivares et¬†al.  is ‚Äútoo restrictive.‚Äù It can only handle learned mixture of Poisson distributions. It is in fact a special case of our model. If we suppose that there is a single non-parametric factor V1subscriptùëâ1V_{1} in our model that follows a multivariate discrete distribution with the supports and weights outputted by the neural network, and that conditioning on the realized value of the factor, the base-level distributions are Poisson (Eqn.¬†13), then we recover the model of Olivares et¬†al. . Our model represents a substantial generalization along both directions: we consider multiple independent factors and arbitrary distributions. Observe that these two methods represent two extremes on the spectrum between non-parametric modeling and parametric modeling.\nIn Rangapuram et¬†al. , we do not have access directly to the distributions of the marginals (i.e., the distribution of each aggregate time-series) since the model outputs samples from Gaussian distributions, and then it couples them with a projection.\nDue to this coupling, the forecasts follow an unknown, non-parametric distribution.\nOn the other hand, in the Olivares et¬†al.  method, we can easily describe the marginals, since they are designed to follow a mixture of Poisson distributions. The same holds true for our proposed method. Another difference between these two approaches is that the model of Rangapuram et¬†al.  optimizes the fit over the marginal time series of interest, under the coherence constraint, while in the model of Olivares et¬†al. , the training objective is likelihood-based, which in general does not directly optimize the evaluation metric of interest.\nIn addition, their objective is fixed regardless of the set of marginal time series being evaluated.\nWe design our method so that we can optimize marginal metrics of interest. Our non-neural network-based baseline ARIMA-MinT-Boot consists of three steps. In the first step, we fit an auto ARIMA model  to each marginal time series. Then, we make the mean forecasts coherent by studying the covariance matrix of forecasted errors Wickramasuriya et¬†al. [ref]50, using ordinary least squares. Lastly, to obtain probabilistic coherent forecasts, we apply a a bootstrap-based method  on the coherent point forecasts.\nAlthough ARIMA-based methods do not show state-of-the-art performance for these datasets , we include it for completeness as an example of a reconciliation method.\nAmong approaches to reconcile point forecasts (such as Wickramasuriya et¬†al. [ref]50, Taieb & Koo , and approaches to extend them to probabilistic forecasts  , we only report results for ARIMA-MinT-Boot as they achieved the best CRPS results across most of hierarchical datasets studied in [ref]36.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: We consider the two coherent, end-to-end trainable methods in¬†Rangapuram et¬†al.  and Olivares et¬†al. .\nFor completeness, we also consider an ARIMA-based model with reconciliation implemented in [ref]36 .
