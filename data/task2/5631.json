However, multimedia content has been shown to be more attention-grabbing and widely disseminated than plain text content .\nFurthermore, the presence of an image can make a false statement more convincing to individuals [ref]4, emphasizing the importance of multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). MMD models, as seen in Fig. 1, are trained to identify whether an image and its accompanying caption in combination are accurate (truthful) or misleading (leading to misinformation).\nThe image at the top of Fig. 1 shows a music festival with littered grounds, while the accompanying caption claims that the event occurred in June 2022, after a speech by environmentalist Greta Thunberg.\nIn reality, even though the image depicts a Glastonbury festival, it was not taken in June 2022 after Greta Thunberg’s speech, but rather in 2015; years before Greta Thunberg became a public figure111https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-glastonbury-greta-idUSL1N2YE1JD.\nThis case involves the manipulation of named entities (person and date) in order to frame a target public figure and her associated audience under a negative spotlight.\nThe bottom image illustrates a railway bridge that collapsed into a body of water with the caption claiming that the event took place in Kursk, Russia during the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war.\nA bridge was indeed damaged that day in Kursk, however, this image was actually taken in 2020 in Murmansk, Russia222https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-destroyed-bridge-idUSL2N2WU1CM.\nThis case illustrates the use of an out-of-context image, either by mistake or with the intention to exaggerate or downplay the severity of the event.\nFrom the above examples, it is evident that multimodal misinformation takes diverse forms, can be disseminated for various motives, and entails subtle cues that are challenging to discern. Researchers have been exploring training deep neural networks for MMD .\nConsidering the data-intensive nature of training deep neural networks for MMD as well as the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation, researchers have been investigating methods for automatically generating synthetic multimodal misinformation, which we refer to as Synthetic Misinformers.\nThese methods include the generation of out-of-context (OOC) image-text pairs or the creation of cross-modal entity inconsistencies (NEI).\nOOC involves\npairing an image with an incongruous caption [ref]6 while NEI involves manipulating the named entities in otherwise truthful captions [ref]7.\nPrevious works have relied on random sampling\n [ref]6 or feature-informed sampling methods  0 for generating OOC and in-cluster random sampling 1 or rule-based random sampling [ref]7 for generating NEI. Examples of generated OOC and NEI misinformation can be seen in Fig. 2. Nevertheless, despite the efforts of previous studies, those have been limited by evaluating their methods on test sets generated by their own Synthetic Misinformers instead of real-world multimodal misinformation,\nthe only exception being the work presenting the COSMOS dataset [ref]6.\nHowever, the authors of the latter work made use of a problematic evaluation protocol that suffers from information leakage, as seen in Fig.3 (See section 3.1.4 for further details).\nAdditionally, prior studies did not compare their methods with other Synthetic Misinformers.\nLack of comparison and evaluation on real-world data hinders the ability of the research community to assess the progress made and determine the current state-of-the-art on MMD.\nTo this end, we replicate multiple Synthetic Misinformers,\nfine-tune our Transformer-based MMD model (termed DT-Transformer) on the generated data and finally compare them on the COSMOS benchmark [ref]6 that encompasses real-world multimodal misinformation.\nIn our comparative study, we examine whether OOC or NEI are more representative of real-world misinformation. Our hypothesis is that - despite prior research treating them as separate tasks - both OOC and NEI are crucial components of effective MMD.\nFor this reason, we also investigate a range of hybrid Synthetic Misinformers. The main contributions of our work can be summarised as follows: We perform the first comparative study on Synthetic Misinformers, which offers a comprehensive evaluation of the current state-of-the-art on MMD and can provide guidance for future research in the field. We introduce “CLIP-based Named Entity Swapping”, which demonstrates the highest multimodal accuracy among other OOC and NEI approaches.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that hybrid Synthetic Misinformers can further enhance detection accuracy. Our findings highlight that although NEI-based may outperform OOC methods, they tend to suffer from a unimodal bias, where text-only models can outperform multimodal ones.\nMoreover, low Sensitivity\nscores\n- or Hit Rate for ‘Falsified’ pairs -\nindicate that the problem is significantly more challenging than previous works suggested.\nWe offer recommendations on how future studies may address these challenges.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: content has been shown to be more attention-grabbing and widely disseminated than plain text content .\nFurthermore, the presence of an image can make a false statement more convincing to individuals [ref]4, emphasizing the importance of multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). MMD models, as seen in Fig. 1, are trained to identify whether an image and its accompanying caption in combination\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
