      "content": "Paper Title: Commands 4 Autonomous Vehicles (C4AV) Workshop Summary\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable 2 compares the models from Section 3.2 and 3.3 on the Talk2Car test set. We compare the models in terms of I​o​U.5𝐼𝑜subscript𝑈.5IoU_{.5}, the number of parameters in millions (M) and inference speed in milliseconds (ms). The state-of-the-art prior to the challenge was the MSRR model [ref]9. Notably, the top-performing models from the challenge [ref]8  [ref]35   show significant gains over the prior state-of-the-art [ref]9 in terms of performance (I​o​U.5𝐼𝑜subscript𝑈.5IoU_{.5}). In particular, the Stacked VLBert model establishes a new state-of-the-art, and outperforms prior work by 10.9%percent10.910.9\\% I​o​U.5𝐼𝑜subscript𝑈.5IoU_{.5}. Furthermore, we find that some of the top-performing models [ref]8 [ref]35 drew a lot of inspiration from the Bi-directional retrieval model . We conclude that when using strong visual and textual feature representations, this simple model can outperform more complex schemes like MAC  and MSRR [ref]9. Extra Test To verify the validity of the predictions on the leader board, we evaluated the models on an additional hidden test set of 100 commands after the challenge (see IoU.5†IoU_{.5}\\dagger in Table 2). None of the submissions experiences a significant performance drop compared to the results on the official test set (see I​o​U.5𝐼𝑜subscript𝑈.5IoU_{.5} vs IoU.5†IoU_{.5}\\dagger). This confirms the validity of the models. The additional test set annotations will be released after the workshop. Resource Analysis Although the challenge focuses on the quality of the predictions, the used amount of computational resources needs careful consideration too. We performed a detailed resource analysis in Table 2. Except for ASSMR , models that improve over MSRR [ref]9 do this at the cost of increasing the model size (parameters). However, we do see improvement in terms of inference speed. The advantage of using a simple bi-directional retrieval approach over a more complex multi-step reasoning process is clearly visible here.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: models in terms of I​o​U.5𝐼𝑜subscript𝑈.5IoU_{.5}, the number of parameters in millions (M) and inference speed in milliseconds (ms). The state-of-the-art prior to the challenge was the MSRR model [ref]9. Notably, the top-performing models from the challenge [ref]8  [ref]35   show significant gains over the prior state-of-the-art [ref]9 in terms of performance (I​o​U.5𝐼𝑜subscript𝑈.5IoU_{.5}).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
