      "content": "Paper Title: OSOA: One-Shot Online Adaptation of Deep Generative Models for Lossless Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEntropy Coding\nThe core component underlying any lossless compression algorithm is the entropy coder, which converts between the data symbols and codewords.\nPopular entropy coders include Huffman coding , arithmetic coding (AC) [ref]54 and asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) .\nHuffman coding mainly involves binary trees operations, which is usually more time efficient than AC and ANS but can admit suboptimal codelength for probabilities not being power of 1/2121/2 .\nAs a result, popular codecs adopted by DGM based algorithms are normally based on AC or ANS, e.g.,   .\nThe main difference between AC and ANS is that the former encodes and decodes in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) style while the latter performs in a first-in-last-out (FILO) style [ref]48.\nAll entropy coders require the knowledge of the data symbol alphabet and the associated distribution, in order to conduct compression and decompression.\nIt is worth noting that the distribution used for entropy coding should be discrete and the average codelength is expected to be the entropy of the distribution used for coding.\nRecall that for a discrete distribution with the probabilistic mass function p​(x)𝑝𝑥p(x), the (Shannon) entropy is defined as 𝐄x∼p​[−log⁡p​(x)]subscript𝐄similar-to𝑥𝑝delimited-[]𝑝𝑥\\mathbf{E}_{x\\sim p}[-\\log p(x)].\nMoreover, the optimal average codelength, given by the entropy of the ground truth distribution, is achieved only if the ground truth distribution is used for coding as per Shannon’s source coding theorem .\nSpecifically, compressing data from distribution p​(x)𝑝𝑥p(x) with distribution q​(x)𝑞𝑥q(x) will lead to the expected extra codelength at KL(p(x)||q(x))\\text{KL}(p(x)||q(x)). Coding with Explicit Deep Generative Models\nSince the entropy coders require probability values, implicit DGMs, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs) , cannot be readily used for lossless compression.\nFor explicit DGMs, the learning principle is either maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)   [ref]16: or maximising the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the logarithm evidence log⁡pθ​(x)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑥\\log p_{\\theta}(x)  : where ℒ​(θ,ϕ,x)=𝐄qϕ​(z|x)​[−log⁡qϕ​(z|x)+log⁡pθ​(x|z)​pθ​(z)]ℒ𝜃italic-ϕ𝑥subscript𝐄subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥delimited-[]subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑥𝑧subscript𝑝𝜃𝑧\\mathcal{L}(\\theta,\\phi,x)=\\mathbf{E}_{q_{\\phi}(z|x)}[-\\log q_{\\phi}(z|x)+\\log p_{\\theta}(x|z)p_{\\theta}(z)].\nNote that x𝑥x is a discrete random variable, so p∗​(x)superscript𝑝𝑥p^{*}(x) refers to the probabilistic mass function of the ground truth data distribution. When learning with MLE, one can either directly stipulate a discrete model or stipulate a continuous model with the dequantization technique  .\nIf one stipulates a discrete model, where pθ​(x)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑥p_{\\theta}(x) denotes the probabilistic mass function of the model, the objective function in Eq. 1 delegates the expected codelength when using pθ​(x)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑥p_{\\theta}(x) for entropy coding.\nIf one stipulates a continuous model, one normally dequantizes the discrete data x𝑥x with a continuous noise u𝑢u uniformly distributed on the unit hypercube, and gets the dequantized variable y=x+u𝑦𝑥𝑢y=x+u with distribution p∗​(y)superscript𝑝𝑦p^{*}(y).\nAfter fitting the probabilistic density function pθ​(y)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑦p_{\\theta}(y) of the model to the the probability density p∗​(y)superscript𝑝𝑦p^{*}(y) of the dequantized distribution, one needs to discretise pθ​(y)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑦p_{\\theta}(y) and use the discretised distribution for entropy coding.\nIn this case, the MLE objective 𝐄y∼p∗​(y)​[−log⁡pθ​(y)]subscript𝐄similar-to𝑦superscript𝑝𝑦delimited-[]subscript𝑝𝜃𝑦\\mathbf{E}_{y\\sim p^{*}(y)}[-\\log p_{\\theta}(y)] delegates an upper bound of the expected codelength .\nFor how to design sophisticated dequantization schemes or how to design discrete deep generative models, we refer the readers to [ref]16     . When learning with ELBO, one usually stipulates discrete models for x𝑥x, i.e., pθ​(x|z)subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑥𝑧p_{\\theta}(x|z) is a probabilistic mass function, and continuous models for z𝑧z, i.e., qϕ​(z|x)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥q_{\\phi}(z|x) and pθ​(z)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑧p_{\\theta}(z) are probabilistic density functions.\nFurthermore, one usually does not have direct access to the close form of pθ​(x)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑥p_{\\theta}(x) but the generative components pθ​(x|z)subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑥𝑧p_{\\theta}(x|z) and pθ​(z)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑧p_{\\theta}(z).\nTo use pθ​(x|z)subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑥𝑧p_{\\theta}(x|z) and pθ​(z)subscript𝑝𝜃𝑧p_{\\theta}(z) for efficient coding, a technique called bits-back   is employed, which additionally involves the approximate posterior distribution qϕ​(z|x)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥q_{\\phi}(z|x) learned together with the generative components [ref]48  .\nIn these cases, the discretisation precision of the latent variable will not effect the average codelength, delegated by the objective in Eq 2, with consistent discretisation adopted for the latent distributions [ref]48.\nIt is worth noting that, since bits-back works more compatibly with ANS, bits-back ANS  is usually the first choice for models learned with the ELBO functional.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: underlying any lossless compression algorithm is the entropy coder, which converts between the data symbols and codewords.\nPopular entropy coders include Huffman coding , arithmetic coding (AC) [ref]54 and asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) .\nHuffman coding mainly involves binary trees operations, which is usually more time efficient than AC and ANS but can admit suboptimal codelength for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
