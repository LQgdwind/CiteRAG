      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Task Text Classification using Graph Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Low Resource Language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText classification is a well-studied problem in the field of NLP, which has important applications like sentiment analysis (SA)  [ref]5, emotion identification (EI)  , hate-speech detection (HS) [ref]8 , and sarcasm detection (SAR) [ref]10 . Understanding the contextual and semantic representation of text is one of the main challenges in text classification. Also, the traditional methods represent text with hand-crafted features, including structural and part-of-speech (POS) tagging features, and depend on the availability of rich resources. With the recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of text corpora for the English, neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  and Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)  has been used for efficient text representation.\nThese models can capture semantic, syntactic information and provide a fixed-length vector (latent representation) by taking the sequence of words as input.\nAdditionally, these models have shown great success in the multi-task setting, where shared knowledge helps the model learn more general representation from the input text.\nHowever, the input consecutive word sequences are local to these deep models, but they may ignore global word occurrence. Recently, a new research direction viz. Graph Neural Networks (GNN)  or graph embeddings have attracted wider attention in many NLP tasks such as text classification , neural machine translation , and relational reasoning .\nGNN-based models adopt building a single large graph on the corpus that manages to learn reduced dimension representations and preserve the graph’s global structural information, even with limited labeled data.\nWith the recently proposed method, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is used to generalize (convolutional) neural network models to perform text classification in English for a single task .\nHowever, applying a GCN for single or multi-task text classification for resource-poor Indian languages is unexplored. Moreover, adopting a GCN for Indian languages is often limited by data availability.\nHence, creating annotated data for multiple NLP tasks help the researchers to create better models for Telugu. Unlike English, very few preparatory works have studied text classification in Telugu. Unfortunately, all these works were limited to existing baseline models that use either small annotated datasets  or restricted to single task text classification . Also, none of the works focused on learning the low-dimensional word or sentence graph representations from GCNs, which extracts the direct and indirect interactions between words and sentences in the graph embeddings. GCN-based approaches are alluring in this scenario as they perform both graph reconstruction (GAE) and node classification. Inspired by the Graph AutoEncoder (GAE) model  and Multi-Task Text classification , we propose a supervised graph reconstruction method, MT-Text GCN, an end-to-end model that jointly optimizes the reconstruction and multi-task text classification loss.\nFurther, our proposed method simultaneously learns word & sentence representations for word-sentence graph reconstruction and sentence representations for multi-task text classification.\nIn summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: We propose the multi-task learning model (MT-Text GCN) to reconstruct word-sentence graphs while achieving multi-task text classification with learned graph embeddings. TEL-NLP is the largest NLP dataset in Telugu covering four NLP tasks (16,234 samples for SA, HS, SAR, and 9,675 samples for EI), unlike previous works, which focused only on a single task (SA) with a limited dataset of 2500 samples . For the Telugu language, we are the first to generate word embeddings using random walk based models: DeepWalk and Node2Vec, and Graph AutoEncoders (GAE). Our MT-Text GCN enabled better performance on Telugu when compared with multilingual pretrained transformer models on four NLP tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Text classification is a well-studied problem in the field of NLP, which has important applications like sentiment analysis (SA)  [ref]5, emotion identification (EI)  , hate-speech detection (HS) [ref]8 , and sarcasm detection (SAR) [ref]10 .
