      "content": "Paper Title: Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning for LQR Control via Zeroth-Order Block Coordinate Descent\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection, we propose a distributed ZOO algorithm with asynchronous sample and update schemes based on the BCD algorithm (12) and the gradient approximation for each agent i𝑖i. According to (16), we have the following approximation for each agent i𝑖i at step k𝑘k: where uiksuperscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖𝑘u_{i}^{k} is uniformly randomly sampled from 𝕊qi−1subscript𝕊subscript𝑞𝑖1\\mathbb{S}_{q_{i}-1}. In fact, since hi​(x,ξ)subscriptℎ𝑖𝑥𝜉h_{i}(x,\\xi) only involves the agents in 𝒩isubscript𝒩𝑖\\mathcal{N}_{i}, it suffices to maintain the variables of the agents in 𝒩i∖{i}subscript𝒩𝑖𝑖\\mathcal{N}_{i}\\setminus\\{i\\} invariant when estimating the gradient of agent i𝑖i. That is, in our problem, two agents are allowed to update their variables simultaneously if they are not neighbors. This is different from a standard BCD algorithm where only one block of the entire variable is updated in one iteration. To achieve simultaneous update for non-adjacent agents, we decompose the set of agents 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} into s𝑠s independent clusters (s𝑠s has an upper bound depending on the graph), i.e., 𝒱=∪j=1s𝒱j𝒱superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑠subscript𝒱𝑗\\mathcal{V}=\\cup_{j=1}^{s}\\mathcal{V}_{j}, and such that the agents in the same cluster are not adjacent in the interaction graph, i.e., (i1,i2)∉ℰsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑖2ℰ(i_{1},i_{2})\\notin\\mathcal{E} for any i1,i2∈𝒱jsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑖2subscript𝒱𝑗i_{1},i_{2}\\in\\mathcal{V}_{j}, j∈{1,…,s}𝑗1…𝑠j\\in\\{1,...,s\\}. Note that no matter graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is directed or undirected, any two agents have to lie in different clusters if there is a link from one to the other. Without loss of generality, we assume 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is undirected, and let 𝒩isubscript𝒩𝑖\\mathcal{N}_{i} be the neighbor set of agent i𝑖i. In the case when 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is directed, we define 𝒩isubscript𝒩𝑖\\mathcal{N}_{i} as the set of agents j𝑗j such that (i,j)∈ℰ𝑖𝑗ℰ(i,j)\\in\\mathcal{E} or (j,i)∈ℰ𝑗𝑖ℰ(j,i)\\in\\mathcal{E}. A simple algorithm for achieving such a clustering is shown in Algorithm 1. Note that the number of clusters obtained by implementing Algorithm 1 may be different each time. In practical applications, Algorithm 1 can be modified to solve for a clustering with maximum or minimum number of clusters. Input: 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V}, 𝒩isubscript𝒩𝑖\\mathcal{N}_{i} for i=1,…,N𝑖1…𝑁i=1,...,N.\nOutput: s𝑠s, 𝒱jsubscript𝒱𝑗\\mathcal{V}_{j}, j=1,…,s𝑗1…𝑠j=1,...,s. Set s=0𝑠0s=0, 𝒞=∅𝒞\\mathcal{C}=\\varnothing. while 𝒞≠𝒱𝒞𝒱\\mathcal{C}\\neq\\mathcal{V} Set s←s+1←𝑠𝑠1s\\leftarrow s+1, 𝒟=𝒞𝒟𝒞\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{C}, while 𝒟≠𝒱𝒟𝒱\\mathcal{D}\\neq\\mathcal{V} Randomly select i𝑖i from 𝒱∖𝒟𝒱𝒟\\mathcal{V}\\setminus\\mathcal{D}, set 𝒱s←𝒱s∪{i}←subscript𝒱𝑠subscript𝒱𝑠𝑖\\mathcal{V}_{s}\\leftarrow\\mathcal{V}_{s}\\cup\\{i\\}, 𝒟←𝒟∪𝒩i←𝒟𝒟subscript𝒩𝑖\\mathcal{D}\\leftarrow\\mathcal{D}\\cup\\mathcal{N}_{i}. end 𝒞←𝒞∪𝒱s←𝒞𝒞subscript𝒱𝑠\\mathcal{C}\\leftarrow\\mathcal{C}\\cup\\mathcal{V}_{s}. end Algorithm 1 requires the global graph information as an input, thus is centralized. Nonetheless, Algorithm 1 is only implemented in one shot, and there is no real-time global information required during its implementation. Therefore, Algorithm 1 can be viewed as an off-line centralized deployment before implementing the distributed policy seeking algorithm. Based on the clustering obtained by Algorithm 1, we propose Algorithm 2 as the asynchronous distributed zeroth-order algorithm. Algorithm 2 can be viewed as a distributed RL algorithm where different clusters take actions asynchronously, different agents in one cluster take actions simultaneously and independently. In Algorithm 2, step 5 can be viewed as policy evaluation for agent i𝑖i, while step 6 corresponds to policy iteration. Moreover, the local observation hi​(x^ik+ri​uik,x−ik,ξk)subscriptℎ𝑖superscriptsubscript^𝑥𝑖𝑘subscript𝑟𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑘superscript𝜉𝑘h_{i}(\\hat{x}_{i}^{k}+r_{i}u_{i}^{k},x_{-i}^{k},\\xi^{k}) can be viewed as the reward returned by the environment to agent i𝑖i. Input: Step-size η𝜂\\eta, smoothing radius risubscript𝑟𝑖r_{i} and variable dimension qisubscript𝑞𝑖q_{i}, i=1,…,N𝑖1…𝑁i=1,...,N, clusters 𝒱jsubscript𝒱𝑗\\mathcal{V}_{j}, j=1,…,s𝑗1…𝑠j=1,...,s, iteration number T𝑇T, update order zksubscript𝑧𝑘z_{k} (the index of the cluster to be updated at step k𝑘k) and extrapolation weight wiksuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑖𝑘w_{i}^{k}, k=0,…,T−1𝑘0…𝑇1k=0,...,T-1, initial point x0∈𝒳superscript𝑥0𝒳x^{0}\\in\\mathcal{X}.\nOutput: x​(T)𝑥𝑇x(T). for k=0,1,…,T−1𝑘01…𝑇1k=0,1,...,T-1 do Sample ξk∼𝒟similar-tosuperscript𝜉𝑘𝒟\\xi^{k}\\sim\\mathcal{D}. for all i∈𝒱𝑖𝒱i\\in\\mathcal{V} do if i∈𝒱zk𝑖subscript𝒱subscript𝑧𝑘i\\in\\mathcal{V}_{z_{k}} do (Simultaneous Implementation) Agent i𝑖i computes x^iksuperscriptsubscript^𝑥𝑖𝑘\\hat{x}_{i}^{k} by (13), samples uiksuperscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖𝑘u_{i}^{k} randomly from 𝕊qi−1subscript𝕊subscript𝑞𝑖1\\mathbb{S}_{q_{i}-1} and observes hi​(x^ik+ri​uik,x−ik,ξk)subscriptℎ𝑖superscriptsubscript^𝑥𝑖𝑘subscript𝑟𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑘superscript𝜉𝑘h_{i}(\\hat{x}_{i}^{k}+r_{i}u_{i}^{k},x_{-i}^{k},\\xi^{k}).

Then updates its policy: else end end end In the literature, BCD algorithms have been studied with different update orders such as deterministically cyclic   and randomly shuffled  . In this paper, we adopt an “essentially cluster cyclic update” scheme, which includes the standard cyclic update as a special case, and is a variant of the essentially cyclic update scheme in  [ref]24, see the following assumption. (Essentially Cluster Cyclic Update)\nGiven integer T0≥ssubscript𝑇0𝑠T_{0}\\geq s, for any cluster j∈{1,…,s}𝑗1…𝑠j\\in\\{1,...,s\\} and any two steps k1subscript𝑘1k_{1} and k2subscript𝑘2k_{2} such that k2−k1=T0−1subscript𝑘2subscript𝑘1subscript𝑇01k_{2}-k_{1}=T_{0}-1, there exists k0∈[k1,k2]subscript𝑘0subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2k_{0}\\in[k_{1},k_{2}] such that zk0=jsubscript𝑧subscript𝑘0𝑗z_{k_{0}}=j. Assumption 3 implies that each cluster of agents update their states at least once during every consecutive T0subscript𝑇0T_{0} steps. When |𝒱i|=1subscript𝒱𝑖1|\\mathcal{V}_{i}|=1 for i=1,…,s𝑖1…𝑠i=1,...,s, and s=N𝑠𝑁s=N, Assumption 3 implies an essentially cyclic update in  [ref]24. To better understand Algorithm 2, let us look at a multi-agent coordination example. Suppose that the global function to be minimized is (11) with ℰ={(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)}ℰ122334\\mathcal{E}=\\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)\\} being the edge set. Then the local cost function for each agent is: where ξi​jsubscript𝜉𝑖𝑗\\xi_{ij} is a bounded zero-mean noise. By implementing Algorithm 1, the two clusters obtained are 𝒱1={1,3}subscript𝒱113\\mathcal{V}_{1}=\\{1,3\\} and 𝒱2={2,4}subscript𝒱224\\mathcal{V}_{2}=\\{2,4\\}. By implementing Algorithm 2 with two clusters updating alternatively, the diagram for two consecutive iterations is shown in Fig. 1, where agents in 𝒱1subscript𝒱1\\mathcal{V}_{1} and 𝒱2subscript𝒱2\\mathcal{V}_{2} take their actions successively. In multi-agent coordination, F​(xi,xj,ξi​j)𝐹subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝜉𝑖𝑗F(x_{i},x_{j},\\xi_{ij}) can be set as (‖xi−xj+ξi​j‖2−di​j2)2superscriptsuperscriptnormsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝜉𝑖𝑗2superscriptsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗22(\\|x_{i}-x_{j}+\\xi_{ij}\\|^{2}-d_{ij}^{2})^{2} for distance-based formation control (di​jsubscript𝑑𝑖𝑗d_{ij} is the desired distance between agents i𝑖i and j𝑗j), and ‖xi−xj+ξi​j−hi​j‖2superscriptnormsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝜉𝑖𝑗subscriptℎ𝑖𝑗2\\|x_{i}-x_{j}+\\xi_{ij}-h_{ij}\\|^{2} for displacement-based formation control (hi​jsubscriptℎ𝑖𝑗h_{ij} is the desired displacement between agents i𝑖i and j𝑗j).\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: .
