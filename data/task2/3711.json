      "content": "Paper Title: BELLATREX: Building Explanations through a LocaLly AccuraTe Rule EXtractor\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs previously mentioned, Bellatrex falls in the category of local, model-specific methods, and in particular, Bellatrex explains the outcomes of a trained random (survival) forest model in a post-hoc fashion.\nSuch family of RF-specific methods has produced a rich literature as shown in  , and can be categorised\nin three sub-categories, namely: size reduction, rule extraction, and local explanation. In this section, we discuss other model-specific approaches that use RFs as the underlying black-box model.\n The earliest example of such is . This work proposed a procedure for analysing a RF in binary classification tasks, and concepts such as tree-metric, a distance metric defined on the space of tree learners, are also introduced.\nTrees are then represented in a two-dimensional space by using Multi Dimensional Scaling  on the tree-distance matrix. The authors then perform a qualitative study and mention the possibility of clustering the resulting tree representations. A more recent work by  followed the path traced by  by suggesting a range of tree similarity metrics and by performing clustering on such tree representations. Furthermore, the authors implicitly propose a vector representation of trees based on the covariates used to build them and it consists of an adaptation of the approach from . Given such representation, the authors clustered and extracted a few trees out of a random forest and illustrate the validity of their framework “C443” on simulated and real world datasets.\nThe resulting method has some features in common with ours, namely, the idea of representing tree- (or rule-) distances for clustering purposes. However, the focus in C443 lays more on giving an overview of the possible approaches rather than optimising the performance of a surrogate model. Furthermore, the C443 method aims at global explanations (e.g. by looking at trends and sources of heterogeneity), rather than focusing at an instance-base level. Later work by  (“iForest”) made use of a tree-distance metric intuition to project tree paths via t-SNE , and made also use of visual analytics to improve interpretability. These visuals include a “feature view” that shows the relationship between a selected covariate and a prediction (similarly to a Partial Dependency plot ) as well as a control panel that just lets the user see the decision paths that lead to the prediction of a group of instances. Unlike Bellatrex, there is no rule extraction or forest approximation mechanism and none of the original learners are shown to the end user. Other relevant approaches include , where the authors presented a method for computing how a covariate within a value range influences the final prediction of a model, while an optimisation-based approach that exploits the bijective relationship between a tree leaf and a subspace of the input space is proposed by [ref]18.\nSimilarly, recent work [ref]19  proposes a method called “LionForest”, where rules are generated in a local approach fashion, and path reduction approaches are run in order to provide shorter rules with more “conclusive” (i.e., stable) explanations. A toolbox named “SIRUS” is proposed in , where a set of rules is extracted from an RF and shown as an explanation.\nMore specifically, rules are first generated by large RF and a pre-selection step picks the most commonly occurring ones. After that, a “post-treatment” step narrows down the selection by eliminating rules associated to a linear combination of other rules of higher frequency. The procedure stops when the desired number of final rules is reached and is then shown to the end user. These final rules serve as an explanation of the original RF and their average prediction can be used as a the prediction of the obtained surrogate model.\nThe resulting explanation is global and consists of a limited number of rules that are stable under different subsets of data, and\nwhose outcome can be averaged to get a prediction.\n More recently, “RuleCOSI+” [ref]22 has been proposed as another global, rule-extraction (according to the categorisation by ) method that greedily combines and simplifies the corresponding base trees.\nMore specifically, the algorithm builds a decision list by iteratively creating new rules by merging or pruning the ones generated by the tree ensemble. At the end of each iteration step, the generated rule is added to the existing list under the condition that it is beneficial to the generalisation performance.\nWhen no extra rules can be added, an empty rule (playing the part of an “else” instance) is appended, and the final model consists of the set of rules found, structured as members of a decision list. That is, for a given instance to be explained, the rules are evaluated in order of appearance until one of them is found to hold and is used as the models’ prediction. If no rules are fired, the final (“empty”) rule is used to make the prediction. Finally, a size-reduction, global approach is represented by “Hierarchical Shrinkage”  (HS) algorithm. The idea is to increase performance and robustness of tree learners by shrinking the predictions of any leaf node towards the predictions of its ancestors. The shrinking operation is performed repeatedly and is controlled by a regularisation parameter. The resulting tree has a size that can be controlled and offers a global explanation to the model. It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned RF-specific, post-hoc explainability methods follow a global approach and therefore show the same explanation regardless of the input instance. Bellatrex, on the other side, follows a local approach that adapts its explanations to the instance of interest. This leads to an increased flexibility of the output explanation and allows Bellatrex to closely follow the predictions of the underlying RF.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: range influences the final prediction of a model, while an optimisation-based approach that exploits the bijective relationship between a tree leaf and a subspace of the input space is proposed by [ref]18.\nSimilarly, recent work [ref]19  proposes a method called “LionForest”, where rules are generated in a local approach fashion, and path reduction approaches are run in order to provide\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
