      "content": "Paper Title: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: The Strange Case of Off-Policy Policy Updates\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nC4 defines the necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic convergence to optimality. However, we will see in Section 4.2 that in difficult planning tasks, C4 can be insufficient for convergence to happen in a reasonable amount of time. Below, we therefore introduce C4-s, a condition stronger444C4-s is identical to C5, but applied to the full state space 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} (it thus implies C5). than C4, as well as two techniques for C4-s to be verified: C4-s. ∀s∈𝒮,limT→∞1T​∑t=0Tηt​dt​(s)≥d⊥​(s)>0.formulae-sequencefor-all𝑠𝒮subscript→𝑇1𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑡0𝑇subscript𝜂𝑡subscript𝑑𝑡𝑠subscript𝑑bottom𝑠0\\forall s\\in\\mathcal{S},\\quad\\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\eta_{t}d_{t}(s)\\geq d_{\\mathrel{\\scalebox{0.5}{$\\bot$}}}(s)>0. The first technique to enforce C4-s is to apply the approximate expected policy update 7  : The expected policy update is deterministic in the sense that it does not require sampling actions. As there exists a deterministic optimal policy, this in turn implies that the learning rate ηtsubscript𝜂𝑡\\eta_{t} does not need to satisfy the second Robbins-Monro condition: ∑tηt2<∞subscript𝑡superscriptsubscript𝜂𝑡2\\sum_{t}\\eta_{t}^{2}<\\infty, and thus may be constant ηt≐ηapproaches-limitsubscript𝜂𝑡𝜂\\eta_{t}\\doteq\\eta. The second technique to enforce C4-s is to ensure that the density of updates dtsubscript𝑑𝑡d_{t} does not decay to 0 for any state s𝑠s. This can be obtained by maintaining a constant proportion otsubscript𝑜𝑡o_{t} of off-policy actor updates in order to cover the whole state space. We propose to do so by recording two replay buffers: one with on-policy samples, i.e. samples collected with an exploitation policy, and another with off-policy samples, i.e. samples collected with an exploration policy. To the best of our knowledge, this type of prioritized experience replay has never been used in this fashion, nor to this effect. We note that off-policy policy gradient is a concept that exists in the literature, but it refers to the application of policy gradients from batch samples [ref]20. Following the success of DQN , experience replays have also been used in actor-critic methods  which bears some resemblance to our suggestion. Finally, off-policy actor-critic with shared prioritized experience replay 2 has been applied to large-scale experiments with distributed agents  . Many RL algorithms (actor-critic or purely value-based) ensure some form of exploration. They broadly form two groups: dithering exploration (e.g., epsilon greedy, softmax, entropy regularization   ), and deep exploration (e.g., UCB, thompson sampling, density constraints    0). Strong cases have been made against dithering exploration, arguing in particular its inability to ensure visits to all states and therefore convergence to optimality . In spite of these arguments (that we recall in App. A.5), there are still only very few actor-critic algorithms that realize deep exploration  1. We conjecture that this relates to the following observations: i) exploration involves a moving objective, hence a non-stationarity of the desired policy, ii) actor-critic algorithms have a structural inertia in their policy (in contrast to value-based methods that can completely switch policy when an action’s value overtakes another’s). As a consequence, a dual exploration-exploitation actor-critic algorithm takes a lot of time to switch from deep exploration to exploitation, and back, making it inefficient. To avoid this issue, we propose to train two policies, a pure exploration one and a pure exploitation one. As an added benefit, they will be used to constitute the on-policy and off-policy replay buffers introduced in the second technique above.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: used in this fashion, nor to this effect.
