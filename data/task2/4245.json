Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: How Many Events Do You Need? Event-based Visual Place Recognition Using Sparse But Varying Pixels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provide comparisons to several baseline methods: Firstly, the sum-of-absolute-differences of event counts when using all pixels (similar to [ref]34 but without using patch normalization). For fair comparison, we use the same temporal binning as in our method (Eqs. 1 and 2). Secondly, we compare to two versions of our previous method, Ensemble-Event-VPR [ref]6, that relies on the reconstruction of conventional images  and extracting NetVLAD features  from these reconstructed images. In one version, we use an ensemble that combines temporal window sizes of varying length, and in another we use a more computationally efficient method that uses a single temporal window size of 30ms to reconstruct the images. We note that the reconstructed images are of lower spatial resolution (346x260 pixels) and quality (see [ref]6) compared to conventional images taken with e.g. a smartphone camera, which impacts NetVLAD’s performance. Finally, we compare to Event-VPR by Kong et al. We note that Event-VPR  is unfairly disadvantaged as it does not use sequences. However,  has shown that it performs similar to Ensemble-Event-VPR [ref]6, and thus the performance of [ref]6 (where sequence matching is used for fair comparisons) can be used as a proxy for . and EventVLAD by Lee and Kim  (see Section II-C for a description of these methods).\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: We provide comparisons to several baseline methods: Firstly, the sum-of-absolute-differences of event counts when using all pixels (similar to [ref]34 but without using patch normalization). For fair comparison, we use the same temporal binning as in our method (Eqs. 1 and 2).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
