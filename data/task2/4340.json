      "content": "Paper Title: Revealing Unfair Models by Mining Interpretable Evidence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeployment of unfair machine learning models in the society, if unchecked, can lead to significant discrimination against certain groups of subjects    .\nFor example, a particular group of prisoners may get discriminated by an AI-assisted justice system to receive unfair judgements . A group of consumers may be discriminated by not allowing them to avail some premium services based on their communities and neighborhoods . Many fair machine learning methods [ref]7   0 1 focus on training fair models, however, there has been little control on the fairness of models trained by third-parties .\nTherefore, before deploying a trained model, it is crucial to reveal and explain potential unfairness of the model. How can we reveal and explain the unfairness of a trained model on a given data distribution? Existing model explanation methods 2 cannot reveal and explain the unfairness of a trained model, because they focus on answering the questions of why and how a machine learning model makes a prediction, but they ignore the fairness of the prediction. We attempt to tackle this challenging task by borrowing the principled idea of statistical hypothesis testing 3. Specifically, we assume that the model is fair and then try to reject the assumption by finding the most extreme evidence in data to demonstrate the unfairness of the model. Intuitively, the most extreme evidence in data is the group of data instances that are discriminated the most by the model.\nA group of data instances is said to be discriminated if an instance in the group has a much lower probability of getting a favorable prediction, such as mortgage approval and college entrance admission, than the other data instances not contained in the group 4. To explain why a group of data instances gets discriminated by the model, it is also important to identify the set of key attributes that characterizes the group and distinguishes the instances in the group from the rest of the data instances..\n\nFor example, to demonstrate that a correctional offender management system is unfair, one can find solid evidence in data, such as the group of African-American with dark skin and are younger than 25 who are subject to a much higher false negative rate on releasing decisions than the other suspects 5.\nThe key attribute values “African-American” and “dark skin” explain why the group of suspects is discriminated by the system. Following the above intuition, we propose a novel data mining task named Revealing Unfair Models by mining Interpretable Evidence (RUMIE), which aims to reveal and explain potential unfairness of a trained model by finding the most discriminated group of instances and the corresponding key attributes. RUMIE is a challenging task for multiple reasons.\nFirst, the discriminated group of data instances is often characterized by multiple key attributes. Thus, the time cost of searching the discriminated group and the key attributes grows exponentially with respect to the number of attributes. Continuous attributes make this task further challenging as there may exist huge number of unique assignments for such attributes.\nSecond, it is challenging to interpret the discriminated group and key attributes to an end user without machine learning background, because the user may not understand how and why the key attributes characterize the discriminated group. In this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we propose the novel task of RUMIE. The goal is to find a discriminated group of instances that is most discriminated by a trained model. We also aim to interpret why the group of instances is discriminated by finding a small set of key attributes that characterizes the discriminated group of instances and distinguishes them from the other data instances that are not discriminated. Second, we propose an effective algorithm to efficiently find the most discriminated group of data instances. While the scalability of brute-force searching methods is significantly limited by the exponential number of combinations of attributes, our method achieves outstanding efficiency by formulating a continuous numerical optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by a well designed method. Third, to explain to the users how the key attributes characterize the discriminated group,\nwe use the key attributes to construct a decision tree that separates the discriminated group from the other data instances. Then, we derive human-understandable rules from the decision tree to explain how the key attributes distinguish the discriminated group from the other data instances.\nAs shown in extensive case studies, the key attributes and the decision tree provides clear interpretation on why the group of instances are discriminated.\n Last, we report extensive experiments on many real-world data sets to demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: unfair judgements .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
