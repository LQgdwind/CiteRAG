      "content": "Paper Title: Space-time unfitted finite element methods for time-dependent problems on moving domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNumerical simulations using standard finite element methods require the generation of body-fitted meshes, which is one of the main bottlenecks of the simulation workflow. This problem is exacerbated in applications that involve moving interfaces and evolving geometries. The method of lines, which discretises in space and time separately, cannot be readily applied to transient problems with moving domains or interfaces since it assumes a constant geometry in time. In order to solve this problem, one can consider  arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) schemes  . ALE schemes require frequent remeshing and are not suitable for large geometrical variations or topological changes. Another approach is to use variational space-time formulations on space-time body-fitted meshes. These methods have been widely used in applications like fluid-structure interaction 3 [ref]10 . Even though variational space-time schemes can be applied to moving domains/interfaces, they do require space-time meshes, which are unfeasible in general. The mathematical analysis of space-time methods has been considered, e.g., in  (for a  discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method in time for parabolic equations on body-fitted domains and constant geometries) and in  (for a space-time DG method for advection-diffusion on time-dependent domains). Unfitted (also known as immersed or embedded)  finite element (FE) formulations lower the geometrical requirements since they do not require body-fitted meshes but simple, e.g., Cartesian, background meshes. Hence, unfitted FEM are becoming increasingly popular in applications with moving interfaces such as fluid-structure interactions   , fracture mechanics  , and in applications with changing geometries such as additive manufacturing   and stochastic geometry problems . In , a mass transport problem across an evolving interface is analysed using a variational space-time DG extended finite element method (XFEM). However, unfitted FEMs are prone to ill-conditioning problems when dealing with unfitted boundaries and high contrast interface problems 5 [ref]3 . If the intersection of a cut background cell with the physical domain is small, it can lead to a so-called small cut cell problem. The support of the FE shape functions corresponding to the background cell can have an arbitrarily small support, leading to almost singular system matrices. Several methods      have been proposed to circumvent the small cut cell problem. However, only few formulations are robust and optimal with respect to the cut cell position. Some methods include additional terms that enhance the stability of the FE discretisation while keeping optimal convergence (see, e.g., the ghost penalty  formulation used in CutFEM   ). Another approach, used in this work, involves cell aggregation (or agglomeration) techniques. These techniques can readily be applied to numerical methods that can handle general polytopal meshes, e.g., DG or hybridisable methods (see, e.g.,  7  ). Cell aggregation for ùíû0superscriptùíû0\\mathcal{C}^{0} FE spaces has been proposed in [ref]3, where it was coined  aggregated finite element method (AgFEM). In AgFEM, the degrees of freedom associated to FE functions that have arbitrarily small support and can lead to ill-conditioning are eliminated. This is attained by designing a discrete extension operator that constrains the ill-posed DOFs using the well-posed DOFs while preserving ùíû0superscriptùíû0\\mathcal{C}^{0} continuity. AgFEM enjoys good numerical properties, such as stability, bounded condition numbers, optimal convergence and continuity with respect to data; detailed mathematical analysis of this method is included in [ref]3 for elliptic problems, in  for the Stokes equation and in  for higher-order FEs. The method is also amenable to arbitrarily complex 3D geometries , distributed implementations for large scale problems , error-driven h‚Ñéh-adaptivity and parallel tree-based meshes , explicit time-stepping for the wave equation  and elliptic interface problems with high contrast 0. A weak AgFEM technique is proposed in , which is much less sensitive to stabilisation parameters than the ghost penalty method. Despite the potential of unfitted FEMs for transient problems with moving boundaries and interfaces, few formulations are robust and enjoy optimal convergence. The space-time DG XFEM scheme proposed in  is not robust to the cut location and the error estimate is suboptimal with respect to time. The main reason for the suboptimal error estimates is the fact that the FE space cannot be expressed as a slab-wise tensor product in space-time. The CutFEM formulation in  makes use of space-time quadratures to approximate moving domains for transient convection-diffusion problems.\nRobust and optimally convergent space-time DG formulations are presented in  9 4, in which the robustness of these methods are due to additional stabilisation terms in the weak formulation. Space-time CutFEM on overlapping meshes with optimal convergence are explored in  . The novelties of this work are the following: We propose a novel unfitted variational space-time formulation on moving domains/interfaces that is robust with respect to the small cut cell problem. Robustness is attained by extending AgFEM to space-time. The spatial discretisation can handle both continuous (nodal) and discontinuous FE spaces, while a DG space is used in time. We carry out a detailed mathematical analysis proving that this method enjoys sought-after numerical properties such as well-posedness, stability, bounded condition numbers and optimal convergence. In addition, we provide implementation details and perform a set of numerical experiments that support the theoretical results. In particular, we consider a slab-wise cell aggregation scheme and a space-time discrete extension operator that can be expressed as a space-time tensor product. This way, the  aggregated finite element (AgFE) space is constant at each time slab, and we can prove optimal error bounds. The outline of this work is as follows. First, we introduce the embedded geometry setup, the aggregation strategy and construct the AgFE spaces in Section¬†2. In Section¬†3, the proposed space-time AgFEM discretisation is introduced for a model problem. We perform the numerical analysis of the method in Section¬†4 and numerical experiments that support these results are presented in Section¬†5. Finally, we draw some conclusions in Section¬†6.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: changes.
