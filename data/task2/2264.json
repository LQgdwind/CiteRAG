      "content": "Paper Title: Convolutional Sparse Coding Fast Approximation with Application to Seismic Reflectivity Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn sparse coding, we attempt to decompose an observation signal 𝐲∈ℝN×1𝐲superscriptℝ𝑁1\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times 1} into its building blocks (atoms) . Namely, the sparse representations model  assumes a signal 𝐲∈ℝN×1𝐲superscriptℝ𝑁1\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times 1} that can be formulated as a sparse superposition of atoms. Mathematically speaking, we assume the observation signal 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} obeys where 𝐃∈ℝN×M𝐃superscriptℝ𝑁𝑀\\mathbf{D}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times M} is a matrix called the dictionary, that consists of the atoms 𝐝i∈ℝN×1,i=1,…,Mformulae-sequencesubscript𝐝𝑖superscriptℝ𝑁1𝑖1…𝑀\\mathbf{d}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times 1},\\ i=1,...,M, as its columns, and\n𝐱∈ℝM×1𝐱superscriptℝ𝑀1\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M\\times 1} is the sparse vector of the atoms weights.\nGenerally, we do not impose any relation between N𝑁N and M𝑀M. That is, the dictionary could either be complete (N=M𝑁𝑀N=M), over-complete (N<M𝑁𝑀N<M) or under-complete (N>M𝑁𝑀N>M). Over the years, great efforts have been invested in finding sparse solutions to (1). Breaking down a signal into its building blocks has become a popular task in many fields related to signal processing, such as: image processing , computer vision , compressed sensing , radar [ref]5, ultrasound imaging , seismology   , visual neurosciense 0 1, and more. Moreover, from a certain perspective, neural networks can be viewed as an unfolding of an iterative sparse coding solver 2. In a sense, deep neural nets (DNNs) are trained to seek the atoms weights, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 3, that are trained to find a set of filters tailored to perform a classification or a regression task at hand. However, in many real-time applications, such as pattern recognition, sparse coding is still a bottleneck in terms of inference time. Most often, a sparse code is required for every image patch.\nConsequently, many attempts have been made to pursue faster methods for sparse coding. The Iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) 4 is one of the most popular algorithms for sparse coding. Despite its simplicity, ISTA is considered as a slow algorithm. Over time, faster extensions have been suggested, such as, Fast-ISTA (FISTA) 5, Learned-ISTA (LISTA)6 and Ada-LISTA 7. LISTA 6, for example, uses a learned substitute dictionary, and ada-LISTA 7 incorporates an adaptive threshold, where the first threshold corresponds to the maximal feature weight in the data. Then, the thresholds are gradually decreasing at each iteration.\nSince the seminal idea of LISTA - to unroll the iterative algorithm into feed-forward layers - was first proposed, many similar sparse coding model-based deep learning methods have been proposed, such as: ADMM with CNN 8, ADMM-CSNet 9, and FISTA-Net 0. These methods are designed to provide accurate and fast reconstruction compared with other deep learning methods. Inspired by the classic iterative thresholding algorithms, in this work, we propose a fast alternative algorithm that produces a good approximation of a convolutional sparse code. Most solvers are slowed down by the use of one global threshold (bias) to detect each local feature shift along the signal, or a predetermined constant local threshold. This way, even if the signal (or the input batch) is normalized, when we apply a threshold at each iteration, if the threshold is too high, weak expressions are annihilated, and strong expressions can “cast a shadow” over low-energy regions in the signal, which can be interpreted as false-positive support locations. On the other hand, if the threshold is very small, as often is the case in ISTA, many iterations are required to compensate for false detections in early iterations, especially in the presence of noise, and in real-time applications due to model perturbations. Alternatively, we propose to normalize each data point by a locally focused data energy measure, before applying a threshold. In other words, each receptive field of the data is scaled with respect to the local energy. This way even when the data is inherently unbalanced, we can still use a common bias for all receptive fields, without requiring many iterations that are usually required in order to globally detect the features support. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined dictionary and global fixed bias terms for each iteration, or with a learned dictionary and learned bias terms. In practice, the trained version is implemented as a small recurrent CNN that corresponds to a few unfolded iterations of the proposed method. An approximate solution is produced within only 2-5 iterations, that is, to our knowledge, the state of the art performance in terms of speed and computational complexity versus accuracy error. We further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution to seismic inversion, via experimental results with real data and synthetic data, demonstrating that even if the mutual coherence of the dictionary is relatively high, the first iteration of the method accurately detects at least 70%percent\\% of the features weights. The following few iterations make the required corrections. We performed extensive synthetic data and real data numerical experiments, in order to verify the robustness of the method in noisy and attenuating environment. We also prove that under sufficient separation and sufficiently low mutual coherence the first iteration of our method is guaranteed to perfectly recover the true support. Furthermore, in our opinion, the proposed predictor can be potentially included in learning systems in many applications, such as, recognition systems and biomedical-imaging super-resolution. The main contribution of this work is a highly efficient method for fast convolutional sparse coding approximation. We also propose a learning-based (data driven) variation of the proposed method. The performance is demonstrated via extensive numerical experiments conducted with seismic real data as well as with synthetic data.\nFurthermore, we prove that the proposed method achieves a reliable solution under sufficient separation or low mutual coherence. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the necessary background for sparse representations, convolutional sparse coding and iterative thresholding algorithms. Section III describes the seismic inversion problem.\nIn Section IV, we present the proposed method and its theoretical guarantees.\nSections V-VI introduce synthetic and real data experimental results.\nSection VII proposes a learned version of the proposed algorithm, and demonstrates its employment experimentally. Finally, Section VIII concludes and discusses future research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: (1).
