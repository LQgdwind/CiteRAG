      "content": "Paper Title: RESEARCH PROPOSAL Toward a traceable, explainable, and fair JD/Resume recommendation system\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is ample detail in the job description to identify major roles and important tasks as they occur today. They are not dependent on any particular qualities of an incumbent (such as experience, expertise, ability, efficiency, commitment, loyalty, years of service, or degree) . They provide the details required to identify the job, not the employee. Personal Requirements The job descriptions issued by recruitment agencies or companies possess a certain format which is based on the primary and secondary level of important information. As mentioned earlier, some companies are more intended towards getting technical and qualification information rather than personal details    [ref]12  [ref]106    . Depending upon the vacancy available and suitable gender quota, gender information is considered to be important in job description analysis by studies undertaken in existing literature.   9      . The required age for the suitable job is also significant to find a specific job  5       . Some of the studies have also included civil status   9  4 , military status  and needed ability [ref]12    as personal requirements features. Location of the job placement should be known for the candidate thus it is added frequently by the researchers     1   . Educational Requirements This section lists the required level of job knowledge (such as education, experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities) required to do the job. This section focuses on the “minimum” level of qualifications for an individual to be productive and successful in this role. In a job description, it is essential to identify the educational qualifications that an employee must possess to satisfactorily perform the job duties and responsibilities.  Thus, the educational qualifications must be stated well in terms of areas of study and/or type of degree or concentration that would provide the knowledge required for entry into this position. Educational requirements features such as degree names and grades have a primary significance in job recommendation systems and all studies have added this feature in job description analytic algorithms except a few that are more into technical skills      . The academic awards, i.e. scholarships and awards, are also considered for the distinctive recruitment of employees     9  . Offered Position The purpose of job descriptions is to make candidates understand the nature of their responsibilities depending upon their skills, ability and qualification. The job description must offer a suitable position for the candidates considering these requirements. Thus, various studies have distributed this feature into sub-categories for a better match result and improved the algorithm’s performance . All studies involving job description analysis include offered positions and industry types for which jobs are available   5 7   8   1        9   [ref]12                [ref]106      3  . The offered salary is mentioned in job descriptions depending on the experience and skills a candidate brings to the position. 7  8  1   0 9  [ref]12         2    . Depending upon the seniority of job and responsibilities, years of experience define the candidates’ suitability, and this is why all the studies have included it as job feature except the ones that are considering the university datasets or fresh graduates.  7  8        9  . Companies have certain workplaces for their employees, such as to work in a team or individually. It is important to highlight that some studies considered the candidate working experience in a team or individually as a feature, called as teamwork skills  [ref]12     [ref]106    and work length 5 8  1     as requirements for the candidates. Technical Job Requirements\nA list of the technical roles and obligations allocated to the job is given in this section; the basic tasks are also referred to job requirements. The job requires sufficient knowledge of the subject area to address both unique and normal work challenges, to be able to comment on technological concerns, and to act as a guide for those within the organization on the subject.  Thus, it is important to list particular abilities and/or skills needed for the performance of the candidate in this position, including the designation of any required licenses. Analytical, budget exposure, internal or external contact, machine, innovative thinking, customer service, decision-making, variety, critical thinking, multi-tasking, collaboration, problem-solving, project management, oversight, coordination, are some considerations: In job description analysis, the technical required information such as technical information 1      , technical categories       , and specific field experience          are necessary. Thus, these features are found to be essential for job resume matching algorithms. Furthermore, all these jobs and personal features are divided among certain matching and recommendation frameworks to differentiate among job recommendation, matching, content-based analysis, and resume analytics.\nOne to one job description and resume matching are used in the majority of the studies       9   6 . Apart from developing a matching model of both resume and job description matching, some researchers are more interested in only one of these, i.e., job recommendation.   1  0 . These recommendation systems adopt certain algorithms by combining position description and resume information. These algorithms are content base analysis    , ontology based    and text base classification   .\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: primary and secondary level of important information. As mentioned earlier, some companies are more intended towards getting technical and qualification information rather than personal details    [ref]12  [ref]106    . Depending upon the vacancy available and suitable gender quota, gender information is considered to be important in job description analysis by studies undertaken in existing\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
