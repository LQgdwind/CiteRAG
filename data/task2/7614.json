      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Adversarial Frontier: Quantifying Robustness via Adversarial Hypervolume\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe increasing emphasis on evaluating the inherent robustness of deep learning (DL) models and developing more robust DL systems constitutes a pivotal area of research within the machine learning (ML) community [ref]1    .\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by growing security concerns associated with adversarial attacks on deep neural network-based (DNN) image classification systems. These attacks introduce imperceptible perturbations to input images, which are typically indistinguishable from the human eye, leading to incorrect classifications by the DNN model  [ref]7 .\nThe potential implications of such vulnerabilities are particularly alarming in contexts critical to security, such as face recognition  and autonomous driving , where the consequences of misclassification could be severe.\nNonetheless, efforts to construct adversarially robust models face substantial challenges, particularly the absence of a comprehensive evaluation framework for rigorously evaluating the robustness of DL models. Conventionally, adversarial accuracy has been the principal metric for robustness evaluation, measuring a model’s resilience to adversarial examples generated through a range of attack strategies [ref]7 [ref]11 .\nThe emergence of increasingly sophisticated attacks, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [ref]7, DeepFool , Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) [ref]1, and Auto Projected Gradient Descent (APGD) , has led to an expansion of benchmark adversarial accuracies. Despite this, the field lacks a unified robustness metric due to the differing adversarial accuracy results across various attacks.\nNotably, the integration of APGD  and Square Attack  within AutoAttack  has established a widely recognized benchmark for adversarial accuracy assessment.\nThe development of standard toolkits like RobustBench  has also substantially advanced the uniform comparison of adversarial defense capabilities across different defensive models, positioning the adversarial accuracy of the models under AutoAttack as the gold standard. Recent research has challenged the adequacy of adversarial accuracy as the robustness metric for DL models, demonstrating that it fails to capture the full scope of a model’s resilience against attacks [ref]11  .\nRobey et al.  have proposed the probability of misclassification as a more comprehensive measure of robustness, calculated through random sampling, although they acknowledge the computational challenges posed by the complexity of high-dimensional spaces.\nOliver et al.  have explored non-adversarial spaces using geometric methods, assessing the extent of these regions within the sample space as an indicator of robustness.\nDespite these contributions, one can argue that neither misclassification probability nor adversarial region size sufficiently represent a model’s robustness, as they fail to consider the variation in a model’s response to varying levels of perturbation intensities. To address the shortcomings of existing robustness metrics, which focus solely on model robustness at a fixed perturbation level, we introduce a new metric called adversarial hypervolume.\nThis metric evaluates DL model robustness by examining the normalized confidence scores of worst-case adversarial examples across various levels of perturbation intensities.\nIt facilitates meaningful comparisons between defensive models with comparable adversarial accuracy and evaluation of the incremental robustness improvements provided by weaker defensive measures like Feature Squeezing and JPEG compression .\nA higher adversarial hypervolume metric value indicates improved model robustness throughout various perturbation intensities, thereby offering a more comprehensive assessment of a model’s resilience against adversarial attacks.\nWe illustrate a conceptual comparison between our proposed metric and two existing metrics in Figure 1. Our metric, adversarial hypervolume, is based on the concept of hypervolume 0 from the multi-objective optimization literature 1 2 3.\nWe begin by constructing a multi-objective optimization problem that mirrors the complexity of actual attack scenarios, with the dual aims of minimizing the perturbation’s magnitude and simultaneously reducing the model’s confidence in the original classification.\nIn contrast, much of existing research approaches the problem from the perspective of single-objective optimization with a distance constraint [ref]7 [ref]1 or employs a weighted sum of multiple objectives [ref]11.\nWe subsequently delineate a set of adversarial examples that illustrate the model’s unique vulnerability landscape when subjected to an attack. Each example signifies a nadir of confidence corresponding to a particular magnitude of perturbation, thereby delineating the adversarial frontier.\nThis concept is inspired by the Pareto optimality principle 1.\nUltimately, we quantify a model’s robustness by calculating the adversarial hypervolume, which measures the size of the region demarcated by the adversarial frontier. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We introduce a novel metric, the adversarial hypervolume, which quantifies the robustness of DL models against a range of perturbation intensities, thus offering a comprehensive evaluation of a model’s resilience to adversarial attacks. Employing this metric, we propose a straightforward method for its computation and adopt an efficient training algorithm to enhance the robustness of DL models. Our empirical findings reveal that the adversarial hypervolume effectively measures the enhancement of robustness from weaker defensive mechanisms (i.e., input transformations) and delivers important supplementary insights, such as average confidence variation, which serve as valuable adjuncts to adversarial accuracy. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we have assessed the robustness of cutting-edge state-of-the-art (SOTA) defensive models, thereby setting a benchmark for future studies.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: emphasis on evaluating the inherent robustness of deep learning (DL) models and developing more robust DL systems constitutes a pivotal area of research within the machine learning (ML) community [ref]1    .\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by growing security concerns associated with adversarial attacks on deep neural network-based (DNN) image classification systems.
