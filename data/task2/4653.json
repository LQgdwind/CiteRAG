      "content": "Paper Title: Manifold Free Riemannian Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work combines Riemannian optimization and MMLS, and more generally methods for manifold learning which are similar to MMLS (in the sense of Assumption 18). Here, we briefly summarize the most relevant\nprior work on each of these subjects. Riemannian optimization is a framework aimed at solving problems of the form of Problem¬†(1.1). There exists an extensive literature on Riemannian optimization, starting from the early works in  [ref]35 , and more recently the surveys  . In particular, in this work we focus on optimization problems where there is limited information both on the constraining manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} and possibly on the cost function as well, i.e., accessed only via samples. Most works in the field of Riemannian optimization related to zeroth-order optimization are generalizations of unconstrained zeroth-order optimization methods, i.e., the manifold is explicitly available but the cost function is accessed only via samples, see for example 7     . Unlike the aforementioned works, our main contribution is in tackling problems where the constraining manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} and its geometric components cannot be explicitly formed, forcing their approximation via samples of ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}. To the best of our knowledge our work is the first which tackles such case, with the aim of applying the framework of Riemannian optimization. Manifold learning is a thoroughly studied problem, with widespread applications. The goal of manifold learning is to find an embedding of high dimensional data in a low dimensional space, where it is assumed that the data resides in an underlying low dimensional manifold. Some well-known algorithms include: Isomap [ref]39, Local Linear Embedding  , Laplacian Eigenmaps , Diffusion maps , and tùë°t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding . Unlike the aforementioned methods which aim at finding a global embedding of the data, in this paper we utilize MMLS algorithm  which provides local approximation of the manifold in the ambient space. This property is important in our proposed algorithm since it allows the approximation of local geometrical structure of the underlying manifold such as the tangent spaces. MMLS method is a generalization of 5, where surfaces approximation using moving least-squares (MLS) was presented. MMLS was extended to approximation of functions over manifolds . Also, the properties of the differential of the approximation were studied in . An extension to MMLS was presented in , where full analysis of the method was performed under noisy data assumption. Other works close in spirit to MMLS, i.e., form a local coordinate system over which some regression over some unknown underlying manifold is solved locally, are  [ref]13 8, where regression problems under manifold constraints are solved in a finite ambient dimension  [ref]13, and in an infinite ambient dimension 8. Another recent work is , which aims at preprocessing noisy data via a denoising process before forming a local coordinates system, over which a local Gaussian process regression is performed to approximate the manifold.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Riemannian optimization is a framework aimed at solving problems of the form of Problem¬†(1.1).
