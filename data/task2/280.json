      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Manifold Defense Against Multiple Adversarial Perturbations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral defense models have been proposed to improve the robustness of DNN classifiers against adversarial perturbations.\nAmong the existing defense frameworks, adversarial training provides the best empirical robustness against adversarial attacks.\nMadry et al. (2018)  achieve ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty}-robustness by training the classifier using expensive ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty}-bounded PGD adversaries.\nThis framework can be generalized to any perturbation type, and the interpretable loss-gradients indicated that the classifiers do not cause gradient masking .\nRecent works such as TRADES , LLR  propose additional loss regularizer for adversarial training models.\nShafahi et al. (2019)  propose a ‚Äòfree‚Äô-adversarial training to improve the training efficiency by unfolding the PGD-adversary generation step.\nHowever, Tram√®r and Boneh (2019) [ref]8 demonstrates that it would require the generation of adversarial examples for different perturbation types to achieve robustness for multiple-perturbation, leading to a linear increase in the training time.\nTheir findings have also raised concerns that adversarial training may not be the appropriate direction to improve the adversarial robustness for multiple perturbations [ref]8[ref]13. Input transformation techniques such as feature squeezing , pixel-deflection  have been proposed to heuristically alter the pixels in images.\nHowever, these techniques did not induce the correct amount of alteration and thus, could not improve the robustness .\nXie et al. (2018) [ref]22 achieve ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty}-robustness by incorporating adversarial training with their denoising network.\nIn contrast, randomized smoothing defenses induce the correct amount of noise to achieve certified robustness .\nHowever, their success is limited to minor-‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2}-perturbations. Image quilting  is another type of input transformation technique.\nIt replaces the original input patches using the clean patches, selected from a large set of 50,0005000050,000 clean patches.\nThis defense has been broken by the adaptive BPDA attack .\nUnlike the quilting technique, we reconstruct patches using a combination of patch samples, randomly drawn from a much smaller set of our RBF filters, that also inject noises to the images.\nInstead of using pre-trained weights for the CNN classifiers like , we train our model by incorporating the reconstruction layer and achieve a robust classifier for any minor ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1} perturbations. Our proposed defense can be categorized under manifold defense strategy where generative models are applied to project the input or the hidden activations onto the (learned) data manifold.\nExamples include DefenseGAN  using generative adversarial networks , Ape-GAN  using auto-embedding GAN , defense using Variational Autoencoder (VAE) , PixelDefend .\n[ref]13 train multiple VAEs for each class and chose the class with maximum-likelihood score as their prediction.\nSimilar ideas using non-generative models include auto-encoders to project the input images into the ‚Äòknown‚Äô data manifold  [ref]22.\nHowever, all these defenses, except [ref]13, are found to be ineffective . The key reason why these defenses fail is that they rely on their generative model(s) to completely remove adversarial perturbations.\nThis would require the generator to completely capture the underlying data manifold.\nHowever, due to the limited capacities of the existing generative (or non-generative) models, they fail to efficiently capture the complete data manifold and often over-estimate or under-estimate different modes of the underlying distribution.\nFurther, the classifier used to classify these projected images, often remain adversarially vulnerable as before.\nHence, these models are either broken or fail to scale to complex image domains.\nHere, we address these limitations by using an RBF layer\nto capture the density of smaller input image patches.\nOur reconstruction process allows us to train classifiers that\nis robust against any minor ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1}-perturbations and remain effective on a more complex image dataset such as CIFAR-10. The most recent work Croce and Hein (2020)  design a regularization scheme to provide robustness for small networks for all ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1} perturbations.\nHowever, their success remains limited for much smaller perturbation boundaries and at the cost of much reduced clean data classification accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: training models.\nShafahi et al. (2019)  propose a ‚Äòfree‚Äô-adversarial training to improve the training efficiency by unfolding the PGD-adversary generation step.\nHowever, Tram√®r and Boneh (2019) [ref]8 demonstrates that it would require the generation of adversarial examples for different perturbation types to achieve robustness for multiple-perturbation, leading to a linear increase in the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
