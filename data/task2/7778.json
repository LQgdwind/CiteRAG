We already know that there are two complete interpretations of TopKAT defined as follows: with a complete language model 𝒢K⊤,Bsubscript𝒢subscript𝐾top𝐵\\mathcal{G}_{K_{\\top},B},\nand a complete model consisting of relations 𝐈𝐦⁡(h)𝐈𝐦ℎ\\operatorname{\\mathbf{Im}}(h). The operations in these models can be recovered by computing these maps.\nFor example, the multiplication operation in the language TopKAT can be computed as follows: Since r𝑟r does not change the multiplication operation,\nthe multiplication in the language TopKAT is the same as in language KAT.\nIn fact, as r𝑟r does not change any operation in KAT,\nmost operations in language TopKAT are the same as language KAT.\nThus, we only need to compute the top element in language TopKAT. The top element in language TopKAT can be computed in the same fashion: i.e. the top element is just the complete language. The language TopKAT inherits all the operations in language KAT,\nexcept the top element, which is defined as the full language.\nAnd such models are complete with G∘r𝐺𝑟G\\circ r as a complete interpretation. In the same way, we know that complete models consisting of relations (a.k.a. general relational TopKAT)\nwill have the same operations as relational KATs.\nHowever, in this case the characterization of the computed top: h∘G∘r​(⊤)ℎ𝐺𝑟toph\\circ G\\circ r(\\top)\nis not as simple as the full language,\nbut we know it is the largest relation in the range of h∘G∘rℎ𝐺𝑟h\\circ G\\circ r: The general relational TopKAT inherits all the operations in relational KAT,\nexcept the top element is the largest relation.\nAnd such models are complete with h∘G∘rℎ𝐺𝑟h\\circ G\\circ r as a complete interpretation. Finally, to investigate whether we can use general relational TopKAT\nto encode incorrectness logic,\nwe will provide a short proof that general relational TopKATs\nare as expressive as relational KATs [ref]41;\nthat is, every property on relations that can be encoded using general relational TopKAT,\nis already encodable in the relational KAT.\nHence, adding a top element does not give extra expressive power in general relational TopKAT. The original proof [41, Lemma 2]\nencodes every TopKAT term using a KAT term,\nand then uses two pages to prove the soundness of this encoding.\nHere we show the aforementioned encoding is simply the reduction r𝑟r. Given two terms t1,t2∈𝖳𝗈𝗉𝖪𝖠𝖳subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2𝖳𝗈𝗉𝖪𝖠𝖳t_{1},t_{2}\\in\\mathsf{TopKAT}, and n primitives p1,p2,…,pn∈K+Bsubscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑛𝐾𝐵p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{n}\\in K+B,\nwe say that an n-ary predicate P𝑃P is expressible by\nequation t1=t2subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2t_{1}=t_{2} for a class of TopKATs 𝖪𝖪\\mathsf{K}\nwhen for all interpretations I𝐼I into TopKATs in 𝖪𝖪\\mathsf{K},\nthe following equivalence holds: Given an alphabet K,B𝐾𝐵K,B, an n-ary predicate P𝑃P on relations,\nthe predicate P𝑃P over primitives p1,p2,…,pn∈Ksubscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2…subscript𝑝𝑛𝐾p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{n}\\in K is expressible in\ngeneral relational TopKAT if and only if it is expressible in relational KAT. A predicate expressible in relational KAT is also expressible\nin general relational TopKAT using the same pair of terms,\nwe only need to show the converse.\nAssume a predicate P𝑃P is expressible in general relational TopKAT,\nthen there exists two TopKAT terms t1,t2∈𝖳𝗈𝗉𝖪𝖠𝖳K,Bsubscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2subscript𝖳𝗈𝗉𝖪𝖠𝖳𝐾𝐵t_{1},t_{2}\\in\\mathsf{TopKAT}_{K,B} s.t.\nfor all general relational TopKAT interpretations I⊤subscript𝐼topI_{\\top}: We take an arbitrary relational KAT interpretation I𝐼I from 𝖪𝖠𝖳K⊤,Bsubscript𝖪𝖠𝖳subscript𝐾top𝐵\\mathsf{KAT}_{K_{\\top},B}.\nNotice 𝐈𝐦⁡(I)𝐈𝐦𝐼\\operatorname{\\mathbf{Im}}(I), the range of I𝐼I,\nis a relational KAT with the largest element I​((∑K)∗)𝐼superscript𝐾I((\\sum K)^{*}),\ni.e. 𝐈𝐦⁡(I)𝐈𝐦𝐼\\operatorname{\\mathbf{Im}}(I) is a general relational TopKAT.\nBecause I𝐼I is a KAT interpretation,\nit preserves all the KAT operations and the largest element.\nHence, I𝐼I is a TopKAT homomorphism from 𝖪𝖠𝖳K⊤,Bsubscript𝖪𝖠𝖳subscript𝐾top𝐵\\mathsf{KAT}_{K_{\\top},B} to 𝐈𝐦⁡(I)𝐈𝐦𝐼\\operatorname{\\mathbf{Im}}(I). Then we can construct I∘r:𝖳𝗈𝗉𝖪𝖠𝖳K,B→𝐈𝐦⁡(I):𝐼𝑟→subscript𝖳𝗈𝗉𝖪𝖠𝖳𝐾𝐵𝐈𝐦𝐼I\\circ r:\\mathsf{TopKAT}_{K,B}\\to\\operatorname{\\mathbf{Im}}(I),\na general relational interpretation: Thus the two KAT terms r​(t1),r​(t2)∈𝖪𝖠𝖳K⊤,B𝑟subscript𝑡1𝑟subscript𝑡2subscript𝖪𝖠𝖳subscript𝐾top𝐵r(t_{1}),r(t_{2})\\in\\mathsf{KAT}_{K_{\\top},B} also can express the predicate P𝑃P. Since the image of I𝐼I is not necessarily a relational TopKAT,\nwhere the top element is interpreted as the complete relation,\nthe above trick does not work for relational TopKAT.\nIt is also known that relational TopKAT is strictly more expressive than general relational TopKAT,\nsince relational TopKAT can encode incorrectness logic,\nwhere general relational TopKAT cannot [ref]41.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Designing complete interpretations and models was not always easy.\nIn fact, in previous works ,\nthe authors made a mistake in the definition of language TopKAT,\nwhich was fixed later [ref]41\nby suggestion of Pous et al. .\nHowever, with the results in Section 3.1,\nwe can construct the complete interpretation just by composition,\nand compute the complete model by computing the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
