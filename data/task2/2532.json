      "content": "Paper Title: A Neural Approach for Detecting Morphological Analogies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is a long tradition of works on word representation using statistical methods based on co-occurrence of words to represent them as vectors, that we usually call word embeddings.\nSince early works on embedding spaces [ref]13, it is usually assumed that embeddings represent the semantics of words and that analogies in the vector space can be defined by simple arithmetic operations, either by relying on the parallelogram rule  (see Equation 4) or by using a cosine distance  such as Equation 5\nor 3CosMul ; other similar metrics can be found in . For instance, GloVe or word2vec [ref]13 embeddings are usually able to solve simple analogical equations using the parallelogram rule such as c​a​t→−k​i​t​t​e​n→+d​o​g→≈p​u​p​p​y→→𝑐𝑎𝑡→𝑘𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛→𝑑𝑜𝑔→𝑝𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑦\\vec{cat}-\\vec{kitten}+\\vec{dog}\\approx\\vec{puppy}. However, as mentioned in , those simplistic rules for analogy do not match human performance in all cases.\nAdditionally, some strict properties of formal analogy can contradict human intuition, like uniqueness which is problematic when dealing with (quasi-)synonyms, which should be interchangeable solutions of analogical equations on word semantics.\nHence, it becomes necessary to relax the model of analogy to match human performance on analogies. While Murena et al.  follow a simplicity principle on the transformation between words, Lim et al.  propose to learn an analogy operator directly from analogies as an elegant way to get out of the simplistic models of parallelogram and cosine analogy. They use simple neural networks to learn analogies from a dataset of semantic analogies, and propose different models for classification and regression purposes. Moreover, they rely on the properties of formal analogies mentioned in Section II-A to increase the amount of training data (as described in Section III-C) and to ensure that models fit those properties to a certain degree.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: of works on word representation using statistical methods based on co-occurrence of words to represent them as vectors, that we usually call word embeddings.\nSince early works on embedding spaces [ref]13, it is usually assumed that embeddings represent the semantics of words and that analogies in the vector space can be defined by simple arithmetic operations, either by relying on the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
