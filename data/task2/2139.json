We use outer iteration to refer to the iterating over the N𝑁N environments, and inner iteration to refer to the T𝑇T time steps within an environment. Notations: We use superscripts (e.g., (i)𝑖(i) in xt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖x_{t}^{(i)}) to denote the index of the outer iteration where 1≤i≤N1𝑖𝑁1\\leq i\\leq N, and subscripts (e.g., t𝑡t in xt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖x_{t}^{(i)}) to denote the time index of the inner iteration where 1≤t≤T1𝑡𝑇1\\leq t\\leq T. We use step(i,t𝑖𝑡i,t) to refer to the inner time step t𝑡t at the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\mathrm{th}} outer iteration. ∥⋅∥\\|\\cdot\\| denotes the 2-norm of a vector or the spectral norm of a matrix. ∥⋅∥F\\|\\cdot\\|_{F} denotes the Frobenius norm of a matrix and λmin​(⋅)subscript𝜆⋅\\lambda_{\\min}(\\cdot) denotes the minimum eigenvalue of a real symmetric matrix. vec​(⋅)∈ℝm​nvec⋅superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛\\mathrm{vec}{(\\cdot)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{mn} denotes the vectorization of a m×n𝑚𝑛m\\times n matrix, and ⊗tensor-product\\otimes denotes the Kronecker product. Finally, we use u1:tsubscript𝑢:1𝑡u_{1:t} to denote a sequence {u1,u2,⋯,ut}subscript𝑢1subscript𝑢2⋯subscript𝑢𝑡\\{u_{1},u_{2},\\cdots,u_{t}\\}. We consider a discrete-time nonlinear control-affine system   with environment-dependent uncertainty f​(x,c)𝑓𝑥𝑐f(x,c). The dynamics model at the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\mathrm{th}} outer iteration is: where the state xt(i)∈ℝnsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖superscriptℝ𝑛x_{t}^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, the control ut(i)∈ℝmsuperscriptsubscript𝑢𝑡𝑖superscriptℝ𝑚u_{t}^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}, f0:ℝn→ℝn:subscript𝑓0→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛f_{0}:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{n} is a known nominal dynamics model, B:ℝn→ℝn×m:𝐵→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛𝑚B:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m} is a known state-dependent actuation matrix,\nc(i)⊂ℝhsuperscript𝑐𝑖superscriptℝℎc^{(i)}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{h} is the unknown parameter that indicates an environmental condition, f:ℝn×ℝh→ℝn:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝℎsuperscriptℝ𝑛f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{h}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{n} is the unknown c(i)superscript𝑐𝑖c^{(i)}-dependent dynamics model, and wt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑖w_{t}^{(i)} is disturbance, potentially adversarial. For simplicity we define Bt(i)=B​(xt(i))superscriptsubscript𝐵𝑡𝑖𝐵superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖B_{t}^{(i)}=B(x_{t}^{(i)}) and ft(i)=f​(xt(i),c(i))superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑖𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖superscript𝑐𝑖f_{t}^{(i)}=f(x_{t}^{(i)},c^{(i)}). Interaction protocol.\nWe study the following adaptive nonlinear control problem under N𝑁N unknown environments.\nAt the beginning of outer iteration i𝑖i, the environment first selects c(i)superscript𝑐𝑖c^{(i)} (adaptively and adversarially), which is unknown to the controller, and then the controller makes decision u1:T(i)subscriptsuperscript𝑢𝑖:1𝑇u^{(i)}_{1:T} under unknown dynamics f​(xt(i),c(i))𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖superscript𝑐𝑖f(x_{t}^{(i)},c^{(i)}) and potentially adversarial disturbances wt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑖w_{t}^{(i)}. To summarize: Outer iteration i𝑖i. A policy encounters environment i𝑖i (i∈{1,…,N}𝑖1…𝑁i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}), associated with unobserved variable c(i)superscript𝑐𝑖c^{(i)} (e.g., the wind condition for a flying drone). Run inner loop (Step 2). Inner loop. Policy interacts with environment i𝑖i for T𝑇T time steps, observing xt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖x_{t}^{(i)} and taking action ut(i)superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑡𝑖u_{t}^{(i)}, with state/action dynamics following (1). Policy optionally observes c(i)superscript𝑐𝑖c^{(i)} at the end of the inner loop (used for some variants of the analysis). Increment i=i+1𝑖𝑖1i=i+1 and repeat from Step 1. We use average control error (𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{ACE}) as our performance metric: The average control error (𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{ACE}) of N𝑁N outer iterations (i.e., N𝑁N environments) with each lasting T𝑇T time steps, is defined as 𝖠𝖢𝖤=1T​N​∑i=1N∑t=1T‖xt(i)‖𝖠𝖢𝖤1𝑇𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑡1𝑇normsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖\\mathsf{ACE}=\\frac{1}{TN}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\|x_{t}^{(i)}\\|.\n 𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{ACE} can be viewed as a non-asymptotic generalization of steady-state error in control . We make the following assumptions on the actuation matrix B𝐵B, the nominal dynamics f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}, and disturbance wt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑖w_{t}^{(i)}: We consider fully-actuated systems, i.e., for all x𝑥x, rank​(B​(x))=nrank𝐵𝑥𝑛\\mathrm{rank}(B(x))=n. ‖wt(i)‖≤W,∀t,inormsuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑖𝑊for-all𝑡𝑖\\|w_{t}^{(i)}\\|\\leq W,\\forall t,i. Moreover, the nominal dynamics f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} is exponentially input-to-state stable (e-ISS): let constants β,γ≥0𝛽𝛾0\\beta,\\gamma\\geq 0 and 0≤ρ<10𝜌10\\leq\\rho<1. For a sequence v1:t−1∈ℝnsubscript𝑣:1𝑡1superscriptℝ𝑛v_{1:t-1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, consider the dynamics xk+1=f0​(xk)+vk,1≤k≤t−1formulae-sequencesubscript𝑥𝑘1subscript𝑓0subscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝑣𝑘1𝑘𝑡1x_{k+1}=f_{0}(x_{k})+v_{k},1\\leq k\\leq t-1. xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} satisfies: With the e-ISS property in Assumption 1, we have the following bound that connects 𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{ACE} with the average squared loss between Bt(i)​ut(i)+wt(i)superscriptsubscript𝐵𝑡𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑡𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑖B_{t}^{(i)}u_{t}^{(i)}+w_{t}^{(i)} and ft(i)superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑡𝑖f_{t}^{(i)}. Assume x1(i)=0,∀isuperscriptsubscript𝑥1𝑖0for-all𝑖x_{1}^{(i)}=0,\\forall i. The average control error (𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{ACE}) is bounded as: The proof can be found in the Appendix A.1. We assume x1(i)=0superscriptsubscript𝑥1𝑖0x_{1}^{(i)}=0 for simplicity: the influence of non-zero and bounded x1(i)superscriptsubscript𝑥1𝑖x_{1}^{(i)} is a constant term in each outer iteration, from the e-ISS property (2). Remark on the e-ISS assumption and the 𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{ACE} metric. Note that an exponentially stable linear system f0​(xt)=A​xtsubscript𝑓0subscript𝑥𝑡𝐴subscript𝑥𝑡f_{0}(x_{t})=Ax_{t} (i.e., the spectral radius of A𝐴A is <1absent1<1) satisfies the exponential ISS (e-ISS) assumption. However, in nonlinear systems e-ISS is a stronger assumption than exponential stability. For both linear and nonlinear systems, the e-ISS property of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} is usually achieved by applying some stable feedback controller to the system222For example, consider xt+1=32​xt+2​sin⁡xt+u¯tsubscript𝑥𝑡132subscript𝑥𝑡2subscript𝑥𝑡subscript¯𝑢𝑡x_{t+1}=\\frac{3}{2}x_{t}+2\\sin{x_{t}}+\\bar{u}_{t}. With a feedback controller u¯t=ut−xt−2​sin⁡xtsubscript¯𝑢𝑡subscript𝑢𝑡subscript𝑥𝑡2subscript𝑥𝑡\\bar{u}_{t}=u_{t}-x_{t}-2\\sin{x_{t}}, the closed-loop dynamics is xt+1=12​xt+utsubscript𝑥𝑡112subscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑢𝑡x_{t+1}=\\frac{1}{2}x_{t}+u_{t}, where f0​(x)=12​xsubscript𝑓0𝑥12𝑥f_{0}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x is e-ISS., i.e., f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} is the closed-loop dynamics  [ref]24 [ref]16. e-ISS assumption is standard in both online adaptive linear control [ref]24 [ref]16  and nonlinear control [ref]13, and practical in robotic control such as drones . In 𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{ACE} we consider a regulation task, but it can also capture trajectory tracking task with time-variant nominal dynamics f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} under incremental stability assumptions [ref]13. We only consider the regulation task in this paper for simplicity. Generality. We would like to emphasize the generality of our dynamics model (1). The nominal control-affine part can model general fully-actuated robotic systems via Euler-Langrange equations  , and the unknown part f​(x,c)𝑓𝑥𝑐f(x,c) is nonlinear in x𝑥x and c𝑐c. We only need to assume the disturbance wt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑖w_{t}^{(i)} is bounded, which is more general than stochastic settings in linear   [ref]16 and nonlinear [ref]13 cases. For example, wt(i)superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑖w_{t}^{(i)} can model extra (x,u,c)𝑥𝑢𝑐(x,u,c)-dependent uncertainties or adversarial disturbances. Moreover, the environment sequence c(1:N)superscript𝑐:1𝑁c^{(1:N)} could also be adversarial. In term of the extension to under-actuated systems, all the results in this paper hold for the matched uncertainty setting [ref]13, i.e., in the form xt+1(i)=f0​(xt(i))+B​(xt(i))​(ut(i)−f​(xt(i),c(i)))+wt(i)subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑖𝑡1subscript𝑓0subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑖𝑡𝐵subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖superscript𝑐𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑡𝑖x^{(i)}_{t+1}=f_{0}(x^{(i)}_{t})+B(x^{(i)}_{t})(u_{t}^{(i)}-f(x_{t}^{(i)},c^{(i)}))+w_{t}^{(i)} where B​(xt(i))𝐵subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑖𝑡B(x^{(i)}_{t}) is not necessarily full rank (e.g., drone and inverted pendulum experiments in Section 5). Generalizing to other under-actuated systems is interesting future work.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: where f0​(x)=12​xsubscript𝑓0𝑥12𝑥f_{0}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x is e-ISS., i.e., f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} is the closed-loop dynamics  [ref]24 [ref]16. e-ISS assumption is standard in both online adaptive linear control [ref]24 [ref]16  and nonlinear control [ref]13, and practical in robotic control such as drones .
