      "content": "Paper Title: Selective Learning: Towards Robust Calibration with Dynamic Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on various tasks [ref]1. However, current deep learning classification models often suffer from poor calibration, i.e., their confidence scores fail to accurately reflect the accuracy of the classifier, especially exhibiting excessive confidence during test time [ref]2. This leads to challenges when deploying them to safety-critical downstream applications like autonomous driving [ref]3 or medical diagnosis , since the decisions cannot be trusted even with high confidences. Therefore, accurately calibrating the confidence of deep classifiers is essential for the successful deployment of neural networks. Various regularization-based methods are proposed to avoid overfiting on the training dataset and thereby calibrate deep classifiers not to be overconfident. Specifically, existing empirical evidences reveal that employing strong weight decay and label smoothing can improve calibration performance effectively [ref]2 . More generally, most previous methods directly modify the objective function by implicitly or explicitly adding a maximum-entropy regularizer during training, such as penalizing confidence , focal loss and its extension methods    , and logit normalization . Specifically, they prevent the model from overfitting on training samples through regularization, thereby alleviating the model’s overconfidence problem. The underlying objective of these methods can be intuitively understood as minimizing the classification loss by increasing confidence corresponding to the ground-truth label, while simultaneously maximizing the predictive entropy of the predicted probability by decreasing confidence. In short, previous methods strive to adjust the confidence while accurately classifying to avoid miscalibration. However, existing methods lack clear guidance on when to increase confidence or decrease confidence, which may lead to unreliable prediction when training in practical scenarios where the training set contains both easy samples and challenging samples (e.g., outliers). Specifically, on the one hand, existing methods attempt to apply regularization to prevent the model from overly confident, which may lead to lower confidence even for easy samples that should be classified accurately with high confidence. On the other hand, they still strive to reduce the classification loss by increasing the confidence corresponding to the ground-truth label to fit the labels of these samples, which could lead to higher confidence for challenging samples that are difficult to classify accurately. Therefore, when the training set contains both easy and challenging samples, the potential limitations of existing methods are exposed. Unfortunately, such scenarios are prevalent, arising from various reasons such as differences in inherent sample difficulty    , data augmentation   or the existence of multiple subgroups in the data   . Meanwhile, due to limited model capacity, we may also not be able to accurately classify samples in all cases. In summary, the lack of clear supervision on how to adjust confidence may lead to three significant problems of existing methods. (1) They may overly regularize the predictions of model, resulting in higher predicted entropy even for easy samples, potentially leading to an under-confident model . In other words, the model might fail to accurately classify samples that it should have been able to recognize effectively. (2) They enforce the model to over-confidently classify all training samples, even though that may be potentially challenging samples (e.g., outliers) beyond the model capabilities. This will result in the model assigning higher confidence to the classification of samples that are inherently difficult to classify accurately. (3) Striving for accurate classification on the training samples while simultaneously maximizing prediction entropy represents two opposing goals, making it difficult in balancing between the two objectives. To this end, we propose a novel method called dynamic regularization (DReg) to solve the above three problems in a unified framework. At a high level, the proposed method is designed to ensure that the model learns selectively during training what it is capable of learning, while acknowledging its limitations in accurately classifying the remaining samples. As illustrated in Fig. 1, our expectation is that the proposed model will confidently classify samples within its capabilities, while refraining from making decisions on samples that pose a challenge. To achieve this goal, we implicitly construct a probability of whether a sample should be known to the model and then impose dynamic regularization to different samples. Specifically, we avoid imposing regularization to increase predicted entropy for easy samples, which prevents undermining model confidence for easy samples (samples that should be learned). Meanwhile, DReg prevents deep learning models from miscalibration by increasing the predicted entropy on potential outlier samples (samples beyond model capabilities). In this way, DReg can elegantly balance the two opposing goals of accurately classifying training samples and maximizing the entropy of predicted probabilities. By actively distinguishing which sample should be learned, DReg can achieve more robust calibration, especially when the challenging samples are presented in the test set. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DReg.  The contributions of this paper are as follows: We summarize the core principle shared by existing regularization-based calibration methods, and demonstrate the underlying limitations due to their indiscriminate regularization on all samples and lack of clear confidence supervision. We propose a novel paradigm that improves previous regularization-based calibration approaches by informing the model what it should and should not be learned, avoiding problems caused by the lack of explicit confidence guidance in previous works. We provide theoretical analysis that proves the superiority of DReg in achieving lower calibration error compared to previous regularization-based methods. We conduct extensive experiments on various settings and datasets. The experimental results, with DReg achieving the best performance, strongly suggest DReg outperforms previous approaches in calibration.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on various tasks [ref]1.
