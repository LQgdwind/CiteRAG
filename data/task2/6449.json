      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Shot Continual Learning via Flat-to-Wide Approaches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe apply the concept of b-flat-wide local minima where, for the parameters of interests in the flat-wide region, i.e., the feature extractor parameters WFsubscript𝑊𝐹W_{F} the losses are still minimized leading to well separations of the classes of interest and robustness against the catastrophic forgetting problem [ref]8. Once found in the base learning phase, these parameters are only tuned within this region during the few-shot learning phases. In other words, it is sufficient to adjust the network parameters within the flat-wide interval to avoid the over-training problem. A definition of the b-flat-wide local minima is formalised as: Definition 1 [ref]8: given a real-valued loss function ℒ(.)\\mathcal{L}(.), for any b>0𝑏0b>0 and network parameters Θ={WC,WF}Θsubscript𝑊𝐶subscript𝑊𝐹\\Theta=\\{W_{C},W_{F}\\}, the b-flat-wide local minima Θ∗superscriptΘ\\Theta^{*} follow the following condition: Condition 1: for ℒ​(x;Θ∗+ϵ)ℒ𝑥superscriptΘitalic-ϵ\\mathcal{L}(x;\\Theta^{*}+\\epsilon), where −b≤ϵ≤+b𝑏italic-ϵ𝑏-b\\leq\\epsilon\\leq+b. Condition 2: there exist c1<Θ∗−bsubscript𝑐1superscriptΘ𝑏c_{1}<\\Theta^{*}-b and c2>Θ∗+bsubscript𝑐2superscriptΘ𝑏c_{2}>\\Theta^{*}+b s.t. ℒ​(x;Θ)>ℒ​(x;Θ∗)ℒ𝑥Θℒ𝑥superscriptΘ\\mathcal{L}(x;\\Theta)>\\mathcal{L}(x;\\Theta^{*}) where c1<Θ<Θ∗−bsubscript𝑐1ΘsuperscriptΘ𝑏c_{1}<\\Theta<\\Theta^{*}-b and Θ∗+b<Θ<c2superscriptΘ𝑏Θsubscript𝑐2\\Theta^{*}+b<\\Theta<c_{2} These conditions are extremely hard to hold in reality and an approximation is carried out using a noise perturbation. That is, we run M𝑀M trials with different noise perturbations ϵj,−b≤ϵj≤+b&j∈Mformulae-sequencesubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑗𝑏subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑗𝑏𝑗𝑀\\epsilon_{j},-b\\leq\\epsilon_{j}\\leq+b\\quad\\&\\quad j\\in M, against network parameters Θ∗superscriptΘ\\Theta^{*}. Under different noise perturbations, the network parameters within the estimated b flat-wide regions are supposed to return similar losses and to have small function values [ref]8. Fig. 1 visualizes the flat learning paradigm. In a nutshell, the base learning phase is designed to minimize the following loss function. where pc,pc∗subscript𝑝𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑐p_{c},p_{c}^{*} stand for the prototype of the c−t​h𝑐𝑡ℎc-th class before and after noise perturbations respectively. The first term of ℒb​a​s​esubscriptℒ𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{base} is designed to unveil the b-flat-wide region while the second term prevents the prototype drift problem. PUsubscript𝑃𝑈P_{U} is a uniform distribution and ℒK​L(.)\\mathcal{L}_{KL}(.) promotes wide local minima via output’s projections to uniform distributions. Note that (3) extends [ref]8 where only the flatness is solicited and ignores the wide learning issue. The goal of (3) is to unveil a flat-wide region working well on all tasks, thus overcoming the catastrophic forgetting problem. It is done by sampling ϵjsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑗\\epsilon_{j} M𝑀M times to vary network parameter leading to ℒk=1subscriptℒ𝑘1\\mathcal{L}_{k=1} considered as a non-convex loss function [ref]8. It is an approximation of the expected loss R​(Θ)=𝔼z,ϵ​[ℒt=1]𝑅Θsubscript𝔼𝑧italic-ϵdelimited-[]subscriptℒ𝑡1R(\\Theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{z,\\epsilon}[\\mathcal{L}_{t=1}], which is impossible to minimize in practise. zksubscript𝑧𝑘z_{k} is the k−t​h𝑘𝑡ℎk-th data batch. Assumption 1 (L-smooth risk function [ref]8): R:ℜD→ℜ:𝑅→superscript𝐷R:\\Re^{D}\\rightarrow\\Re is continuously differentiable and L-smooth L>0𝐿0L>0: This assumption constraints the pace of the gradients w.r.t the parameter vectors. Assumption 2: the expected loss function R​(Θ)𝑅ΘR(\\Theta) holds the following properties [ref]8: R𝑅R is bounded below a scalar R∗superscript𝑅R^{*} given {Θk}subscriptΘ𝑘\\{\\Theta_{k}\\} where k𝑘k indicates the k−t​h𝑘𝑡ℎk-th data batch. It implies R𝑅R to be bounded by a minimum value R∗superscript𝑅R^{*}; For all k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} and j∈[1,M]𝑗1𝑀j\\in[1,M]: where ∇ℒb​a​s​ej,k∇superscriptsubscriptℒ𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑗𝑘\\nabla\\mathcal{L}_{base}^{j,k} is an unbiased estimation of ∇R​(Θk)∇𝑅subscriptΘ𝑘\\nabla R(\\Theta_{k}) to simplify the proof; given m1≥0,m2≥0formulae-sequencesubscript𝑚10subscript𝑚20m_{1}\\geq 0,m_{2}\\geq 0, for all k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} and j∈[1,M]𝑗1𝑀j\\in[1,M]: meaning that the variance of the gradient cannot be arbitrarily large. 𝔼zk,ϵj,𝕍[.]\\mathbb{E}_{z_{k},\\epsilon_{j}},\\mathbb{V}[.] respectively denote the expectation w.r.t the joint distribution of random variables zk,ϵjsubscript𝑧𝑘subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑗z_{k},\\epsilon_{j} and the variance. These three conditions are reasonable in practise and applicable for convergence analysis. Assumption 3: the learning rates λksubscript𝜆𝑘\\lambda_{k} satisfy [ref]8 which can be easily met due to λk<1subscript𝜆𝑘1\\lambda_{k}<1 and a decreasing function w.r.t k𝑘k. These assumptions establish a theorem. Theorem 1: Given the assumptions 1-3 and R𝑅R is twice differentiable, we have: the convergence of the flat-wide minima strategy. A set of proofs are provided in the appendices.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: the feature extractor parameters WFsubscript𝑊𝐹W_{F} the losses are still minimized leading to well separations of the classes of interest and robustness against the catastrophic forgetting problem [ref]8.
