      "content": "Paper Title: Large Language Models: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLLaMA is a collection of foundation language models, released by Meta.\nUnlike GPT models, LLaMA models are open-source, i.e., model weights are released to the research community under a noncommercial license.\nThus, the LLaMA family grows rapidly as these models are widely used by many research groups to develop better open-source LLMs to compete the closed-source ones or to develop task-specific LLMs for mission-critical applications.\n The first set of LLaMA models [ref]32 was released in February 2023, ranging from 7B to 65B parameters.\nThese models are pre-trained on trillions of tokens, collected from publicly available datasets.\nLLaMA uses the transformer architecture of GPT-3, with a few minor architectural modifications, including (1) using a SwiGLU activation function instead of ReLU,\n(2) using rotary positional embeddings instead of absolute positional embedding, and (3) using root-mean-squared layer-normalization instead of standard layer-normalization.\nThe open-source LLaMA-13B model outperforms the proprietary GPT-3 (175B) model on most benchmarks, making it a good baseline for LLM research. In July 2023, Meta, in partnership with Microsoft, released the LLaMA-2 collection , which include both foundation language models and Chat models finetuned for dialog, known as LLaMA-2 Chat.\nThe LLaMA-2 Chat models were reported to outperform other open-source models on many public benchmarks.\nFig 12 shows the training process of LLaMA-2 Chat. The process begins with pre-training LLaMA-2 using publicly available online data. Then, an initial version of LLaMA-2 Chat is built via supervised fine-tuning. Subsequently, the model is iteratively refined using RLHF, rejection sampling and proximal policy optimization. In the RLHF stage, the accumulation of human feedback for revising the reward model is crucial to prevent the reward model from being changed too much, which could hurt the stability of LLaMA model training. Alpaca [ref]62 is fine-tuned from the LLaMA-7B model using 52K instruction-following demonstrations generated in the style of self-instruct using GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003).\nAlpaca is very cost-effective for training, especially for academic research.\nOn the self-instruct evaluation set, Alpaca performs similarly to GPT-3.5, despite that Alpaca is much smaller. The Vicuna team has developed a 13B chat model, Vicuna-13B, by fine-tuning LLaMA on user-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT. Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a evaluator shows that Vicuna-13B achieves more than 90% quality of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Google’s Bard while outperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in more than 90% of cases.\n13 shows the relative response quality of Vicuna and a few other well-known models by GPT-4.\nAnother advantage of Vicuna-13B is its relative limited computational demand for model training. The training cost of Vicuna-13B is merely $300. Like Alpaca and Vicuna, the Guanaco models  are also finetuned LLaMA models using instruction-following data. But the finetuning is done very efficiently using QLoRA such that\nfinetuning a 65B parameter model can be done on a single 48GB GPU.\nQLoRA back-propagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pre-trained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA).\nThe best Guanaco model outperforms all previously released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of fine-tuning on a single GPU.\n Koala  is yet another instruction-following language model built on LLaMA, but with a specific focus on interaction data that include user inputs and responses generated by highly capable closed-source chat models such as ChatGPT.\nThe Koala-13B model performs competitively with state-of-the-art chat models according to human evaluation based on real-world user prompts.\n Mistral-7B [ref]65 is a 7B-parameter language model engineered for superior performance and efficiency. Mistral-7B outperforms the best open-source 13B model (LLaMA-2-13B) across all evaluated benchmarks, and the best open-source 34B model (LLaMA-34B) in reasoning, mathematics, and code generation. This model leverages grouped-query attention for faster inference, coupled with sliding window attention to effectively handle sequences of arbitrary length with a\nreduced inference cost. The LLaMA family is growing rapidly, as more instruction-following models have been built on LLaMA or LLaMA-2, including\nCode LLaMA , Gorilla , Giraffe , Vigogne , Tulu 65B , Long LLaMA , and Stable Beluga2 , just to name a few.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: used by many research groups to develop better open-source LLMs to compete the closed-source ones or to develop task-specific LLMs for mission-critical applications.\n The first set of LLaMA models [ref]32 was released in February 2023, ranging from 7B to 65B parameters.\nThese models are pre-trained on trillions of tokens, collected from publicly available datasets.\nLLaMA uses the transformer\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
