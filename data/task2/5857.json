      "content": "Paper Title: Prompt Tuning based Adapter for Vision-Language Model Adaption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. Following previous works such as CoOp  and Tip-Adapter , we use 11 publicly available image classification datasets. These datasets include ImageNet , Caltech101 [ref]9, OxfordPets , StanfordCars , Flowers102 , Food101 , FGVCAircraft , SUN397 7, DTD , EuroSAT [ref]14, and UCF101 [ref]14. By selecting a diverse range of datasets, we aimed to ensure that the evaluation was comprehensive and our methods can generalize across different domains. ImageNet  is a massive dataset containing over 14 million images with more than 20,000 object categories. Caltech101 [ref]9 is a smaller dataset consisting of 101 object categories, containing about 9,000 images. The OxfordPets  dataset includes over 7,000 images of pets in various categories, such as cats, dogs, and birds. StanfordCars  is a dataset of cars consisting of over 16,000 images of 196 car models. Flowers102  is a dataset with over 8,000 flower images in 102 categories. Food101  is a dataset consisting of 101 food categories, including pizza, sushi, and burgers. FGVCAircraft  is a dataset containing over 10,000 images of aircraft, including commercial and military planes. SUN397 7 is a scene recognition dataset that includes over 130,000 images of indoor and outdoor scenes. DTD (Descriptive Textures)  is a dataset with 47 texture categories, including fabrics, tiles, and plants. EuroSAT [ref]14 is a dataset with 27,000 satellite images of ten land-use classes. Finally, UCF101 4 is a dataset with 13,000 videos in 101 action categories, such as playing basketball or brushing teeth. Table 1 is the statistics of these 11 datasets. Training Details.\nWhen training the learned prompt [V]1‚Äã[V]2‚Äã‚Ä¶‚Äã[V]Msubscriptdelimited-[]V1subscriptdelimited-[]V2‚Ä¶subscriptdelimited-[]VùëÄ[\\text{V}]_{1}[\\text{V}]_{2}...[\\text{V}]_{M}, the maximum training epoch of the ImageNet dataset is fixed at 50. While for the other 10 datasets, the maximum training epoch is set to 200 epochs for 16/8 shots, 100 epochs for 4/2 shots, and 50 epochs for 1 shot. The optimizer is SGD and the learning rate is 0.002 with batch size 32. And the learning rate is scheduled by the cosine annealing rule. We follow all other settings as the default settings in CoOp  for fairly comparing. While training for the cache features FŒ∏subscriptùêπùúÉF_{\\theta}, we follow the default settings on Tip-Adapter  and set 100-epoch training for the EuroSAT dataset and only 20-epoch training for the other 10 datasets. All the experiments are done on 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 20 shots training sets, and test on the full test sets. The initial learning rate is 0.001 with a batch size of 256, and the AdamW optimizer with a cosine scheduler. Baseline. We compare our method with various existing methods to evaluate its effectiveness. In particular, we use the following five methods as baselines for comparison purposes: 1) Zero-shot CLIP 0: This baseline method relies solely on the CLIP model without any parameter fine-tuning. The hand-crafted text prompt template ‚Äùa photo of a {}‚Äù is used as the text encoder input. 2) Linear-probe CLIP 0: This method involves adding an additional linear classifier on top of the feature extraction layer of the frozen CLIP model. The classifier is trained on a few-shot training set to learn the corresponding labels. 3) CoOp : This method aims to optimize the learnable vectors as the text prompt. Specifically, it employs a context optimization technique to improve the performance of the CLIP model. 4) UPT 9: This method presents a unified text and visual prompt tuning approach. It employs a lightweight self-attention network to generate the prompt for CLIP‚Äôs text and visual encoders. 5) Tip-Adapter : This method is based on a key-value cache model that stores and retrieves knowledge. It is a training-free adaptation method that enables parameter-efficient adaptation of large vision and language models. For fair comparisons, we use the same backbone with ViT-B16, and data preprocessing with CLIP. We report the average results of three random seed-running experiments to reduce variance and increase result robustness. In addition, we adopt the default settings for each baseline method as described in the original papers. Few-shot Learning Results \nWe first report results on the 20-shot image setting for the Prompt-Adapter network. After training, we freeze the prompt and fine-tune the learnable cache features. We also use 20-shot images to train other baseline methods. The evaluation results are presented in Table 2, which shows that our Prompt Adapter achieves an average classification accuracy of 78.44%, which is 1.1% higher than the Tip-Adapter‚Äôs (77.35%) accuracy. This improvement can be attributed to the pre-trained prompt that contains rich text knowledge. Furthermore, when finetuning the learnable cache features with Prompt-Adapter-F, the classification accuracy reaches 81.52%, which is 0.06% higher than Tip-Adapter-F‚Äôs (81.46%) and Unified Prompt Learning‚Äôs (81.44%) accuracy. Remarkably, our Prompt-Adapter-F outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods even when trained on 20-shot images. For experiments with 1, 2, 4, and 8, 16 shot settings, we plot out the learning curves for different methods in Figure 2. By looking at the average results over 11 datasets, we find that our method Prompt-Adapter-F achieves the highest accuracy among all the few-shot settings. Specifically, our method outperforms CoOp , UPT 9, and Tip-Adapter-F  in the 1-shot, 2 shots, 4 shots, and 8 shots experiments. These results indicate that our method can effectively handle scenarios with extremely limited data availability. Notably, our method has demonstrated superior performance compared to UPT 9. Because UPT needs 200 epochs of training time to achieve such performance while our method only needs 20 epochs of training time. This phenomenon further highlighting the efficacy of our approach. These findings support the claim that our Prompt Adapter approach is a promising technique for few-shot image classification tasks. In addition to achieving high accuracy on the average classification accuracy across 11 datasets, our method also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on individual datasets. Specifically, on datasets such as Flowers102 , FGVCAircraft , DTD , StanfordCars , Food101 , SUN397 7, Caltech101 [ref]9, and UCF101 4, the proposed Prompt-Adapter-F demonstrates superior performance compared to other methods by significant margins. Only on some datasets like EuroSAT [ref]14 and OxfordPets  our method has some slight decreases in accuracy compared with other methods. We claim the reason may be these two datasets have high intra-class visual feature variance 9, making text prompt adaption difficult. In summary, the experimental results demonstrate that our Prompt-Adapter approach is effective and robust for few-shot image classification tasks. The pre-trained prompt and learnable cache features synergistically contribute to the superior performance of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Datasets.
