      "content": "Paper Title: Trajectory Optimization of Chance-Constrained Nonlinear Stochastic Systems for Motion Planning Under Uncertainty\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting methods to solve a chance-constrained stochastic optimal control problem use moment space propagation    , unscented transformation-based propagation 3, Monte Carlo sample propagation   , and scenario-based 5 3 approaches to construct a deterministic surrogate problem. Although these methods alleviate the curse of dimensionality, they do not provide asymptotic convergence guarantees for a DNOC problem. Monte Carlo methods provide asymptotic convergence guarantees but often require large samples to estimate the constraint satisfaction for nonlinear systems and use mixed-integer programming  solvers for computing a solution. We use gPC propagation  to construct a DNOC problem that converges to the SNOC problem asymptotically. The gPC projection transforms the chance constraints from being a non-convex constraint in moment space to a convex constraint in the gPC space. This enables the use of sequential convex programming 2 4 method for computing a solution. Additionally, we study the existence and uniqueness 6 of a solution and the controllability of the deterministic surrogate dynamics of the stochastic dynamics. Earlier work 7   uses a Gaussian approximation of the linear and the quadratic chance constraint for collision checking and for terminal constraint satisfaction. While this avoids multi-dimensional integration of chance constraints for feasibility checking, Gaussian approximation might not be an equivalent representation (or) even a subset of the feasible set in the presence of stochastic process noise in dynamics. We use distributional robustness 0 1 property to propose a new deterministic second-order cone constraint and a quadratic constraint approximation of the linear and quadratic chance constraints. We prove that the deterministic approximations are a subset of the respective chance constraints. In  , linear chance constraints were considered for probabilistic optimal planning for linear systems. The literature on chance-constrained programming focuses on problems with deterministic decision variables and uncertain system parameters for both linear 0 and nonlinear 1 cases. The results 0  on distributional robust subset and convex approximations of the chance constraints can be readily transformed to the case with a random decision variable for an unknown measure. The quadratic chance constraint would lead to an inner semi-definite program 8 that adds complexity to the SNOC problem considered in this paper. The linear chance constraint for collision checking was first presented in . In 9, authors show that linearized chance constraint is a subset of the original nonlinear chance constraint for a Gaussian confidence-based constraint. Since the local Gaussian assumption might not be valid for nonlinear systems, we present proof for the distributionally robust convex constraint formulation that includes uncertainty in obstacle state for a nonlinear stochastic differential equation. The gPC expansion approach was used for stability analysis and control design of uncertain systems      . For trajectory optimization, recent work focused on nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainty   with no constraints on the state or linear systems with linear chance-constraints that do not extend to the SNOC problem considered here and lack analysis on the deterministic approximation of the uncertain system. The gPC approach was used to compute a moment-space receding horizon approximation , which was solved using nonlinear programming methods. We extend prior work to incorporate nonlinear dynamics and include analysis on the deterministic approximation. We formulate convex constraints for linear and quadratic constraints in gPC space and use this formulation to design algorithms for motion planning and control of a nonlinear stochastic dynamic system. Furthermore, we present a new predictor-corrector formulation (gPC-SCPPC). The gPC-SCPPC method decouples the stochastic propagation using gPC and planning using SCP to optimize a nominal trajectory and ensure safety under uncertainty. In [ref]49, a similar approach was used to correct for the linearization and discretization errors via nonlinear propagation in the SCP. To the best of our knowledge, no other work used such an approach for planning under uncertainty for nonlinear stochastic systems with chance constraints. We generalize and extend our prior conference paper  significantly as follows: i) we derive a sequence of approximations from a SNOC problem to the DNOC problem, which provides a modular architecture to understand trajectory optimization under uncertainty; ii) we include examples discussing the effect of gPC projection on the controllability of stochastic dynamics; iii) we design a motion planning algorithm to handle uncertainty in both dynamics and obstacle location, which takes advantage of the state-of-the-art sampling-based 7 planning algorithms; iv) we formulate a predictor-corrector extension of gPC-SCP and provide conditions for real-time trajectory generation; and v) we validate the gPC-SCP and the gPC-SCPPC approach empirically on three and six-degree-of-freedom robot dynamics and the spacecraft simulator hardware testbed.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: formulation (gPC-SCPPC).
