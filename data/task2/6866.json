Sparsification aims to provide a more compact model that is computationally efficient without compromising performance considerably . Deep Neural Network sparsification techniques include Weight pruning  and Dropout .\n introduced Sparseout, a Dropout extension, that is beneficial for Language models. This approach imposes a LqsubscriptùêøùëûL_{q}-norm penalty on network activations. Considering probability as a global criterion to assess weight importance for all layers,  proposed a network sparsification technique called probabilistic masking (ProbMask). In ProbMask, the pruning rate is progressively increased to provide a smooth transition from dense to sparse state.\nOur study is most related to works that consider model sparsification as a supplementary objective in addition to the primary objective of loss minimization by determining their trade-off. Working with linear classification models,  presented SLIM, a data-driven scoring system constructed by solving an integer program that directly encodes measurements of accuracy and sparsity. The sparsity is managed through the l0subscriptùëô0l_{0}-norm of the model parameters added to the 00-111 loss function (for accuracy) and a small l1subscriptùëô1l_{1}-penalty (to limit coefficients to coprime values). In [ref]53, Group-Lasso has been used in training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as sparse constraints imposed on neurons during the training stage. This method may, however, fail in the presence of highly correlated parameters. To simultaneously prune redundant neurons and tying parameters associated with strongly correlated parameters,  used the Group Ordered Weighted l1subscriptùëô1l_{1} (GrOWL) regularizer for Deep Neural Networks, with a low accuracy loss. GrOWL, promotes sparsity while learning which sets of parameters should have a common value.\nIn our case, we suggest an appropriate Multi-Objective Optimization approach for training a DNN in terms of its primary objective functions, as well as the GrOWL function as a secondary objective function.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: through the l0subscriptùëô0l_{0}-norm of the model parameters added to the 00-111 loss function (for accuracy) and a small l1subscriptùëô1l_{1}-penalty (to limit coefficients to coprime values).
