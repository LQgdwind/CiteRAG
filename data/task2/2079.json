      "content": "Paper Title: A systematic review of Hate Speech automatic detection using Natural Language Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTables 6 and 7 present some characteristics of selected highly cited papers, organized according to their publication date. The tables can serve as a quick reference for all the key works performed in textual automatic HS detection. The employed methods and related experimental results in terms of Precision, Recall, or F-measure are listed concisely. Table 6’s attributes include data platform, type of hate speech, type of machine learning, features, and performance results. One notices, for instance, the dominance of Twitter and YouTube as the main source of data and supervised machine learning algorithms as the dominant machine learning type. Whereas Table 7 repeats the previous process for non-English and multilingual textual data. Furthermore, we have plotted statistical figures regarding all the 463 documents to understand the overall trend according to language, types of HS, data collection platform, ML approach, features, and algorithm used for HS detection. Figure 8 illustrates the proportion of the various languages of the textual input analyzed by HS automatic detection algorithms in the identified records. As expected, English textual source is by far the most investigated. This is rationally justified by the fact that initial work in the field has started with English textual dataset as in Dinakar et al. , but also due to the maturity of the natural language Parsers developed for English language as well as the abundance of benchmarking dataset that enable researchers to carry out useful comparative results. Nevertheless, with the advances in multilingual parsers and deep learning technology, together with increasing pressures from policy-makers to handle hate speech issues at local resources, non-English HS detection toolkits have seen a steady increase. The figure indicates that about 51% of all works in this field are performed on English dataset, with an increase of proportion of other languages as well where Arabic (13% )    3, Turkish (6%) 3 , Greek (4%) 3  , Danish (5%)  3, Hindi (4%) 1  , German (4% )  0, Malayalam (3%) [ref]130 , Tamil (3%) [ref]130 , Chinese (1%)   , Italian (2%) , Urdu (1%) 6  , Russian(1%) , Bengali (1% ) 2 7 9, Korean (1%) , French (1%)   , Indonesian (1%) , Portuguese (1%) , Spanish (1%)  and Polish (1%)  seem to dominate the rest of the languages in this field. It is worth noticing that despite Chinese being the 2nd largest speaking language globally, it has been much less investigated in HS detection community. One reason could be the lack of Chinese language in HS competition workshop such as SemEval2020  and Hasoc2020  where multilingual tasks included English, Danish, Greek, Arabic, Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, German and Turkish, which encouraged many participants all over the world to work in these languages. Figure 9 depicts the percentage of different HS categories in the identified records. We can see that publications related to ’general hate’ (36%) are a dominant trend followed by ’abusive language’ 23% of total records. Cyberbullying and Radicalization categories share the same percentage of (15%) each. While relatively a small percentage is assigned to religion (5%), racial (3%), and sexism (3%) associated hate speech categories. From Figure 10, one can notice that 47% of dataset employed in HS detection was collected from Twitter social network, followed by Facebook (12%), Youtube (9%) and Wikipedia (5%). This indicates a growing trend in research community to tackle the occurrence of hate speech in social media forums as social media platforms constitute by far the dominant agora of hate speech because of easy access, fast spread and societal impact. The rest of the dataset sources, with low occurrence rate, were mainly investigated for comparative purpose and benchmarking. For instance, Pawar et al. used Formspring dataset for cyberbullying detection and developed methods that enhance question-answer systems. In Section 7, we discuss in detail the current state of the art of HS dataset. Figure 11 provides a global trend in terms of types of machine learning approaches employed in our identified records. Among the ML approaches, we distinguish supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised like approaches. The analysis revealed that most of the works adopted supervised methods (73%). From Tables 6 and 7, we can observe that any of these three methods can achieve high-performance accuracy, and there is no substantial evidence to favor one over another one, whereas only the context of data (e.g., availability and quality of training samples) can play a role in deciding about the suitability of one category over another one. For example, Chen et al. used an unsupervised method and lexical & syntactic features to achieve 98% accuracy. Similarly, several works were based on supervised and semi-supervised methods that have shown close or better performance 1 . Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning the popularity of the supervised like approach over other ML approaches, possibility due to the multiplication of benchmarking dataset and machine learning / deep learning platforms that promote supervised approach. Fig. 12 and 13 depict the percentage of ML algorithms and features employed in the identified records, respectively. The SVM method emerges as the most popular HS detection model covering 29% of total records. The use of deep learning models to HS started to rise from 2017 1 to quickly cover about 22% of total identified records. On the other hand, LR (20%) and NB (14%) were also among popular ML methods investigated by the researchers. We also noticed that in many deep-learning related methods, non-deep learning models were often employed as baseline to compare the performance of the investigated deep-learning model   3 1. Fig. 13 shows that TF-IDF based features cover 29% of the total records. However, word embedding models, which have widely being used in deep learning embedding layers, cover 33% of the entire records. The PoStag (3%), topic modeling (3%), and sentiment (3%) features were the least used features. This suggests that the deep-learning models and embedding features seem comparatively popular and widely used by the community. Next, we explored the popularity of the various deep-learning architectures (e.g., CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, etc.) for HS automatic detection. The results are outlined in the next section 6.3.2.\n\nReference markers found: [130]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]130: English dataset, with an increase of proportion of other languages as well where Arabic (13% )    3, Turkish (6%) 3 , Greek (4%) 3  , Danish (5%)  3, Hindi (4%) 1  , German (4% )  0, Malayalam (3%) [ref]130 , Tamil (3%) [ref]130 , Chinese (1%)   , Italian (2%) , Urdu (1%) 6  , Russian(1%) , Bengali (1% ) 2 7 9, Korean (1%) , French (1%)   , Indonesian (1%) , Portuguese (1%) , Spanish (1%)  and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
