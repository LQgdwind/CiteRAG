Unless otherwise stated, parameters are set as follows: the transmit power of ground users PG=0.1subscript𝑃𝐺0.1P_{G}=0.1 W, the transmit power of UAVs PU=1subscript𝑃𝑈1P_{U}=1 W, the transmit power of LEO satellite PS=1subscript𝑃𝑆1P_{S}=1 W, the noise level is -100 dBm , the transmission overhead factor b=1.2𝑏1.2b=1.2, the path loss exponents αL=2subscript𝛼𝐿2\\alpha_{L}=2 and αN=2.5subscript𝛼𝑁2.5\\alpha_{N}=2.5, respectively.

The discount factor in DRL is 0.99, Adam optimizer is utilized in the proposed algorithm. The tasks are randomly generated by DAGs, each ground user has 10 tasks. We set the number of ground users M=12𝑀12M=12, the number of UAVs N=3𝑁3N=3, the number of LEO satellites L=5𝐿5L=5, the number of cloud server K=3𝐾3K=3, the thresholds Tmax=50subscript𝑇max50T_{\\rm max}=50 s, Emax=400subscript𝐸max400E_{\\rm max}=400 J. The ground users are randomly distributed in a square of 200 m ×\\times 200 m, UAVs are randomly distributed in a square of 200 m ×\\times 200 m with the height of 60 m at the beginning, the distance of LEO satellites are randomly generated from 100 km to 500 km, the cloud servers are randomly distributed at intervals of 50 km to 100 km centered around the midpoint of the ground users. UAVs can only fly in a square of 200 m ×\\times 200 m with the minimum height of 50 m and the maximum height of 60 m. All agents interacted with the environment for approximately 100,000 episodes (each episode representing a complete multi-task computation process within the MEC framework) to achieve convergence. Moreover, we compare the proposed algorithm DM-SAC-H with the following benchmarks: Multi-agent PPO (M-PPO) [ref]48 (widely used DRL algorithm), Parametrized DQN  (a DQN & DDPG hybrid framework), and A3C  (a asynchronous multi-agent DRL approach). Fig. 7 presents the energy consumption versus the number of ground users for the proposed algorithm and benchmarks in Case 1. ‘DM-SAC-H NoCloud’ represents the proposed method within the SAGIN framework but without the inclusion of cloud servers, ‘DM-SAC-H NoISL NoCloud’ denotes the scenario where each LEO satellite is unable to offload tasks to other LEO satellites or cloud servers. As depicted in the results, it is clear that energy consumption rises with an increase in the number of ground users. This is primarily due to the fact that with more ground users, there is a higher demand for offloading tasks to the UAVs, LEO satellites, and cloud servers, all of which possess greater computational capacities but consume significantly more energy. Furthermore, the energy consumption escalates rapidly when M≥11𝑀11M\\geq 11; this is a consequence of the LEO satellites’ inability to complete the computing task within the latency constraint, leading to the necessity of offloading the remaining tasks to the high energy-intensive cloud servers in MEC. It is also worth noting that the proposed DM-SAC-H algorithm achieves approximately 18.13 KJ when M=12𝑀12M=12, in contrast to the benchmarks which obtain 19.4, 19.3 and 21 KJ, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm leverages the hybrid action method and decision assistant to enhance the performance of convergence. Besides, the absence of cloud servers in MEC results in the inability to meet the latency requirements when the number of ground users exceeds 10. Concurrently, in scenarios without both ISL and cloud servers, MEC fails to complete all tasks when M≥8𝑀8M\\geq 8. These findings underscore the significance of incorporating both ISL and cloud in MEC. Fig. 8 indicates a comparison of energy consumption between the proposed method and the benchmarks in case 1. First, it is evident that energy consumption escalates as the average task data size increases. This is attributable to the larger task data size necessitating a more extended offloading time, as in (14), (18), (28) and (26). However, it is noteworthy that the influence of the average task data size is not substantial. This is predicated on the assumption that the required computational CPU cycles do not correlate with the data size of the task due to the diversity of tasks such as image processing and natural language processing. Although a larger task size may provide more information for computation, the computation process itself may remain unchanged. Thus, when the volume of information (task data size) increases while the required computational cycles remain constant, there is a moderate increase in energy consumption. As illustrated in Fig. 9, energy consumption in each instance rises as the requirement for CPU cycles per task increases. This is attributable to the necessity of offloading a larger portion of the computational tasks to the UAVs, LEO satellites, and cloud servers as the capacity of the computational task increases. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks; DM-SAC-H reduce the energy consumption to 2.16 KJ with 2 Gcycles, while benchmarks consume between 3 KJ to 3.5 KJ. This improved performance is due to the DM-SAC-H algorithm’s combination of the hybrid action space and its usage of a priori information to mitigate the impact of unavailable actions, thereby enhancing the convergence performance. It is important to note that for computational tasks requiring over 4Gcycles, the proposed framework is unable to complete the tasks within the latency constraint due to the substantial computational requirements. Fig. 10 illustrates the examination of energy consumption as the computing capacity of ground users increases for both the proposed scheme and the benchmarks. It is evident that the proposed DM-SAC-H algorithm converges efficiently and surpasses all three benchmarks. When the computing capacity of ground users is 1.25 GHz, the proposed algorithm reduces energy expenditure to approximately 4.11 KJ while the other benchmarks consume over 5.2 KJ. Furthermore, when the computing capacity of ground users exceeds 1.25 GHz, there is a rapid decrease in energy consumption. This is due to the increased computing capacity enabling the ground users to complete a larger portion of the tasks, thereby only necessitating the offloading of the remainder to the UAVs and LEOs. In Fig. 11, we assess the average latency of both the proposed scheme and the benchmarks in relation to different numbers of ground users. As shown in all the results, the average latency increases as the number of ground users rises. This is attributable to an increase in the number of tasks as the number of ground users expands, prompting each MEC unit to allocate computational resources to the additional tasks. Moreover, the proposed DM-SAC-H algorithm manages to reduce the average latency to 19 s with 12 ground users, whereas the other benchmarks register results exceeding 20 s. Notice that the A3C exhibits the highest latency and instability in convergence due to the low sample efficiency and the asynchronous framework. Moreover, as the number of ground users escalates, the total task count rises, resulting in a significant increase in time cost in scenarios absent of ISL or cloud servers. This outcome effectively validates the benefits of incorporating cloud servers and ISL into MEC within the SAGIN framework. Fig. 12 shows a comparison of the average latency between the proposed algorithm and the benchmarks in relation to the average task data size in case 2. We can see that larger task sizes result in extended transmission times during offloading in MEC. The proposed algorithm achieves an average latency of 19.3 s when the average task size is 1 MB, while the other benchmarks yield higher latencies of 20.34 s, 20.40, and 22.31 s, respectively. These results underscore the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in utilizing the advantages of the hybrid action space and the decision assistant to achieve superior convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: km, the frequency for UAV is 1 GHz, the beam gain δl=25subscript𝛿𝑙25\\delta_{l}=25 dB, the carrier frequency of LEO satellites is 30 GHz, the maximum Doppler frequency is referred to the Ka-band in [ref]47, the normalized gain Gdsuperscript𝐺𝑑G^{d} is 1 for all ISL , the thermal noise ζ=354.81𝜁354.81\\zeta=354.81 K , the bandwidth for ISL and satellite-Cloud is 1 GHz [ref]47, other bandwidths are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
