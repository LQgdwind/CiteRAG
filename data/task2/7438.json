      "content": "Paper Title: A Human-Machine Collaboration Framework for the Development of Schemas\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the literature, the development of new schemas by experts is a laborious task requiring creativity, inspiration, and motivation , and perhaps, not unsurprisingly, there seem to exist a limited number of WSC datasets that have been widely used   . It seems that the development of new schemas from scratch deserves more research attention, given that the availability of Winograd schemas seems disproportional to their demand and potential impact. Perhaps not unrelated to the limited availability of schemas, the first and only WSC took place in 2016 as a side event of IJCAI, where contestants did not manage to earn the price of $25000 . According to the challenge organizers, the challenge itself was found to be too troublesome and difficult to handle at regular intervals. In this line of work, the WSC is now part of the GLUE-benchmark 222https://gluebenchmark.com where new Winograd schemas could potentially enhance the language understanding evaluation task. Of course, in retrospect, this led to the development of various approaches that, although they tackled subsets of schemas with high accuracy results, were often done without considering the challenge purpose as the means to understanding the innards of basic human behavior while disambiguating pronouns. In hindsight, when the challenge was introduced, it was not easy to consider the possibilities of several obvious lines of attack by narrow statistical and opaque approaches such as neural network ones. On the other hand, it is not feasible even for humans to determine how machines could find word patterns that could lead them to the successful resolution of pronouns in schemas. In a relevant study , we showed that the challenge can form a novel form of CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) in an effort of bringing security researchers to the field. In this regard, a new schema replenishment mechanism was necessary to display schemas to identify humans from bots. Reportedly, since then, few studies have investigated how we can develop Winograd schemas from scratch, like the Winventor and WinoFlexi systems  . Winventor  is a system that automatically develops schemas from scratch and considerably helps humans in the development task. In its simplest form, it uses several components that enhance the schema development process applied to sentences found on the English Wikipedia. If it cannot develop a schema, it only develops a half —the first instance of a schema. Broadly speaking, it parses each examined sentence to select sentences that include pronouns and more than two nouns/proper nouns. Next, it parses each examined sentence via a spelling-correction component to fix possible abbreviations, spelling errors, or misspellings of words. With the help of the spaCy333https://spacy.io dependency parser, it builds semantic relations, which show how the sentence’s nouns or proper nouns relate to the sentence’s pronouns. Through another component, it selects the best possible pronoun-target pair, either two nouns or proper nouns with the same number and gender. The next step is developing the first half’s question through a specified question generator . The last step includes finding and substituting the first half’s special word to build the second half. WinoFlexi  is an online collaboration platform that enhances the schema development process, where crowdsourced workers collaborate to design schemas in real-time. Specifically, WinoFlexi brings together workers from various geographic locations [ref]2 to work on the development of Winograd schemas. To that end, it incorporates several mechanisms that guide humans with no prior knowledge in designing new schemas of similar quality to most typical existing collections. Among others, WinoFlexi’s mechanisms include a training session that familiarizes workers with the schema development process by asking them to correctly resolve randomly selected schemas designed by experts. To do that, it categorizes workers into two groups: Contributors and Evaluators. Contributors are workers who develop schemas, that is, pair of halves consisting of sentences, questions, and answers. On the other hand, the Evaluators are qualified Contributors who validate schemas. At the same time, the engine is cheat-proof, and it uses quality controls that benefit non-dubious workers and ban dubious ones. To illustrate, it uses quality controls, namely, test questions, the ban score, and the schema hardness score. The test-question approach is based on the adaptive interjection of questions during the schema development process and evaluation, where workers who correctly resolve them get a positive score. The ban score, a specified way to deal with cheating, automatically bans workers with a sufficiently predefined low score. The schema hardness mechanism is WinoFlexi’s way of giving Contributors feedback regarding their developed schemas’ structure. This is a metric that labels each schema with a hardness score that indirectly shows if a schema is considered hard or easy in relation to their already developed schemas — e.g., if the majority of contributor schemas are easy to solve, WinoFlexi prompts them to develop more complex schemas. Experiments showed that WinoFlexi experiments ran for one week and yielded more than 165 schemas from 50 workers aged 18 to 65. However, it seems the engine could not motivate them to develop large amounts of schemas. Specifically, during the experiments, it was found that only 50 workers decided to participate, where the highest score was 250 points and the lowest -70. Additionally, the mean response time across all workers was 1.48 minutes, and the average time for the best worker was 1.66 minutes. Also, it was found that 60% of bonuses were offered to the top five workers. It seems that a novel Human-Machine Collaboration approach that blends the advantages of the studies mentioned above would enhance the schema development process. In this regard, inspired by having humans and machines acting as associates rather than supervisors and tools, this work introduces WinoFusion, which brings the schema development process into a new era, where both humans and machines are evolving from supervisors and assistants to associates and collaborators . According to the literature, Human-Machine Cooperation (HCM)  is necessary to introduce new stakes, which were introduced a long time before with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). On the one hand, machines could provide autonomous agents for different tasks, and on the other hand, humans could control the whole process with the optimum goal of producing efficacious results.  . To put it succinctly, by amplifying human and machine intelligence, we can address some of their weaknesses . This is why Human-Computer Interaction has moved to the collaboration era between humans and machines . In essence, our proposed framework utilizes the Winventor replenishment mechanism to inspire and motivate crowdworkers to be creative based on a novel interaction that amplifies human and machine intelligence by combining their complementary strengths. The design of appropriate crowdsourcing mechanisms for our particular task is the focus of the rest of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: that enhances the schema development process, where crowdsourced workers collaborate to design schemas in real-time.
