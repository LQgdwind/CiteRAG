A comprehensive survey of FL from the perspective of fundamentals, challenges, solutions, and applications in MEC networks can be found in [ref]34. Therein, FL-based privacy-preserving popularity prediction in MEC networks has been explored in many works, i.e.,    . Nevertheless, many challenges still remain to be addressed. In a recent work , the center server is prohibited from snooping on users’ private data, while only the local MEC server is permitted to collect and learn from the historical requests of users. This scheme relies on authorization management and is susceptible to unauthorized access provided by the unreliable network operator or gained by malicious cracking. In addition, the deep learning method in  requires manual labeling in advance, which unfortunately is costly and infeasible in real implementation. The authors in  proposed an FL-based method to realize the privacy-preserving EC. On the basis of literature , Cui et al.  utilized blockchain to further improve the security of FL implementation. However, the EC policies considered in   are both built on the similarities between users and contents, which is calculated by potential features extracted from historical requests of users. The similarity calculated in these two literatures is just a rough estimation of popular contents rather than the actual popularity. Thus, the content popularity which represents the accurate requested probability of each content has not been predicted in  . Moreover, the relationship between the client-side popularity and server-side popularity has not been explored in  . In , the content popularity has been predicted while the popularity relationship between the client side and server side is preliminarily explored. Nonetheless, the explorations of the relationship between client-side and server-side popularities were sketchy and empirical in , which was reflected in the thoughtlessness of user request arrival rate as well as the absence of any verification for the given relationship. In this paper, we introduce the concept of local popularity at user side and global popularity at MEC server side respectively, and further derive and validate the mathematical relationship between these two popularity types. Yu et al.  considered the mobility of users and proposed a mobility-aware FL method to predict the popularity while preserving user privacy. Nevertheless, the temporal variability of the popularity caused by the time-varying user interests has not been explored in . Furthermore, in , sampling from the real popularity distribution at the MEC server side is required to generate the input of the prediction model during the local training phase. However, the real popularity distribution at the MEC server side depends on the subjective interests of users within the entire service area and thus is extremly hard to obtain a priori. In our study, we consider the local and global popularities both time-varying and unavailable so as to be more closely aligned with reality. In addition, we can further observe from     that local users are supposed to share or upload their request history when making online predictions, so as to generate the input of the prediction model. Indeed, this kind of sharing or upload violates the privacy-preserving requirement. The fundamental reason why these works need to collect users’ request history for the global prediction can be attributed to the consistency requirement in the typical FL framework, which demands that the model structures and model inputs should be exactly the same between the local and global sides [ref]33. To mitigate the risk of privacy leakage caused by the collection of user request history, we design the input structure of the local and global models to break the consistency requirement on model inputs, and then realize the distributed training and prediction without any external access to user’s historical requests except itself.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: supply of abundant and closer computing/caching resources.
