Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Sift : How to Sift Out a Clean Subset in the Presence of Data Poisoning?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe detail the 16 attacks in human studies as follows: For Label-only attacks, Random and Targeted Label-Flipping leads to mislabeled samples. However, since humans can only classify at a sample-wise level, these attacks present the same level of difficulty to humans. Hence, we only evaluate Random Label-Flipping, where we randomly shuffle a poisoned sample‚Äôs label to a different class. For Feature-only attacks, we consider three representative works: Label-Consistent attack 777https://github.com/MadryLab/label-consistent-backdoor-code[ref]6, Hidden Trigger backdoor888https://github.com/UMBCvision/Hidden-Trigger-Backdoor-Attacks [ref]53, and the Narcissus attack .\nWe include three different designs of triggers from the original paper: vanilla Narcissus with l‚àû=16/255subscriptùëô16255l_{\\infty}=16/255; watermarked Narcissus, which used a mask to constrain the trigger within a pre-defined shape; and Narcissus-Smooth trigger, which is constrained to be low-frequency. For Label-Feature attacks, we study a comprehensive list of dirty-label backdoor attacks with different trigger designs: 1) Patch-based triggers that adopt an arbitrary trigger pattern in small regions: BadNets, and Masked random noise (Masked-Noise) , Watermark ; 2) Blending-based triggers that blend the trigger into the original image for better stealthiness: Blended random noise (Blended-Noise)  and Refool999https://github.com/DreamtaleCore/Refool [ref]54; 3) Attack based on elastic transformation: WaNet101010https://github.com/THUYimingLi/BackdoorBox ; 4) Optimized triggers within norm-balls: l0subscriptùëô0l_{0} and l2subscriptùëô2l_{2} invisible triggers ; 5) Optimized low-frequency triggers: the smooth trigger111111https://github.com/YiZeng623/frequency-backdoor ; 6) Input-specific triggers with trigger patterns customized to individual inputs: the input aware backdoor (IAB)121212https://github.com/THUYimingLi/BackdoorBox .\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: a poisoned sample‚Äôs label to a different class. For Feature-only attacks, we consider three representative works: Label-Consistent attack 777https://github.com/MadryLab/label-consistent-backdoor-code[ref]6, Hidden Trigger backdoor888https://github.com/UMBCvision/Hidden-Trigger-Backdoor-Attacks [ref]53, and the Narcissus attack .\nWe include three different designs of triggers from the original\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
