      "content": "Paper Title: Unraveling Movie Genres through Cross-Attention Fusion of Bi-Modal Synergy of Poster\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditionally, researchers have explored a range of\nvisual inputs (e.g., trailers [ref]5, movie-clips , facial frames )\ntextual inputs (e.g., plot summaries , screenplays [ref]13), and\nmultimodal inputs integrating visual, textual, and audio data [ref]14, .\nIn this paper, we concentrate on identifying multi-label movie genres solely from posters,\nwhich has been relatively limited in the existing literature . Visual Input:\nZhou et al.  extracted global visual descriptors from trailer keyframes and utilized KNN classifier for genre identification.\nIn [ref]5 and , CNNs were employed to analyze trailers of LMTD (Labeled Movie Trailer Dataset) for detecting genres.\nA transformer network was used for genre identification from trailer clips in .\nIn , spatio-temporal features were extracted from video clips and hierarchical SVM was employed.\nYadav et al.  analyzed facial expressions in movie trailers to predict emotions and identify genres using an Inception-LSTM architecture.\nMoving beyond the trailer, very few works have been found using movie poster images.\nNaïve Bayes classifier with global features was used in .\nIn , CNN with GRAM layers was incorporated to capture style features from posters.\nYOLO and CNN models were engaged in identifying genres from detected objects of posters in . Textual Input:\nTo analyze plot summaries for genre prediciton, BLSTM and GRU-based architectures were harnessed in  and , respectively.\nIn  also, CNN with LSTMs and GRUs was employed for analyzing multi-lingual movie synopses.\nCNN with the flow of emotions was used in  to capture emotions and genres from plot synopses.\nWehrmann et al.  adopted a CNN architecture enriched with a self-attention mechanism for genre classification from synopses.\nGorinski et al. [ref]13 utilized movie screenplays for predicting various movie attributes, including genre, mood, etc. Their approach employed a multi-label encoder and LSTM-based decoder. Multimodal Input:\nPast studies integrated multiple data sources, such as poster images, synopsis texts, trailer videos, and audio, to enhance genre classification.\nIn  and , the Gated Multimodal Unit (GMU) and CentralNet were employed, respectively, leveraging textual features from movie synopsis/metadata via Word2Vec and visual features from posters using CNN.\nGMU with transformer was utilized in  to integrate text, image, video, audio, and metadata features from diverse modalities. In [ref]14, fastText, fastVideo, VGG-19, and CRNN were employed to extract features from text (plot summary, metadata), trailers, posters, and audio, respectively.\nIn , various classifiers, including LSTM, KNN, SVM, MLP, and decision tree, were utilized to extract features from synopses, subtitles, trailers, posters, and audio. Positioning of our work:\nIn the literature, there is a noticeable scarcity of research that focuses exclusively on movie posters for genre identification.\nThe focus on other modalities has overshadowed the rich source of information contained within posters. Unlike trailers and clips, which provide dynamic visual sequences, posters offer a static yet highly curated representation of a film’s aesthetic and thematic elements. Similarly, while textual summaries and screenplays provide comprehensive narrative details, posters distill this information into concise visual and textual elements that convey genre information at a glance. Furthermore, prior studies have only used visual information in the poster and neglected textual information.\nOur study is one of the earliest attempts to utilize both visual and textual information from movie posters for classifying multi-label genres.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Traditionally, researchers have explored a range of\nvisual inputs (e.g., trailers [ref]5, movie-clips , facial frames )\ntextual inputs (e.g., plot summaries , screenplays [ref]13), and\nmultimodal inputs integrating visual, textual, and audio data [ref]14, .\nIn this paper, we\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
