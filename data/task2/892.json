      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Local and Global Descriptors in Parallel to Search Correspondences for Visual Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough early hand-crafted local descriptors focused on gradient and intensity knowledge have been widely used, such as SIFT , ORB , BRISK , many researchers have attempted to design the learned counterparts with the increasing popularity of machine learning and emergence of annotated patch benchmarks . It seems that end-to-end descriptors learned from patches by CNNs have become a tendency in recent years. MatchNet  consists of a deep convolutional network that extracts descriptors from patches and a network of three fully connected layers that calculates a similarity between the extracted descriptors. DeepDesc [ref]22 adopts Siamese network and an aggressive mining strategy towards hardly classified patches while DeepCompare  studies several neural network architectures to improve the performance. TFeat [ref]24 utilizes triplets of training samples and in-triplet mining of hard negatives. HardNet [ref]25 minimizes distances of matching pairs, and meanwhile maximizes distances between patches and their “hardest-within-batch” negatives. GeoDesc  integrates geometry constraints from multi-view reconstructions to the learning process and provides guidelines of using learned local descriptors in structure-from-motion pipelines. SOSNet  incorporates a second order similarity regularization into its training process and designs a local descriptor evaluation method based on von Mises-Fischer distribution. L2-Net  takes descriptor compactness into account. DOAP  achieves better results by directly optimizing an average precision metric. In addition, SuperPoint , D2-Net , and R2D2  are the representatives of joint detection and description methods. They just need a whole image as input, then keypoints and their corresponding descriptors are extracted by a relatively complex network. Although most learning based local descriptors have achieved good performances in certain tasks, they are real-valued descriptors and cannot be embedded in random trees directly.\nTherefore, we propose a weighted Hamming regularization term to keep discriminativeness of learning based local descriptors after binarization.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: consists of a deep convolutional network that extracts descriptors from patches and a network of three fully connected layers that calculates a similarity between the extracted descriptors. DeepDesc [ref]22 adopts Siamese network and an aggressive mining strategy towards hardly classified patches while DeepCompare  studies several neural network architectures to improve the performance. TFeat\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
