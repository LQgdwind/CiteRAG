      "content": "Paper Title: Hidden Biases of End-to-End Driving Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnd-to-end driving approaches have rapidly improved in performance on the CARLA leaderboard , the de-facto standard for fair online evaluation. Driving scores have increased from under 20 0  to over 70 [ref]35 [ref]41 in just two years. However, why recent systems work so well is not fully understood, as both methods and training sets differ largely between submissions. Rigorous ablations are expensive due to the large design space of driving systems and the need to simulate large amounts of driving for evaluation. In particular, recent methods trained with Imitation Learning (IL) have shown strong performance 2 [ref]9 [ref]41 [ref]35 . They are trained using offline datasets, yet they can surprisingly recover from the classic compounding error problem of IL  , as indicated by their high route completions 2 [ref]9 [ref]41 [ref]35. While they do not utilize HD maps as input, they are provided with map-based GNSS locations in the center of the lane (spaced 30 m apart on average) called target points (TPs) that describe the route the car should follow. TPs were introduced as an alternative form of conditioning signals to convey driver intent 0 . Prior work 4 5 used discrete navigation commands or NCs (i.e. follow lane, turn right, …) instead. In this paper, we show that TP conditioned models recover from the compounding error problem because they use geometric information contained in the TP to reset steering errors periodically (at every TP). This makes them implicitly rely on accurate map information, even though they are otherwise HD map free. Steering directly towards a TP is a shortcut 7 that these IL methods learn to exploit. When methods accumulate enough steering error to be out of distribution during deployment, we observe that they steer towards the nearest TP. When the TP is close, this has the effect of driving back to the lane center, where it is in distribution again. This is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). However, when the TP is far away, this shortcut can lead to catastrophic steering errors (e.g. cutting a turn). We show examples of this behavior for various SotA architectures in Section 3.1. We demonstrate that the shortcut problem is intrinsically related to the decoder architecture and that a transformer decoder  can mitigate it. Another common aspect of the current SotA is that they use waypoints (future positions of an expert driver) as output representations 2 [ref]9 [ref]41. We point out that this is an ambiguous representation as the future velocity is multi-modal, yet the model commits to a point estimate. This is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). We show that this ambiguity can sometimes be helpful due to the continuous nature of waypoints: the network can continuously interpolate between modes. We propose an alternative that explicitly predicts the uncertainty of the network via target speed classification, and show that interpolating between target speeds weighted by the uncertainty reduces collisions. Our controlled experiments also cover important but sometimes neglected details in the training of end-to-end driving systems, such as augmentation, training schedules, and dataset size. In particular, we revisit the idea of shift and rotation augmentations to aid recovery  . These were common in early IL methods for CARLA with control outputs 5, but are harder to implement with waypoint outputs and not used by the current SotA. We find that they yield significant improvements. Using these insights, we develop TransFuser++ (TF++), which sets a new SotA on the Longest6 2 and LAV [ref]9 benchmarks. Two of the ideas we apply, transformer decoder pooling and path-based outputs instead of waypoints, have been used in Interfuser [ref]35. However, these are presented as minor details, and their impact is not studied in isolation as in our work. TF++ is significantly simpler than Interfuser, yet outperforms it by a large margin on Longest6, as we show in Section 4. We use ∼similar-to\\sim4×\\times less data, 1 camera instead of 4, and do not require complex heuristics to extract throttle and brake commands for our path output. Contributions: We show that target point conditioned models learn a shortcut that helps them recover from steering errors. We point out that the waypoint output representation is ambiguous, but its continuous nature helps models collide less by interpolating to slow down. Using the insights gained from controlled experiments, we propose TransFuser++ which places first on the Longest6 and LAV benchmarks.
