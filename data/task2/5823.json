      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Learning and Explaining Indirect Causal Effects in Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct a wide range of experiments across three kinds of datasets – A synthetic dataset, three well-known public real-world benchmark datasets, and three industry-based simulated datasets. We compare the causal explanations of AHCE with a well-known post-hoc gradient-based explanation method: Integrated Gradients (IG) [ref]44, a post-hoc causal explanations (CA) method , the causal Shapley values (CSHAP) , and a recent causal regularization method in [ref]17. We compare against IG since it can be viewed as computing individual causal effects of input neurons on the output of an NN [ref]14. Ground truth causal effects are computed using the adjustment formula in Eqn 3. Following [ref]17, we use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Frechet distance between true causal effects and the learned explanations. We present our results on total causal effects for a fair comparison with all methods (indirect causal effects do not exist for IG, CA, CREDO; comparison of CSHAP with our method on indirect causal effects is presented in Appendix §E). Additional results and experimental setup are presented in Appendix §E owing to space constraints. Our code is provided in the supplementary material. Synthetic Data:\n\nWe create a synthetic dataset using a causal graph and corresponding structural equations shown in Fig 3 and Tab 2. From Fig 3, W𝑊W has only indirect causal effect on Y𝑌Y via the paths: W→X→Y,W→Z→X→Yformulae-sequence→𝑊𝑋→𝑌→𝑊𝑍→𝑋→𝑌W\\rightarrow X\\rightarrow Y,W\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow X\\rightarrow Y, and W→Z→Y→𝑊𝑍→𝑌W\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow Y. Z𝑍Z has a direct causal effect on Y𝑌Y via the path Z→Y→𝑍𝑌Z\\rightarrow Y and an indirect causal effect on Y𝑌Y via the path Z→X→Y→𝑍𝑋→𝑌Z\\rightarrow X\\rightarrow Y, and X𝑋X has only a direct causal effect on Y𝑌Y via the path X→Y→𝑋𝑌X\\rightarrow Y. This dataset has linear equations with additive Gaussian noise among input features W,Z,X𝑊𝑍𝑋W,Z,X, and the output Y𝑌Y is a non-linear function of its inputs with additive Gaussian noise. Hence, for purposes of modeling causal effects, the lateral connections among inputs in 𝒩I​n​dsuperscript𝒩𝐼𝑛𝑑\\mathcal{N}^{Ind} are obtained using simple linear regressors that take a set of real numbers as input and produce a real number as output (for real-world datasets, we replace simple linear regressors with multi-layer perceptrons to account for non-linear relationships among input features). Tab 3 shows the results. The total causal effects given by our method are closer to ground truth causal effects compared to baselines. These results show that the training algorithm for our ante-hoc causal explanation model can better learn both direct and indirect causal effects and match the total causal effects. We perform an ablation study to empirically verify our hypothesis that adding edges among input features helps in learning causal effects. In this study, we check the causal effects with and without outgoing edges from each input feature W,Z,X𝑊𝑍𝑋W,Z,X in 𝒩I​n​dsuperscript𝒩𝐼𝑛𝑑\\mathcal{N}^{Ind} (denoted by 𝒩W​i​t​hI​n​dsubscriptsuperscript𝒩𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑊𝑖𝑡ℎ\\mathcal{N}^{Ind}_{With}, 𝒩W​i​t​h​o​u​tI​n​dsubscriptsuperscript𝒩𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑊𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡\\mathcal{N}^{Ind}_{Without} respectively in Tab 4). This setting also resembles real-world scenarios where we can often access only a partial causal graph. From the results in Tab 4, we observe that the total causal effects in 𝒩W​i​t​hI​n​dsubscriptsuperscript𝒩𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑊𝑖𝑡ℎ\\mathcal{N}^{Ind}_{With} are closer to the ground truth total causal effects compared to 𝒩W​i​t​h​o​u​tI​n​dsubscriptsuperscript𝒩𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑊𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡\\mathcal{N}^{Ind}_{Without}. Auto-MPG:\nIn this experiment, we work on Auto-MPG dataset  where the task is to predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on various parameters such as acceleration, horsepower, etc. We do not know the ground truth causal graph in this case. Hence, we first construct a causal graph as shown in Fig 4 based on pertinent domain knowledge. Subsequently, we verify the correctness of this constructed causal graph through interaction with the popular large language model GPT-3.5 , questioning the correctness of each causal edge within the constructed graph. We use this constructed graph as the available knowledge in our experiments. Tab 5 shows these results. Since the underlying structural equations are unavailable for this dataset, we cannot evaluate indirect causal effects. However, we can compare the performance with respect to total causal effects, which is the sum of direct and indirect causal effects. From the results, our method outperforms baselines in capturing true total causal effects. Lung Cancer:\nIn Lung Cancer dataset 9, whose causal graph is known (see Fig 4), we consider Dyspnea is the output variable with the remaining features such as smoking, bronchitis, etc. as inputs. From the results shown in Tab 5, our model is better at learning the true total causal effects when compared to the baselines. The lateral connections among input features are implemented using simple multi-layer perceptrons with non-linear activation functions. Since the underlying causal graph of the Lung Cancer dataset is a discrete Bayesian network with binary-valued features, the Frechet score is not relevant, and so we report only RMSE values for this dataset. Similar to Auto-MPG dataset, we present results on total causal effects. Sachs: Sachs dataset consists of 11 protein types and their causal relationships as shown in Fig 4. We consider the variable Akt as output and the remaining variables Plcg, PIP2, PIP3 as inputs as they do not causally influence the output. The results in Tab 5 show that our model is better at learning the true total causal effects than the baselines. To check that the second phase of our proposed ante-hoc training algorithm, where we train the parameters of layer 00, does not reduce the model performance, we check the performance on each dataset after each epoch for each training phase. As shown in Fig 5, the two phases of ante-hoc model training converge without oscillations in phase 2 training.\nFlight Simulation Datasets:\n\nTo study the value of our efficient implementation strategies discussed in Sec. 4.3, we consider flight simulation datasets that benefit from such strategies. We consider three different time series-based datasets: Parking Brake Dataset (PBD), Flap Dataset (FD) and Multiple Anomaly Dataset (MAD) which simulate the application of parking brakes during the takeoff, the deployment of a wrong flap during takeoff and the multiple brake anomalies (left-brake, right-brake, and auto-brake) respectively. These datasets are captured on an industry-grade flight simulator. In all these datasets, we train an RNN to predict whether a given sequence is anomalous or not. We compare our method with CA and an approximation to the second-order term in Eqn 4 proposed in . Tab 6 shows the results, highlighting the improvements in time needed to compute ACE in our method. Appendix F contains qualitative results showing the performance of these methods using ACE plots.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: benchmark datasets, and three industry-based simulated datasets. We compare the causal explanations of AHCE with a well-known post-hoc gradient-based explanation method: Integrated Gradients (IG) [ref]44, a post-hoc causal explanations (CA) method , the causal Shapley values (CSHAP) , and a recent causal regularization method in [ref]17. We compare against IG since it can be viewed as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
