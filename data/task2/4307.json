      "content": "Paper Title: MCTS with Refinement for Proposals Selection Games in Scene Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly methods for floor plan creation from 3D data relied on basic image processing methods such as histograms or plane fitting      . For example,  creates a floor plan by detecting vertical planes in a 3D point cloud by building a histogram of the vertical positions of all measured points. In a similar way,  creates a floor plan from located walls in a 3D point cloud by extracting planar structures by applying sweeping techniques to identify Manhattan-World directions. However, these techniques relied heavily on heuristics and were prone to fail on noisy data. Significant progress has been made later by using graphical models as in     .  uses graph-cuts optimization in a volumetric MRF formulation. However, the proposed method is vulnerable to noisy data, as regularization in MRFs is based only on pairwise interaction terms.  combines an MRF with Robust Principal Component Analysis to obtain more compact 3D models.\nGraphical models are also used in  where layouts and floor plans are recovered from crowd-sourced image and location data. Graph-based methods define objective functions made of unary terms representing the elements of the plan and binary terms which involve only two elements at a time (here, the elements are mostly walls). In our case, we use MCTS as the optimization algorithm. MCTS does not impose restrictions on the form of the objective function and we use an objective function that captures complex constraints. In particular, the main term of our objective function is a deep network that considers all the elements at the same time. Moreover, we complement MCTS by adding a refinement step to adjust the locations of the elements based on the same objective function. More recent works rely on other optimization techniques  [ref]3 . The challenges for these techniques, however, are the definition of a cost function and the optimization procedure. One of these methods called FloorNet  proposes a deep network for detecting probable corner locations from a given density map of the scene, followed by an Integer Programming formulation. However, incorrect corner detection and misdetections result in missing or extra walls and rooms. Moreover, the solution space is restricted to Manhattan scenes and generalizing to non-Manhattan scenes would lead to a much larger solution space. By contrast, our approach is scalable, as it relies on the efficiency of MCTS to reduce the search space, and can consider Manhattan and non-Manhattan scenes with the same complexity. It selects room detections that best explains the input through a global optimization, and is thus not sensitive to false positives. The starting point of our method is inspired by Floor-SP [ref]3, which proposes to first segment room instances, and then to reconstruct polygonal representations of rooms by sequentially solving shortest path problems. In their case, every pixel location in a discretized density map is a node in a graph that potentially belongs to the polygonal curve of the room. Wrong segmentations may still lead to an inaccurate floor plan structure, while we handle incorrect room segmentation at an early stage. Also, Floor-SP discretizes the edge directions of rooms and models multiple Manhattan frames per room, while our approach can consider any angle. It still encourages angles close to 90°°\\degree to be exactly 90°°\\degree, which results in better shapes when the rooms actually follow Manhattan structures while allowing other shapes. As we will show in the experiments, our approach outperforms the accuracy of Floor-SP.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: time.
