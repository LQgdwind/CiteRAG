      "content": "Paper Title: Duet: efficient and scalable hybriD neUral rElation undersTanding*\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCardinality estimation is a classical problem of the database that aims to estimate how many tuples will be selected by a given query. And it‚Äôs critical since most RDBMS‚Äôs query optimizers evaluate the query plan according to the cardinality¬†, so the query optimizer‚Äôs effectiveness depends on accurate cardinality estimation. Also, during the optimization, the estimator is called for many times to evaluate the candidate query plan, so the estimator must be accurate and efficient. Even though a lot of traditional cardinality estimation methods¬†                 including bloom-filter-based, histogram-based, and sampling-based methods have been proposed to draw a sketch of data for estimating the queries‚Äô selectivity, these methods‚Äô error is as high as 2‚Äãe52superscriptùëí52e^{5} when facing the complex query workloads and data distribution¬†. Since cardinality estimation directly affects the effectiveness of query optimization, a more accurate cardinality estimation method is urgently needed. In recent years, AI-driven cardinality estimation methods¬†[ref]6  have made great progress in accuracy. These methods can be divided into three classes: query-driven, data-driven, and hybrid methods since the first two methods learn from query and data respectively, and the latter performs hybrid learning from both query and data. However, all these three kinds of methods have their shortcomings, we summarize their most common problems into the following five main problems and discuss them by each kind of method. High computation complexity and high memory requirement for complex range queries during inference. Long-tail distribution problem on high-dimensional tables, i.e., estimator‚Äôs maximum error is significantly higher than the 99th percentile error. High computation and memory cost for hybrid training. Instability that gives uncertain results. Hard to adapt the workload drift problem. The query-driven methods are end-to-end models, such as MSCN¬†, RobustMSCN¬†[ref]45, LW-XGB¬†[ref]11, and LW-NN¬†[ref]11, they learn to estimate cardinality from the labeled query directly. Such methods are regression models essentially¬†, and must be re-trained or fine-tuned when the workloads drift to maintain accuracy due to the i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) assumption of machine learning, which leads to the Problem (5). Although some valuable works¬† [ref]45 try to improve such end-to-end methods by designing model-updating-method to solve the workload distribution drift problem, or adding query masking to make the model generalize better on unseen predicates, the workload drift problem is still not completely solved since learning from queries requires the future incoming queries to have independent and identically distribution with the training queries, which cannot be guaranteed. This problem is a fundamental flaw of the query-driven method and can hardly be completely avoided by designing more advanced models. The data-driven methods¬†[ref]6      learn from the table itself, so they are irrelevant to query workloads and can adapt to any query workload. All data-driven methods can be roughly divided into three categories: probability-based¬†[ref]6  , SPN-based¬† , and pre-training-based. Unfortunately, they each have some shortcomings that limit their applications. For probability-based methods, Naru and Neurocard have Problems (1, 2, 4) since they all introduce progressive sampling into their inference. We will analyze it in subsection¬†V-D and confirm this in experiments of Figure¬†6. The efficiency of FACE¬† depends on whether there are similar queries that already have converged buckets. If not, the iteration of sampling would be inefficient (Problem(1)) as the authors stated in the paper¬†. The SPN-based methods perform better in inference speed and scalability but have poorer accuracy than Naru. For example, DeepDB¬† suffers from low accuracy (Problem (2)) since it introduces the conditional independence assumption. Although FLAT¬† has removed this assumption, its accuracy barely reaches a level similar to Naru according to the reported experimental results. The pre-training-based method¬† had achieved a very high performance in their experiments, which shows great potential for applying the pre-training model to the CE problem. However, such a method highly relies on the assumption that most real-world datasets have common patterns in the frequency and correlation distributions. It is still unknown to what extent this assumption can be satisfied in the real world. And when meeting a dataset with extremely skewed distribution and complex correlation, the effectiveness of this method still needs to be further studied. The hybrid methods¬† use both query-driven and data-driven methods to improve the estimation accuracy. Peizhi Wu and Gao Cong proposed a hybrid cardinality estimation method UAE¬† by using the Gumbel-Softmax Trick. They analyzed the gradient flow of Naru in detail and proved that the progressive sample hinders the back-propagation in training. The UAE is the first unified deep autoregressive model to use both data as unsupervised information and query workload as supervised information for learning joint data distribution. By backward propagating gradient on the estimation process, the predicted cardinality can be used as supervisory signals along with the predicted distribution to train the model. However, the Gumbel-Softmax Trick that it uses is still a sampling method, so it still suffers from the Problems (1, 2, 4) of data-driven methods. Besides, the most important problem is the high memory and computation cost of UAE‚Äôs hybrid training (Problem (3)) caused by using hybrid training and progressive sampling simultaneously. We analyze it in subsection¬†IV-D. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that introduces the predicate information into the autoregressive model by learning from virtual tables and a hybrid approach (Duet111Duet‚Äôs code is available at: https://github.com/GIS-PuppetMaster/Duet) for efficient and scalable cardinality estimation. Duet can address the five problems simultaneously by removing the sampling process. Specifically, our approach enables accurate and deterministic cardinality estimation for various range query workloads, high cardinality, and high-dimensional tables, with much lower time and memory costs since no sampling is needed. Furthermore, since Duet‚Äôs estimation process is differentiable and considering the temporal locality of queries, users can further improve the long-tail distribution problem by applying hybrid training on historical queries. Our contribution can be summarized as follows. We proposed a novel methodology for modeling data-driven cardinality estimation which can deal with range queries without sampling and any non-differentiable process during inference. Taking a neural network inference as a basic operation, Duet can achieve O(1) time complexity during inference with only a single network forward pass for each estimation. This feature makes Duet can even be inferred on the CPU with less time cost than that of most learned methods on GPU. Also, by removing the sampling process, Duet achieves higher accuracy on high-dimensional tables significantly. Duet is a differentiable cardinality estimation method and naturally supports hybrid training with higher efficiency. Benefiting from the sampling-free estimation design, Duet is a stable and practical cardinality estimation method that always gives a determinate result. Compared with other hybrid methods, Duet saves a massive amount of GPU memory and calculation during training. The experimental results demonstrate that Duet can achieve less time cost of inference, lower memory cost, and similar or higher accuracy than data-driven and hybrid cardinality estimation baselines represented by Naru and DeepDB and their derivatives. Compared with all query-driven baselines, Duet also achieves much better accuracy and can adapt to any query workload naturally without fine-tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: estimation directly affects the effectiveness of query optimization, a more accurate cardinality estimation method is urgently needed.
