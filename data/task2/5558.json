      "content": "Paper Title: ASSET: Robust Backdoor Data Detection Across a Multiplicity of Deep Learning Paradigms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeployment of deep learning (DL) in critical services and infrastructures calls for special emphasis on security, given its susceptibility to erroneous predictions in the presence of attacks   . Specifically, data-poisoning-based backdoor attacks - where attackers manipulate the training data to force certain outputs during testing - pose a significant threat. Successful attacks have been demonstrated on various computer vision tasks and beyond . This paper focuses on the problem of detecting the poisoned samples within a training set. An effective detection strategy allows one to mitigate the risk of backdoors by removing suspicious samples from training. Poisoned samples can be regarded as outliers in a training set. However, unlike arbitrary outliers considered in the classical outlier detection and robust statistics literature, poisoned samples are special outliers that induce specific model behaviors, e.g., misleading the model to predict some target class(es).\nHence, recent works on backdoor detection primarily leverage the model trained on the poisoned dataset (backdoored model hereinafter ) or information cached during training to help discover poisoned samples  [ref]6   [ref]9 0 1. For instance, most of the prior work starts by extracting the backdoored model’s output [ref]6, intermediate activation patterns   [ref]9 0, gradient 1 for each sample, and then separate poisons from clean samples based on the extracted information. While taking advantage of the information collected from the downstream learning process provides a clear path to enhancing backdoor detection performance, it also raises the question:\nCan these detection methods maintain their performance across different DL settings?\nParticularly, existing detection methods are exclusively evaluated in only one learning setting—end-to-end supervised learning (SL), where a labeled poisoned dataset is used to train a model from scratch. On the other hand, new learning paradigms are increasingly adopted and have demonstrated state-of-the-art prediction performance with reduced annotation costs and computational burden 2 3 4 5.\nThe two most representative and popular paradigms are self-supervised learning (SSL) adaptation and transfer learning (TL), as illustrated in Figure 1. In SSL adaptation, one pre-trains a model on large unlabeled data (e.g., through contrastive learning 6 7 8 or masked autoencoder (MAE) 3) and then fine-tunes only the last layer using labeled data from a specific downstream task. Recent work 9 0 1 has shown that an attacker can poison the unlabeled dataset to implant backdoors without any control over downstream fine-tuning processes.\nThus, it is natural to ask: Can we detect the poisoned samples within an unlabeled dataset using existing methods?\nIn TL, one starts with an existing pre-trained model and fine-tunes all layers of the model or just the last layer with labeled data.\nDespite the importance of TL in practice 2, we lack an understanding of backdoor detection in this setting:\nCan we detect the poisoned samples when they are used for fine-tuning an existing model instead of training it from scratch? Our first contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of existing detection methods across different DL paradigms. The key findings are summarized as follows. (Case-0) End-to-end SL:\nDespite the efficiency demonstrated by prior detection efforts in specific settings, the consistency of efficacy varies a lot across different attacks or poison ratios.\nIn particular, all fail to detect the state-of-the-art clean-label backdoor attack111Clean-label attacks refer to those where the poisoned samples appear to be correctly labeled to a human inspector.  and underperform in the very low or very high poison ratio setting (e.g., 0.05% or 20%). (Case-1) SSL adaptation:\nThere are no existing methods dedicated to detecting unlabeled poisoned samples in the SSL setting. Yet, some of the existing methods can be adapted to the SSL. For instance, those methods attempting to separate the poisoned samples from clean in the embedding space can employ an embedder learned from unlabeled data to generate the embedding for each sample 222We will elaborate on the adaptation techniques in Section 5.1.. However, the performance of these methods after adaptation is limited (e.g., their average detection rate over different attacks all falls below 26%). Case-2 TL: While prior literature omitted TL in their evaluation, the detection methods can all be applied to it. However, the methods based on embeddings suffer a significant performance loss compared to the end-to-end SL setting because the poisoned samples are less distinguishable from clean ones in a fine-tuned embedding space than a trained-from-scratch one. The limitations of existing methods per our evaluation are summarized in Table 1. Overall, there still lacks a detection method that is effective across different learning paradigms. ○○\\bigcirc Our second contribution is the development of a robust, generic approach to backdoor detection that applies to the three representative learning paradigms discussed above. Like most existing literature [ref]9 [ref]6 , our approach also assumes that the defender has an extra set of clean samples (referred to as a base set hereinafter) with a size much smaller compared to the training set. In practice, these clean samples can be obtained through manual inspection or automatic screening 4. However, unlike the previous works, we do not require the base set to be labeled. The key idea of our approach is to induce different model behaviors between poisoned samples and clean ones. To achieve this, we design a two-step optimization process: we first minimize some loss on the clean base set; then, we attempt to offset the effect of the first minimization on the clean distribution by maximizing the same loss on the entire training set including both clean and poisoned samples. The outcome of this two-step process is a model which returns high loss for poisoned samples and low loss for clean ones. Hence, we can decide whether a sample is poisoned or clean based on the corresponding loss value. We found that the two-step optimization-based offset idea achieves strong detection performance except in settings where the poison ratio is low, or the learning of the poisoned samples happens slowly—at roughly the same speed as learning of clean samples. As we will explicate later in the paper, in these cases, the effect of the second maximization significantly outweighs that of the first minimization; as a result, both poisoned and clean samples achieve large losses and become inseparable. To tackle the challenge, we propose a strengthened technique that involves two nested offset procedures, and the inner offset reinforces the outer one. Specifically, we use the inner offset procedure to identify the points most likely to be poisoned and mark them as suspicious; the outer offset procedure still minimizes some loss on the clean base set, but the maximization will now be performed on the points marked to be suspicious by the inner offset, instead of the entire poisoned dataset.\nAs the proportion of clean samples within the suspicious set is much smaller than that within the entire poisoned set, the small loss of clean samples obtained from the first minimization would be impacted much less by the second maximization.\nThis nested design effectively improves the separability between clean and poisoned samples.\n Our third contribution is the provision of techniques that can adaptively set the loss threshold to discern poisoned samples. Some of the prior works   assume the knowledge of poison ratio and mark a fixed number of samples as poisoned ones based on their respective criteria. Moreover, the poisoned and clean samples often do not have a clear separation based on their criteria (see examples in Figure 5); as a result, their detection performance is very sensitive to the estimated poison ratio. We argue that in practice, it is challenging to have an accurate estimate of the poison ratio. Hence, it is preferable to adapt detection to the data characteristics rather than relying on a fixed estimate. Herein, we design two adaptive thresholding techniques tailored to specific requirements imposed by inner and outer offset procedures (i.e., prioritizing\nprecision vs. prioritizing true positive rate). We conduct extensive experiments in comparison with seven representative or state-of-art backdoor data detection methods over 56 different attack settings across various DL paradigms and show that our proposed method, ASSET, is the only one that can provide reliable detection consistently across all the evaluated settings. This work is also the first practical backdoor detection for the SSL and the TL settings333Open-source: https://github.com/ruoxi-jia-group/ASSET.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: works on backdoor detection primarily leverage the model trained on the poisoned dataset (backdoored model hereinafter ) or information cached during training to help discover poisoned samples  [ref]6   [ref]9 0 1.
