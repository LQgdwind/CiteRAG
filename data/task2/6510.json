      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Neural Networks based Log Anomaly Detection and Explanation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern high-tech systems, such as cloud computers or lithography machines, typically consist of a large number of components. Over time these systems have become larger and more complex, making manual system operation and maintenance hard or even infeasible . Therefore, automated system operation and maintenance is highly desirable. To achieve this, system logs are universally used to record system states and important events. By analysing these logs, faults and potential risks can be identified, and remedial actions may be taken to prevent severe problems. System logs are usually semi-structured texts though, and identifying anomalies through log anomaly detection is often challenging. Since both industry and academia show great interest in identifying anomalies from logs, a plethora of log anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Existing log anomaly detection methods can be roughly divided into three categories: quantitative-based, sequence-based, and graph-based methods. Specifically, quantitative-based methods, such as OCSVM [ref]33 and PCA , utilise a log event count matrix to detect anomalies, and are therefore unable to capture semantic information of and sequential information between log events. Meanwhile, sequence-based methods, including DeepLog  and LogAnomaly [ref]23, aim to detect anomalies by taking sequential (and sometimes semantic) information into account. They cannot consider the full structure among log events though. In contrast, graph-based methods, such as GLAD-PAW  and GLAD , convert logs to graphs and exploit semantic information as well as the structure among log events, exhibiting the following three advantages over the former two categories of methods [ref]13: 1) they are able to identify problems for which the structure among events is crucial, such as performance degradation; 2) they are capable of providing contextual log messages corresponding to the identified problems; and 3) they can provide the ‘normal’ operation process in the form of a graph, helping end-users find root-causes and take remedial actions. However, graph-based methods like GLAD transform log events into undirected graphs though, which may fail to capture important information on the order among log events. Moreover, most existing graph-based methods perform graph representation and anomaly detection separately, leading to suboptimal detection accuracy. Moreover, as highlighted by Li et al. , with the growing adoption of anomaly detection algorithms in safety-critical domains, there is a rising demand for providing explanations for the decisions made within those domains. This requirement, driven by ethical considerations and regulatory mandates, underscores the importance of accountability and transparency in such contexts. Moreover, in practical applications, the attainment of precise anomaly explanations contributes to the timely isolation and diagnosis of anomalies, which can mitigate the impact of anomalies by facilitating early intervention . However, to our knowledge, most existing log anomaly detection methods focus exclusively on accurate detection without giving explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Logs2Graphs, a graph-based unsupervised log anomaly detection approach for which we design a novel one-class graph neural network. Specifically, Logs2Graphs first utilises off-the-shelf methods to learn a semantic embedding for each log event, and then assigns log messages to different groups. Second, Logs2Graphs converts each group of log messages into an attributed, directed, and weighted graph, with each node representing a log event, the node attributes containing its semantic embedding, directed edges representing how an event is followed by other events, and the corresponding edge weights indicating the number of times the events follow each other. Third, by coupling the graph representation learning and anomaly detection objectives, we introduce One-Class Digraph Inception Convolutional Networks (OCDiGCN) as a novel method to detect anomalous graphs from a set of graphs. As a result, Logs2Graphs leverages the rich and expressive power of attributed, directed, and edge-weighted graphs to represent logs, followed by using graph neural networks to effectively detect graph-level anomalies, taking into account both semantic information of log events and structure information (including sequential information as a special case) among log events. Importantly, by decomposing the anomaly score of a graph into individual nodes and visualizing these nodes based on their contributions, we provide understandable explanations for identified anomalies. Overall, our contributions can be summarised as follows: (1) We introduce Logs2Graphs, which formalises log anomaly detection as a graph-level anomaly detection problem and represents log sequences as directed graphs to capture more structure information than previous approaches; (2) We introduce OCDiGCN, a general end-to-end unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection method for attributed, directed and edge-weighted graphs. By coupling the graph representation and anomaly detection objectives, we improve the potential for accurate anomaly detection over existing approaches; (3) For each detected anomaly, we identify important nodes as explanations, offering cues for subsequent root cause diagnosis; (4) We empirically compare our approach to eight state-of-the-art log anomaly detection methods on five benchmark datasets, showing that Logs2Graphs performs at least on par with and often better than its competitors.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: log anomaly detection methods can be roughly divided into three categories: quantitative-based, sequence-based, and graph-based methods.
