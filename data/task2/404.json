      "content": "Paper Title: Speech to Text Adaptation: Towards an Efficient Cross-Modal Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe next step is materializing the architecture. Here we refer to two kinds of key papers, namely cross-modal KD for speech translation  and LM compression . Cross-modal KD is an ambiguous term at a glance since it is difficult to define what the modality is. Thus, we here regard speech and text to incorporate different modality, though in our task, both lead to the same type of inference (intent understanding). Similar to , where a student speech translation model learns from the prediction of a teacher machine translation module, our SLU model takes advantage of the logit inference of a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM [ref]6. In this process, we employ detailed compressing procedures of a Transformer LM , both regarding the model architecture and loss functions.\nAt the very first phase, a pre-trained LM, e.g., bidirectional encoder representation from Transformers (BERT) [ref]6, is fine-tuned with the ground truth, eventually making up a teacher model (though with different modality).\nConsequently, at the end-to-end SLU training phase, which utilizes a frozen pre-trained acoustic module  , the loss function is updated with the knowledge distilled from the teacher. Here, knowledge is represented as a loss, which indicates the gap between the logit layers of both modules. To wrap up, leveraging pre-trained LM to an end-to-end SLU in our approach includes LM fine tuning and distillation from LM to SLU.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: where a student speech translation model learns from the prediction of a teacher machine translation module, our SLU model takes advantage of the logit inference of a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM [ref]6.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
