      "content": "Paper Title: FFConv: Fast Factorized Convolutional Neural Network Inference on Encrypted Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo build light-weight neural networks for faster inference, various compression techniques have emerged in the literature  such as quantization and pruning [ref]23  [ref]25 [ref]26. Quantization represents network variables (weights and activations) with low-precision numbers, leading to smaller model size and lower computational cost. Recent works [ref]23 mainly adopted uniform quantization to reduce the bit-width down to 2 bit without significant accuracy drop. The extreme case of quantization is binary neural networks , which approximate the neural network variables with 0 or 1. Quantization can been integrated with HE schemes to speed up the inference, for instance, TAPAS  accelerates HE based encrypted prediction via optimizations on binary networks. Nevertheless, quantization has no dependencies on ciphertext packing. Pruning is to remove the redundant weights from the over-parameterized neural network models, which can be categorized into unstructured weight pruning [ref]25 and structured filter pruning [ref]26 . The former prunes weights satisfying certain criteria such as the magnitude of weights is smaller than a pre-defined threshold. The latter prunes filters based on pruning criteria such as L1/L2 norm of filters. Faster CryptoNets  used unstructured weight pruning to reduce the inference latency of HECNN by skipping the homomorphic multiplications associated with pruned weights. However, the irregular model structure after unstructured weight pruning is not compatible with ciphertext packing. On the other hand, structured filter pruning maintains regular model structure and thus can be integrated with ciphertext packing. Nevertheless, structured filter pruning often suffers from low pruning rate, which in turn limits the inference speed-up. Another line of research in neural network compress is Low-rank factorization     , which decomposes a convolution layer into the product of two smaller convolutions with lower rank. Though low-rank factorization has been widely studied in accelerating neural network inference in plaintext domain, it is largely unexplored for secure neural network inference with data encrypted by HE schemes. In this work, we find a unique angle on how low-rank factorization can be integrated with ciphertext packing, in order to reduce the rotation overhead and thus achieve considerable inference acceleration on encrypted data.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: To build light-weight neural networks for faster inference, various compression techniques have emerged in the literature  such as quantization and pruning [ref]23  [ref]25 [ref]26.
