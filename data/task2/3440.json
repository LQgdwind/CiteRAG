      "content": "Paper Title: Constant Approximating Parameterized 𝑘-SetCover is W[2]-hard\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we formally define the k𝑘k-SetCover problem and related hypothesis. For every graph G𝐺G, we use V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) and E​(G)𝐸𝐺E(G) to denote its vertex set and edge set. For every vertex v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), let N​(v)⊆V​(G)𝑁𝑣𝑉𝐺N(v)\\subseteq V(G) be the set of neighbors of v𝑣v in G𝐺G. For every vertex set C⊆V​(G)𝐶𝑉𝐺C\\subseteq V(G), define N​(C)=⋃v∈CN​(v)𝑁𝐶subscript𝑣𝐶𝑁𝑣N(C)=\\bigcup_{v\\in C}N(v). The (weighted variant of) SetCover is defined as follows. An instance ΓΓ\\Gamma consists of a bipartite graph G=(S,U,E)𝐺𝑆𝑈𝐸G=(S,U,E) and a weight function w:S→ℕ+:𝑤→𝑆superscriptℕw:S\\to\\mathbb{N}^{+}. The goal is to find a set C⊆S𝐶𝑆C\\subseteq S such that N​(C)=U𝑁𝐶𝑈N(C)=U and the total weight ∑s∈Cw​(s)subscript𝑠𝐶𝑤𝑠\\sum_{s\\in C}w(s) is minimal. We use 𝖮𝖯𝖳​(Γ)𝖮𝖯𝖳Γ{\\sf OPT}(\\Gamma) to represent the minimum total weight. For every χ∈ℕ𝜒ℕ\\chi\\in\\mathbb{N}, we say an instance ΓΓ\\Gamma is χ𝜒\\chi-weighted if the number of different weights is upper bounded by χ𝜒\\chi, i.e. |{w​(v):v∈S}|≤χconditional-set𝑤𝑣𝑣𝑆𝜒|\\{w(v):v\\in S\\}|\\leq\\chi. The unweighted SetCover is equivalent to 111-weighted SetCover. Given a constant χ𝜒\\chi, by duplicating every vertex according to its weight, any χ𝜒\\chi-weighted SetCover instance ΓΓ\\Gamma can be reduced to an unweighted (111-weighted) SetCover instance Γ′superscriptΓ′\\Gamma^{\\prime} in time (|Γ|⋅max⁡{w​(s):s∈S})O​(1)superscript⋅Γ:𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑆𝑂1\\left(|\\Gamma|\\cdot\\max\\{w(s):s\\in S\\}\\right)^{O(1)}, while preserving the optimum. For any constant χ𝜒\\chi, there is a reduction which, given any χ𝜒\\chi-weighted SetCover instance Γ=(S,U,E,w)Γ𝑆𝑈𝐸𝑤\\Gamma=(S,U,E,w), outputs an unweighted SetCover instance Γ′=(S′,U′,E′)superscriptΓ′superscript𝑆′superscript𝑈′superscript𝐸′\\Gamma^{\\prime}=(S^{\\prime},U^{\\prime},E^{\\prime}) in \nO​((|Γ|​max⁡{w​(s):s∈S})O​(1))𝑂superscriptΓ:𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑆𝑂1O(\\left(|\\Gamma|\\max\\{w(s):s\\in S\\}\\right)^{O(1)}) time, such that for every k<|Γ|𝑘Γk<|\\Gamma|, 𝖮𝖯𝖳​(Γ)≤k𝖮𝖯𝖳Γ𝑘{\\sf OPT}(\\Gamma)\\leq k if and only if 𝖮𝖯𝖳​(Γ′)≤k𝖮𝖯𝖳superscriptΓ′𝑘{\\sf OPT}(\\Gamma^{\\prime})\\leq k. In parameterized complexity theory, we consider problems L⊆{0,1}∗𝐿superscript01L\\subseteq\\{0,1\\}^{*} with a computable function κ:{0,1}∗→ℕ:𝜅→superscript01ℕ\\kappa:\\{0,1\\}^{*}\\to\\mathbb{N} which returns a parameter κ​(x)∈ℕ𝜅𝑥ℕ\\kappa(x)\\in\\mathbb{N} for every input instance x∈{0,1}∗𝑥superscript01x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{*}. Since we mainly focus on graph related problems, it is convenient to treat each input as a pair x=(G,k)𝑥𝐺𝑘x=(G,k) with G𝐺G a graph and k𝑘k an integer and let κ​(x)=κ​(G,k)=k𝜅𝑥𝜅𝐺𝑘𝑘\\kappa(x)=\\kappa(G,k)=k.\nA parameterized problem (L,κ)𝐿𝜅(L,\\kappa) is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) if it has an algorithm which for every input x∈{0,1}∗𝑥superscript01x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{*} decides if x𝑥x is a yes-instance of L𝐿L in f​(κ​(x))⋅|x|O​(1)⋅𝑓𝜅𝑥superscript𝑥𝑂1f(\\kappa(x))\\cdot|x|^{O(1)}-time for some computable function f𝑓f. An FPT-reduction from problem (L,κ)𝐿𝜅(L,\\kappa) to (L′,κ′)superscript𝐿′superscript𝜅′(L^{\\prime},\\kappa^{\\prime}) is an algorithm A𝐴A which on every input x𝑥x, outputs an instance x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} in f​(κ​(x))⋅|x|O​(1)⋅𝑓𝜅𝑥superscript𝑥𝑂1f(\\kappa(x))\\cdot|x|^{O(1)}-time such that x𝑥x is a yes-instance if and only if x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} is a yes-instance and κ′​(x′)=g​(κ​(x))superscript𝜅′superscript𝑥′𝑔𝜅𝑥\\kappa^{\\prime}(x^{\\prime})=g(\\kappa(x)) for some computable function f𝑓f and g𝑔g.\nIn the parameterized version of SetCover, i.e., k𝑘k-SetCover, we are given an instance ΓΓ\\Gamma of unweighted SetCover and an integer k𝑘k as its parameter(i.e. κ​(Γ,k)=k𝜅Γ𝑘𝑘\\kappa(\\Gamma,k)=k). The goal is to decide if 𝖮𝖯𝖳​(Γ)≤k𝖮𝖯𝖳Γ𝑘{\\sf OPT}(\\Gamma)\\leq k.\nThe c𝑐c-gap k𝑘k-SetCover problem is to distinguish between the cases 𝖮𝖯𝖳​(Γ)≤k𝖮𝖯𝖳Γ𝑘{\\sf OPT}(\\Gamma)\\leq k and 𝖮𝖯𝖳​(Γ)>c​k𝖮𝖯𝖳Γ𝑐𝑘{\\sf OPT}(\\Gamma)>ck. Another fundamental parameterized problem is the k𝑘k-Clique problem, whose goal is to decide whether an input graph G𝐺G contains a clique of size k𝑘k. At the end, we present the hypothesis 𝖶​[ref]𝟤≠𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖶delimited-[]2𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{W[ref]2}\\neq\\mathsf{FPT} and 𝖶​[ref]𝟣≠𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖶delimited-[]1𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{W[ref]1}\\neq\\mathsf{FPT} on which our results based. For simplicity, we omit the definition of W-Hierarchy and only use an equivalent form. k𝑘k-SetCover cannot be solved in f​(k)⋅nO​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑂1f(k)\\cdot n^{O(1)} time for any computable function f𝑓f. k𝑘k-Clique cannot be solved in f​(k)⋅nO​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑂1f(k)\\cdot n^{O(1)} time for any computable function f𝑓f. Analogously to the definition of 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness, we say a problem is 𝖶​[ref]𝟣𝖶delimited-[]1\\mathsf{W[ref]1}-hard or 𝖶​[ref]𝟤𝖶delimited-[]2\\mathsf{W[ref]2}-hard if there is an FPT-reduction from k𝑘k-Clique or k𝑘k-SetCover to it, respectively.\nSimilarly, a problem is in 𝖶​[ref]𝟣𝖶delimited-[]1\\mathsf{W[ref]1} or 𝖶​[ref]𝟤𝖶delimited-[]2\\mathsf{W[ref]2} if there is an FPT-reduction from it to k𝑘k-Clique or k𝑘k-SetCover, respectively. Note that 𝖶​[ref]𝟣≠𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖶delimited-[]1𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{W[ref]1}\\neq\\mathsf{FPT} implies 𝖶​[ref]𝟤≠𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖶delimited-[]2𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{W[ref]2}\\neq\\mathsf{FPT}, because there is an FPT reduction which transforms a k𝑘k-Clique instance to an unweighted k𝑘k-SetCover instance ΓΓ\\Gamma with small universe size |U|=k3⋅log⁡|Γ|𝑈⋅superscript𝑘3Γ|U|=k^{3}\\cdot\\log|\\Gamma| [KLM19, Lin19]. Thus, in our paper, the starting point of our reduction for Theorem 2 is an unweighted k𝑘k-SetCover with small universe size rather than a k𝑘k-Clique instance. Formally, the reduction [KLM19, Lin19] is stated below. There is a polynomial time reduction which, given an n𝑛n-vertex graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) and a parameter k𝑘k, outputs a k𝑘k-SetCover instance Γ=(S,U,E)Γ𝑆𝑈𝐸\\Gamma=(S,U,E) where |U|=O​(k3​log⁡n)𝑈𝑂superscript𝑘3𝑛|U|=O(k^{3}\\log n) and |S|=|E|=O​(n2)𝑆𝐸𝑂superscript𝑛2|S|=|E|=O(n^{2}), such that: if G𝐺G contains a k𝑘k-clique, then 𝖮𝖯𝖳​(Γ)≤(k2)𝖮𝖯𝖳Γbinomial𝑘2\\mathsf{OPT}(\\Gamma)\\leq\\binom{k}{2}; if G𝐺G contains no k𝑘k-clique, then 𝖮𝖯𝖳​(Γ)>(k2)𝖮𝖯𝖳Γbinomial𝑘2\\mathsf{OPT}(\\Gamma)>\\binom{k}{2}.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Another fundamental parameterized problem is the k𝑘k-Clique problem, whose goal is to decide whether an input graph G𝐺G contains a clique of size k𝑘k.
