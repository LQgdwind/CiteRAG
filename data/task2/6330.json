      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Diffusion Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMomentum SGD. Let us consider an optimization problem, min𝐱∈ℝn⁡f​(𝐱)subscript𝐱superscriptℝ𝑛𝑓𝐱\\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}}f(\\mathbf{x}), where\nf𝑓f is a differentiable function. Then, one often uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD)  to update the parameter 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} per iteration: where 𝐠ksubscript𝐠𝑘\\mathbf{g}_{k} denotes the stochastic gradient, and α𝛼\\alpha is a step size. Momentum SGD [ref]21 is proposed to accelerate the convergence of SGD: where β𝛽\\beta is a constant. The momentum β​(𝐱k−𝐱k−1)𝛽subscript𝐱𝑘subscript𝐱𝑘1\\beta(\\mathbf{x}_{k}-\\mathbf{x}_{k-1}) =−∑i=0k−1α​βk−i​𝐠iabsentsuperscriptsubscript𝑖0𝑘1𝛼superscript𝛽𝑘𝑖subscript𝐠𝑖=-\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\\alpha\\beta^{k-i}\\mathbf{g}_{i} accumulates all the past gradients and thus provides a more stable descent direction than the single gradient 𝐠tsubscript𝐠𝑡\\mathbf{g}_{t} used in SGD. Consequently, momentum SGD can effectively avoid oscillation which often exists around the loss regions of high geometric curves, and thus achieves much faster convergence speed than SGD in both theory and practice [ref]22  . Diffusion Models (DMs).\nDMs consist of a forward diffusion process and a corresponding reverse process . For the forward process, DMs gradually add Gaussian noises into the vanilla sample 𝐱0∼pdata​(𝐱0)similar-tosubscript𝐱0subscript𝑝datasubscript𝐱0\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\sim p_{\\text{data}}(\\mathbf{x}_{0}), and generates a series of noisy samples 𝐱tsubscript𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{x}_{t}: where μtsubscript𝜇𝑡\\mu_{t} varies along time step t𝑡t. In particular, p​(𝐱t|𝐱0)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱0p(\\mathbf{x}_{t}|\\mathbf{x}_{0}) is also widely known as the perturbation kernel applied to the original sample 𝐱0subscript𝐱0\\mathbf{x}_{0}. For VEs , μt≡1subscript𝜇𝑡1\\mu_{t}\\equiv 1; more generally, for others  [ref]2 , limt→∞μt=0subscript→𝑡subscript𝜇𝑡0\\lim\\nolimits_{t\\to\\infty}\\mu_{t}=0. The noise level σtsubscript𝜎𝑡\\sigma_{t} increases monotonically with t𝑡t.\nAccordingly, one can easily obtain the noisy sample 𝐱tsubscript𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{x}_{t} at time step t𝑡t by 𝐱t=μt​(𝐱0+σt​ϵt)subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝜇𝑡subscript𝐱0subscript𝜎𝑡subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡\\mathbf{x}_{t}=\\mu_{t}(\\mathbf{x}_{0}+\\sigma_{t}\\epsilon_{t}),\nwhere ϵt∼𝒩​(0,𝐈)similar-tosubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝒩0𝐈\\epsilon_{t}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\mathbf{I}) denotes a Gaussian noise. We use 𝐱^t=𝐱0+σt​ϵtsubscript^𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱0subscript𝜎𝑡subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t}=\\mathbf{x}_{0}+\\sigma_{t}\\epsilon_{t} to denote the non-scaled (w/o μtsubscript𝜇𝑡\\mu_{t}) noisy sample throughout the paper unless specified. The reverse process from a Gaussian noise (i.e. 𝐱Tsubscript𝐱𝑇\\mathbf{x}_{T}) to the clean sample 𝐱0subscript𝐱0\\mathbf{x}_{0} is called sampling. Given the score function ∇log⁡pt​(𝐱^t;σt)∇subscript𝑝𝑡subscript^𝐱𝑡subscript𝜎𝑡\\nabla\\log p_{t}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t};\\sigma_{t}) which indicates the direction of the higher data density , the reverse process is formulated by a probability flow ODE [ref]2: where σ˙tsubscript˙𝜎𝑡\\dot{\\sigma}_{t} denotes a time derivative of σtsubscript𝜎𝑡{\\sigma}_{t}.\nGiven any noise 𝐱^T∼𝒩​(0,σT2​𝐈)similar-tosubscript^𝐱𝑇𝒩0superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑇2𝐈\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{T}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_{T}^{2}\\mathbf{I}), one can solve Eq. (6) via any numerical ODE solver, and generate real sample 𝐱^0∼pdata​(𝐱)similar-tosubscript^𝐱0subscript𝑝data𝐱\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{0}\\sim p_{\\text{data}}(\\mathbf{x}). Since the score function ∇log⁡pt​(𝐱^t;σt)∇subscript𝑝𝑡subscript^𝐱𝑡subscript𝜎𝑡\\nabla\\log p_{t}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t};\\sigma_{t}) is inaccessible in general, one can follow Karras et al. [ref]2 to use a learnable score network Dθ​(𝐱^t,σt)subscript𝐷𝜃subscript^𝐱𝑡subscript𝜎𝑡D_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t},\\sigma_{t}) to estimate it, formulated as:\n∇log⁡pt​(𝐱^t;σt)=(Dθ​(𝐱^t,σt)−𝐱^t)/σt2∇subscript𝑝𝑡subscript^𝐱𝑡subscript𝜎𝑡subscript𝐷𝜃subscript^𝐱𝑡subscript𝜎𝑡subscript^𝐱𝑡superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑡2\\nabla\\log p_{t}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t};\\sigma_{t})=(D_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t},\\sigma_{t})-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t})/\\sigma_{t}^{2}. For sampling quality  8  , the score network is often reparameterized to predict the noise. For example, in VP , the score network is defined as Dθ​(𝐱^t,σt):=𝐱^t−σt​Fθ​(μt​𝐱^t,t)assignsubscript𝐷𝜃subscript^𝐱𝑡subscript𝜎𝑡subscript^𝐱𝑡subscript𝜎𝑡subscript𝐹𝜃subscript𝜇𝑡subscript^𝐱𝑡𝑡D_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t},\\sigma_{t}):=\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t}-\\sigma_{t}F_{\\theta}(\\mu_{t}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{t},t), where a network Fθsubscript𝐹𝜃F_{\\theta} parameterized by θ𝜃\\theta predicts the noise ϵtsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡\\epsilon_{t}. Then one can train Fθsubscript𝐹𝜃F_{\\theta} via minimizing the loss: where λ​(σt)𝜆subscript𝜎𝑡\\lambda(\\sigma_{t}) denotes the standard loss weight to balance the loss at different noise levels σtsubscript𝜎𝑡\\sigma_{t} 3 [ref]2 4.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: stochastic gradient descent (SGD)  to update the parameter 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} per iteration: where 𝐠ksubscript𝐠𝑘\\mathbf{g}_{k} denotes the stochastic gradient, and α𝛼\\alpha is a step size.
