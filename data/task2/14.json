      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Interpretable and Robust Hand Detection via Pixel-wise Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks are widely adopted in many fields of study, e.g., computer vision and natural language processing, and achieve state-of-the-art results. However, as their inner workings are not transparent, the correctness and objectivity of the predicting results cannot be guaranteed and thus limit their development in industry. In recent years, some researchers have begun to explore interpretable deep leaning methods. [ref]1 focuses on network interpretability in medical image diagnosis.  decomposes output into contributions of its input features to interpret the image classification network. There is also a clear need to develop an interpretable neural network in driving monitoring as the predicting results will directly affect the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. In this paper, we present a highly interpretable neural network to detect hands in images, which is a basic task in driving monitoring. Hand detection in natural scenes plays an important role in virtual reality, human-computer interaction, driving monitoring  . It is a critical and primary task for higher-level tasks such as hand tracking, gesture recognition, human activity understanding. Particularly, accurately detecting hand is a vital part in monitoring driving behavior  . Detecting hands in images is a challenging task. The illumination conditions, occlusion, and color/shape similarity will bring great difficulties to hand detection. Moreover, hands are highly deformable objects, which hard to detect due to their variability and flexibility. Hands are not always shown in an upright position in images, so the rotation angle needs to be considered to locate the hand in images more accurately. The problem of hand detection has been studied for years. Traditional methods extract features such as skin-related features , hand shape and background, Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG)  to build feature vector for each sample. Then these vectors are used to train classifiers such as SVM . Although the hand-crafted features have clear meanings and are easy to understand, they are too limited to meet the requirements for the accuracy of hand detection in the real world. With the increasing influence of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the field of computer vision, many CNN-based object detection methods have emerged, Region-Based Convolutional Networks(R-CNNs) [ref]9, Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) , for example. Inspired by these advances, many CNN-based methods have been proposed to deal with hand detection. Features are extracted automatically by designed CNNs from the original images   or the region proposals  and then used to locate the hands in original images. In order to extract as many effective features as possible to detect hand more accurately, the network structure is always very complicated and therefore has a heavy computational burden. This limits its value in practical applications such as monitoring driving behavior and sign language recognition. The deep CNNs are used as black-boxes in the existing methods. Different from hand-crafted features, it is difficult to know the meaning of features extracted by CNNs. As a result, the stability and robustness of these methods cannot be guaranteed. In view of the issues mentioned above, we propose an interpretable framework, Pixel-wise Hand Detection Network (PHDN), to detect hands more efficiently. The proposed method achieves better performance with faster computational speed. An explainable module named Highlight Feature Fusion (HFF) block is developed to get more discriminative features. With HFF block, PHDN performs effectively and stably in different image contexts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to give reasonable explanations of learned features in the hand detection procedure. Popular deep convolutional neural networks VGG16  or ResNet50  is adopted as a backbone network in PHDN. The HFF block makes full use of multi-scale features by weighting the lower-level features with the higher-level features. In this way, the discriminative features, namely the effective ones for locating the hand, are highlighted in the detection procedure. Each HFF block fuses features from two layers. It first weights the lower-level features by the last higher-level feature maps and then fuses the features by convolution operations. Several HFF blocks are connected in cascade mode (see Fig. 1(b)) to iteratively fuse multi-scale features, which greatly reduces computational overhead and saves time compared to the serial connection (see Fig. 1(a)). As PHDN makes hand region predictions with multi-scale features, it is more robust to hands of different sizes. In other words, our model is scale-invariance. As for the rotated hand detection, adding additional rotation and derotation layers  makes the network more complicated and thus increases the computational burden and time overhead. We propose the rotation map and the distance map to store the rotation angle and the geometry information of the hand region respectively, which handles the rotation hands without increasing complexity of the network and learns more interpretable representations of angles by recording angles of pixels directly. In the training process, we add supervision to each HFF block. Deep supervision to the hidden layers makes the learned features more discriminative and robust, and thus the performance of the detector is better. The auxiliary losses accelerate the convergence of training in a simple and direct way compared with , which accelerates training by constraining the input weight of each neuron with zero mean and unit norm. Existing detection methods make predictions for grid cells  or default boxes , which need to seek appropriate anchor scales. Alternatively, we predict hand regions at pixel resolution to avoid the adverse effects of improper anchor scales settings, for which we name our model as Pixel-wise Hand Detection Network. Detecting hands at pixel level also explains what pixels are the basis for its decision, which improves transparency of the model. The hand regions predicted by PHDN are filtered by the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to yield the final detection results. To evaluate our model, experiments are conducted on two authentic and publicly accessible hand detection datasets, the VIVA hand detection dataset  and the Oxford hand detection dataset . Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our model achieves competitive Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR) on VIVA dataset with 4.23 times faster detecting speed, and obtains 5.5% AP improvement on Oxford dataset. Furthermore, we test the PHDN with the hand tracking task on VIVA hand tracking dataset [ref]19, which is a higher application scenario of hand detection. We try three tracking-by-detection methods: SORT tracker 0, deep SORT tracker 1 and IOU tracker 2, where the PHDN acts as a detector. Experimental results show that using any of the aforementioned tracking algorithms based on our detector can achieve better results than existing methods. It indicates that PHDN is robust and practicable as the detector performance plays a crucial role in tracking-by-detection multiple object tracking methods. Part of the work has been introduced in 3. The extensions made in this article compared to 3 are as follows: (1) We analyze the interpretability of our model by visualizing the features extracted by HFF block to interpret our model. It shows the mechanism of internal layers and demonstrates how our method outperforms the others. (2) We integrate our detector with the popular trackers to track hands in videos and achieve state-of-the-art results on the authoritative VIVA hand tracking challenge dataset [ref]19. (3) We give a more detailed description of our model including related work in hand detection and multiple hand tracking in vehicles, network architecture, feature fusion processing, loss functions and the settings and results of conducted experiments. The main contributions of this paper are in four folds: We give insight to the interpretability of the hand detection network for the first time. Reasonable explanations for the feature activated in hand detection procedure and the discriminative features learned by HFF block are first given. The proposed Pixel-wise Hand Detection Network predicts hand regions at pixel resolution rather than grid cells or default boxes. It gets rid of the adverse effects of inappropriate anchor scales and can detect different sizes of hands by fusing multi-scale features with the cascaded HFF blocks. The rotation map is designed to predict hand rotation angles precisely. It learns and represents the angles in an interpretable way with less computational cost. Auxiliary losses are added to provide supervision to hidden layers of the network, leading to faster convergence of the training and higher precision. Experiments on VIVA and Oxford hand detection datasets show that PHDN achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Evaluated on the VIVA hand tracking dataset, tracking-by-detection trackers such as SORT tracker, deep SORT tracker and IOU tracker with the PHDN detector outperform the existing hand tracking methods. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the related work in the field. Section 3 gives a detailed description of the proposed method. Section 4 introduces the datasets and experimental setup, reports and analyzes the results. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: objectivity of the predicting results cannot be guaranteed and thus limit their development in industry.
