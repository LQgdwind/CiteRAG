      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Automatic Modulation Classification Scheme Based on Multi-Scale Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nO’Shea et al. [ref]18 first exploited a two-layer CNN as the feature extractor and then classified the feature representations with a softmax classifier. It is well known that the increase of the depth of the network can boost the feature representation ability [ref]19, and result in the gradient vanishing and over-fitting problem. In [ref]20, the authors designed a deep residual network (ResNet) by using residual learning with skip connection for image classification, which alleviates the over-fitting problem when training deep networks, and is able to learn discriminative features for achieving a better performance. For AMC, the authors in  directly adopted ResNet to recognize the modulations. However, the classification performance is limited without any modifications of the network structure. O’Shea et al.  proposed a modified ResNet by taking real and imaginary (I/Q) parts of the received signals as the input for extracting features. The authors in  designed convolutional blocks with asymmetric kernels to acquire more powerful features. Instead of concentrating on the CNN structure, Qi et al.  adopted ResNet to learn multi-modal data combining I/Q data, envelope data and spectrum data. Multiple deep CNNs have been applied for boosting the performance of AMC in  and . However, a fixed kernel size of 3×1313\\times 1 convolution was adopted in these works, which cannot capture the long term spatio-temporal information.\nMeanwhile, West et al.  first proposed a convolutional long short-term deep neural networks (CLDNN) model which combines CNN and LSTM for modulation classification. The direct combination cannot perform very well due to its simple structure. Rajendran et al.  and Hu et al.  adopted LSTM, which can obtain high accuracy with fewer signal symbols. However, it requires a long training time due to its recurrent structure. Huang et al.  utilized an another kind of RNN named gated recurrent unit (GRU) to classify the received signals by exploring the timing correlation characteristics. However, both LSTM and GRU are time-consuming and these models can only be applied to few modulation formats. Typically, most CNNs and RNNs for AMC adopt the softmax classifier and the cross entropy loss (simplified as softmax loss) to implement the classification. However, the softmax loss can only learn separable features. Besides the basic structures of CNN and RNN for AMC, many other techniques were applied to improve the classification performance, such as feature fusion , , model acceleration, , complex networks , generative adversarial network (GAN) , , adversarial attacks .\nZheng et. al  investigated the feature fusion for CNN-base AMC methods, which shown better performance compared to the non-fusion method.\nIn , the authors adopted the principal component analysis to reduce the training time and achieved a good performance under low SNRs.\nWang et. al  designed a lightweight model with smaller model sizes and faster computational speed by using model compression.\nThe authors in  proposed a complex-valued network for AMC which can achieved a superior performance than the real-valued counterparts.\nA conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) was applied to in  to generate sufficient high-quality labeled data.\nLin et. al  studied the adversarial attacks for improving the reliability and security of AMC.\nThese techniques mentioned above can be utilized with the basic structure of CNN or RNN together to obtain a better classification performance. The performance of AMC has been greatly improved due to the powerful feature learning ability of the deep CNN or RNN models. However, the classification performance is subject to the variational noise conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, a typical pipeline of an AMC model consists of several stages, namely, input (data collection of the received signals like I/Q samples), feature extraction by CNN or RNN models, classification by the fully connected (FC) layer with the softmax loss. In these CNNs, kernel sizes such as 3×1313\\times 1 are usually utilized, similar to the image classification task. However, AMC is different from the image classification. AMC needs to learn a long term spatial correlation while image classification only needs to focus on the neighboring pixels in a small region. Thus, deeper convolutional layers with small kernel sizes cannot capture much spatial information about AMC. RNNs and LSTM can be used for learning long-term correlation. However, they are quite time-consuming. Instead of introducing the recurrent mechanism, CNNs with large kernels can also achieve high performance since larger kernels can learn longer spatial features [ref]20. Thus, the utilization of multi-scale convolutions with large kernels can achieve a high classification performance while the computation cost is maintained reasonably low. In the DL models, the softmax loss is used as the default metric since it is appropriate for classifying features in the space with a high dimension, and it has been applied in the most classification tasks in [ref]20 and . It enables the DL models to learn the separable features so that it can deal with the inter-class diversity . However, unlike other kinds of data such as images or sentences, which normally have a small difference among the same class, the signals here are very different under different SNRs due to the existence of noises. As shown in the input part of Fig. 1, the I/Q samples under the same modulation type with different SNRs (−66-6dB, 00dB, 666dB, 121212dB) have diverse wave shapes, which cause challenge for the classifier. The intra-class diversity is the major problem that makes the DL based models not to perform very well under the typical classification pipeline using the softmax loss. Under this situation, it is quite important to learn both discriminative and separable features, which are much easier to be classified compared to the separable features. The reason why the discriminative features are much easier to be classified is that the distances among the same class features are smaller. That is to say, the discriminative features can decrease the influence of the intra-class diversity caused by different SNRs. However, the existing works that used DL models to perform AMC cannot capture small intra-class scatters. Thus, it is urgent to find a scheme that can learn both separable and discriminative features for AMC.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: O’Shea et al.
