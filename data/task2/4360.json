Specifically, we conduct experiments on transferring the optimal architecture from image classification to crowd counting task  [ref]32   and segmentation .\nThe model trained with classification is typically used to initialize the model for downstream tasks  .\nIf the found network have the transferability, we will have the advantages as follows: (I) We do not need to spend extra time searching for a ticket for the new task;\n(II) The model for the new task inherits a good representation ability of the pretrained model; (III) The model with fewer SAMs has less forward and back-propagation cost compared with Full-SAM. In this case, the computational cost of our RL-based search shown in Table VI is acceptable. Crowd counting. Crowd counting aims to estimate the density map and predict the total number of people for a given image, whose efficiency is also crucial for many real-world applications, e.g., video surveillance and crowd analysis. However, most state-of-the-art works still rely on the heavy pre-trained backbone networks  for obtaining satisfactory performance on such dense regression problems. The experiments show that the Share-EAN trained on ImageNet serves as an efficient backbone network and can extract the representative features for crowd counting.\nWe evaluate the transferring performance on the commonly-used Shanghai Tech dataset , which includes two parts. Shanghai Tech part A (SHHA) has 482 images with 241,677 people counting, and Shanghai Tech part B (SHHB) contains 716 images with 88,488 people counting. Following the previous works, SHHA and SHHB are split into train/validation/test set with 270/30/182 and 360/40/316 images, respectively. The performance on the test set is reported using the standard Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), as shown in Table VII.\nOur Share-EANs outperform the baseline (Full-SA and Full-Share) while reducing the inference time increment by up to 28% compared with the baseline. \n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nModel\n\nMAE/MSE (↓↓\\downarrow)\n\nRelative Inference Time Increment (%)\n\n\nFull-SA\nFull-Share\nShare-EAN\n\nFull-SA\nFull-Share\nShare-EAN\n\nSHHB\nSE [ref]2\n\n9.5/15.93\n8.9/14.6\n8.6/14.7\n\n19.19\n19.19\n6.16 (↓↓\\downarrow 13.03)\n\nDIA [ref]5\n\n-\n9.1/14.9\n8.2/13.9\n\n-\n16.93\n8.71 (↓↓\\downarrow 8.22)\n\nSHHA\nSGE \n\n93.9/144.5\n91.6/143.1\n88.4/140.0\n\n58.98\n58.85\n30.55 (↓↓\\downarrow 28.30)\n\nSE [ref]2\n\n89.9/140.2\n89.9/140.2\n79.4/127.7\n\n49.50\n49.00\n21.07 (↓↓\\downarrow 27.93)\n\nDIA [ref]5\n\n-\n92.5/130.4\n90.3/141.6\n\n-\n51.75\n29.43 (↓↓\\downarrow 22.32)\n\n\n Semantic segmentation.\nWe verify the transferability of the Share-EAN on semantic segmentation task in Pascal VOC 2012  dataset. Table VIII shows the performance comparison of the backbone with different types of SAM, e.g., DIA and SE. Again, our results indicate that the Share-EAN can maintain the performance of the Full-Share network and significantly reduce the time increment compared with the Full-Share network, which shows Share-EAN has the capacity of transferring to segmentation. \n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nmIoU/mAcc/allAcc (%)\nTime Increment (%)\n\n\n\nOriginal ResNet\n69.39 / 78.87 / 92.97\n-\n\nFull-Share-SE\n73.03 / 82.13 / 93.74\n48.16\n\nShare-EAN-SE\n73.68 / 83.08 / 93.79\n16.43 (↓↓\\downarrow 31.73)\n\nFull-Share-DIA\n74.02 / 83.11 / 93.92\n64.86\n\nShare-EAN-DIA\n73.91 / 82.93 / 93.92\n7.68 (↓↓\\downarrow 57.18)\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: of the network architecture searched by our baseline method.
