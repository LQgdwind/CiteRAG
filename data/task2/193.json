      "content": "Paper Title: ESBM: An Entity Summarization BenchMark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe review methods and evaluation efforts for entity summarization. Methods for Entity Summarization.\nIn a recent survey  we have categorized the broad spectrum of research on entity summarization. Below we briefly review general-purpose entity summarizers which mainly rely on generic technical features that can apply to a wide range of domains and applications. We will not address methods that are domain-specific (e.g., for movies  or timelines ), task-specific (e.g., for facilitating entity resolution  or entity linking [ref]4), or context-aware (e.g., contextualized by a document 6 or a query ). RELIN  uses a weighted PageRank model to rank triples according to their statistical informativeness and relatedness. DIVERSUM 0 ranks triples by property frequency and generates a summary with a strong constraint that avoids selecting triples having the same property. SUMMARUM 4 and LinkSUM 3 mainly rank triples by the PageRank scores of property values that are entities. LinkSUM also considers backlinks from values. FACES , and its extension FACES-E  which adds support for literals, cluster triples by their bag-of-words based similarity and choose top-ranked triples from as many different clusters as possible. Triples are ranked by statistical informativeness and property value frequency. CD 8 models entity summarization as a quadratic knapsack problem that maximizes the statistical informativeness of the selected triples and in the meantime minimizes the string, numerical, and logical similarity between them.\nIn ES-LDA , ES-LDAext , and MPSUM 7, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is learned where properties are treated as topics, and each property is a distribution over all the property values. Triples are ranked by the probabilities of properties and values. MPSUM further avoids selecting triples having the same property. BAFREC  categorizes triples into meta-level and data-level. It ranks meta-level triples by their depths in an ontology and ranks data-level triples by property and value frequency. Triples having textually similar properties are penalized to improve diversity. KAFCA  ranks triples by the depths of properties and values in a hierarchy constructed by performing the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). It tends to select triples containing infrequent properties but frequent values, where frequency is computed at the word level. Limitations of Existing Benchmarks.\nFor evaluating entity summarization, compared with task completion based extrinsic evaluation, ground truth based intrinsic evaluation is more popular because it is easy to perform and the results are reproducible. Its idea is to create a benchmark consisting of human-made ground-truth summaries, and then compute how much a machine-generated summary is close to a ground-truth summary. Table 1 lists known benchmarks, including dedicated benchmarks 2   and those created for evaluating a particular entity summarizer  0  . It is not surprising that these benchmarks are not very large since it is expensive to manually create high-quality summaries for a large set of entities. Unfortunately, some of these benchmarks are not publicly available at this moment. Three are available 2   but they are relatively small and have limitations. Specifically, WhoKnows?Movies! 2 is not a set of ground-truth summaries but annotates each triple with the ratio of movie questions that were correctly answered based on that triple, as an indicator of its importance. This kind of task-specific ground truth may not be suitable for evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers. The other two available benchmarks were created for evaluating FACES/-E  . Classes and/or literals are not included because they could not be processed by FACES/-E and hence were filtered out. Such benchmarks could not comprehensively evaluate most of the existing entity summarizers  0 8 7   that can handle classes and literals. These limitations of available benchmarks motivated us to create a new ground truth consisting of general-purpose summaries for a larger set of entities involving more comprehensive triples where property values can be entities, classes, or literals.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: range of domains and applications. We will not address methods that are domain-specific (e.g., for movies  or timelines ), task-specific (e.g., for facilitating entity resolution  or entity linking [ref]4), or context-aware (e.g., contextualized by a document 6 or a query ). RELIN  uses a weighted PageRank model to rank triples according to their statistical informativeness and relatedness.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
