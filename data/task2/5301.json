      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Spatiotemporal Frequency-Transformer for Low-Quality Video Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideo super-resolution (VSR) is a fundamental task in computer vision, which aims to restore a sequence of high-resolution (HR) frames from its low-resolution (LR) counterparts. VSR can benefit a broad range of downstream applications, such as high-definition television  and video surveillance [ref]2.\nExisting VSR methods focus on leveraging temporal information from sliding windows [ref]3 [ref]4   or recurrent structures   , and have achieved great success in limited scenarios that usually take LR video frames with known degradation process as inputs. However, in real-world scenarios, most videos on the internet or on user devices are stored and transmitted in low-quality formats with unknown degradations. For example, low-resolution videos can be generated with various corruptions (downsampling with blur kernels, noises), and different compression algorithms. These complicated degradations result in different information loss, which makes it more challenging to recover the HR frames from low-quality LR counterparts. As shown in Figure 1, the low-quality frames with different degradations show different artifacts.\nSuch variational characteristics of low-quality videos make it harder to recover HR frames by using current VSR methods  0 1 since they are designed with known degradation process. To handle the problem of unknown degradation, the blind VSR methods 2 3 4 firstly estimate the degradation kernels and noise parameters, then design the special modules with the estimated degradation parameters to remove blur and noise.\nHowever, these designs are specific and not suitable for other degradations in real-world scenes, such as video compression.\nThe compression artifacts are generated from the quantification process acting on the image patches transformed by Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). Different from the global degradations in blur or noise, compression has different information lost on local patches and can not estimate its degradation process. Video compression is one of the commonest sources of degradation in real-world scenarios. For example, the most widely-used video codec H.264 takes a constant rate factor (CRF) varied from 00 to 515151 as its parameter to control the compression rate and results in varying degrees of degradations. As shown in Figure 2, the existing SOTA IconVSR method  fails to recover pleasant visual results on such compressed LR videos.\nThe compression artifacts are magnified during the restoration processes since this model takes unseen compression artifacts as common textures.\nLi et al. 5 retrain the model with compressed videos but achieve limited gain since it is hard for the model to recover high-frequency textures while simultaneously removing the high-frequency compression artifacts. To strengthen the awareness of compression, COMISR 5 predicts detail-aware flow to align features and restore HR frames by a Laplacian enhancement module. However, as shown in Figure 2, large gaps between the generated frame and the ground truth remain. Thus, compression degradation is difficult to process and needs special designs. Other real-world VSR methods propose new real-world datasets or pre-processing modules to deal with these problems. RealVSR 6 and RealBasicVSR 7 propose a new dataset for evaluation, while the real HR frames cannot be obtained for training. RealBasicVSR 7 uses a ”Pre-cleaning” module to remove artifacts before applying BasicVSR . However, the ”Pre-cleaning” module still cannot solve the video compression problem and has limited generalization ability in real-world scenarios since it needs degradation-cleaning image pairs for training. To handle these complicated degradations including compression in real-world scenarios, we propose a novel Frequency Transformer for low-quality Video Super-Resolution (FTVSR).\nThe insightful idea is to use the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to convert low-quality video frames into a series of frequency-based representations and then design frequency-based attention to enable interactions between frequency features across various frequency bands.\nThis design brings two key merits:\n1) The patch-based frequency representation treats each frequency band equitably, effectively preserving high-frequency visual information;\n2) frequency-based attention guides the generation of high-frequency textures from low-frequency information (e.g., object structure), which can significantly reduce the effect of corruption artifacts.\nIn order to remove the artifact caused by different degradations, we propose Dual Frequency Attention (DFA), which can capture the local and global frequency relations to better deal with different degradations, such as compression, blur, noise, and so on.\nFor example, compression artifacts show different patterns in the local areas of the image and need stronger local attention, while blur-based degradations show similar patterns in the global area and need more global attention.\nAdditionally, several frequency-based attentions that effectively combine with space and time attention are investigated to further extract the frequency interactions in both the spatial and temporal dimensions for VSR.\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose and successfully process VSR in the frequency domain, which is the first VSR work to introduce learning frequency dependencies. We propose frequency attention to build a frequency Transformer for VSR. Besides, we further propose enhanced dual frequency attention to handle the complicated degradations in the real-world VSR. We discuss different self-attention strategies for processing frequency-domain video and find that the highest video enhancement quality comes from ”divided attention,” which first performs a joint space-frequency attention before applying temporal-frequency attention to each frequency band. Extensive experiments on several widely-used VSR benchmarks with multiple complicated degradations and real-world VSR benchmarks show the superior performance of FTVSR. Our previous work 8 in conference proposed FTVSR for compressed video super-resolution, which restores the compressed LR videos by a frequency Transformer. In this work, we tackle the more complicated degradations of VSR in real-world scenarios.\nCompared with previous work, the new contributions lie in the following aspects:\n1) We further explore the local and global frequency relations in frequency attention, and propose novel enhanced dual frequency attention (DFA), which is introduced in Section 3.3. The novel DFA can capture local and global frequency relations for frequency Transformers, which achieves better results on multiple VSR benchmarks.\n2) We extend FTVSR to compressed videos with multiple compression algorithms in Section 4.3.2, including Constant Rate Factor (CRF), Constant Quantization Parameters, and Constant Bitrate, which shows the stronger generalization ability of FTVSR.\n3) We study the more complicated degradation in more real-world VSR, including Blur-based VSR in Section 4.3.3, Noise-based VSR in Section 4.3.4, and Real-world VSR in Section 4.3.5.\n4) The new FTVSR with DFA achieves state-of-the-art results on uncompressed, compressed, Blur-based, Noise-based, and real-world VSR benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: of high-resolution (HR) frames from its low-resolution (LR) counterparts.
