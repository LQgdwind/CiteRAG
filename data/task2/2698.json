      "content": "Paper Title: The Accuracy and Efficiency of Posit Arithmetic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the tremendous interest in Machine Learning (ML) which sparked new use\ncases and business opportunities, companies are deploying Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) models in users‚Äô devices, at the edge of the Internet.\nTypical architectures used by these edge devices include ARM CPU cores\nintegrated with a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and a Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU) to increase the performance of AI applications. In general, GPUs are more\ntime-energy efficient compared to CPUs when running ML applications, both during\nthe training and inference phases¬†[ref]9. But a recent study by\nFacebook¬†[ref]43, shows that only 20% of the smartphone SoCs have\naccelerators that are significantly more efficient than the CPU. In addition, it is\nmore tedious to program accelerators compared to CPUs, due to different\narchitecture, programming model and, sometimes, due to the immaturity of the\nSoftware Development Kit (SDK). Hence, it is important to optimize CPU inference\nperformance on mobile edge devices. ML computations take place in two different stages, namely (i) at model training\nwhen an ML model is built using huge datasets, and (ii) at inference when a new\nsample or small dataset is processed by a trained model. Traditionally, ML\ntraining is done on powerful accelerators, such as GPUs or Tensor Flow Units\n(TPUs)¬†. To achieve high accuracy, ML models increasingly use large\nnumbers of parameters and, at runtime, they induce a huge number of arithmetical\noperations. For example, VGG-16¬† from 2015 has\napproximately 138 million parameters and 15,300 million multiply-add\noperations¬† , while some current\nsubmissions for ImageNet classification have one billion parameters. This\nlevel of complexity is inappropriate for real-time applications, especially when\nthe inference is running on edge devices. To address the complexity of ML inference, researchers have explored both model\npruning and lower bit representations for the parameters. Recent\nstudies¬†  show that new floating-point\nrepresentations are more energy-efficient compared to the IEEE 754\nfloating-point standard implemented by all modern hardware processing units,\nincluding CPUs and GPUs. IEEE 754 hardware implementations use significant chip\narea and power because they need to handle many corner cases and exceptions\ndescribed by the standard. Some studies show that that this standard is\nerror-prone¬† and its different implementations may produce\ndifferent results¬†. Among the alternatives to IEEE 754, unum¬† and\nits third version, named posit¬† ,\nwere introduced by Gustafson to\nsolve some of the issues of IEEE 754 floating-point representation. Compared to\nIEEE 754, posit has variable length fields to represent the exponent and the\nfraction of a real number. Hence, posits can represent small numbers more\naccurately by reserving more bits for the fraction and fewer bits for the\nexponent. Moreover, posits have only two special representations, namely for 00\nand not-a-real (N‚Äãa‚ÄãRùëÅùëéùëÖNaR), whereas IEEE 754 reserves many binary representations\nfor not-a-number (N‚Äãa‚ÄãNùëÅùëéùëÅNaN). This feature, together with the non-existence of\nsubnormal make posit implementations simpler.\nIn this paper, we address the following research questions, (i) are posits more\nefficient than IEEE 754 for ML inferencing at the edge? (ii) what is a good\ntrade-off between accuracy and time-energy efficiency when employing lower bit\nsize posits? To answer these questions, we propose an alternative hardware-software approach\nfor efficient ML inference at the edge by (i) designing and implementing an\nElastic Posit Arithmetic Unit (POSAR) in a Rocket\nChip-based¬† RISC-V core replacing its IEEE 754\nfloating-point unit (FPU), and (ii) modifying existing software to run on this\nsystem.\nRISC-V¬† is an open-source architecture with limited\navailable hardware implementations. However, it is very promising due to its\nenergy efficiency and modular ISA, thus, it is timely to explore this new CPU\narchitecture for ML inference at the edge. Without modifying the ISA, we use the\nFùêπF extension of the RISC-V specification¬† but change the\ninternal processor representation of floating-point numbers to posit. To address\nthe challenge of executing the same application software on the modified\nhardware, we make minor high-level code changes and convert IEEE 754 constants\nto posit. To evaluate the POSAR, we use three application levels and compare their\naccuracy, execution time, and power consumed on an FPGA implementation. In\naddition, we compare the resource utilization of POSAR on the FPGA. Among the\nthree application levels, the first consists of computing the values of\nwell-known mathematical constants, such as œÄùúã\\pi and eùëíe for testing accuracy\nover a large number of operations. The second level represents kernels\nfrequently used in ML applications, such as matrix multiplication, k-means, and\nlinear regression, among others. The third level is a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) running on Cifar-10 dataset. Among the existing posit hardware\nimplementations¬† 2 3  4, most are accelerators, co-processors or stand-alone units. The closest\nwork to ours is PERI , which designs a PAU for the RISC-V\ncore SHAKTI implemented in Bluespec System Verilog for 32-bit posits.\nHowever, PERI is evaluated only on 32-bit posits with two exponent sizes while\nrunning image processing, FFT, trigonometric functions, and K-means. In\ncontrast, our proposed approach is elastic as it can be adapted to\ndifferent posit sizes. In this paper we have evaluated POSAR on three posit\nsizes of 8, 16, and 32 bits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\n(i) implement an POSAR in the Chisel language (a dialect of Scala) and integrate\nit into a Rocket Chip core, and (ii) evaluate a posit-enabled Rocket Chip system\non an FPGA. In addition, we release the code associated with our project and the\ndocumentation as open-source to aid future research in this\narea111https://github.com/dloghin/posar. In summary, we make the following contributions: We implement an Elastic Posit Arithmetic Unit (POSAR) in the Chisel\nlanguage to replace the traditional Floating Point Unit (FPU) in a Rocket Chip\nRISC-V core. In addition, we implement a Scala library for posit arithmetic to\ntest our POSAR. Our POSAR supports any posit size and exponent size, but in this paper\nwe instantiate it for three sizes: 8, 16, and 32 bits, respectively.\nWe test these instantiations in both simulation mode and on an Arty A7-100T\nFPGA. Our evaluation shows that POSAR with 32-bit posit achieves the same\naccuracy as the original FPU of Rocket Chip with 32-bit IEEE 754\nfloating-point. POSAR is logging fewer cycles, but uses more FPGA resources and\nconsumes more power. However, our energy measurements on the FPGA running a\nloop of two million iterations that computes œÄùúã\\pi show that 32-bit posit uses\nonly 6% more energy while being 30% faster compared to 32-bit IEEE 754\nfloat. We show that 8-bit posit is not suitable to replace 32-bit IEEE 754\nfloat in scientific and classic ML applications due to low accuracy. On\nthe other hand, 16-bit posit offers the best option in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency. For example, 16-bit posit achieves the same Top-1 accuracy as\n32-bit IEEE 754 single-precision format on a Cifar-10 CNN with a speedup of\n18%. Moreover, a hybrid approach where 8-bit posit is used to store\nparameters in memory and a 16-bit posit POSAR is used for computations leads to\nno loss of accuracy on the Cifar-10 CNN. In the next section, we provide details on ML complexity, posit and RISC-V. In\nSection¬†III we summarize related works. In\nSection¬†IV we present the design of our POSAR and discuss the\nchallenges of enabling existing applications to run on it. In\nSection¬†V we evaluate our approach before concluding in\nSection¬†VI.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: to increase the performance of AI applications.
