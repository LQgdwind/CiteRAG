      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Group Robustness in the presence of Partial Group Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaselines.\nWe contrast the performance of our method with respect to a few well-known baselines. ERM: Empirical Risk Minimization that optimizes aggregate average loss over all the samples in the training dataset. Unsup DRO [ref]14: Samples with losses exceeding a threshold Œ∑ùúÇ\\eta are considered as a group whose average loss is optimized. Since the method doesn‚Äôt require group labels, it is an unsupervised algorithm. The method Unsup DRO, similar to CVaR DRO , requires a wider hyper-parameter search relative to the other baselines. More details in Appendix¬†A.4. Group DRO [ref]35: A method that optimizes the Rawlsian criterion by assigning simplex weights to the groups.\nThe group labels for individual samples are assumed to be available, hence this method is fully-supervised in terms of the group label. Group DRO (Partial): We consider another variant of Group DRO that only uses samples with group labels at train time. We call the method Group DRO (Partial), to contrast with the above baseline, Group DRO (Oracle). We compare above methods with our proposal, Worst-off DRO. Note that our approach requires marginal probabilities as an input to the algorithm, which are computed from the training dataset in our experiments. All our baselines for experiments are single-stage approaches similar to our method Worst-off DRO. We provide a comparison to two-stage methods in Section¬†2. For baselines and Worst-off DRO implementations, samples are drawn randomly for every batch ensuring an unbiased comparison to the ERM baseline. This is unlike [ref]35 who adopt a weighted sampling procedure which could be noisy when group labels are uncertain or missing as in our problem. 111Minor differences, in the accuracies of the Group DRO baseline to those reported in [ref]35, are due to the random sampling scheme of samples during batch-wise updates.  Evaluation Metrics.\nWe set aside a test set whose group labels are fully available. Since all of our datasets characterize a classification task, we evaluate overall accuracies and per-group accuracies in our experiments. Specifically, we highlight the accuracy of the minority group (min) together with the overall (avg) accuracy where individual samples are equally weighted regardless of their group. Model Selection.\nModel selection plays a crucial role when distributional differences are observed in a dataset [ref]13. In our problem setting, individual groups may differ from each other in the joint distribution over the data and the label space, however, the testing set resembles the training set. That is, there are no out of distribution samples and the focus is to improve robustness over a predefined set of groups common to both training and testing datasets. Consequently, among the recommendations made in [ref]13, a training domain validation set is a feasible strategy for our problem. In our algorithm, learning rate and weight decay are important hyper-parameters. Prior works [ref]35  noted that ERM fails to optimize for the minority group‚Äôs performance under high regularization regime thus necessitating an alternative. Hence, we compare our methods in this regime. We also tune for algorithmic specific hyper-parameters for each baseline. These hyper-parameters are the loss threshold in Unsup DRO (Œ∑UDROsubscriptùúÇUDRO\\eta_{\\text{UDRO}}) and the step size for the group weights in Group DRO (Œ∑GDROsubscriptùúÇGDRO\\eta_{\\text{GDRO}}) and in Worst-off DRO (Œ∑WDROsubscriptùúÇWDRO\\eta_{\\text{WDRO}}). A list of all hyper-parameter choices used in the experiments is provided in the Appendix¬†A.6. All the numbers reported in the paper were averaged over three random seeds. We adopt NVP (novel validation procedure)  in our experiments. In this procedure, we first search for hyper-parameters with the best overall accuracy. Then, from the top five best performing hyper-parameters, we select the model that achieves the highest minority group accuracy. Such a procedure offers robustness to hyper-parameters in the reported numbers.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: performance of our method with respect to a few well-known baselines.
