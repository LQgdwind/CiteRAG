      "content": "Paper Title: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Finding Non-Exploitable Strategies in Two-Player Atari Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) in multi-agent systems has succeeded in many challenging tasks, including Go , hide-and-seek [ref]5, Starcraft [ref]39, Dota , Poker  [ref]10 , and board games  .\nExcept for Poker systems, a large number of these works measure their success in terms of performance against fixed agents, average human players or experts in a few shots. Nevertheless, a distinguishing feature of games is that the opponents can further model the learner’s behaviors, adapt their strategies, and exploit the learner’s weakness. It is highly unclear whether the policies found by many of these multi-agent systems remain viable against the adversarial exploitation of the opponents. In this paper, we consider two-player zero-sum Markov games (MGs), and our objective is to find the Nash Equilibrium (NE) . By definition, the NE strategy is a stationary point where no player has the incentive to deviate from its current strategy. Due to the minimax theorem, the NE strategy for one player is also the best solution when facing against the best response of the opponent. That is, NE in two-player zero-sum games is a natural solution that is free from the exploitation by adversarial opponents. The concepts of Nash equilibrium and non-exploitability have been well studied in the community of learning extensive-form games (EFGs) such as Poker  [ref]10  .\nHowever, directly applying EFGs algorithms to solve MGs requires us to first convert MGs with general transitions to EFGs with tree-structured transitions. The conversion will lead to an exponential blow-up in the game size in the worst case (especially when there are many states that can be reached by a large number of different paths), resulting in significant inefficiency in practice.\nAnother line of prior works   directly combine the best-response-based algorithm for finding NE in normal-form games, such as fictitious play  and double oracle , with single-agent deep RL algorithm such as DQN  and PPO  for finding the best-response. While these approaches are designed for solving MGs, they do not utilize the detailed game-theoretic structure within MGs beyond treating it as normal-form games, which will again lead to the significant inefficiency in learning (see detailed theoretical arguments in Section 2, and empirical performance on tabular and Atari environments in Section 5). This paper proposes two new, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning algorithms for learning the Nash equilibrium of two-player zero-sum MGs: Nash Deep Q-Network (Nash_DQN), and its variant Nash Deep Q-Network with Exploiter (Nash_DQN_Exploiter).\nNash_DQN effectively combines (a) the recent deep learning techniques DQN  for addressing single-agent RL with continuous state space and function approximation, with (b) the classic algorithms Nash VI or Nash Q-learning  for solving tabular Markov games.\nNash_DQN_Exploiter is a variant of Nash_DQN which explicitly train an exploiting opponent during its learning. The exploiting opponent stimulates the exploration for the main agent. Both algorithms are the practical variants of theoretical algorithms which are guaranteed to efficiently find Nash equilibria in the basic tabular setting. Experimental evaluations are conducted on both tabular MGs and two-player video games, to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms. As shown in Fig. 1, the video games in our experiments include five two-player Atari games in PettingZoo library   and a benchmark environment Slime Volley-Ball . Due to the constraints of computational resource, we consider the RAM-based version of Atari games, and truncate the length of each game to 300 steps. We test the performance by training adversarial opponents using DQN that directly exploit the learner’s policies. Our experiments in both settings show that our algorithms significantly outperform standard algorithms for MARL including Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP)  and Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) , in terms of the robustness against adversarial exploitation.\nThe code for experiments is released.111The repositories for code implementation are released: 1. https://github.com/quantumiracle/nash-dqn is an independent implementation of our proposed algorithms; 2. MARS (https://github.com/quantumiracle/MARS) is a library for MARL algorithm evaluation. Even though our Nash_DQN algorithm is a natural integration of existing deep learning techniques and classic algorithms for MGs, to our best knowledge, this natural algorithm has never been formally proposed before. Neither has it been thoroughly tested, and compared against existing popular algorithms in representative environments such as Atari games, especially in terms of robustness to exploitation. We believe there lies the main contribution of this paper, to fill this important missing piece in the literature.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Reinforcement learning (RL) in multi-agent systems has succeeded in many challenging tasks, including Go , hide-and-seek [ref]5, Starcraft [ref]39, Dota , Poker  [ref]10 , and board games  .\nExcept for Poker systems, a large number of these works measure their success in terms of performance against fixed agents,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
