      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse Attention Acceleration with Synergistic In-Memory Pruning and On-Chip Recomputation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBenchmarks.\nWe use the following models to evaluate the efficacy of Sprint: BERT-Base (BERT-B) , BERT-Large (BERT-L) ,\nALBERT-X-Large (ALBERT-XL) ,\nALBERT-XX-Large (ALBERT-XXL) ,\nViT-Base (ViT-B) ,\nand GPT-2-Large (GPT-2-L) [ref]111.\nWe employ the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQUAD)  to test BERT-B, BERT-L, ALBERT-XL, ALBERT-XXL, the WikiText-2  to test GPT-2-L, and CIFAR10  dataset to test the ViT-B.\nWe use the default sequence length (s𝑠s) of 197, 384, and 1024 for the CIFAR10, SQUAD and WikiText-2 datasets, respectively.\nAll models use an embedding size of d=64𝑑64d=64.\nOn top of the above datasets, we create two additional synthetic models Synth1 and Synth2 with 2K and 4K sequences.\nThese additional models estimate the projected benefit of Sprint architecture for longer input sequences. Model fine-tuning for target benchmarks.\nFor the baseline, we use pre-trained models from HuggingFace  and fine-tune them on each task with the reported hyperparameters   [ref]39.\nWe only alter batch size due to our limited GPU memory.\nNonetheless, even with reduced batch size, the final accuracy after fine-tuning does not change discernibly.\nFollowing the described methodology , we implement differentiable soft thresholding into the studied transformer models.\nWe identify the optimal pruning threshold per attention layer as part of the task-specific fine-tuning process.\nWe use identical hyperparameters for training, except for the learning rate and the number of epochs.\nThe search space for the model learning rate is {2​e−32superscript𝑒32e^{-3}, 2​e−42superscript𝑒42e^{-4}, 2​e−52superscript𝑒52e^{-5}}, whereas the search space of {2​e−52superscript𝑒52e^{-5}, 2​e−62superscript𝑒62e^{-6}} is used for the learned threshold.\nThe number of epochs varies from one to three depending on the target tasks.\nWe conduct our experiments with PyTorch v1.10  on an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU, except for GPT-2-L, for whcih we use an Nvidia A100 GPU. The resulting pruning rates for BERT-B, BERT-L, ALBERT-XL, ALBERT-XXL, ViT-B, and GPT-2-L are 74.6%, 75.5%, 65.1%, 73.1%, 64.4%, and 73.9%, respectively.\nFor Synth1 and Synth2, we set a pruning rate of 75% and a padding ratio of 50%.\nThe estimated main memory access when switching to new query vector for Synth1 and Synth2 are obtained by scaling up the numbers from BERT-B based on the sequence length difference. Sprint hardware simulations.\n\nTable I lists the design parameters of Sprint for three studied configurations:\n(1) S-Sprint: a CORELET with 16KB,\n(2) M-Sprint: two CORELETs with 32KB,\nand (3) L-Sprint: four CORELETs with 64KB total on-chip buffer capacity.\nWe use Cadence Genus 19.1  for the logic synthesis and Cadence Innovus 19.1  for the placement/routing (PnR) of digital blocks with a 65 nm TSMC general-purpose standard cell library.\nWe generate the digital blocks to meet the target frequency of 1 GHz from the post-layout simulations.\nFor SRAM on-chip memories, we use ARM Memory Compiler with High density 65 nm single-port SRAM (version r0p0)  to measure its energy consumption.\nReRAM crossbar in-memory operation consumes 0.10 pJ / MAC in 65 nm including the digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) .\nThe standard ReRAM read/write operations consume 3.1 pJ/bit and 24.4 pJ/bit, respectively Compared to NVSim [ref]38 with a similar configuration, we use a more conservative model with 1.6×\\times and 7.2×\\times higher read delay and energy, respectively, to accommodate for additional ReRAM overheads..\nEach analog comparator consumes 41 fJ .\nA recent study of ReRAM in-memory computing  has shown that 64-tap in-memory dot-product delivers 5-bit equivalent output accuracy.\nTo emulate the limited accuracy of the in-memory thresholding, we use an identical error specification in Section III-A with b=5𝑏5b=5. Sprint performance simulator.\n\nWe collect the numbers of in-memory dot-product operations and analog comparisons, read accesses to ReRAM, on-chip q×𝒦T𝑞superscript𝒦𝑇q\\times\\mathcal{K}^{T} for unpruned elements, accesses to LUTs, and division operations for Softmax.\nIn addition, we compile the numbers of additions and multiplications to calculate the weighted sum of v𝑣v vectors.\nFor the numbers of read accesses to ReRAM, the simulator properly accounts for the spatial locality between adjacent queries and limited on-chip memory capacity.\nFinally, because the majority of these statistics are input-dependent, we average these numbers across the entire input dataset for each model.\nFor energy consumption, we multiply the average number of operations across the self-attention layers by their corresponding energy consumption from post-layout simulation along with the reported access energy for ReRAM, as listed in Table II.\nFor latency and throughout estimation, we calculate the delay of self-attention layers while taking into account the in-memory thresholding compute delay along with the communication delay between ReRAM arrays and CORELETs.\nWe also implement token interleaving (See Section VI), which distributes tokens across the entire input dataset to CORELETs.\nSuch interleaving better leverages the spatial localities between k𝑘k vectors and minimizes the imbalance factor.\nWe report the delay of each self-attention layer as the worst-case delay across the N𝑁N CORELETs. Baseline architecture.\nWe employ the same configuration of S-Sprint, M-Sprint, and L-Sprint, but without the in-memory pruning, proposed memory controller, and two-dimensional computing reduction for the padded sequences.\nWe compare Sprint and the baseline at iso-setups including the same frequency, the number of processing elements, on-chip memory capacity, and bit widths for all the input and output of digital logic blocks. Comparison to prior systems.\nA3superscript𝐴3A^{3} , SpAtten , and LeOPArd  also support the run-timing pruning to minimize the required computation.\nA3superscript𝐴3A^{3} is a prior state of the art on using approximation to accelerate attention mechanism.\nA3superscript𝐴3A^{3} thresholds after processing a limited number of k𝑘k vectors from the sorted queue in a magnitude order to minimize the run-timing pruning overhead.\nNonetheless, A3superscript𝐴3A^{3} does not consider the data movement cost from the main memory assuming enough on-chip memory capacity.\nLeOPArd performs the gradient-based training to co-optimize the model accuracy and pruning rate by tuning the pruning threshold automatically during the training instead of empirical methods. Again, LeOPArd does not consider the cost from main memory access.\nSpAtten proposed a cascaded pruning to exclude the redundant heads and tokens from all the subsequent layers once those are pruned in the previous layer.\nSpAtten reduces the DRAM access cost for GPT-2, but not for other models assuming enough on-chip capacity.\n\nReference markers found: [111]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]111: models to evaluate the efficacy of Sprint: BERT-Base (BERT-B) , BERT-Large (BERT-L) ,\nALBERT-X-Large (ALBERT-XL) ,\nALBERT-XX-Large (ALBERT-XXL) ,\nViT-Base (ViT-B) ,\nand GPT-2-Large (GPT-2-L) [ref]111.\nWe employ the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQUAD)  to test BERT-B, BERT-L, ALBERT-XL, ALBERT-XXL, the WikiText-2  to test GPT-2-L, and CIFAR10  dataset to test the ViT-B.\nWe use the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
