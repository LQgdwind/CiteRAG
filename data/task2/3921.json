      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Representation via Dynamic Feature Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we introduce the datasets and implementation details for adversarial attack defensing and OOD detection tasks, respectively. a) Adversarial Robustness. The robustness of the proposed method against adversarial attacks is evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR100  and Tiny ImageNet. The WideResNet  with depth of 28 and width of 10 (WRN-28-10) is adopted as the backbone for CIFAR-10/100. While, for the Tiny-ImageNet [ref]8, the backbone is set as PreActResNet18 . For data augmentation, we employ horizontal flipping and cropping from the image padded by four pixel on each side in this experiment. To guarantee the fairness of performance comparison, all the experiments are conducted under the same training protocol. In particular, the models are trained using SGD with a weight decay of 0.0005 and a momentum of 0.9. Models are observed to converge after 200 epochs of training. The list of learning rate is set to [0.1, 0.02, 0.004, 0.0008], in which the learning rate decreases to the next after every 60 training epochs. The noise term œÉùúé\\sigma is set to 0.05 for CIFAR-10 and 0.005 for CIFAR-100, respectively. Attack Methods. To evaluate the robustness against adversarial attacks, three popular adversarial attack methods, including FGSM , PGD   and CW , are involved in this study. The perturbation budget is set to 8/255 and 4/255 under l‚àûsubscriptùëôl_{\\infty} norm distance for single- and multi-step attacks. PGD-KùêæK denotes a KùêæK-step attack with a step size of 2/255. For CW, two cases are taken into account, in which the steps are both set to 100 steps and cùëêc is set to 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. Benchmarking Methods and Evaluation Criterion. Two interpolation-based methods, including Mixup  and Manifold-Mixup , are involved for comparison in this study. Although there are recent papers proposing new ways to mix samples in the input space  3 , they do not achieve significant improvements over Mixup or Manifold-Mixup, especially against adversarial attacks . Therefore, Mixup and Manifold-Mixup remain the most relevant competing methods among the zoo of Mixup. Note that our mixing strategy is based on Manifold-Mixup, which performs as a solid baseline to validate the effectiveness of Dynamic Feature Aggregation. For a more comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, an effective adversarial training, free-AT , is also included for reference as the upper bound. The evaluation metric is the classification accuracy on the whole test set. b) Out-of-Distribution Detection. In the OOD detection scenario, the training set of CIFAR-10  is adopted as the in-distribution data, and the test set of CIFAR-10 refers to the positive samples for OOD detection. Similar to the prior works [ref]47  [ref]26 , the OOD datasets include Tiny-ImageNet [ref]8 and LSUN . Tiny-ImageNet (a subset of ImageNet [ref]8) consists of 10,000 test images with a size of 36 √ó\\times 36 pixels, which can be categorized to 200 classes. LSUN  consists of 10,000 test samples from 10 different scene groups. Since the image size of Tiny-ImageNet and LSUN are not identical with that of CIFAR-10, two downsampling strategy (crop (C) and resize (R)) are adopted for image size unification, following the protocol of [ref]26  [ref]47.\nTherefore, we have four OOD test datasets, i.e., TIN-C, TIN-R, LSUN-C and LSUN-R. The training protocol and backbone for OOD detection is identical to Sec.¬†6.1 a. Benchmarking Methods and Evaluation Criterion. For the competing methods, Softmax Pred. 7, Counterfactual , CROSR , OLTR  and Union of 1D Subspaces [ref]47 are included. We also exploit the solutions using Monte Carlo sampling or OOD samples [ref]26  as the references for competing methods. To some extent, these methods can be seen as the upper bound for OOD detection regardless of time-consumption and over-fitting.\nFor example, Monte Carlo sampling   could generally yield improvements to most of current OOD methods with huge extra\ncomputational costs. The evaluation metric for OOD detection is the F1 score‚Äîthe maximum score over all possible threshold œï‚àósuperscriptitalic-œï\\phi^{*}.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: attacks is evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR100  and Tiny ImageNet.
