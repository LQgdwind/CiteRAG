Developing such high-performance models is a costly process for companies .\nThey often provide their models as a service through an  Application Programming Interface (API). This enables users to have predictions for their queries. Besides, state-of-the-art  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are more and more computationally expensive and require intensive memory, which in some cases hinder their deployment in embedded devices. Therefore, during the past years, researchers proposed to quantize DNNs without significantly affecting their performance [ref]3.\nThis enables a DL model to run efficiently on edge devices to enable a service for a user (e.g. smartphones) or other applications in the system (e.g. autonomous vehicle). Sharing models as a black box to users or between companies creates a dilemma for the model owner since there might be a financial risk of  Intellectual Property (IP) theft.\nSome research work focuses on obfuscating the model architecture to hinder attackers from retrieving the original model architecture.\nNevertheless, the model obfuscation is useless when the attacker can retrieve a surrogate model using only the prediction API [ref]4.\nAn attacker can act as a normal user and send input queries to the DL model. Leveraging the output predictions, a malicious user can train a high-accuracy and high-fidelity copy of the original model.\nIn addition, model stealing attacks can be used to facilitate other attacks such as adversarial attacks where the attacker creates malicious examples to evade the model classification . Previous work proposed different defenses against API-based model stealing attacks.\nSome work proposes to withhold information about probabilities, but this reduces the model’s transparency and utility [ref]4.\nThe prediction confidence is important information, especially for critical systems, e.g. in an autonomous vehicle the system might take an action only when a confidence threshold is reached.\nOther work proposes to add perturbations to the prediction probabilities in a way that reduces the attacker performance [ref]6  .\nHowever, these techniques often inject high perturbation which hurts the model transparency or even reduces its performance.\nAdditionally, state-of-the-art defense techniques are computationally expensive.\nDespite the focus of previous work on maintaining the defender model’s performance by adding a minimal perturbation, none of them measure their defenses’ impact on the model inference latency [ref]6  .\nIn critical systems, inference latency is very important which makes state-of-the-art defenses infeasible.\nWhen developing DL models targeting edge devices, it is crucial to have\nefficient algorithms\nthat neither overload the system nor reduce its utility [ref]3. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel efficient perturbation-based defense alternative called  Deception (DCP).\nOur heuristic approach aims to deceive the attacker and decrease the accuracy of his stolen model by adding an adaptive noise that deviates the probability scores without increasing the inference time. In order to keep the model’s transparency, we aim to decrease the attack performance with a low amount of perturbation.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to propose a defense that takes into account the attack performance, the defender’s accuracy, the perturbation level, the inference time, the energy consumption and the number of required models to perform the defense (Table I).\nWe test our approach on several vision datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 , SVHN 0, GTSRB 1 and CUB200 2.\nOur evaluation proves that our technique is effective in defending against three state-of-the-art model stealing attacks KnockoffNets 3, MAZE 4 and DFME 5.\nWe find better or comparable results with state-of-the-art defenses in the matter of the perturbation budget and the attack performance.\nFurthermore,\nour technique outperforms the state-of-the-art\ndefenses\nGRAD2  and MAD [ref]6\nwith a faster inference latency by consuming less energy and without relying on other surrogate models.\nWe validate our approach on large (i.e., original architecture) and quantized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\nWe show that the latter is as vulnerable to model stealing attacks as their corresponding original models.\nOur technique succeeds in defending against these attacks in the quantization setting which ensures that our defense extends to real-world applications in edge devices.\nOur code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/KacemKhaled/defending-extraction The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:\nSection II reviews the state-of-the-art that relates to model stealing attacks and defenses, and CNNs quantization;\nSection III details our methodology;\nwe include our experiments and obtained results in Section IV;\nand Section V concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: memory, which in some cases hinder their deployment in embedded devices.
