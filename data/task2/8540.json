Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Recent Developments in Deep Learning-based Author Name Disambiguation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ideal way to compare state-of-the-art methods in deep learning is following these two criteria: Studies must evaluate their results on the same or comparable datasets. Studies must evaluate their results with the same evaluation metrics. Most of the studies selected by this review rely on datasets derived from AMiner and evaluate their results with Precision, Recall and F1 metrics. For this reason we provide a detailed confrontation of them below. The results from the studies analyzed show significant variation in performance, with the highest F1-score achieved by Xie, Liu, Wang, and Jia (2022) , reaching an impressive 89.7, followed by Cheng, Chen, Zhang, and Tang (2024)  with an F1-score of 87.72. Zhao et al. (2020)  achieved a score of 86.22 using the CONNA model with fine-tuning, while Xiong, Bao, and Wu (2021)  achieved 84.7. Sun et al. (2020)  recorded an F1-score of 82.53, and Yan, Peng, Li, Li, and Wang (2020)  reached 81.3. The study by Gong, Fang, Peng, et al. (2024)  showed an F1-score of 76.21, while Pooja, Mondal, and Chandra (2022)  achieved 75.6.\nAt the lower end, Zhou, Chen, Wang, Xu, and Zhao (2021)  obtained a score of 74.96, followed by Zhang et al. (2021)  with 73.13. Ma, Wu, and Lu (2020) [ref]35 recorded 72.40, while Zhang, Yu, Liu, and Wang (2020)  had a score of 70.19. Rettig, Baumann, Sigloch, and Cudré-Mauroux (2022)  achieved 70.0, and Kim et al. (2019) [ref]19 reached 69.14. Zhang, Y., Zhang, F., Yao, P., and Tang, J. (2018)  scored 67.79, while Santini et al. (2022)  had two models with F1-scores of 64.18 (LAND-glin) and 63.07 (LAND-ggru).\nTable  1 summarises the collected results for AMiner. Among those based on the DBLP dataset, we have [ref]16 with an F1 score of 0.98 and B with a score of 0.975,  with a score of 0.875, and  with a score of 0.737. Among the methods based on the CiteSeerX dataset, we have  with an F1 score of 71.9,  with a score of 71.3,  with a score of 69.8, and  with a score of 68.1. For the methods based on the PubMed dataset,  achieves the highest F1 score of 95.95, followed by [ref]19 with a score of 89.29. Methods based on the Scopus dataset exploit 2 that achieves the highest F1 score of 99.6, followed by 3 with a score of 96.92. For other datasets,1 achieves an F1 score of 90.0 on the Dutch Central Catalogue (https://picarta.on.worldcat.org/discovery). Meanwhile, 7, which collects documents from various heterogeneous academic search services—including research papers, national R&D reports, patents, and research reports—achieves an impressive score of 99.0.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Mondal, and Chandra (2022)  achieved 75.6.\nAt the lower end, Zhou, Chen, Wang, Xu, and Zhao (2021)  obtained a score of 74.96, followed by Zhang et al. (2021)  with 73.13. Ma, Wu, and Lu (2020) [ref]35 recorded 72.40, while Zhang, Yu, Liu, and Wang (2020)  had a score of 70.19. Rettig, Baumann, Sigloch, and Cudré-Mauroux (2022)  achieved 70.0, and Kim et al. (2019) [ref]19 reached 69.14.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
