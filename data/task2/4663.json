      "content": "Paper Title: Deep autoencoders for physics-constrained data-driven nonlinear materials modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this framework, the material behavior is described by means of\nstrain and stress tensors (𝐄^,𝐒^)^𝐄^𝐒(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}) given by the material genome database. A material database 𝔼={(𝐄^I,𝐒^I)}I=1M∈ℰ𝔼superscriptsubscriptsubscript^𝐄𝐼subscript^𝐒𝐼𝐼1𝑀ℰ\\mathbb{E}=\\{(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}_{I},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{I})\\}_{I=1}^{M}\\in\\mathcal{E} is defined to store the material data,\nwhere M𝑀M is the number of material data points, and the hat symbol ”∧\\wedge” is used to denote material data. Here, ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} denotes the admissible set of material database, which will be further discussed in Section 2.3.\nTo search for the most suitable (closest) strain-stress pairs (𝐄^∗,𝐒^∗)superscript^𝐄superscript^𝐒(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}^{*},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^{*}) for a given state (𝐄,𝐒)𝐄𝐒(\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{S}), an energy-like distance function extended from  is defined: with\n where ℂ^^ℂ\\hat{\\mathbb{C}} is a predefined symmetric and positive-definite tensor used to properly regulate the distances between (𝐄,𝐒)𝐄𝐒(\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{S}) and (𝐄^,𝐒^)^𝐄^𝐒(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}). Usually, the selection of the coefficient matrix ℂ^^ℂ\\hat{\\mathbb{C}} depends on the a priori knowledge of the given dataset. One widely adopted normalization scheme in machine learning is based on the variance of the data, but the selection is not unique. For example, the Mahalanobis distance of data is employed to compute the coefficient matrices [ref]31. Recently, He et al. [ref]1 proposed to use the ratio of the standard deviations of the associated components of the stress–strain data to construct a diagonal coefficient matrix. Henceforth, the strain-stress pair (𝐄^,𝐒^)∈ℰ^𝐄^𝐒ℰ(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}})\\in\\mathcal{E} extracted from the material database is called the material data (state), whereas (𝐄,𝐒)𝐄𝐒(\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{S}) is called the physical state if it satisfies the physically admissible set 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} given by the equilibrium and compatibility equations in Eq. (1), denoted as (𝐄,𝐒)∈𝒞𝐄𝐒𝒞(\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{S})\\in\\mathcal{C}. As a result, the data-driven modeling problem can be formulated as: This data-driven problem is solved by fixed-point iterations, where the minimization of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} with respect to (𝐄,𝐒)𝐄𝐒(\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{S}) and (𝐄^,𝐒^)^𝐄^𝐒(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}) are performed iteratively until the intersection of two sets, 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} and ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}, is found within a prescribed tolerance. We denote the minimization corresponding to the material data as the local step, i.e. Eq. (3), while the one associated with the physical state as the global step, which will be discussed as follows. Given the optimal material data (𝐄^∗,𝐒^∗)superscript^𝐄superscript^𝐒(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}^{*},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^{*}), the global step of the data-driven problem (6) is expressed as the following constrained minimization problem [ref]1: With the Lagrange multipliers 𝝀𝝀\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} and 𝜼𝜼\\boldsymbol{\\eta}, Eq. (7) is transformed to the minimization of the following functional: The Euler-Lagrange equation of Eq. (8) indicates that 𝜼=−𝝀𝜼𝝀\\boldsymbol{\\eta}=-\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} on ΓtXsuperscriptsubscriptΓ𝑡𝑋\\Gamma_{t}^{X} and 𝝀=𝟎𝝀0\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}=\\boldsymbol{0} on ΓuXsuperscriptsubscriptΓ𝑢𝑋\\Gamma_{u}^{X} . Consequently, we have By means of integration by parts and the divergence theorem, Eq. (9) is reformulated as The stationary conditions of Eq. (10) read: As Eq. (11b) provides correction between the physical stress 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} and the material stress data 𝐒∗superscript𝐒\\mathbf{S}^{*}, a collocation approach is considered in Eq. (11b) to yield: which represents the stress solution update. Substituting Eq. (12) into Eqs. (11a) and (11c) yields:\n The solutions 𝐮𝐮\\mathbf{u} and 𝝀𝝀\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} are solved from Eqs. (13) by means of the Newton-Raphson method , and the physical state stress 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} is subsequently obtained from (12).\nAs such, Eqs. (12)-(13) are the computational procedures to solve Eq. (7).\nMoreover, in this boundary value problem, Eq. (13), the optimal material data (𝐄^∗,𝐒^∗)superscript^𝐄superscript^𝐒(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}^{*},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^{*}) not only provides the underlying material information learned from material database, but also serves as the material data-based connection to relate the strain in compatibility and the stress in equilibrium equations in Eqs. (13a) and (13b), respectively. In this study, the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM)   is employed to discretize the unknown fields 𝒖𝒖\\boldsymbol{u} and 𝝀𝝀\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} in Eqs. (13) due to its capabilities of nodal approximation of state variables and enhanced smoothness that are particularly effective for data-driven computing. The formulation of the reproducing kernel approximation is given in A. Moreover, for effectiveness in data-driven computing, a stabilized nodal integration scheme (SCNI , see B) is used to integrate the weak formulations in Eq. (13) for reducing the number of integration points where the stress and strain material data need to be searched . Combining the ease of introducing arbitrary order of continuity in the RK approximation as well as the employment of the SCNI scheme to integrate the weak equations in Eq. (13), it allows the material data search and variable evaluation to be performed only at the nodal points, avoiding the necessity of computing field and state variables separately at nodal points and Gauss points, respectively, for enhanced efficiency and accuracy of data-driven computing. In addition, under the SCNI framework, the nodal physical stress 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} is directly associated with the material stress data without introducing additional interpolation errors, see  [ref]1 for more details.\nThe Green Lagrangian strain tensor 𝐄𝐄\\mathbf{E} is computed from the RK approximated displacement 𝐮𝐮\\mathbf{u} and is evaluated at the nodal points. Note that stress update equation in Eq. (12) is also carried out nodally. The physical state (𝐄,𝐒)𝐄𝐒(\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{S}) evaluated at the integration points 𝐱αsubscript𝐱𝛼\\mathbf{x}_{\\alpha} are denoted as {(𝐄α,𝐒α)}α=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐄𝛼subscript𝐒𝛼𝛼1𝑁\\{(\\mathbf{E}_{\\alpha},\\mathbf{S}_{\\alpha})\\}_{\\alpha=1}^{N}, where N𝑁N is the number of integration points. Note that due to the employment of nodal integration  , the integration points share the same set of points as the nodal points. For simplicity of notation, we denote 𝐳α=(𝐄α,𝐒α)subscript𝐳𝛼subscript𝐄𝛼subscript𝐒𝛼\\mathbf{z}_{\\alpha}=(\\mathbf{E}_{\\alpha},\\mathbf{S}_{\\alpha}) as the physics state and 𝐳^α=(𝐄^α,𝐒^α)subscript^𝐳𝛼subscript^𝐄𝛼subscript^𝐒𝛼\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}_{\\alpha}=(\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}_{\\alpha},\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{\\alpha}) the material data associated with the integration point α𝛼\\alpha in the following discussions. In data-driven computing, the local step (3) and the global step (7) are solved iteratively to search for the optimal material data from the admissible material set ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} that is closest to the physical state satisfying the physical constraints given in Eq. (1).\nThe convergence properties of this fixed-point iteration solver have been investigated in  . It should be noted that the selection of the optimal material data by the material data-driven local solver is crucial to the effectiveness of data-driven computing  , and further discussion will be presented in the following Sections 2.3 and 4.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: scheme in machine learning is based on the variance of the data, but the selection is not unique.
