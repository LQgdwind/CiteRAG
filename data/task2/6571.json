      "content": "Paper Title: Model-Driven Engineering Method to Support the Formalization of Machine Learning using SysML\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLeveraging data to allow experts making informed decisions during the product lifecycle of a product is recently defined as data-driven engineering [ref]1.\nThe knowledge required for implementing data-driven engineering can be characterized in a two-fold way [ref]2, i.e., by i) profound machine learning skills with respect to processing and analytics of data and implementation of algorithms, and ii) by domain knowledge regarding the product of interest, relevant product lifecycle data, and related business processes with the entangled IT infrastructures to identify data provenance and information flows.\nRegarding i) profound machine learning skills, a recent industrial survey revealed that companies have fewer machine learning experts and too little knowledge to implement solutions themselves. Further, few experts are available on the market . To still connect the domain and machine learning knowledge, various methods have been recently proposed in literature  .\nHowever, these methods lack support for defining machine learning tasks and do not sufficiently represent the perspective of engineers.\nAdditionally, the methods mainly integrate engineering methods into data science methodologies supporting data scientists rather than allowing engineers to apply the methods to support the elaboration of machine learning support. Therefore, this work aims to integrate machine learning knowledge into systems engineering to support engineers in the definition of machine learning tasks, to consequently enable data-driven engineering and, ultimately, to support the product development for the definition of prerequisites for the machine learning integration. Particularly, means of Model-Based Engineering (MBE) are adapted to define tasks for data-driven engineering by leveraging data from the product lifecycle of a system.\nThe method of this work builds upon the systems modeling language SysML , a general-purpose modeling language allowing to formalize a system from various viewpoints and disciplines. The interdisciplinary formalization of systems knowledge refers to the term Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) . Additionally, the CRISP-DM  methodology is used as a basis for the organization of the machine learning task definition. The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a methodology consisting of common approaches used by data mining professionals to work out a data mining project from inception (requirements and business understanding) through processing (data understanding, data preparation and modeling) to evaluation and deployment.\nUltimately, the method proposed in this work aims to formalize machine learning tasks during product development and to use the formalized knowledge to derive parts of the machine learning and to guide the implementation, respectively. The method is evaluated using a case study representing a weather station with multiple subsystems to predict weather forecasts and a second study to prevent wasting of 3D printer filament by canceling the printing if the intended result cannot be achieved. The contribution of this work is manifold: The proposal of a SysML metamodel extension to include stereotypes that are used to describe machine learning functions for domain-specific data objects A method that fits to the latest research areas of the modeling community and is called MDE4AI   A means of structuring the models based on the CRISP-DM methodology. Two case studies using the proposed concepts for modeling machine learning support based on simple input data, followed by a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the method. A user study showing the workload and usability of the method as rated by experts and computer scientists. This work lays a foundation for allowing non-programmers to define machine learning tasks by formalizing knowledge from the problem domain into a high-level model and to communicate formalized knowledge.\nAdditionally, semantic connection of data from various Product-Lifecycle Management (PLM)  sources allows to describe the origination and composition of data relations.\nWith the availability of such models, the goal is to support the automatic decomposition of SysML models and the (semi-)automatic generation of executable machine learning modules. This work constitutes an extension of our previous work presented in\n[ref]12 and expands [ref]12 in several ways by providing more extensive background information to foster understanding. extending the presented method with a generic and fine-grained sample of the modeling method. applying the method in two case studies from industry. conducting a user study on the perceived workload and usability of mechanical engineers and computer scientists discussing advantages and disadvantages of the method in a more thorough way. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2.2 presents the background regarding MBSE, data science methodologies and related work of data-driven engineering. In Section 3, the elaborated method is introduced in detail and evaluated based on two case studies in Section 4. Further, a user study is presented in Section 5 that evaluates the perceived workload and the usability of the method with mechanical engineers and computer scientists.\nBased on the findings of the evaluation and the user study, an extensive discussion on advantages and disadvantages is presented in Section 6. Finally, the study is summarized in conclusion with future remarks in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Leveraging data to allow experts making informed decisions during the product lifecycle of a product is recently defined as data-driven engineering [ref]1.\nThe knowledge required for implementing data-driven engineering can be characterized in a two-fold way [ref]2, i.e., by i) profound machine learning skills with respect to processing and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
