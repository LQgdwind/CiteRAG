      "content": "Paper Title: Formal Verification of the Sumcheck Protocol\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBailey and Miller   formalized the security analyses of various non-interactive proof systems in the Lean 3 interactive theorem prover. They analyze     , and the construction of  which has extremely low communication complexity and is widely deployed. All of these proof systems are built from cryptographic pairings and have very similar properties. Their security analysis takes place in a strong idealized model called the “algebraic group model”, which simplifies both pen-and-paper and machine security analysis. The analysis focuses on verifying equality between the coefficients of various multivariate polynomial expressions. Work on constant-round proof systems includes analyses of Sigma protocols and their composition properties in  and protocols using the “MPC-in-the-head” paradigm of  in [ref]28 . Many signature schemes are also based on constant-round proof systems, and machine-formalized signature schemes and implementations of this type include Schnorr  and Dilithium  signatures. All of these formalizations use EasyCrypt. The analysis of Sigma protocols is made more challenging through the use of computational assumptions and security definitions involving computationally bounded adversaries, and rewinding algorithms, which we do not consider here. Note that  does consider the sequential composition of Sigma protocols, leading to the formal analysis of a multi-round protocol. However, a composed Sigma protocol treats the same instance in each repetition of the Sigma protocol, whereas the sumcheck protocol reduces to a new instance in each round of the protocol, in a way that depends on the previous messages in the protocol.\nBoth Sigma protocols and commitment schemes were formalized in  using the CryptHOL framework based on Isabelle/HOL. A recent Isabelle formalization of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma  also involves formalizing various probabilistic and inductive statements about multivariate polynomials similar to some lemmas we prove as part of our soundness proof.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: polynomial expressions.
