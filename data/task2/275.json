      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Homography Estimation for Dynamic Scenes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate two versions of our method: the multi-scale homography network (MHN) and the dynamics mask-augmented network (MHNm). We compare them to both feature matching-based and deep learning-based methods. The first category of methods use the SIFT feature or its recent variations followed by a robust estimation method, including SIFT+RANSAC , SIFT+MAGSAC , SIFT+GeoDesc+RANSAC , SIFT+ContextDesc+RANSAC [ref]22, LF-Net , and AFFNET [ref]25. We also use PWC-Net 0, a state-of-the-art optical flow method, to estimate dense correspondences between input images and then use RANSAC to estimate the homography. The deep learning homography estimation methods include CLKN [ref]8, DHN , and PFNet 2. Our experiments use three datasets. The first is derived from the MS-COCO , following the procedure in the recent work [ref]8 . The image size is 128×128128128128\\times 128 and the image corners are randomly shifted in the range of [-32, 32] pixels. Please refer to [ref]8  for more details. The second, named as VidSets, is the static version of our dynamic-scene dataset by creating image pairs from a single video frame so that there is no dynamic content in each image pair. The third is our dynamic-scene dataset described in Sec. 3, named as VidSetd. Following [ref]8, we use the mean corner error as the evaluation metric: ec=14​∑j=14‖cj−c^j‖2subscript𝑒𝑐14superscriptsubscript𝑗14subscriptnormsubscript𝑐𝑗subscript^𝑐𝑗2e_{c}=\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{j=1}^{4}||c_{j}-\\hat{c}_{j}||_{2}\nwhere cjsubscript𝑐𝑗c_{j} and c^jsubscript^𝑐𝑗\\hat{c}_{j} are corner j𝑗j transformed by the estimated homography and the ground-truth homography, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: first category of methods use the SIFT feature or its recent variations followed by a robust estimation method, including SIFT+RANSAC , SIFT+MAGSAC , SIFT+GeoDesc+RANSAC , SIFT+ContextDesc+RANSAC [ref]22, LF-Net , and AFFNET [ref]25.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
