      "content": "Paper Title: AlphaZero-Inspired Game Learning: Faster Training by Using MCTS Only at Test Time\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-play RL has a long tradition in game learning, with Tesauro’s TD-Gammon  being a very early TD-learning application to Backgammon.\nThe seminal papers of Silver et al. on\nAlphaGo and AlphaZero   lifted this for the games Go, chess and shogi to a new complexity and performance level. They have stirred the interest of many researchers to achieve similar things with smaller hardware requirements and/or fewer training cycles. Thakoor et al.  provided in 2017 a general AlphaZero implementation in Python with less computational demands than the original.\nBut even their architecture requires for 6x6 Othello 3 days of training on a specialized cloud computing service (Google Compute Engine with GPU support).\nSeveral works of Wang et al. [ref]29 0  focus on different aspects of the AlphaZero architecture: alternative loss functions, hyperparameter tuning and warm-start enhancements. They test these aspects\non smaller games like 6x6 Othello or 5x5 ConnectFour. The work of Chang et al. 1 covered several AlphaZero improvements applied to 6x6 Othello. van der Ree and Wiering 2 investigate TD-, Q- and Sarsa-learning for 8x8 Othello with a simple neural network (one hidden layer with 50 neurons). Dawson  introduces a CNN-based and AlphaZero-inspired RL agent named ConnectZero for ConnectFour, which can be played online and which reaches a good playing strength against MCTS1000. Young et al. 2 report on an AlphaZero implementation applied to ConnectFour. Here, training took between 21 and 77 hours of GPU time. Recently in 2022,\nNorelli and Panconesi  presented an approach that is close to our work: They as well pursue the goal to set up an AlphaZero-inspired algorithm at much lower cost than the original AlphaZero . The agent in  is based on a residual DNN and is trained solely by self-play. It is able to play 8x8 Othello and to defeat the strong Othello program Edax  up to level 10. Although much less computationally demanding than the original AlphaZero , their training time took roughly one month on Colaboratory, a free Google cloud computing service offering GPUs and TPUs. See Sec. V-C for a direct comparison between Norelli and Panconesi  and our work. Apart from Norelli and Panconesi , there are only few works on Othello game learning that actually benchmark against Edax: Liskowski et al. 3 presented in 2018 an agent obtained by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the help of a database of expert moves. Their agent could defeat Edax up to and including level 2. Our work presented here is based on an earlier Bachelor thesis 4 published in 2020 (but only in German); it presents an n-tuple RL agent for Othello trained in 1.8 hours on standard hardware (no GPU) that can defeat Edax up to and including level 7. For the puzzle Rubik’s Cube, the pioneering work of McAleer 5 and Agostinelli 6 in 2018 and 2019 shows that the 3x3x3 cube can\nbe solved without putting human knowledge or positional-pattern databases into the agent. They solve arbitrary scrambled cubes with a method that is partly inspired by AlphaZero but also contains special tricks for Rubik’s Cube. A work related to GBG   is the general game system Ludii 7.\nLudii is an efficient general game system based on a ludeme library implemented in Java, allowing to play as well as to generate a large variety of strategy games. Currently, all AI agents implemented in Ludii are tree-based agents (MCTS variants or AlphaBeta). GBG, on the other hand,\noffers the possibility to train RL-based algorithms on several games. Soemers et al. 8 describe a bridge between Ludii 7 and Polygames 9, the latter providing DNN algorithms for strategy games.\nSimilar to our work, they couple approximator networks (DNNs) with MCTS, but for different games.\nWith 20 hours of training time, 8 GPUs, 80 CPU cores, and 475 GB of memory allocation per training job, their resource usage is in a different dimension than our training process.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: the original.\nBut even their architecture requires for 6x6 Othello 3 days of training on a specialized cloud computing service (Google Compute Engine with GPU support).\nSeveral works of Wang et al.

They test these aspects\non smaller games like 6x6\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
