      "content": "Paper Title: ACR-Pose: Adversarial Canonical Representation Reconstruction Network for Category Level 6D Object Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInstance-level 6D object pose estimation only estimates the 6D pose of a particular object can be divided into five parts: direct-methods [ref]47 [ref]17 3, keypoint-based methods   , dense coordinate-based methods   , refinement based methods    and self-supervised methods  . There are also many methods propose to utilize RGBD data as input for instance-level object pose estimation    . For more details, we refer readers to Fan et al.  for a comprehensive overview. Though promising, generalization of instance-level methods is limited because we have to train different models for different objects even though they belong to the same category. This requires huge computational costs at both training and inference time. In this paper, we explore category-level 6D object pose estimation owing to its better generalization ability towards different objects. NOCS  is the first deep learning-based category-level method. It proposes the Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS) representation to handle huge shape variance between different objects. Then, Chen et al.  propose another canonical representation named Canonical Shape Space (CASS). Both NOCS and CASS attract the interests of the following works. For example, SPD  proposes a shape prior deformation method for accurate NOCS representation reconstruction utilizing a category-prior as an additional model input. Lee et al.  propose to simultaneously predict the NOCS representation and the metric-scale object shape from the RGB observation for category-level object pose detection, trying to remove the dependence on the depth information. However, its performance still lags behind RGBD based methods. Recently, DualPoseNet  proposes a Dual-Pose Network to learn pose consistency to improve the pose estimation accuracy, and FS-Net  introduces a novel data augmentation method for improving modelsâ€™ performance. Nevertheless, no matter what efforts they make to improve performance, most of the existing methods adopt the idea of reconstructing the canonical representation in their models. Our method also reconstructs the NOCS representation for category-level 6D object pose estimation. We argue that the potential of the NOCS representation has not been fully explored. Therefore, we propose ACR-Pose to improve the reconstruction quality through adversarial training, which will be presented in detail later.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: Instance-level 6D object pose estimation only estimates the 6D pose of a particular object can be divided into five parts: direct-methods [ref]47 [ref]17 3, keypoint-based methods   , dense coordinate-based methods   , refinement based methods    and self-supervised methods  .
