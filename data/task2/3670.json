Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

To avoid numerical issues from the unbounded values of score [ref]33, we set ϵ=10−5italic-ϵsuperscript105\\epsilon=10^{-5}. In the function σ​(t)𝜎𝑡\\sigma(t), used in the diffusion function of the VE-SDE, we need to specify σminsubscript𝜎min\\sigma_{\\text{min}} and σmaxsubscript𝜎max\\sigma_{\\text{max}}. Following the parameters of [ref]19, we set σmin=0.01subscript𝜎min0.01\\sigma_{\\text{min}}=0.01, σmaxsubscript𝜎max\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = 378. We use a batch size of 2, and train the network using Adam  optimizer with linear warm-up schedule. Specifically, we linearly increase the learning rate for the first 5000 steps of optimization, reaching 2e-4 at the end of warmup. Learning rate remains static after the warmup. Exponential moving average of 0.9999 is applied to the parameters, and the training took about 3 weeks with 2×\\timesRTX 2080Ti GPUs. We use ncsnpp [ref]17 as the neural network architecture for modeling sθsubscript𝑠𝜃s_{\\theta}, which conditions the network on t𝑡t with Fourier features . For the numerical SDE solver, we use predictor-corrector (PC) sampler proposed in [ref]17. The parameter for low frequency regularization is set to λ=0.005𝜆0.005\\lambda=0.005. We set a constant α=0.2𝛼0.2\\alpha=0.2 unless specified otherwise.
