      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Method Names to Improve Code Summarization: A Deliberation Multi-Task Learning Approach † Corresponding author.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSource code summarization is the task of creating readable summaries that describe the functionality of source code pieces  . High-quality code summarization not only greatly frees programmers from their tedious work on code documentation [ref]3, but also benefits source code maintenance and improves the performance of code retrieval [ref]4. The task of code summarization mainly involves two different but related scenarios. The first scenario is to predict a natural language sentence that describes a given method. Researchers have built corresponding datasets by extracting source code of individual methods and the first sentence of their documentation (e.g., docstring of Python method[ref]4  and Javadoc of Java method  [ref]3  ). The second scenario is to predict a natural language sentence that describes a given code snippet [ref]7 , e.g., from Stack Overflow, which is not necessarily the source code of an entire method.\nWe focus on the first scenario in this paper. Deep learning is now widely used in code summarization as a mainstream approach. More and more techniques of neural network for machine translation and text summarization have been introduced into code summarization recently ever since Iyer et al.  proposed a classical neural attention model. Researchers in the fields of natural language processing, deep learning, and software engineering have proposed a variety of neural models, which mainly involve advances in two following directions. The first direction is to design better feature representation to capture more accurate semantics of code such as control-flow structure information of a method [ref]3 [ref]7.\nThe second direction is to bring in more sophisticated deep learning techniques of text generation, such as variational auto encoder 0, dual learning 1 2, reinforcement learning [ref]4, et al. Although earlier studies achieved considerable performance improvement, the relationship between method names and code summaries, which could improve code summarization significantly as we demonstrated in this work, has not been well explored yet. As shown in Table I, although the name and code summary of a method have a large difference in length, they both can be considered as the functional description of the method code. We analyzed the method name and code summary in the dataset built by Leclair et al. 3, and found that averagely 50.6% of the words in method names appear in the corresponding summaries, and 21.3% of the words in summaries appear in the corresponding method names. For about 20% of the methods, all the words in the method names appear in the corresponding summaries. In fact, programmers are also do some kinds of code summarization work in the process of naming a method, and they usually write code summaries based on the corresponding method name. Therefore, the task of Method Name Generation (MNG), which predicts a method name with its given body 4 [ref]7 5, can be used as an auxiliary task of code summarization to provide a useful inductive bias. Adding this auxiliary task will make the model more focused on those hypotheses that can explain both code summarization and MNG at the same time, and consequently have a potential to improve the generalization and performance of the model. However, poorly-defined method names, which are common in practical software projects  6 7, could lead to inaccurate code summaries. As shown in Figure 1, method names which contain customized abbreviations, nonstandard conjunction, or spelling errors may mislead the code summarization model. In other words, the state-of-the-art models are highly dependent on high-quality method names. In this case, if MNG could first produce a more meaningful method name, the summarization model can make further extension and polishing based on a more informative compressed draft (i.e., the generated method name).\nInspired by the high-level concept of “deliberation” proposed\nby Xia et al. 8, we incorporate another auxiliary task of method name informativeness prediction (MNIP) into a novel two-pass deliberation process in our MTL architecture, aiming to generate consistent code summaries more robustly, especially when method names are non-informative. Last but not least, since the method name is always a part of the method code, the MNG task has a natural large-scale self-labeled training corpus, which resembles the language model in natural language processing. Language models predict the next (or masked) word in a given text sequence, which can be trained and used to improve almost all other NLP tasks, thanks to extremely large self-supervised corpora 9 0 1. In a similar way, we show that\nby pre-training MNG, the self-supervised task, with an extra large-scale corpus, we could further improve code summarization. In short, by introducing tasks MNG and MNIP, we design a deliberation multi-task learning approach, which better characterizes the relationship between method summaries and method names, to improve code summarization. To evaluate our approach, we carried out large-scale experiments on two existing datasets for Java and Python. We also collected a huge self-labeled dataset (30.4 million pairs of method bodies and their names) from Github for evaluating the pre-training effect of task MNG. From the experiment results, we found that exploiting the inner connection between code summaries and method names can significantly improve the performance of code summarization. We believe the deliberation MTL architecture has the potential to be extended to more similar scenarios, e.g., mining inner connections of summaries and headlines of internet news. Our main contributions are: We proposed a Deliberation Multi-task learning Approach for COde Summarization (DMACOS). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the inner connection between method names and code summaries systematically in the research of code summarization. We carried out an experiment on two large existing datasets for code summarization (on Java and Python). The experiment results show that our MTL approach can not only achieve competitive performance, but also be easily applied to some existing encoder-decoder models of code summarization and improve their performance. We studied DMACOS’s performance on methods with non-informative names, and DMACOS showed significant superiority brought by its two-pass deliberation mechanism. We showed extra knowledge introduced by MNG model pre-trained with large-scale self-supervised corpus can further improve the performance of the model, which can be observed even across programming languages.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: creating readable summaries that describe the functionality of source code pieces  .
