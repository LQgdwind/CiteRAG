      "content": "Paper Title: Constrained and Ordered Level Planarity Parameterized by the Number of Levels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs stated above, Klemz and Rote  showed\nthat OLP (and, thus, CLP) is NP-hard even when restricted to\ninstances of levelwidth two.\nIn this paper, we focus on the other “dimension”:\nwe study\nCLP and OLP parameterized by height. We show that OLP parameterized by the height is complete with\nrespect to the complexity class XNLP, which was first studied by\nElberfeld, Stockhusen, and Tantau  (under the name N​[f​poly,f​log]N𝑓poly𝑓log\\mathrm{N}[f\\ \\mathrm{poly},f\\ \\mathrm{log}]) and recently made more prominent by Bodlaender,\nGroenland, Nederlof, and Swennenhuis . It contains all\nparameterized problems that can be solved nondeterministically in\ntime f​(k)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝒪1f(k)\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} and space f​(k)⋅log⁡n⋅𝑓𝑘𝑛f(k)\\cdot\\log n\n(where f𝑓f is a computable function, n𝑛n the input size, and k𝑘k\nthe parameter).\nElberfeld et al. and Bodlaender et al. study properties of\n(problems in) this class and provide several\nproblems that are XNLP-complete.\nIn particular, if a problem is XNLP-complete, it\nlies in XP, but is W​[t]𝑊delimited-[]𝑡W[t]-hard for every t𝑡t . Ordered Level Planarity parameterized by\nthe height of the input graph is XNLP-complete\n(and, thus, it lies in XP, but is W​[t]𝑊delimited-[]𝑡W[t]-hard for every t𝑡t).\nXNLP-hardness holds even when restricted to the case where the input graph is connected.\nMoreover, there is a constructive XP-time algorithm for Ordered Level Planarity (w.r.t. the height). Parameterizing OLP by height captures the “linear” nature of the\nsolution – this is reminiscent of recent results by\nBodlaender, Groenland, Jacob, Jaffke, and Lima \nwho established XNLP-completeness for several problems parameterized\nby linear width measures\n(e.g., Capacitated Dominating Set by pathwidth and\nMax Cut by linear cliquewidth).\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first graph drawing (or computational geometry) problem shown to be XNLP-complete.\nThe algorithms are described in Section 2, whereas the hardness is shown in Section 3.\nIn contrast to the fact that OLP parameterized by the height lies\nin XP,\nit is not difficult to see that the socket/plug gadget described by\nBrückner and Rutter [ref]7\ncan be utilized in the context of a reduction from 3-Partition to show that\n(PLP and, thus) CLP remains NP-hard even when restricted to instances of constant height.\nIn fact, the unpublished full version of [ref]7 features such a construction with a height of 7 .\nHere, we present a reduction that is tailor-made for CLP, showing that it is NP-hard even when restricted to instances of height 4.\nWe complement this result by showing that the (surprisingly challenging) case of instances with height at most three can be solved in polynomial time. Constrained Level Planarity is NP-hard even when restricted to\nheight 4, but instances of height at most 3 can be solved\nconstructively in polynomial time. We show the hardness in Appendix C, describe the\nalgorithm in Section 4,\nand state\nopen problems in Section 5.\nProofs of statements marked with a (clickable) ⋆⋆\\star\nare in the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the hardness is shown in Section 3.\nIn contrast to the fact that OLP parameterized by the height lies\nin XP,\nit is not difficult to see that the socket/plug gadget described by\nBrückner and Rutter [ref]7\ncan be utilized in the context of a reduction from 3-Partition to show that\n(PLP and, thus) CLP remains NP-hard even when restricted to instances of constant height.\nIn fact, the unpublished\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
