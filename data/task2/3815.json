Trajectories collected through passive sensing are unique in many ways. First the collected trajectories respect the density of wireless checkpoints (WiFi, cellular towers, etc) and have much lower resolution than GPS traces. Missing data is the norm, for example, in regions without WiFi access points. It is an interesting problem to properly handle the time-stamp information.\nFirst, time stamp labels cannot be ignored but it is preferred to allow flexibility in handling time stamps. Accurate spatial temporal information (i.e., the location of a person at a particular time) can be considered sensitive and private.\nWith long term trajectory data, frequent locations¬†[ref]26 , co-locations¬†, and specific patterns¬†  of users can be easily learned,\nwhich can be used to identify a user, breach their social ties and locate their whereabouts at any time.\nThus location/time-stamp data in published data sets is often intentionally perturbed or generalized¬†. Further, although human mobility shows great regularity and repetition, people have a fair amount of flexibility in daily routines. For example, it is common that a user goes to work every day but the time of leaving home may fluctuate. With passively collected trajectories, one can\ndiscover interesting mobility patterns by clustering trajectories into groups of similar ones, for which we need a measure of similarity.\nThere has been much work on distances to measure similarity between curves.\nFor example, Hausdorff distance measures the maximum distance of all points on one curve to their nearest point on the other curves.\nFr√©chet distance measures the minimum of maximum length between all possible pairing/coupling of points on the two curves.  These distances for curves when applied to data mining in passively collected human trajectory data are not ideal.\nFirst, all these distances focus on the shape of the curves but ignore the time stamp information.\nBut time dimension is important for understanding group mobility and traffic. Two individuals, traveling along the same route but at totally different time frames shall not be considered similar. The duration spent at a location is a crucial attribute for important places for a user and the patten of visiting a sequence of locations is useful to infer the semantics of the trip.\n In this paper we develop alternative similarity measures. We explored in two directions. Time-window Fr√©chet distance. In the first variant, we introduce time-window Fr√©chet distance, where only pairs of points within a time window Œ¥ùõø\\delta can be coupled. Further, we show an algorithm to compute the time window Fr√©chet distance with running time related to the complexity of the input curves. Metric-based edit distance. In the second variant, we take uniform sampling along the time dimension and use a combinatorial representation as a string of cells/towers/APs visited by the user and the edit distance ‚Äì the minimum number of changes (insertions or deletions) to turn one sequence to another.\nWe consider a variant of edit distance by incorporating the underlying metric in the calculation of the edit distance. Specifically, the cost of inserting or deleting a symbol is based on the change of the metric distance before and after the operation. This will be able to handle the issue of missing data. We also discuss algorithms for computing the metric based edit distance.\n Next, we talk about clustering motion trajectories into meaningful clusters. We use the notion of kùëòk-gather clustering¬†, which is to minimize the radius of any cluster, such that each trajectory is in a cluster of at least kùëòk traces.\nThe requirement of kùëòk is needed to define group motion and often adopted to define popular/meaningful traffic patterns. There is also additional benefit of kùëòk-anonymity¬† if only a summary of each cluster is reported/shared with the public ‚Äì one cannot tell a specific user from a group of kùëòk trajectories. It is known that kùëòk-gathering for points in a metric space is NP-hard and there is a 222-approximation algorithm¬†. We extend the hardness proof to the case of trajectories under edit distance, metric based edit distance and the Jaccard distance. Finally, we provide a hardness proof. It is recently shown that there is no subquadratic algorithm to compute Fr√©chet distance unless SETH fails¬† and later in  it is shown that it is true for the approximation factor up to 1.3991.3991.399 in one dimension. We show that in ‚Ñù2superscript‚Ñù2\\mathbb{R}^{2} that there exists no subquadratic algorithm to approximate discrete Fr√©chet distance with factor less than 1.611.611.61 unless SETH fails.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: produces a good approximation of mobile user trajectory.\nPrior studies of trajectories collected passively include the study of human mobility traces of over 100,000100000100,000 mobile phone users¬†[ref]26 and the study of about 95,0009500095,000 users in a large university campus¬†.
