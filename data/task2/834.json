      "content": "Paper Title: Semantics-preserving Reinforcement Learning Attack Against Graph Neural Networks for Malware Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMalware detection models primarily make use of analysis techniques to understand the intention of malware. Features leveraged in malware detection can be grouped into three categories: static features, dynamic features, and hybrid features. Static features are extracted without running the executable files. Dynamic features are extracted by analyzing the behaviors of a program while it is being executed in a simulated and monitored environment. Hybrid features combine both static and dynamic features. Various approaches are deployed to extract static features. Some of them make use of the binary file itself as indicators to detect the malware.\nThe characteristics of the binary files, such as PE import features, metadata, and strings, are also ubiquitously applied in malware detection.\nOthers leverage reverse engineering, including instruction flow graph, control flow graphs, call graph, and opcode sequences , is used to understand the programs’ architecture and extract related features.\nDynamic analysis executes the programs in a virtual environment to monitor their behaviors and observe their functionality.\nFeatures obtained by dynamic analysis are API calls, system calls, registry changes, memory writes, network patterns, etc .\nDynamic analysis can address some obfuscated malware and hence provide more accurate programs’ behaviors. In line with the static analysis, attackers adopt approaches to prevent malware from dynamic analysis. The malware starts an early check and immediately exits if it runs on virtual machines. Some malware even executes benign behaviors so humans draw incorrect conclusions about the intent of the malware. Because the signature-based detection method is not resilient to slight variations, researchers have applied conventional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest) and deep learning method to detect malware.\nConvolutional neural networks and fully connected dense layers are leveraged to learn the high level features out of the selected features. For sequential data such as API calls and instruction sequence, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are applied to classify the malware  .\nRecently some researchers use graph neural networks to classify malware programs represented as control flow graphs[ref]5. The structure information contained by CFGs can be used to find unreachable code, find syntactic structure (like loops), and predict programs’ defect[ref]19 [ref]20.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: sequence, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are applied to classify the malware  .\nRecently some researchers use graph neural networks to classify malware programs represented as control flow graphs[ref]5.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
