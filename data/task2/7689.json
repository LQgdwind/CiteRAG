      "content": "Paper Title: (Towards a) Statistical Probabilistic Lazy Lambda Calculus\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider the study of applicative bisimulation in the pure untyped lazy lambda calculus by Abramsky , Abramsky and Ong  and Ong . In particular, recall  Gordon [ref]18’s LTS approach to applicative bisimulation. A non-value term M𝑀M has a τ𝜏\\tau transition to M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime} if\nM𝑀M reduces in one step to M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime}. U=λ​x​.​M𝑈𝜆𝑥.𝑀U={\\lambda x\\mkern-1.0mu\\mathord{\\text{{.}}}\\mkern-1.0muM} has a transition\nlabeled U′superscript𝑈′U^{\\prime} to the application U​U′𝑈superscript𝑈′U\\;U^{\\prime}. Two terms are bisimilar if the associated transition systems are bisimilar, i.e., if their convergence properties agree and each\napplicative test yields bisimilar terms. In this article, we build on Lassen 6’s presentation of  Sangiorgi ’s treatment. We follow the “open bisimulation” presentation of Lassen’s later work 7 9  in a form that validates η𝜂\\eta-expansion. In contrast to applicative bisimulation, the applicative tests are restricted to (perhaps new) variable names ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi: U=λ​x​.​M𝑈𝜆𝑥.𝑀U={\\lambda x\\mkern-1.0mu\\mathord{\\text{{.}}}\\mkern-1.0muM} has a transition\nlabeled 𝖺𝗉𝗉​ϕ𝖺𝗉𝗉italic-ϕ\\mathsf{app}\\;{\\phi} to the application U​ϕ𝑈italic-ϕU\\;\\phi. “Open” application results in a new category of normal forms of the form ϕ​M¯italic-ϕ¯𝑀\\phi\\;\\overline{M}, for a vector of terms M¯¯𝑀\\overline{M}, forcing the consideration of “external call” tests: A value ϕ​M¯italic-ϕ¯𝑀\\phi\\;\\overline{M} has a transition\nlabeled 𝖿𝖼𝖺𝗅𝗅​(ϕ,(i,n))𝖿𝖼𝖺𝗅𝗅italic-ϕ𝑖𝑛{\\mathsf{fcall}\\;({\\phi},{{(}i,n{)}})} to M¯​(i)¯𝑀𝑖\\overline{M}{(}i{)} (the i𝑖i’th term in M¯¯𝑀\\overline{M}), where |M¯|=n¯𝑀𝑛|\\overline{M}|=n. Lassen 6 shows that Levy-Longo tree equivalence is the biggest bisimulation for such a transition system. In subsequent papers beginning with7, Lassen and his coauthors studies a full suite of programming language features, including control 8, and state . Jagadeesan et al. 3 adapt this approach to aspect-oriented programming languages. The open-bisimulation approach has also been used to study issues related to types and parametricity, eg,  Lassen and Levy 9 provide a coinduction principle to simplify proofs about existential types and Jaber and Tzevelekos 2 show that Strachey parametricity implies Reynolds parametricity. Why does this approach work so well?  Levy and Staton  provides a hint by demonstrating a tight correspondence between open bisimulation and game semantics,  Abramsky et al. , Hyland and Ong 1, and Nickau , albeit for a small calculus with a limited type theory. This has led Paul Levy to coin the evocative (but arguably unnattractive?!) term “Operational Game Semantics” to describe the approaches based on open bisimulation. In this article, we do not further the study needed to resolve the suspicion of a more pervasive and general connection between game semantics and open bisimulation. Rather, what is crucial is the commonality between the semantics of programs in these two approaches, namely: The semantics of a program is a set of traces. Remarkably, there is no explicit mention of any higher order structure, such as abstraction and higher order functionals. On the games side, this is particularly true of the Abramsky et al.  style of games; the Hyland and Ong 1 games and Nickau  games also appeal to a “pointer” structure that is not intrinsic to a linear trace. The AJM games inherit this feature from the Geometry of Interaction of Girard [ref]17. In this style of model, a single top level, first order, fixpoint iterator serves as the control engine driving the execution. The complications and subtlelty of higher order control flow is handled purely by dataflow over structured tokens, an idea made precise in Abramsky and Jagadeesan . On the open bisimulation side, the transition system identifies the (set of) paths through the normal form of the program as the invariant of the bisimulation class of the program; a familiar perspective of GOI models as seen in Malacaria and Regnier . The only residue of higher order computation in this first-order world view is perhaps the partition of the labels of the transition system into moves associated with the program and the environment. This seemingly abstruse technical point acquires particular relevance when considering the semantics of statistical programming languages.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Consider the study of applicative bisimulation in the pure untyped lazy lambda calculus by Abramsky , Abramsky and Ong  and Ong .
