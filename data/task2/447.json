      "content": "Paper Title: METASET: Exploring Shape and Property Spaces for Data-Driven Metamaterials Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nShape similarity metrics are key in many computer vision and graphics applications, e.g., facial recognition and object retrieval from databases. In these methods, the shapes are usually first represented by structural descriptors extracted from individual shapes¬†, or by embedded features learned via data-driven methods such as clustering or deep learning¬† . The distances between features can then be measured in Euclidean¬† or Riemmanian space¬† . Since Riemannian metrics are based on geodesic distances, they are suitable if one needs invariance to deformation, i.e., if one considers a shape to be the same after bending. For metamaterials, however, we must rule out deformation and rotation invariant metrics since any transformation of a unit cell impacts its properties. Additionally, we seek techniques that are efficient but still able to discriminate fine details and form positive semi-definite similarity matrices for the next step involving DPPs. Thus, we introduce the following Euclidean metrics based on structural features: a descriptor-based distance for 2D, and two point cloud-based metrics for 3D, namely, the Hausdorff distance and embedded cosine similarity utilizing deep learning. While we elected for separate metrics in 2D and 3D by bearing in mind their respective computational efficiencies, shape analysis is a wide and ever-growing topic of research in computer science; many other metrics are available. As we later show in Sec.¬†4.2, METASET selects diverse subsets regardless of the metric used, as long as the requirements for DPPs are met. 2D Descriptor-Based Euclidean Distance: \nFor 2D unit cells, which are typically binary images resulting from TO, we propose using a descriptor-based approach by first extracting division-point-based descriptors¬† to reduce the images into vectors that capture salient features at different levels of granularity. This has been applied to the field of optical character recognition¬† . The binary image of a unit cell is recursively divided into sub-regions that contain an equal number of solid pixels. The coordinates of all division points, i.e., points at the intersection of two division lines between each sub-region, are then obtained as descriptors of the unit cell. This process is repeated until the desired level of detail is captured, constructing a k-d tree of the distribution of solid materials. In our 2D case study (Sec.¬†3), we obtain a sufficient amount of detail by performing the division seven times for each unit cell, resulting in 62 division points that constitute a 124-dimensional shape descriptor. Using the above method, we can represent each 2D unit cell as a vector, then use the Euclidean norm to find the distance between any pair. However, the input for a DPP is a positive semi-definite similarity matrix, LùêøL, so we transform the distance to a similarity metric through a radial basis function kernel with unit bandwidth, i.e., Li,j=exp‚Å°(‚àí0.5‚Äãd‚Äã(i,j)2)subscriptùêøùëñùëó0.5ùëësuperscriptùëñùëó2L_{i,j}=\\exp(-0.5~{}d(i,j)^{2}), where d‚Äã(i,j)ùëëùëñùëód(i,j) is the distance between iùëñi-th and jùëój-th unit cells. In practice, the choice of an appropriate transformation is equivalent to choosing the right distance metric between items. Our empirical study on other common transformations showed that different choices mainly affect the distribution of similarity values but do not significantly affect the final outcome or the key findings of our work. 3D Hausdorff Distance: \nAs for 3D unit cells, mesh formats such as STL are commonly used so that the metamaterials can be manufactured through additive manufacturing. However, since performing analysis on 3D shapes is undoubtedly more computationally intense due to the curse of dimensionality, we suggest representing each unit cell as points on the surface of the original mesh, i.e., point clouds, which are more efficient for extracting and processing 3D features¬†. This extra conversion can take little computation with well-established sampling methods, e.g., randomly sampling the surface of a mesh with the probability of choosing a point weighted by the area of the triangular faces. We then use a distance metric commonly utilized to measure the distance between sets of points, the Hausdorff distance. In essence, it computes the difference between two clouds as the maximum of the nearest neighbor distances of each point. This is expressed as [ref]34: where aùëéa is a point within cloud Aùê¥A and bùëèb is a point in the second cloud BùêµB. The notation ‚à•‚ãÖ‚à•delimited-‚à•‚à•‚ãÖ\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert indicates that any distance can be used; for example, we can use the Euclidean norm or the cosine distance between two points. In our implementation, we computed the nearest neighbor Euclidean norms using a GPU-enabled code by Fan et¬†al.¬†[ref]35. Then, to obtain a symmetric distance, we take the maximum as follows: Finally, we convert the pairwise distances into a DPP similarity kernel, LùêøL, using the following transformation: Li‚Äãj=11+d‚Äã(i,j)subscriptùêøùëñùëó11ùëëùëñùëóL_{ij}=\\frac{1}{1+d(i,j)}. 3D Embedded Cosine Similarity:\nAlternatively, the embedded features of the unit cells in a given dataset can be extracted using deep learning models as simple as an autoencoder, a dimension reduction technique that compresses, i.e., encodes, complex shapes into vectors. Once such a model has been trained, an embedding-based shape similarity metric can be defined as the similarity between the vector representations of unit cells, much like the 2D descriptor-based distance earlier. Here we also leverage point clouds, which are growing as a scalable and powerful representation for 3D deep learning¬†. We utilize a point cloud autoencoder provided by Achlioptas¬†et¬†al.¬† with the Earth Mover‚Äôs distance as the reconstruction loss. Our 3D dataset (described in Sec.¬†4.1) is split into training, test and validation sets by 70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively, and a grid search is performed to decide the hyperparameters: 64-dimensional embedded vectors for each unit cell, a learning rate of 0.0005 and batch size of 32. After training the model for 120 epochs, we can then take the cosine similarity between the embedded vector representations of any two unit cells as the shape metric. In our 3D experiment (Sec.¬†4.2), we compare the diverse subsets obtained using this embedded feature approach against those using the Hausdorff distance.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: between sets of points, the Hausdorff distance.
