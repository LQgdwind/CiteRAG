      "content": "Paper Title: 3DSGrasp: 3D Shape-Completion for Robotic Grasp\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe mainly cover related works addressing shape completion with 3D data and robotic grasping.\n\n3D shape completion. In environments where objects are not placed on top of others, such as cupboards and shelves, object shape completion can provide additional grasp poses that augment the selection range. Given the incomplete partial 3D data as the input, the aim is to predict an approximation of the complete shape. 3D shape completion methods can be categorised into geometric and data-driven approaches . Geometry-based methods   assume the presence of shape priors, such as geometric primitives, symmetry and structural repetition [ref]19. However, the application of these priors may lead to less accurate reconstructions for large-scale datasets and real-world 3D data. Data-driven (i.e. learning-based) approaches rely on deep neural networks that discover the shape completion priors from the data both at local and global point cloud level [ref]20 . In earlier works, the irregular 3D data (i.e., raw point cloud) is converted to a regular data representation (i.e.,voxel grid),\nwhere 3D CNNs applied on voxelized inputs have been widely adopted for the pure 3D shape completion task  and for shape completion for improving grasp estimation  . However, the cost of memory usage and computational time for such methods is very large . Instead, PCN  directly uses raw PCD for shape completion tasks, and it is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is a PointNet-based backbone network that provides global features. The decoder has two stages, one that estimates a coarse point cloud by applying an MLP. After that, FoldingNet  is used to generate the detailed and completed point cloud.\nFollowing PCN, a range of learning-based methods for pure 3D shape completion tasks from PCD were proposed     to improve the resolution and robustness of the reconstructed PCD, while others   , were proposed for improving the performance of grasp success rate by directly processing 3D PCD for completing the shape of the object. PoinTr  was the first PCD completion system to adopt the Transformer architecture , leading to a significant improvement in performance.\nLater,  introduced a transformer-based network for object completion\nthat consists of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is a conventional Multi-Head Self-Attention module, and the decoder is based on the AtlasNet . Although the authors improve the reconstruction result of the GRnet  network that use 3D grids to regularize unordered PCD for point cloud completion, they do not compare their results with PoinTr , which consistently outperforms GRnet. In addition, the alignment between the partial point cloud and the reconstructed one requires a 6D pose estimation module.\nIn contrast, our method accurately aligns the observed point cloud with the reconstructed one.\nAdditionally, according to our experiments, we improve the reconstruction results compared to the state-of-the-art and provide more promising grasp poses.\n\nVision based Robotic Grasping. Robotic Grasping aims to find the optimal pose of the robot’s end-effector that leads to a successful grasp of an object. In one way, model-based methods consider contact points and exerted forces to select the grasps that provide more stability, but the evaluation is usually in simulation, which suffers from a large reality gap . In the other, data-driven approaches aim to map directly perceptual input such as RGB   and RGB-D images   [ref]35, to the grasp success. Recent methods take advantage of model-based and data-driven approaches by generating data samples and labels from simulations using domain randomization   [ref]35. Current approaches are able to map 6DoF pose candidates to point clouds   [ref]35  , addressing successful grasping in cluttered scenarios. From the perceptual point of view, segmentation of the objects is very challenging, so these approaches start by sampling grasp poses, followed by grasp pose score computation and finally a refinement pose procedure. Amongst the 6DoF grasping approaches, we select Grasp Pose Detection in Point Clouds (GPD)  to be used in our system, due to the computational efficiency of the grasp sampling and score computation . The main steps of GPD are: (i) heuristics-based grasp candidate sampling and (ii) binary classification of candidates by a CNN. A detailed description of GPD is in Section III-C.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: methods can be categorised into geometric and data-driven approaches . Geometry-based methods   assume the presence of shape priors, such as geometric primitives, symmetry and structural repetition [ref]19. However, the application of these priors may lead to less accurate reconstructions for large-scale datasets and real-world 3D data.
