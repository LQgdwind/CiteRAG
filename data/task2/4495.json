      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Dynamic Movement Primitives - a survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe previous sections described how different strategies were developed to encode Dynamic Movement Primitives. However, the fact that traditional Dynamic Movement Primitives, represented as nonlinear differential equations, are hard to generalize to new behaviors has spurred research to find new means to encode such information. Furthermore, many researchers have found that while basic movement information can be encoded in the Dynamic Movement Primitives, Reinforcement Learning can improve the quality of the Dynamic Movement Primitives, achieve greater generalization, and eventually learn new movements. Furthermore, Theodorou et al.  considered the Dynamic Movement Primitives as a special case of parameterized policies and introduced the PI2 algorithm, working on continuous state-action spaces. Among the advantages of the algorithm, the authors list the fact that is numerically robust, and the ease to implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms based on trajectory roll-outs. Robot programming by demonstration is one of the central topics of the field of robotics . Given the difference in kinematic capabilities between a human demonstrator and a humanoid robot, there is a need to adapt human motion trajectories to stable robot movements. [ref]51 addressed this issue by using Dynamic Movement Primitives to obtain a compact representation of a movement obtained from a first demonstration and then use Reinforcement Learning to improve the policy based on trial and error. They did so, generalizing the Reinforcement Learning policy from the immediate reward to the episodic reinforcement learning approach. They found that the state-dependent exploration enabled faster policy learning methods than the widely adopted Gaussian explorations with constant variance. This finding led them to devise a new expectation maximization-based policy learning algorithm called PoWER. Dynamic Movement Primitives specify three components: goal, shape, and temporal scaling. When used with Reinforcement Learning, only the weights for shaping the Dynamic Movement Primitives are usually learned, assuming the goal and temporal scaling are predefined. Nevertheless, there are many tasks where the goal position is not well known and can affect the outcome. Dynamic Movement Primitives shape and goal need to be learned simultaneously in such cases. To achieve a successful solution, Tamosiunaite et al.  used different methods for the learning of the two components (NAC for goal learning, and PI2 for weight learning), to avoid mutual interference. NAC is a policy gradient method that transforms the gradient using the Fisher information matrix to obtain a natural gradient to compute the optimal reward. PI2, on the other side, is derived from stochastic optimal control considers works by adding noise to the Dynamic Movement Primitives weights during an exploration phase, to later update the weights to minimize the cost. The authors found the approach successful and capable of ignoring incorrect feedback information so that they did not influence convergence towards a successful task resolution. Further research on how Dynamic Movement Primitives can be enhanced with Reinforcement Learning was performed by , who developed a global model to map task parameters to policy parameters. While they used the Dynamic Movement Primitives to encode the demonstrated movements, Reinforcement Learning was used to optimize the shape parameters and generalize the task to unseen situations. In their paper, the authors stress the importance of the noise structure and propose using correlated noise to balance learning speed and prevent safety hazards that could result from high noise variance. A different setting was explored by , who developed a system to convert information regarding human movements captured through a low-cost RGB-D camera into stable humanoid robot movements. While movements are not guaranteed to be optimal, they can be subsequently improved with model-free reinforcement learning and therefore achieve enhanced movement stability and accuracy. For this particular use case, the authors noted that different conditions must be considered, whether the movement corresponds to the lower or upper body part. When considering the lower body part, the movements must consider that at least one feet remain grounded when imitating a movement, while the upper body has no such constraints. Another line of research was pursued by authors who envisioned the principle of divide and conquer could be applied when designing the Reinforcement Learning components and therefore obtain better results by dividing the problem into smaller pieces. In this direction, Stulp et al.  used hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to reduce the search space of planning and control using tasks decomposition in order to ease complex task learning. They represented tasks through Dynamic Movement Primitives and applied Reinforcement Learning to Dynamic Movement Primitive sequences optimizing the movement primitive considering the cost of the following primitive in the sequence. PI2 was used to search the policy parameters space and simultaneously learn the shape and goal parameters of a motion sequence with no need for a model regarding the robot or the environment on which the task is performed. Furthermore, the authors found that such an approach led to lower overall costs than would be achieved by optimizing each Dynamic Movement Primitive separately over the motion sequence. A different approach was followed by Kim et al. , who built a neural network to represent the differential equation and then learned to generalize the movements by using an actor-critic algorithm for deep reinforcement learning while applying a hierarchical strategy to decompose complex tasks and reduce the robot’s search space in a sparse reward setting. To that end, two controllers are used: a meta-controller to learn policies over intrinsic (problem independent) goals and a sub-controller to learn policies over actions to achieve the given goals (problem-specific). E.g., the meta-controller would learn how to optimize movements given a sequence of tasks (e.g., tasks required to pick and place an object), while the sub-controller would learn how to best perform each of the sub-tasks (e.g., approach an object, grasp it, transport it to another location, and place it on the desired location). The authors reported implementing the hierarchical reinforcement learning component with the PI2 algorithm to learn the goal parameters only. In this same direction, but prescind from the hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, [ref]28 explored the use of Dynamic Movement Primitives and Reinforcement Learning for humanoid robot movement, proposing a novel scheme for coupled Dynamic Movement Primitive-based motion sequence planning. They considered a two-level strategy, using (i) a neural dynamic optimization algorithm for redundancy resolution, (ii) Dynamic Movement Primitives to model and learn joint trajectories, and (iii) Reinforcement Learning to re-learn the proposed trajectories while including manipulation uncertainties. The initial spatial information and feedback are obtained through a machine vision component. The first step obtained the Dynamic Movement Primitive target points by considering the optimal solutions computed by the deep neural network and using the Dynamic Movement Primitives to model and learn the joint trajectories. Finally, the PI2 was used to learn the trajectory models considering external perturbations. While new movements can be thought to the robot, they should be able to acquire new skills through imitation and self-improvement strategies.  proposed encoding the demonstrated skills into a compact form through a Dynamic Movement Primitive and then using the PoWER Reinforcement Learning policy to adapt and improve the encoded skill while learning the coupling along with different motor control variables. While a similar outcome could be realized using other Reinforcement Learning policies, the authors highlight two PoWER advantages when tackling the aforementioned problem: (i) there is no need to specify a learning rate, and (ii) together with importance sampling makes better use of previous agent’s experience to determine new exploratory parameters. The use of Dynamic Movement Primitives with Reinforcement Learning is frequently conditioned to specific use case scenarios, which determine meaningful aspects on how both should interact to achieve successful learning. We illustrate this with three use cases. First,  describes the modeling of in-contact tasks. Modeling in-contact skills is challenging since it requires considering not only the trajectory of the movement but control of the pose and force too since each action changes the environment and does not allow for the generalization of the task. In particular, the authors demonstrate their approach to the wood planning task. They report using a Dynamic Movement Primitive to encode the kinematic and force profiles that of a successful operation, and the PI2 Reinforcement Learning algorithm to update the force policy. Furthermore, they developed a framework to improve in-contact tasks by exploring the demonstrated force profile, arguing that it is not safe to start the exploration from a zero force profile for such tasks. The second use case refers to clothing assistance [ref]57. Similar to the setting described by , the fact that the shape of the clothing article constantly changes, it affects the task settings. Therefore, the authors experimented using force information to detect whether the clothing article got stuck and concluded that the orientation of the end-effector must not be ignored to achieve a successful outcome. Finally,  addressed a similar use case, teaching a robot to fold clothes. To that end, they characterized the robot moves through Dynamic Movement Primitives. The Dynamic Movement Primitive is then used to initialize a Reinforcement Learning process, leveraging a linear dimensionality reduction in between, to reduce the optimization problem’s dimensionality and, therefore, the cost required to solve it. The results show that using dimensionality reduction not only fulfilled the purpose of decreasing the overall computational costs but also led to better learning curves.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: field of robotics .
