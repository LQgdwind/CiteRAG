      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Ensemble Q-learning: Minimizing Estimation Bias via Error Feedback\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThanks to recent advances in function approximation methods using deep neural networks , Q-learning  has been widely used to solve reinforcement learning (RL) problems in a variety of applications, e.g., robotic control  , path planning   and production scheduling  . Despite the great success,\nit is well recognized that Q-learning may suffer from the notorious overestimation bias     7, which would significantly impede the learning efficiency. Recent work [ref]9  indicates that this problem also persists in the actor-critic setting.\nTo address this issue, the ensemble method  [ref]1   has emerged as a promising solution in which multiple Q-function approximators are used to get better estimation of the action values.\nNeedless to say, the ensemble size, i.e., the number of Q-function approximators used in the target, has intrinsic impact on Q-learning. Notably, it is shown in   that while a large ensemble size could completely remove the overestimation bias, it may go to the other extreme and result in underestimation bias and unstable training,\nwhich is clearly not desirable.\nTherefore, instead of simply increasing the ensemble size to mitigate the overestimation issue, a fundamental question to ask is:“ Is it possible to determine the right ensemble size on the fly so as to minimize the estimation bias?” Some existing ensemble methods    adopt a trial-and-error strategy to search for the ensemble size, which would be time-consuming and require a lot of human engineering for different RL tasks. The approximation error of the Q-function during the learning process plays a nontrivial role in the selection of the ensemble size, since it directly impacts the Q-target estimation accuracy. This however remains not well understood. In particular, the fact that the approximation error is time-varying, due to the iterative nature of Q-learning  , gives rise to the question that whether a fixed ensemble size should be used in the learning process.\nTo answer this question, we show in Section 2.2 that using a fixed ensemble size is likely to lead to either overestimation or underestimation bias, and the bias may shift between overestimation and underestimation because of the time-varying approximation error, calling for an adaptive ensemble size so as to drive the bias close to zero based on the underlying learning dynamics. Thus motivated, in this work we study effective ensemble size adaptation to minimize the estimation bias that hinges heavily on the time-varying approximation errors during the learning process. To this end, we first\ncharacterize the relationship among the ensemble size, the function approximation errors, and the estimation bias, by deriving an upper bound and a lower bound on the estimation bias. Our findings reveal that the ensemble size should be selected adaptively in a way to cope with the impact of the time-varying approximation errors. Building upon the theoretic results, we cast the estimation bias minimization as an adaptive control problem\nwhere\nthe approximation error during the learning process is treated as the control object, and the ensemble size is adapted based on the feedback of the control output, i.e., the value of the approximation error from the last iteration.\nThe key idea in this approach is inspired from the classic Model Identification Adaptive Control (MIAC) framework  5, where at each step the current system identification of the control object is fed back to adjust the controller, and consequently a new control signal is devised following the updated control law. One main contribution of this work lies in the development of AdaEQ, a generalized ensemble method for the ensemble size adaptation, aiming to minimize the estimation bias during the learning process. Specifically, the approximation error in each iteration is quantified by comparing the difference between the Q-estimates and the Monte Carlo return using the current learned policy over a testing trajectory  . Inspired by MIAC, the approximation error serves as the feedback to adapt the ensemble size.\nBesides, we introduce a ‘tolerance’ parameter in the adaptation mechanism to balance the control tendency towards positive or negative bias during the learning process.\nIn this way, AdaEQ can encompass other existing ensemble methods as special cases, including Maxmin , by properly setting this hyperparameter. A salient feature of the feedback-adaptation mechanism is that it can be used effectively in conjunction with both standard Q-learning 2 and actor-critic methods 8 .\nExperimental results on the continuous-control MuJoCo benchmark 0 show that AdaEQ is robust to the initial ensemble size in different environments, and achieves higher average return, thanks to keeping the estimation bias close to zero, when compared to the state-of-the-art ensemble methods such as REDQ  and Average-DQN . Related Work. Bias-corrected Q-learning  introduces the bias correction term to reduce the overestimation bias. Double Q-learning is proposed in   to address the overestimation issue in vanilla Q-learning, by leveraging two independent Q-function approximators to estimate the maximum Q-function value in the target. S-DQN and S-DDQN use the softmax operator instead of the max operator to further reduce the overestimation bias 7. Self-correcting Q-learning aims to balance the underestimation in double Q-learning and overestimation in classic Q learning by introducing a\nnew self-correcting estimator 8. Weighted Q-learning proposes a new estimator based on the weighted average of the sample means, and conducts the empirical analysis in the discrete action space . \nWeighted Double Q-learning 7 uses the Q-approximator together with the double Q-approximator to balance the overestimation and underestimation bias. Nevertheless, acquiring independent approximators is often intractable for large-scale tasks. To resolve this issue, the Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) [ref]9 and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)  have been devised to take the minimum over two approximators in the target network. Along a different avenue, the ensemble-based methods generalize double Q-learning to correct the overestimation bias by increasing the number of Q-function approximators. Particularly, Average-DQN  takes the average of multiple approximators in the target to reduce the overestimation error, and Random Ensemble Mixture (REM) [ref]1 estimates the target value using the random convex combination of the approximators. It is worth noting that both Average-DQN and REM cannot completely eliminate the overestimation bias. Most recently, Maxmin Q-learning  defines a proxy Q-function by choosing the minimum Q-value for each action among all approximators. Similar to Maxmin, Random Ensembled Q-learning (REDQ)  formulates the proxy Q-function by choosing only a subset of the ensemble. Nevertheless, both Maxmin and REDQ use a fixed ensemble size. In this study, we introduce an adaptation mechanism for the ensemble size to drive the estimation bias to be close to zero, thereby mitigating the possible overestimation and underestimation issues.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: .
