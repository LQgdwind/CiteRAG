All compared methods in table 4 are classified into three categories: traditional machine learning(ML), deep learning(DL), and hybrid deep learning(HDL). Most popular traditional machine learning algorithm in ECG signal classification SVM:    . XGBoost , Random Forest , and LDA-MLP  methods also show their performance in ECG classification in recent times. SVM classification with Wavelet coefficient and RR interval ECG signal classification  with 89.02% accuracy, 62.2% precision, and 56.27% recall. Another SVM  classifier with RR and ECG projection matrix classified variable-length ECG signals with 98.46% accuracy.\nLDA-MLP  method with temporal and morphological features to classify ECG signal with 89.02% accuracy, XGBoost with handcraft features  for ECG classification got 91.87% accuracy. RR intervals, Wavelet coefficient, and Morphological descriptor used in SVM-based ECG classification . All other SVM-based classifiers    to classify ECG signals got accuracy between 91% to 97%. It is observed that the SVM  classifier with multiple features to classify ECG signals with the highest accuracy, 98.91%, among traditional machine learning methods.\nThe most common deep learning-based method is CNN, which here clearly showed superior performance with greater facility compared to other methods. A recently developed method employing CNN  determined patient-specific features with as high as 99.00% accuracy.\nAnother method using CNN  obtained 92.70% accuracy for classifying 0.5s long ECG signal with 200 samples. Mostly this used CNN-based methods with the generation of synthetic data and rescaling of raw data to classify ECG signals with 94.03% accuracy. A method with random projections and extracted RR-interval features and variable length of ECG signal using CNN  with 88.33% accuracy, 64.2% precision, and 57.0% recall.\nA hybrid method with the combination of CNN with RNN gave a precision of 98.10% .\nYıldırım et al.  proposed a CNN-LSTM based. This method used rescaling tools to preprocess ECG signals and it obtained 91.33% accuracy in ECG classification. This author also developed a method with attention to LSTM and obtained 99.11% precision . Another new method using CNN and BiLSTM  gave an accuracy of 96.77%, 77.8% precision, and 81.2% recall obtained by this method. Dilated CNN-based method developed by Ma et al.  with utilizing data denoising and normalization to detect arrhythmia with 98.65% accuracy.\nDang et al. [ref]14. proposed CNN with a BiLSTM-based method to classify ECG signals obtained 69.59% precision. Jin et al  proposed a technique utilizing CNN-LSTM with attention that uses domain knowledge and got 98.51% accuracy in classifying five types of ECG signals. Another technique with CNN-BiLSTM  obtained 99.11% accuracy for ECG classification. Compared Performance is presented in table 4. A multivariate ECG classification by residual channel attention networks  and BiGRU obtained 96.7% and 97.7% accuracy for long and short-length ECG signals. This method used Lead attention and morphological and temporal features very well. This proposed HARDC method used synthetic and preprocessed ECG signals with 360 samples of 1.5s long. In comparison, our hybrid HARDC model achieved the highest accuracy of 99.60%, F1 of 98.21%, and 97.66% precision.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: and 81.2% recall obtained by this method.
