      "content": "Paper Title: Safe and Accelerated Deep Reinforcement Learning-based O-RAN Slicing: A Hybrid Transfer Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture  was proposed by the O-RAN alliance to support the evolution of next-generation networks (NGNs) [ref]2. Virtualization, openness, and intelligence are inherent properties of such an architecture. The O-RAN architecture provides open interfaces for flexible network management and automation [ref]3. These standardized interfaces will enable mobile network operators (MNOs) to flexibly and intelligently control various radio resource management (RRM) functionalities in a closed-loop fashion. The flexibility provided by O-RAN is essential as more customizable radio access network (RAN) products are needed to adapt to the various network scenarios and the new services offered. This also allows MNOs to dynamically change the network configurations to reflect their priorities and objectives at a given time. The O-RAN paradigm is therefore expected to bring gains in many cellular network applications, especially those that necessitate dynamic control based on the network conditions and service requirements such as network slicing [ref]3. In NGNs, the optimization domains and network requirements are expected to become larger and tighter respectively. This will make solving dynamic RRM problems even more complex [ref]4. Next-generation cellular networks have key performance indicators (KPIs) and other measurements used to quantify the performance of the various services. Examples are throughput, latency, quality of experience (QoE), quality of service (QoS), and radio channel conditions. This is seamlessly compatible with the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) feedback loop of observing the system state, taking action, and receiving rewards accordingly. DRL agents can adapt to the dynamic O-RAN environment and make quick decisions based on the available knowledge in an open-control fashion . Hence, DRL algorithms are among the most promising methods to design O-RAN-compliant data-driven applications hosted by the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) . Such applications are called xApps. This allows an MNO to intelligently adjust network settings to achieve an optimal RRM configuration for a given network condition. Despite the potential benefits introduced by the O-RAN RICs, the practical adoption of DRL algorithms in real network deployments falls behind. The main reasons for this are the slow convergence and unstable performance that the DRL agents undergo . This is particularly evident when DRL-based xApps are newly deployed and when experiencing extreme situations or significant changes in the network conditions . Slow convergence relates to the considerable number of time steps the DRL agent takes to find or recover optimal configurations for a given RRM functionality. Unstable performance relates to sudden drops in the O-RAN system’s performance. A certain performance level must be maintained by O-RAN systems to guarantee users’ QoE and the overall system’s QoS. Hence, the instabilities due to DRL exploration affect these two measurements negatively. The training of DRL agents should be done offline initially according to the O-RAN recommendations . This ensures that the trained models do not affect the performance and stability of the network. Nevertheless, the offline simulation environments are usually inaccurate and do not reflect all the situations that could be experienced in practical deployment environments. This applies even if real network data was logged and used to simulate such environments offline 0. This is not the case in other applications such as training a DRL agent to play a computer game. Unlike O-RAN-based NGNs, the game training environment will still match the deployment environment. However, whenever an xApp is newly deployed in O-RAN’s near-RT RIC, some online learning is still required by the incorporated DRL agent to adapt to the live network environment 1. Moreover, learning is needed whenever the agent experiences extreme cases or when the network context changes significantly 2. In both situations, some exploration may be required, while the DRL agent recovers, to avoid affecting the performance of the available services substantially. Convergence needs to be quick and stable so that the end user’s QoE is not affected. Nonetheless, it may take thousands of learning steps to recover, given the stochasticity of NGNs O-RAN systems and the exploratory nature of the DRL-based xApps. This is of great significance in live network deployments. NGNs can only tolerate a few iterations of stable exploration while optimizing near-RT O-RAN functionalities . The approaches used to tackle such challenges are known as safe and accelerated DRL techniques as defined in  and 3. Such techniques attempt to reduce service level agreements (SLAs) violations and to avoid any system performance instabilities. They also aim to shorten the exploration and recovery duration of DRL-based xApps in O-RAN. These approaches can help pave the way for adopting trustworthy DRL to optimize dynamic RRM functionalities in O-RAN. Transfer learning (TL) is among the main methods used to address the DRL-related practical challenges mentioned earlier 4 5. TL can be used to guide a newly deployed DRL-based xApp while learning the optimal policy in network conditions it has not experienced before. A policy learned by a previously trained DRL agent can be used as a guide in such a case. This can be done in several ways as demonstrated in this study. In this paper, we address the challenge of slow and unstable DRL convergence in the context of O-RAN slicing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose TL as a core component for safe and accelerated DRL-based xApps in O-RAN, and more specifically in the closed-loop control of O-RAN slicing. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose to incorporate TL as a core component of DRL-based control of network functionalities in the O-RAN architecture. We propose training and deployment workflows in the non-real-time (non-RT) and near-RT RICs respectively. TL tackles the challenges of slow and unstable DRL convergence by reusing knowledge from pre-trained expert policies. The proposed flows aim at enhancing the convergence and generalizability of O-RAN DRL-based xApps. They accommodate the difference between offline training and live deployment environments. They also accommodate significant changes in the network conditions. We propose a hybrid TL-aided DRL approach for safe and accelerated convergence of DRL-based O-RAN slicing xApps. The proposed approach combines policy reuse and distillation TL methods to guide the DRL agent’s convergence and strike a balance between deterministic and directed exploratory actions. We also propose policy reuse and distillation as two separate TL-aided DRL baselines in addition to the non-TL-aided DRL baseline. We conduct a thorough study on intelligent O-RAN slicing to demonstrate the gains of the proposed hybrid TL-aided DRL approach. We analyze the reward convergence behavior of the proposed approach and baselines. We then evaluate their safety and acceleration aspects. We finally investigate the effect of the introduced parameter, γ𝛾\\gamma, which controls the TL method to be used, on the performance of the proposed hybrid approach. Our approach shows at least: a 7.7% and 20.7% improvements in the average initial reward value and the percentage of converged scenarios, and a 64.6% decrease in reward variance while maintaining fast convergence and enhancing the generalizability compared with the baselines. Our experiments support multiple services, including real VR gaming traffic to reflect immersive scenarios of O-RAN slicing in NGNs. We develop and publicly share the implementation of our OpenAI Gym-compatible DRL environment, and the proposed approach and baselines to facilitate research on trustworthy DRL in O-RAN. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II discusses the related work. Section III details the system model. The proposed O-RAN workflows, hybrid approach, and baselines are described in Section IV. Section V includes the experimental setup and an analysis of the results. Finally, we conclude our work and present potential future directions in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture  was proposed by the O-RAN alliance to support the evolution of next-generation networks (NGNs) [ref]2.
