      "content": "Paper Title: High-Fidelity Guided Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvaluation metrics.\nGiven an input stroke painting, we compare the performance of our approach with prior works in guided image synthesis when no paired data is available. The performance of the final outputs is measured in terms of both faithfulness of the generated image with the target stroke painting as well as the realism of the final output distribution. In particular, given an input painting y𝑦y and output real image prediction x𝑥x, we define faithfulness ℱ​(x,y)ℱ𝑥𝑦\\mathcal{F}(x,y) as, where f(.)f(.) is the painting function. Thus an output image x𝑥x is said to have high faithfulness with the given painting y𝑦y if upon painting the final output x𝑥x we get a painting y~=f​(x)~𝑦𝑓𝑥\\tilde{y}=f(x) which is similar to the original target painting y𝑦y. Similarly, given a set of output data samples 𝒮​(y,τt​e​x​t)𝒮𝑦subscript𝜏𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡\\mathcal{S}({y,\\tau_{text}}) conditioned on both painting y𝑦y and text τt​e​x​tsubscript𝜏𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡\\tau_{text}, and, 𝒮​(τt​e​x​t)𝒮subscript𝜏𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡\\mathcal{S}({\\tau_{text}}) conditioned only on the text, the realism ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is defined as, where F​I​D𝐹𝐼𝐷FID represents the Fisher inception distance . Baselines. We compare our approach with prior works on guided image synthesis from stroke paintings with no paired data. In particular we show comparisons with, 1) SDEdit [ref]23 wherein the generative prior is introduced by first passing the painting y𝑦y through the forward diffusion pass y→yt0→𝑦subscript𝑦subscript𝑡0y\\rightarrow y_{t_{0}}  , and then performing reverse diffusion yt0→y0→subscript𝑦subscript𝑡0subscript𝑦0y_{t_{0}}\\rightarrow y_{0} to get the output image x=y0𝑥subscript𝑦0x=y_{0}111Please note that due to space constraints, we primarily use the standard hyperparameter value of t0=0.8subscript𝑡00.8t_{0}=0.8 in the main paper, and refer the reader to the supp. material for detailed comparisons with changing t0∈[ref]0 subscript𝑡001t_{0}\\in[ref]0 ..\n2) SDEdit + Loopback [ref]4 which reuses the last diffusion output to iteratively increase the realism of the final output. 3) ILVR222Please note that the original ILVR  algorithm was proposed for iterative refinement with diffusion models in pixel space. We adapt the ILVR implementation for inference with latent diffusion models  for the purposes of this paper. Please refer supp. material for further details.[ref]23: which uses an iterative refinement approach for conditioning the output x𝑥x of the diffusion model with a guidance image y𝑦y. Unless otherwise specified, we use the GradOP+ algorithm\n(refer Alg. 2)\nwhen reporting evaluation results. Qualitative Results. Results are shown in Fig. 4. We observe that both proposed approximate optimization methods (i.e. GradOP in row-1,2 and GradOP+ in row-3,4) lead to output images which are both highly photorealistic as well as faithful with reference painting.\nIn contrast, while\nSDEdit [ref]23 shows high faithfulness to the input painting, the final outputs lack details and resemble more of a pictorial art rather than realistic photos.\nIteratively reperforming the guided synthesis with the generated outputs (SDEdit + Loopback [ref]4) helps improve the realism of output images,\nhowever, we find that this has two main disadvantages. First, the iterative loop increases the effective time required for generating each data sample (e.g. four reverse sampling steps instead of just one). Second, we note that as the number of successive iterations increase the final outputs become less and less faithful to the original painting input. Finally, ILVR  leads to more realistic outputs, however, the final outputs are not fully faithful to the reference painting in terms of the overall color composition. Quantitative Results.\nIn addition to qualitative results we also quantitatively evaluate the final outputs on the faithfulness ℱ​(x,y)ℱ𝑥𝑦\\mathcal{F}(x,y) and targeted-realism ℛ(.)\\mathcal{R}(.) metrics defined earlier. Additionally, similar to [ref]23 we also perform a human user study wherein the realism and the overall satisfaction score (faithfulness + realism) are evaluated by human subjects (please refer supp. material for details). Results are shown in Tab. 1. We find that as expected, while SDEdit [ref]23 leads to the best faithfulness with the target painting, it exhibits very poor performance in terms of the realism score. SDEdit with loopback [ref]4 improves the realism score but the resulting images start loosing faithfulness with the given reference. In contrast, our approach leads to the best tradeoff between faithfulness to the target image and realism with respect to the target domain.\nThese findings are also reflected in the user-study results wherein our method is preferred by >85.32%absentpercent85.32>85.32\\% of human subjects in terms of the overall satisfaction score.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Fisher inception distance .
