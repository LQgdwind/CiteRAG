Several\nsingle-compartment models have incorporated adaptive variables to enhance the efficacy of temporal information representation.\nFor instance, [ref]14 and  propose to use adaptive firing thresholds, which function as long-term memory to enhance temporal processing;\n[ref]33 utilizes learnable decay constants to enhance the heterogeneity of neuron populations, enabling them to effectively represent multi-scale temporal information;\n introduces a gating mechanism into the neuron model to explicitly control memory storage and retrieval processes. Comparatively, multi-compartment models utilize compartmental heterogeneity or recurrent interaction to represent information across different timescales.\nFor example,  proposes a two-compartment model where the thresholds undergo a double-exponential decay, facilitating the storage of both short and long-term information;  introduces a heterogeneous model consisting of one soma compartment and varied dendrite-branch compartments;  proposes a two-compartment model that captures the interactive dynamics between the soma and dendrites. Although these handcrafted models demonstrate enhanced performance, there is a pressing need for a principled approach to efficiently scale them and incorporate a variable number of compartments. This is crucial for enhancing their temporal processing capability, which serves as the central focus of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Recent enhancements in spiking neuron models for temporal processing can be categorized into single- or multi-compartment models according to the number of membrane potential subunits involved [ref]32.
