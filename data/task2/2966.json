      "content": "Paper Title: All-In-One: Artificial Association Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are two groups of tasks defined in this study: main tasks and subtasks. The main tasks refer to tasks performed only in the root neuronode, and the subtasks refer to simple tasks performed at each node level. It seems appropriate to assign simple tasks as subtasks performed at the node level. TBCNNs have been effective in the subtask of predicting a parent node[ref]23.\nFrom a time-series data perspective, these tasks are equivalent to tasks that predict the input of the next step, and therefore, they are used in RNNs (Fig 6(b)).\nThus, a function that performs node-level tasks by connecting to other networks based on the subtask is defined as ΦssubscriptΦ𝑠\\Phi_{s}. In this approach, the task of the root node is special; the tasks performed in the root node can be combined with other neural networks such as deep Q-networks(DQNs) to perform actions or relate to various thinking activities.\nThese tasks are defined as main tasks; therefore, in this study, a function that coordinates with other neural networks based on the main task is defined as ΦmsubscriptΦ𝑚\\Phi_{m}. This ΦmsubscriptΦ𝑚\\Phi_{m} performs the task by inputting the hidden state of the root node (h→r​o​o​t′subscriptsuperscript→ℎ′𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡\\overrightarrow{h}^{\\prime}_{root}) and overall neurotree (𝐍𝐓′superscript𝐍𝐓′\\mathbf{NT}^{\\prime}) resulting from DFC (Section III-F). The information that can be used inside the neurotree can differ for different main tasks; the classifier uses the hidden state in the root node when performing the classification task.\nThe overall neuronode information needs to be entered when performing a restoration task such as using a decoder(e.g., an autoencoder[ref]35). The main task in this paper comprises the classification in various domains.\nOther main tasks in progress will be introduced in future studies [ref]36  . In AANs, τdsubscript𝜏𝑑\\tau_{d} indicates multidomain information, building a neurotree (𝐍𝐓𝐍𝐓\\mathbf{NT}) indicates multimodal learning, and τs,τmsubscript𝜏𝑠subscript𝜏𝑚\\tau_{s},\\tau_{m} denotes multi-tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: simple tasks performed at each node level. It seems appropriate to assign simple tasks as subtasks performed at the node level. TBCNNs have been effective in the subtask of predicting a parent node[ref]23.\nFrom a time-series data perspective, these tasks are equivalent to tasks that predict the input of the next step, and therefore, they are used in RNNs (Fig 6(b)).\nThus, a function that\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
