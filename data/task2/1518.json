      "content": "Paper Title: GLocalX - From Local to Global Explanations of Black Box AI Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge, no global frameworks merging local explanations are present in the literature.\nHowever, related work comprises of a set of both global and local explanation methods .\nIn addition, we can distinguish between methods that explain the black box post-hoc, and methods that are, on the other hand, explainable by design . Explainable by design algorithms directly solve the classification problem  and yield an interpretable and global model.\nThe most well known interpretable by design families of models comprise of the Decision Tree  (dt) and the rule-based classifiers (rbc), such as cpar , Decision Sets [ref]28  and corels .\ncpar  combines the positive aspects of both associative classification and traditional rule-based classification, greedily generating a small set of rules directly from training data.\nDecision Sets  are “collections of if-then rules that can be considered in any order”.\nGiven a set of rules, a set of functions is used to identify a subset which enjoys low internal conflict and several other desirable properties such as coverage, shortness, and accuracy.\ncorels  also generates compact explanations with a optimality guarantees by using a discrete optimization technique for building sorted rule lists over categorical feature spaces.\nWe observe different approaches to tackling the complexity of the interpretable global model, with some families ignoring it , partially acknowledging it  or fully including it [ref]28 in the construction phase. Concerning post-hoc black box explanation, several foundational works rely on training explainable by design models leveraging queries to black box models.\nAn example of this family is the Conj Rules approach , which interprets a neural network by framing rule extraction as a learning problem.\nAlong the same lines is Trepan [ref]15, a refinement of the previous approach based on a decision tree specifically built for explaining the behavior of a black box.\nThe original training data and a randomized extension of it are labeled by the black box and used as training data for an interpretable model.\nThe model learns a Decision Tree that maximizes both the gain ratio [ref]33 and the current model fidelity to the black box.\nAn advantage of Trepan with respect to common tree classifiers  is that by enriching the dataset all splits are performed on a considerable amount of data.\nAnother approach using a single tree approximation as an interpretable explanation of the global model is InTrees .\nIt extracts, measures, prunes and selects the final explanation rules from tree ensembles, and calculates frequent variable interactions.\nWe underline that the InTrees approach is model-dependent and cannot be generalized for explaining every black box, while in Trepan we can plug in any query-able black box, making Trepan a more powerful and flexible algorithm. More recently, we are observing a shift of paradigm towards local approaches for explaining the decision of black box classifiers for a single instance.\nThese approaches assume that complex black box models such as deep neural networks implement an overall global logic too complex to be explained and/or understood.\nConversely, they assume that local predictions of a single instance can be explained.\nWe call this assumption of explainability in a local neighborhood the local explainability assumption.\nlime  is the first attempt to derive a local explanation, as it relies on instances randomly generated in the neighborhood of the instance to be explained.\nThe authors propose a feature importance framework in which instances are mapped to a simpler interpretable space on which a linear model is used to compute an importance score for each interpretable feature.\nInterpretable features are then mapped back to the original feature space to provide an explanation.\nlime also provides a global feature importance tool to assess the feature relevance to discriminate in classification tasks, LIME-SP.\nFeature importance is the target of another local explainability model, shap , which frames feature importance as a collaborative game in which features are rewarded according to their contribution to the black box prediction.\nThe game is framed in a formal game theory setting in which features approximate the provably unique Shapley values .\nBased on the neighborhood generation premise is also lore , which populates neighborhoods via genetic programming, optimizing both for the neighborhood distance and its label distribution.\nAs in lime, the neighborhood is then used to train an explainable model from which an explanation is extracted.\nlore employs Decision Trees as explainable models, hence, other than returning a rule as an explanation, it is able to generate a set of counterfactual explanations, i.e., a set of rules similar to the one returned, but with a different outcome.\nThis feature is particularly valuable in actionable settings, in which the model user may understand what changes to apply to data to comply with the black box predictions.\nThe authors of lime also propose anchors , an algorithm that generates explanations in the form of decision rules by iteratively guessing premises and optimizing their precision.\nAn anchor explanation consists of a minimal set of premises that guarantees a baseline of accuracy even when new premises are added.\nTo quote the authors, an anchor “is a rule [..] such that changes to the rest of the feature values of the instance do not matter.”\nLocal explanation methods have repeatedly shown high accuracy, seldom outperforming global models.\nThis, jointly with the local explainability assumption, prompts us to ask whether we can leverage local models to learn global ones while preserving their high fidelity.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: interpretable and global model.\nThe most well known interpretable by design families of models comprise of the Decision Tree  (dt) and the rule-based classifiers (rbc), such as cpar , Decision Sets [ref]28  and corels .\ncpar  combines the positive aspects of both associative classification and traditional rule-based classification, greedily generating a small set of rules directly from training\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
