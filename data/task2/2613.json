      "content": "Paper Title: InSeGAN: A Generative Approach to Segmenting Identical Instances in Depth Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIdentifying (nearly) identical instances of objects is a problem that is ubiquitous in daily life. For example, when taking a paperclip from a container, choosing an apple from a box, or removing a book from a library shelf, humans subconsciously solve this problem because we have an understanding of what the individual instances are. However, when robots are deployed for such a picking task, they need to be able to identify the instances for planning their grasp and approach¬†[ref]30 . Such a problem is commonplace in large manufacturing, industrial, and agricultural contexts¬†8    0. Examples include an industrial robot picking parts from a bin, a warehouse robot picking and placing packages into a delivery truck, or even a fruit-picking robot picking identical fruits in a supermarket. In these scenarios, the robot‚Äôs owners often have no access to a 3D model of the object to be picked, and annotating individual instances for training can be costly, inconvenient, and unscalable. However, they may have access to a large number of unlabeled images each containing multiple instances of the object, such as depth images of boxes as they travel on a conveyor belt from production to a packaging section. Our goal in this paper is to build an unsupervised instance segmentation algorithm using unlabeled depth images, each containing multiple identical instances of a 3D object. Our problem setting is very different from the instance segmentation setups that are typically considered, such as that of Mask-RCNN¬†, 3D point cloud segmentation¬†8, scene understanding¬†, and others¬† 1 5. While these methods usually consider segmenting instances from cluttered backgrounds, our backgrounds are usually simple; however, the foreground instances can be heavily (self-)occluded or may vary drastically in appearance across their poses (see Fig.¬†1 for example). Prior methods to solve our instance segmentation problem use 3D CAD models¬†, fit the 3D instances using primitive shapes¬†, or use classical image-matching techniques to identify the instances¬† . More recently, some have attempted to solve this task using deep learning approaches. For example, in Wu et al.¬†6, a 3D rendering framework is presented that is trained to infer the segmentation masks; however, their losses are prone to local minima. In the recent IODINE¬†, MONET¬†, and Slot Attention¬†9 deep models, the focus is on RGB scene decomposition, and may not generalize to segmenting foreground instances from each other. In this paper, we present a general unsupervised framework for instance segmentation in depth images, which we call InSeGAN. Our model is inspired by a key observation made in several recent works (e.g.,¬†3 ) that random noise that is systematically injected into a generative adversarial network (GAN) can control various attributes of the generated images. A natural question then is whether we can generate an image with a specific number of instances feeding in the respective number of random noise vectors. If so, then instance segmentation could be reduced to simply decoding a test image into several noise vectors, each of which generates its respective instance. InSeGAN implements this idea using a combination of a 3D GAN and an image encoder within an analysis-by-synthesis framework, illustrated in Fig.¬†2. The training data consist of an unlabeled collection of depth images, each image consisting of nùëõn instances of a rigid object. InSeGAN learns an implicit 3D representation of the object shape and a pose decoder that maps random noise vectors to 3D rigid transformations. The generator has two stages. In the first stage, the decoded 3D transformation is applied to the implicit object template, which an instance feature generator converts into a feature-map representation of a single object instance. After the first stage generates nùëõn such instance representations from nùëõn random noise vectors, the second stage aggregates these instance representations and feeds them into a depth image renderer to produce synthetic depth images that are similar in distribution to the training images, as enforced via a discriminator. To achieve instance segmentation, we train an encoder that takes as input a generated multiple-instance depth image and encodes it into a latent space in which it must match the random noise vectors that originally generated the images in the GAN stream, thus closing the generation cycle. At inference time, a given depth image first goes through the encoder to get its set of single-instance latent vectors; these are then fed into the GAN to synthesize each instance (each image segment) individually. Results on two example test images are shown in Fig.¬†1. While the task of instance segmentation has been approached in various contexts, there is no existing dataset that encompasses this task in the context we are after in this paper. For example, images in standard datasets such as MSCOCO¬†7 and CityScapes¬† contain objects of several different classes and background, which may not belong to a common latent space. We introduce a new dataset, dubbed ‚ÄúInsta-10,‚Äù consisting of 10 object classes and 10,000 depth images per class. Each image was rendered using a physics engine that simulated a bin into which 5 instances of an object are randomly dropped, resulting in arbitrary poses of the objects in the rendered depth images. The instances can have significant occlusions and size variations (due to varying distances from the camera), making the task very challenging. We use this dataset to compare our scheme with closely related methods. We also apply our instance segmentation approach to a real-world dataset of blocks in noisy depth images. Our results show that InSeGAN outperforms all of the prior methods by a significant margin on most of the object classes. We now summarize this paper‚Äôs primary contributions: We propose InSeGAN, a 3D GAN that learns to generate multiple-instance depth images from sets of random noise vectors in an unsupervised manner. We propose a two-stage generator structure for InSeGAN, in which the first stage generates a feature map representation of each instance, and the second aggregates these single-instance feature maps and renders a multiple-instance depth image. To enable segmentation, we propose an instance pose encoder that encodes a multiple-instance depth image into a set of latent vectors that would generate it. To train this encoder, we introduce novel cycle-consistency losses. We have created a new large-scale and challenging dataset, Insta-10, which we are making public to advance research on this topic. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that InSeGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Insta-10 dataset, InSeGAN shows a relative improvement of nearly 35% against the recent method of Wu et al.¬†6 and nearly 9.3% against Locatello et al.¬†9.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: an understanding of what the individual instances are.
