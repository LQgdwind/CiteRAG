      "content": "Paper Title: DiffSketcher: Text Guided Vector Sketch Synthesis through Latent Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMinimal representations, such as sketches and natural language, are powerful tools for effectively conveying ideas by emphasizing the subject’s essence. As the carriers of abstract concepts, natural language conveys abstract semantic understanding, whereas sketches embody the human visual abstract presentation. A sketch can provide more visual details than natural language, making the concept more concrete. When a designer discusses the design plan with a client, the designer may sketch a prototype based on the client’s description to ensure a full understanding of his/her requirements. If the process of text-to-sketch could be learned automatically, it would significantly lessen associated labor costs. Unfortunately, the task of text-to-sketch generation remains unexplored. Some studies conducted on generating image-conditioned sketches [ref]3  [ref]45 [ref]44. One such method is Info-drawing [ref]3, which treats a sketch as a photo and uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate a raster sketch based on an input image. It also introduces a style loss to ensure the generated sketches have a similar style to the reference sketch used in training. CLIPasso [ref]45 presents a novel pipeline to produce vector sketches through a differentiable rasterizer optimized by a semantic loss. CLIPasso can only handle the images with a single object, so its follow-up work CLIPascene [ref]44 extends to scene-level images. However, all of these methods depend on input images and do not facilitate the generation of sketches directly from text inputs.\nMoreover, despite their ability to generate realistic sketches from photos, these methods have a limitation in that they cannot generate new content. Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have been driven by diffusion models     trained on billions of image-text pairs . These models, conditioned on text, now support high-fidelity, diverse, and controllable image synthesis. Nonetheless, the present text-to-image diffusion models cannot produce highly abstract and vectorized free-hand sketches (as shown in Fig. 2).\nWe draw inspiration from the highly effective text-to-image diffusion models and image-conditioned sketch generators to build a bridge between two fundamental forms of human expression, namely text and free-hand sketches, resulting in the development of our proposed text-to-sketch generator. In this work, we present DiffSketcher, an algorithm that can synthesize novel and high-quality free-hand vector sketches based on natural language text input. DiffSketcher does not require any text-to-sketch training pairs or large datasets of sketches. Instead, with the guidance of a pretrained diffusion model , we define a sketch as a set of Bézier curves and optimize the curves’ parameters through a differentiable rasterizer . The key idea behind DiffSketcher is to transfer the prior knowledge from text-to-image generation model into the differentiable rasterizer. This allows the optimization of text-guided sketches with semantic consistency, ensuring that the final output sketches are coherent and aligned with their corresponding text inputs.\nHowever, it is a non-trivial task to fully leverage the pre-trained diffusion model to efficiently generate high-quality free-hand sketches for both simple objects and complex scenes. To this end, we propose three strategies to improve the generation quality and efficiency:\n(1) Present an extended Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) Loss to guide the optimization of curve parameters.\nPrevious works optimize the parameters of the vector sketch with CLIP loss. We found that an extended version of SDS loss can give more diverse sketch synthesis results, and it can be combined with CLIP loss or LPIPS loss, providing an additional control term.\n(2) Explore attention maps embedded in the diffusion model for effective stroke initialization.\nThe synthesis process can be very time-consuming if the starting point of each stroke is randomly initialized. Therefore, we explore different initialization strategies and present to initialize the curve control points with a fused product of cross-attention maps and self-attention maps in the U-Net  of the diffusion model,\nwhich significantly improves the efficiency compared to the random initialization.\n(3) Introduce opacity property during the optimization of Bézier curves to better mimic the style of human sketches, achieving the effect of heavy and light brushstrokes.\n In summary our contributions are three-fold:\n(1) We propose a text-to-sketch diffusion model dubbed DiffSketcher. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first diffusion model to generate diverse and high-quality vector sketches with different levels of abstraction at the object and scene levels.\n(2) We present three strategies to improve the generation quality and efficiency, including an extended SDS loss and an attention-enhanced stroke initialization strategy. The opacity property of strokes is considered during synthesis to improve the visual effect further.\n(3) We conduct extensive experiments, and the experimental results show that our model outperforms other models in sketch quality and diversity. Thorough insights are provided for future research.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: it would significantly lessen associated labor costs.
