Crowdsourced data annotation offers a time- and cost-efficient means to collect large-scale datasets for deep learning tasks .\nHowever, due to the imperfect crowd annotators, crowdsourced labels are often noisy; this has become a key concern for training deep neural networks . To learn a classifier in the context of noisy crowd labels, existing methods fall into two paradigms, as shown in Figure 1:\n(1)\nThe two-stage learning-from-noisy-crowds-labels (LNCL) paradigm that first uses\ntruth inference methods     [ref]7   0 1 to infer the true label of each instance and then performs traditional supervised learning;\n(2)\nThe one-stage LNCL paradigm that directly learns from noisy crowds labels in an end-to-end manner using ad hoc LNCL methods 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1, which use all available information together to perform global optimization to obtain the classifier of interest and generally result in better performance.\nSpecifically, existing work on the recently prevailing one-stage LNCL mainly take two approaches: probabilistic or deep learning.\nThe probabilistic approach models true labels as latent variables and uses expectation maximization (EM) to infer the true labels and to learn the parameters of the classifier (which generally be a deep neural network) in an iterative manner 2 3 4 5 6.\nMore recent efforts have focused on the deep learning approach, which trains a deep neural architecture from noisy labels in an end-to-end manner, by introducing into the architecture an extra neural layer that maps latent true labels to the noisy crowd labels 7 9 0 1. In the broader AI community, there is a well-known thorny problem for all deep neural networks:\nwhile being flexible to capture complex mapping between the features and label, deep learning approaches are generally data-hungry and not robust—they only learn (possibly spurious) statistical correlations.\nIn learning from noisy crowd labels,\nall existing prevailing one-stage LNCL approaches suffer much more from those issues for at least the following two reasons.\n(1) On the one hand, those approaches contain additional parameters that model the reliability of each individual crowd annotator; consequently, training those approaches—that contain parameters of both neural network classifiers and annotators—requires a much larger amount of data than the conventional neural networks;\n(2) On the other hand, the presence of label noise makes it harder for the neural network to recognize relevant information from the training data for classification. As a result, the learned data representations may turn out to be dominated by information irrelevant to the true labels, thus becoming useless or even negatively impacting the performance. In comparison to learning-based, data-driven approaches, reasoning-based, knowledge-driven approaches are more sample-efficient and more robust\nbecause of their capability of representing concepts and the causal relations among them.\nRecent discussions in the AI communities have converged on the idea of integrating symbolic approaches with machine learning 2 3.\nA visible trend is the growing body of work on neural-symbolic methods.\nFor example, Allamanis et al. 4 propose to learn continuous representations of symbolic knowledge for integration into neural networks;\nXu et al. 5 present the semantic loss that augments the learning objective of neural networks with soft-constraints specified with domain knowledge.\nOn the application side, neural-symbolic methods have been applied to both vision and language tasks including\nvisual relation prediction 6,\nvisual question answering (VQA) 7,\ntext sentiment analysis 8,\nand semantic parsing 9. In this paper, we move one step further and explore:\nin the presence of noisy crowd labels that makes the model more vulnerable and data-hungry, how can we capitalize on the interpretable and robust logic knowledge in learning from noisy crowd labels to improve the model’s generalization?\nDespite the obvious benefit of the neural-symbolic paradigm, it remains unclear how to best exploit logic knowledge in our context—existing neural-symbolic methods are not easily applicable due to the specific need for the inference of true labels from noisy crowd labels.\nSpecifically, properly inferring true labels needs to take into account the influence of logic knowledge and the reliability of annotators, while learning the parameters of the classifiers in a unified and principled framework.\nTo address these problem, we introduce\nLogic-guided Learning from Noisy Crowd Labels\n(Logic-LNCL), an EM-alike iterative logic knowledge distillation framework that allows neural networks to learn simultaneously from the noisy labels and logic rules.\nUnlike all existing probabilistic models for learning from crowd labels,\nin our “pseudo-E-step”, we introduce a new type of learning target\nby adapting the original learning target with posterior regularization defined by the rules.\nThen, inspired by knowledge distillation 0, both the original and adapted learning targets are used in the “pseudo-M-step” to update the parameters of the deep neural networks and those of the crowd annotators.\nBy doing so, our framework seamlessly integrates symbolic logic knowledge and the inference for true labels, while allowing the deep neural network to\nlearn from both data and logic knowledge. Contributions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nincorporate logic rules in learning from noisy (crowd) labels problems with a principled framework.\nWe introduce Logic-LNCL, an EM-alike iterative logic knowledge distillation framework\nfor learning from both noisy crowd labels and logic rules.\nWe demonstrate the versatility of Logic-LNCL by instantiating it on two representative language tasks,\ntext sentiment classification and named entity recognition.\nWe conduct extensive evaluations of our proposed framework on real-world datasets, showing that Logic-LNCL improves the classifier’s generalization and outperforms the state-of-the-art.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: of noisy crowd labels, existing methods fall into two paradigms, as shown in Figure 1:\n(1)\nThe two-stage learning-from-noisy-crowds-labels (LNCL) paradigm that first uses\ntruth inference methods     [ref]7   0 1 to infer the true label of each instance and then performs traditional supervised learning;\n(2)\nThe one-stage LNCL paradigm that directly learns from noisy crowds labels in an end-to-end\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
