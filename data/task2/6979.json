      "content": "Paper Title: Mira: Cracking Black-box Watermarking on Deep Neural Networks via Model Inversion-based Removal Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate the removal effectiveness of Mira, we perform a comprehensive study on the vulnerability of ten state-of-the-art black-box watermarking schemes listed in Table 1.\nBefore presenting the detailed evaluation results, we first provide a concise introduction to the experimental setups. ∙∙\\bullet Datasets and Victim Models.\nFollowing the settings in  [ref]33 3, we construct victim models on three benchmark datasets, namely, MNIST , CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 . The respective DNN architectures are LeNet-5 , ResNet-18  and ResNet-34.\nWe embed black-box watermarks into the victim models during the training. Then we perform watermark removal attacks including Mira and the baseline attacks to evaluate their effectiveness. ∙∙\\bullet Target Watermark Schemes.\nOur evaluation covers ten existing black-box DNN watermarks, which are categorized as fixed-class watermarks (i.e., all the watermark data are paired with the identical target class), and non-fixed-class watermarks (i.e., each watermark data is paired with its own target class) listed in Table 1. For more backgrounds on the watermarking schemes, please refer to Appendix B.1.\nWe implement the target black-box watermark schemes based on the open-source watermark framework provided by Lederer et al. [ref]32, with target class set to 6 for the fixed-class watermarks.\nFor the watermarks not included in the framework (such as EWE and Blind), we strictly follow the parameter settings described in the original papers.\nFor more implementation details and the performance of the watermarked models, please refer to Appendix B.2 and B.3. ∙∙\\bullet Baseline Removal Attacks.\nWe compare our Mira with the following three types of removal attacks, six baseline attacks in total. Pruning-based attacks:\n(1) Pruning   directly sets a proportion of DNN parameters with the smallest absolute values to zero.\n(2) Fine-pruning  prunes neurons that are infrequently activated by normal data, followed by a finetuning process. Finetuning-based attacks:\n(3) Finetuning   specifically finetunes the target model using a large learning rate, together with a carefully-designed scheduler.\n(4) Regularization 3  finetunes the target model with a large L2 regularization on the parameters.\n(5) Distraction  finetunes the target model on in-distribution or transfer data, together with another set of lure data that distracts the model’s attention away from the watermark. Unlearning-based attacks: (6) Laundering  leverages trigger reverse-engineering methods  in backdoor defense literature to recover watermark data, followed by neuron resetting and model retraining, to remove backdoor-based watermarks. The implementation details of these baseline attacks are clarified in Appendix B.4. ∙∙\\bullet Implementation of Mira.\nDuring watermark recovering, we set hyper-parameters M=250,αℓ2=0.01,αt​v=0.03,αb​n=0.1formulae-sequence𝑀250formulae-sequencesubscript𝛼subscriptℓ20.01formulae-sequencesubscript𝛼𝑡𝑣0.03subscript𝛼𝑏𝑛0.1M=250,\\alpha_{\\ell_{2}}=0.01,\\alpha_{tv}=0.03,\\alpha_{bn}=0.1. We use t​a​n​h​(⋅)𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ⋅tanh(\\cdot) to constrain the batch data within a valid range, and optimize the recovering objective with the Adam optimizer of learning rate 0.1.\nFor target label detection, we set σ1=1.0,σ2=0.03formulae-sequencesubscript𝜎11.0subscript𝜎20.03\\sigma_{1}=1.0,\\sigma_{2}=0.03 for MNIST and σ1=0.5,σ2=0.015formulae-sequencesubscript𝜎10.5subscript𝜎20.015\\sigma_{1}=0.5,\\sigma_{2}=0.015 for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively.\nThe detection threshold T𝑇T is conservatively set to 0.40.40.4 for MNIST and CIFAR-10, while 0.30.30.3 for CIFAR-100.\nFor splitting the recovered samples, we set l𝑙l to be the penultimate layer of the target model, and saliency ratio β=0.95𝛽0.95\\beta=0.95, split ratio γ=0.5𝛾0.5\\gamma=0.5 in Alg.1.\nDuring watermark unlearning, we set αK​L=15subscript𝛼𝐾𝐿15\\alpha_{KL}=15 to ensure the unlearning strength for the basic Mira and the uniform loss weights for the improved Mira.\nThe model is finally finetuned for 101010 epochs using the SGD optimizer with the batch size 128128128.\nThe learning rate is set to 0.010.010.01 when auxiliary data is available and 0.0030.0030.003 when data-free. Noteworthily, the settings above are empirically chosen and lead to strong attack effectiveness uniformly over almost all the covered watermarking schemes, which supports the watermark-agnostic nature of our Mira. ∙∙\\bullet Evaluation Metrics.\nWe primarily focus on the utility and the watermark retention of the surrogate models obtained via removal attacks. Specifically, we use clean accuracy, i.e., the classification accuracy on the test set, to measure the utility, and watermark accuracy, i.e., the ratio of watermark samples correctly classified as target labels, to measure the watermark retention. To compare the attack effectiveness over different black-box watermark schemes, we follow Lukas et al.  to determine the decision threshold θ𝜃\\theta for each watermark on 202020 independently trained clean models, and then calculate a metric called the rescaled watermark accuracy.\nThe linear rescaling function is defined as S​(x;θ)=max⁡(0,1−θ′1−θ​x+θ′−θ1−θ)𝑆𝑥𝜃01superscript𝜃′1𝜃𝑥superscript𝜃′𝜃1𝜃S(x;\\theta)=\\max(0,\\frac{1-\\theta^{\\prime}}{1-\\theta}x+\\frac{\\theta^{\\prime}-\\theta}{1-\\theta}), which degrades to S​(x;θ)=max⁡(0,1−0.5​1−x1−θ)𝑆𝑥𝜃010.51𝑥1𝜃S(x;\\theta)=\\max(0,1-0.5\\frac{1-x}{1-\\theta}) when we set θ′=0.5superscript𝜃′0.5\\theta^{\\prime}=0.5.\nRescaled watermark accuracy unifies the watermark accuracy of surrogate models embedded with different watermarks. According to , the model watermark is fully removed if the rescaled watermark accuracy is lower than 50%percent5050\\%.\nTable B.1 in Appendix B.3 summarizes our estimated decision threshold for the ten black-box watermarking schemes. We define a removal attack is successful (i.e., cracks the target watermark scheme) if the rescaled watermark accuracy is below 50% and the surrogate model maintains at least 90% of the original utility.\nNote that our attack success criterion is slightly different from  in that they consider a maximum 5%percent55\\% utility loss.\nThis is mainly because we consider the more realistic data-limited settings (e.g., 2%percent22\\% of the source training set in Section 6.2), while they assume the attacker has access to over 30%percent3030\\% of the training set.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: in Table 1.\nBefore presenting the detailed evaluation results, we first provide a concise introduction to the experimental setups. ∙∙\\bullet Datasets and Victim Models.\nFollowing the settings in  [ref]33 3, we construct victim models on three benchmark datasets, namely, MNIST , CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 . The respective DNN architectures are LeNet-5 , ResNet-18  and ResNet-34.\nWe embed black-box\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
