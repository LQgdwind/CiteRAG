      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Computation Using Spatial-Photonic Ising Machines: Utilizing Low-Rank and Circulant Matrix Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLow-rank matrices can arise during the construction of securities portfolios in financial analytics. Specifically, the optimal portfolio is the solution to a model-dependent quadratic unconstrained mixed optimization (QUMO) problem. Under an equal-weighting constraint, which we will explain below, this transforms into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that SPIMs can solve. Portfolio optimization involves creating an investment portfolio that balances risk and return. The objective is to allocate assets 𝐲isubscript𝐲𝑖{\\bf y}_{i} optimally to maximize expected returns μ𝜇\\mu while minimizing risk φ𝜑\\varphi. In modern portfolio theory, this problem is formulated in the Markowitz mean-variance optimization model    with the objective function: where the scalar λ∈[ref]0 [ref]1𝜆01\\lambda\\in[ref]0 [ref]1 quantifies the level of risk aversion, and wi∈[ref]0 [ref]1subscript𝑤𝑖01w_{i}\\in[ref]0 [ref]1 with ∑iNwi=1superscriptsubscript𝑖𝑁subscript𝑤𝑖1\\sum_{i}^{N}w_{i}=1 are portfolio weights that describe the proportion of total investment in each asset. 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} is the covariance matrix of N𝑁N assets with elements Si​j=Cov​(𝐲i,𝐲j)subscript𝑆𝑖𝑗Covsubscript𝐲𝑖subscript𝐲𝑗S_{ij}={\\rm Cov}({\\bf y}_{i},{\\bf y}_{j}), and misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i} is the expected return of asset 𝐲isubscript𝐲𝑖{\\bf y}_{i}. The covariance matrix 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} and return forecast vector 𝐦𝐦{\\bf m} are derived from historical data, the latter of which can be formulated using the capital asset pricing model . Markowitz mean-variance portfolio optimization naturally maps to the QUMO abstraction . However, with equal weighting, the problem converts to QUBO. Equal-weighted portfolio optimization, where wi∈{0,1/q}subscript𝑤𝑖01𝑞w_{i}\\in\\{0,1/q\\} for q𝑞q selected assets, has been shown to outperform traditional market capitalization-weighted strategies   . In this case, weights wisubscript𝑤𝑖w_{i} can be transformed to Ising spins si←2​q​wi−1←subscript𝑠𝑖2𝑞subscript𝑤𝑖1s_{i}\\leftarrow 2qw_{i}-1. We extend the model to include a cardinality constraint that limits the portfolio to a specified number of assets, maintaining the QUBO abstraction. This is equivalent to constraining q𝑞q to a predetermined value. Diversification can be controlled through cardinality constraints, providing an additional mechanism to manage portfolio volatility. The objective function can be expressed as an explicit Ising Hamiltonian where parameter η𝜂\\eta controls the magnitude of the cardinality constraint and c𝑐c is a constant offset.\nWe can identify the Ising coupling matrix elements as Ji​j=1−λ4​q2​Si​j+1subscript𝐽𝑖𝑗1𝜆4superscript𝑞2subscript𝑆𝑖𝑗1J_{ij}=\\frac{1-\\lambda}{4q^{2}}S_{ij}+1, and external magnetic field field strength as hi=2​η​(N−q)−λ​mi2​q+1−λ2​q2​∑jNSi​jsubscriptℎ𝑖2𝜂𝑁𝑞𝜆subscript𝑚𝑖2𝑞1𝜆2superscript𝑞2superscriptsubscript𝑗𝑁subscript𝑆𝑖𝑗h_{i}=2\\eta(N-q)-\\frac{\\lambda m_{i}}{2q}+\\frac{1-\\lambda}{2q^{2}}\\sum_{j}^{N}{S_{ij}}. By introducing an auxiliary spin to absorb linear fields with the method given in Section IV.2 and discarding constants, the objective function becomes H=−𝐬T​𝐉h​𝐬𝐻superscript𝐬𝑇superscript𝐉ℎ𝐬H=-\\mathbf{s}^{T}\\mathbf{J}^{h}\\mathbf{s}. Realizing portfolio optimization in SPIM architectures requires coupling matrix 𝐉𝐉\\mathbf{J} to be low rank. This is achieved through low-rank factor analysis (FA), a low-rank approximation technique common in quantitative finance . To compute coupling matrix 𝐉𝐉\\mathbf{J}, covariance matrix 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} is first estimated from historical data on the set of asset returns 𝐫𝐫\\mathbf{r}. However, accurately estimating 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} from historical data can be challenging due to noise, high dimensionality, and limited data [ref]52. FA assumes observed data are linearly driven by a small number K𝐾K of common factors, such that 𝐫=𝐜+𝐁𝐟+ε𝐫𝐜𝐁𝐟𝜀\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{c}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{f}+\\varepsilon, where 𝐜∈ℝN𝐜superscriptℝ𝑁\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} is a constant vector, 𝐁∈ℝN×K𝐁superscriptℝ𝑁𝐾\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times K} is the factor loading matrix with K≪Nmuch-less-than𝐾𝑁K\\ll N, 𝐟∈ℝK𝐟superscriptℝ𝐾\\mathbf{f}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K} is a vector of low-dimensional common factors and ε∈ℝN𝜀superscriptℝ𝑁\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} is uncorrelated noise. The unobservable latent variables 𝐟𝐟\\mathbf{f} capture the underlying patterns shared among the observed variables. FA implies the covariance matrix consists of a positive semi-definite low-rank matrix plus a diagonal matrix such that the transformed covariance matrix is 𝐒′=𝐁𝐁T+Ψsuperscript𝐒′superscript𝐁𝐁𝑇Ψ\\mathbf{S}^{{}^{\\prime}}=\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B}^{T}+\\Psi . For low-rank factor analysis, rank⁡(𝐁𝐁T)≤Kranksuperscript𝐁𝐁𝑇𝐾\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B}^{T})\\leq K [ref]52. The diagonal matrix ΨΨ\\Psi becomes a linear field term in the binary formulation, and it follows from Eq. (21) that 𝐒′superscript𝐒′\\mathbf{S}^{{}^{\\prime}} remains low rank. Indeed, in the Ising QUBO abstraction with auxiliary variable, coupling matrix 𝐉hsuperscript𝐉ℎ\\mathbf{J}^{h} has rank⁡𝐉h≤rank⁡𝐉+2≤rank⁡𝐒′+rank⁡(𝟏⊗𝟏T)+2=rank⁡𝐒′+3ranksuperscript𝐉ℎrank𝐉2ranksuperscript𝐒′ranktensor-product1superscript1𝑇2ranksuperscript𝐒′3\\operatorname{rank}\\mathbf{J}^{h}\\leq\\operatorname{rank}\\mathbf{J}+2\\leq\\operatorname{rank}\\mathbf{S}^{{}^{\\prime}}+\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathbf{1}\\otimes\\mathbf{1}^{T})+2=\\operatorname{rank}\\mathbf{S}^{{}^{\\prime}}+3. Therefore, the transformed coupling matrix remains low rank. Figure (2) illustrates the decomposition of the covariance matrix to its low-rank form and shows the proximity of portfolios constructed in the full-rank and low-rank paradigms. The full universe of stocks can be vast, so decomposing covariance matrices into low-rank forms provides computational advantages in subsequent calculations. For example, the New York stock exchange contains over 2300 stocks, whilst in Fig. (2), we consider only the 503 stocks tracked in the S&P 500 index. For a quadratic unconstrained continuous optimization problem, if the coupling matrix is positive semi-definite as the covariance matrix is, then the problem is convex for any linear field term. However, for QUBO problems, even if 𝐒𝐒\\mathbf{S} and hence 𝐉𝐉\\mathbf{J} is positive semi-definitive, the problem is not necessarily easy to solve. The reason is that the binary constraint makes the feasible region discrete, not convex, which is why QUBO problems are generally NP-hard. SPIMs derive a temporal advantage over classical computing due to optical hardware implementing fast and energy-efficient computation. This is particularly crucial in high-frequency trading, where optimal portfolios must be calculated over microseconds to minimize latency in placing orders  .\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: μ𝜇\\mu while minimizing risk φ𝜑\\varphi.
