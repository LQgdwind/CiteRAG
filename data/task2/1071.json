      "content": "Paper Title: Basket Recommendation with Multi-Intent Translation Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe problem of Basket Recommendation (BR)     [ref]4 is to recommend a ranking list of items that users are likely to buy together. It is necessary to model the user-item interactive signal and item-item correlation signal simultaneously . The user-item collaborative filtering (CF) signal assumes that users with similar interaction patterns share semantically similar items, which is important in representing the user and item semantics [ref]5 . The item-item correlation signal is extracted from items within the same basket  , which is crucial for capturing the basket level item relations. For example, cereal and yogurt are usually in the same basket\nas illustrated in Figure 1, as they are complementary with each other . We can model such item relations to recommend a set of items within the same basket. Existing methods model item relations in BR by assuming that the items within the same basket are semantically related with each other    [ref]4 [ref]7. Specifically, Triple2Vec  minimizes the distance of the embeddings of items within the same basket. DREAM  averages the embedding of items within the same basket so as to model the correlations. Xu, et. al. [ref]7 propose to model the items within the same basket as contexts of each other. BasConv [ref]4 and BGCN  learn basket embeddings by aggregating both user embeddings and item embeddings. These works improve the performance of BR as they can model the basket-level semantics. However, in the real-world, the item relations within baskets are rather complex. According to previous works  0 1 2, users’ shopping behavior is usually of multiple interests. Regarding the BR problem, we observe that there are often multiple intents, as illustrated in Figure 1. Hence, we should design a new model to handle the multi-intent pattern in the BR problem. The advantages of modeling a multi-intent pattern are in three folds. Firstly, the multi-intent pattern helps to find complex semantic relations of items. For example, in Figure 1, one basket b1subscript𝑏1b_{1} contains items {bread, cereal, yogurt, soap, detergent}, where the {bread, cereal, yogurt} are correlated through the “breakfast” intent, while {soap, detergent} are of “cleaning” intent. Simply assuming items within the same basket are of one semantic relation to each other  3  [ref]4 spoils the ability of the model to comprehend the basket-level semantics. Besides, the relation between intents can also be discovered to benefit BR. For example, in Figure 1, basket b2subscript𝑏2b_{2} has intents “breakfast” and ”fruit”, which are complementary intents , indicating items in one intent should be complements to items in the other. Whereas in b1subscript𝑏1b_{1}, the items in “breakfast” have no relation to the items in “cleaning”, though they are in the same basket. As a result, multi-intent relations comprehensively express semantics in baskets. Additionally, the item correlations can be captured more precisely across different baskets through multiple intents. For example, in Figure 1, a basket b2subscript𝑏2b_{2} consists of {milk, waffle, banana, apple, strawberry}, where {milk, waffle} is of “breakfast” intent, while {banana, apple, strawberry} is of “fruit” intent. Though different from b1subscript𝑏1b_{1} in both item-level and basket-level semantics, it still shares a common intent “breakfast” with basket b1subscript𝑏1b_{1}, and thus we can find the correlation of those items. In order to discover the multi-intent pattern from a basket, in this paper, we propose a new framework, Multi-Intent Translation Graph Neural Network (MITGNN). Inspired by translation-based models 4 5 6 in knowledge graph embedding that translate head entity embeddings into tail entity embeddings to model entity relations, MITGNN learns T𝑇T different translations 4 from a basket (i.e., head entity) to construct those intents (i.e. tail entities), as illustrated in Figure 3. The translation-based model 4 5 6 is well-known as it can model the relations between entities. The Translation-based model is built upon triples (h,r,q)ℎ𝑟𝑞(h,r,q), where r𝑟r is the relation between head entity hℎh and tail entity q𝑞q. The embedding of q𝑞q, viewed as the translation of hℎh, is learned by adding the embedding of hℎh with the embedding of r𝑟r, i.e., 𝐪=𝐡+𝐫𝐪𝐡𝐫\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{h}+\\mathbf{r}. Since we model those intents as T𝑇T tail entities from the same basket entity, we therefore have ‖𝐪i−𝐪j‖=‖𝐫i−𝐫j‖normsubscript𝐪𝑖subscript𝐪𝑗normsubscript𝐫𝑖subscript𝐫𝑗\\|\\mathbf{q}_{i}-\\mathbf{q}_{j}\\|=\\|\\mathbf{r}_{i}-\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\|. Hence, the usage of translations in MITGNN can also model the relations among multiple intents. For example, in Figure 3, the distance between different intents indicates the correlation of those intents. Therefore, MITGNN combines the translation-based model with the GNN model. We construct MITGNN upon our defined basket graph, which consists of user, item, and basket entities. Different from existing methods that learn T𝑇T relation vectors as free parameters 4 5 6 7, We integrate item and user information into the intent learning process. Inspired by the design intuition of GNN 8 9, the relation vector between basket and intents is learned by T𝑇T-head aggregators. Each head is associated with an intent, aggregating the user and item information of a basket to learn the relation vector. In addition to those intent embeddings, MITGNN learns user embeddings and item embeddings by aggregating from their neighbor embeddings. Since different baskets are connected through user entities and item entities, stacking multiple layers helps to propagate information across different baskets. The contributions of this paper are: New framework: We propose a new framework combining the translation-based model with GNN. It can not only propagate information across our defined basket graph, but also model the relations of the learned intents. Multi-intent pattern: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the multi-intent pattern in the BR problem. The intents are tail entities translated from basket entities. We use multi-head aggregators to generate the translation vectors. Extensive Experiments: For the evaluation of our model, we conduct BR experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model under both transductive and inductive BR settings.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: The problem of Basket Recommendation (BR)     [ref]4 is to recommend a ranking list of items that users are likely to buy together.
