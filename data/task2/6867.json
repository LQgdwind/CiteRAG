      "content": "Paper Title: Handling the inconsistency of systems of min→ fuzzy relational equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSanchez’s pioneering work on solving systems of fuzzy relational equations based on max−min\\max-\\min composition   was followed by studies on solving systems based on max−T𝑇\\max-T composition    where T𝑇T is a t-norm, and studies on systems based on min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow composition   , where →→\\rightarrow is the residual implicator associated to a t-norm. The authors of these studies\ngave necessary and sufficient conditions for systems of fuzzy relational equations to be consistent.\nHowever, it remains difficult to address the inconsistency of these systems. Recently, to address this issue, the author of  gives an explicit analytical formula to compute, using the L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} norm, the Chebyshev distance Δ=infc∈𝒞‖b−c‖Δsubscriptinfimum𝑐𝒞norm𝑏𝑐\\Delta=\\inf_{c\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\|b-c\\| associated to an inconsistent system of max−min\\max-\\min fuzzy relational equations A​□minmax​x=b𝐴superscriptsubscript□𝑥𝑏A\\Box_{\\min}^{\\max}x=b, where 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is the set of second members of consistent systems defined with the same matrix A𝐴A. From this Chebyshev distance and in the case that the system A​□minmax​x=b𝐴superscriptsubscript□𝑥𝑏A\\Box_{\\min}^{\\max}x=b is inconsistent, the author of  describes the structure of the set of Chebyshev approximations of the second member b𝑏b, which is formed by the vectors c𝑐c such that ‖b−c‖=Δnorm𝑏𝑐Δ\\|b-c\\|=\\Delta and the system A​□minmax​x=c𝐴superscriptsubscript□𝑥𝑐A\\Box_{\\min}^{\\max}x=c is a consistent system  . He also establishes a structure theorem for the approximate solutions set of the inconsistent system, which is the set of solutions of consistent systems A​□minmax​x=c𝐴superscriptsubscript□𝑥𝑐A\\Box_{\\min}^{\\max}x=c, where c𝑐c is a Chebyshev approximation of b𝑏b. From these results, the author introduces a learning paradigm of approximate weight matrices based on max−min\\max-\\min composition according to training data. \nIn [ref]1, the author extends some of these results for a system of max-product fuzzy relational equations and for a system of max-Łukasiewicz fuzzy relational equations. He gives analytical formulas for computing the Chebyshev distance ΔΔ\\Delta associated to inconsistent systems based on max-product or max-Łukasiewicz compositions. For these two systems, the greatest approximate solution and the greatest Chebyshev approximation are directly computed according to the components of the matrix and those of the second member of the system, so the learning paradigm introduced in  can be used for the max-product and max-Łukasiewicz systems. In this article, analogously to [ref]1 , for systems of min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow fuzzy relational equations of the form Γ​□→min​x=βΓsuperscriptsubscript□→𝑥𝛽\\Gamma\\Box_{\\rightarrow}^{\\min}x=\\beta where ΓΓ\\Gamma is a fuzzy matrix of size (m,n)𝑚𝑛(m,n), β𝛽\\beta is a column-vector of m𝑚m components and →→\\rightarrow is a residual implicator among the Gödel implication →Gsubscript→𝐺\\rightarrow_{G}, the Goguen implication →G​Gsubscript→𝐺𝐺\\rightarrow_{GG} or Łukasiewicz’s\nimplication →Lsubscript→𝐿\\rightarrow_{L}, we give explicit analytical formulas for computing the Chebyshev distance ∇=infd∈𝒟‖β−d‖∇subscriptinfimum𝑑𝒟norm𝛽𝑑\\nabla=\\inf_{d\\in\\mathcal{D}}\\|\\beta-d\\| where 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is the set of second members of consistent systems defined with the same matrix ΓΓ\\Gamma. Analogously to the application F𝐹F introduced in [ref]1  for systems based on max−T𝑇\\max-T composition, we introduce an idempotent, increasing and right-continuous application denoted G𝐺G for min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow systems, see (24). The application G𝐺G allows us to reformulate the necessary and sufficient conditions    for checking if a min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow system defined with a fixed matrix and a given vector used as the second member is a consistent system, see (25). As a first result (Theorem 1), this application G𝐺G allows us to show that the Chebyshev distance ∇∇\\nabla of a min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow system Γ​□→min​x=βΓsuperscriptsubscript□→𝑥𝛽\\Gamma\\Box_{\\rightarrow}^{\\min}x=\\beta is the lower bound of the solutions of a vector inequality expressed with this application G𝐺G. Our (Theorem 1) for min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow systems, is the version of (Theorem 1) of Cuninghame-Green and Cechlárová for a max−min\\max-\\min system , which was recently extended in [ref]1 for max−T𝑇\\max-T systems. Furthermore, from this result, we obtain the decomposition of the Chebyshev distance ∇=max1≤j≤m​∇j∇subscript1𝑗𝑚subscript∇𝑗\\nabla=\\max_{1\\leq j\\leq m}\\nabla_{j} (Proposition 5), where for all j∈{1,2,…,m}𝑗12…𝑚j\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,m\\}, each ∇jsubscript∇𝑗\\nabla_{j} is the lower bound of the solutions of the j𝑗j-th scalar inequality in the above-mentioned vector inequality, see (36). \nFor each of the three systems of min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow fuzzy relational equations (depending on whether →→\\rightarrow is the Gödel implication →Gsubscript→𝐺\\rightarrow_{G}, the Goguen implication →G​Gsubscript→𝐺𝐺\\rightarrow_{GG} or Łukasiewicz’s\nimplication →Lsubscript→𝐿\\rightarrow_{L}), we give an explicit formula for computing\nits associated Chebyshev distance ∇∇\\nabla ((Theorem 2), (Theorem 3) and (Theorem 5), respectively). We also prove the following important results: for min−→Gsubscript→𝐺limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow_{G} system, the Chebyshev distance ∇∇\\nabla may be an infimum (based on (Proposition 8) and showed in (Example 5)) while, for min−→G​Gsubscript→𝐺𝐺limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow_{GG} and min−→Lsubscript→𝐿limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow_{L} systems, the Chebyshev distance ∇∇\\nabla is always a minimum i.e. an attainable lower bound (see (Corollary 5) and (Corollary 8)). For min−→Gsubscript→𝐺limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow_{G} systems, we give a sufficient condition for ∇∇\\nabla to be a minimum (see (Corollary 2) and (Corollary 3)).\nFor min−→G​Gsubscript→𝐺𝐺limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow_{GG} systems, min−→Lsubscript→𝐿limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow_{L} systems, or min−→Gsubscript→𝐺limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow_{G} systems whose Chebyshev distance has been verified as a minimum, we can always compute the lowest Chebyshev approximation of the second member and an approximate solution (see (Corollary 4), (Corollary 7) and (Corollary 3)). However, for the min−→Gsubscript→𝐺limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow_{G} systems whose Chebyshev distance has been verified as not being a minimum, the set of Chebyshev approximations of its second member is empty (Lemma 7). The article is structured as follows. In (Section 2), we remind the recent results of [ref]1  on solving systems of max−T𝑇\\max-T fuzzy relational equations, where T𝑇T is a continuous t-norm. In (Section 3), we introduce our main tools for studying the inconsistent systems of min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow fuzzy relational equations: the application G𝐺G and its main properties, and an important decomposition of the Chebyshev distance ∇∇\\nabla associated to a system of min−→→limit-fromabsent\\min-\\rightarrow fuzzy relational equations.\nThen, in the next three sections, we give the explicit analytical formulas for computing the Chebyshev distances ∇=infd∈𝒟‖β−d‖∇subscriptinfimum𝑑𝒟norm𝛽𝑑\\nabla=\\inf_{d\\in\\mathcal{D}}\\|\\beta-d\\| in the case where the residual implicator is the Gödel implication (Section 4), the Goguen implication (Section 5) and Łukasiewicz’s\nimplication (Section 6). Finally, we conclude with some perspectives and we propose some applications of our work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: a Chebyshev approximation of b𝑏b.
