      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Aggregation Networks for Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nWe conduct CIL experiments on two datasets, CIFAR-100  and ImageNet [ref]37, following closely related work  [ref]25 [ref]11. CIFAR-100 contains 60,0006000060,000 samples of 32×32323232\\times 32 color images for 100100100 classes. There are 500500500 training and 100100100 test samples for each class. ImageNet contains around 1.31.31.3 million samples of 224×224224224224\\times 224 color images for 100010001000 classes. There are approximately 1,30013001,300 training and 505050 test samples for each class.\nImageNet is used in two CIL settings: one based on a subset of 100100100 classes (ImageNet-Subset) and the other based on the full set of 1,00010001,000 classes.\nThe 100100100-class data for ImageNet-Subset\nare sampled from ImageNet in the same way as  [ref]11. Architectures.\nFollowing the exact settings in  [ref]25, we deploy a 323232-layer ResNet as the baseline architecture (based on which we build the AANets) for CIFAR-100.\nThis ResNet consists of 111 initial convolution layer and 333 residual blocks (in a single branch). Each block has 101010 convolution layers with 3×3333\\times 3 kernels. The number of filters starts from 161616 and is doubled every next block. After these 333 blocks, there is an average-pooling layer to compress the output feature maps to a feature embedding. To build AANets, we convert these 333 blocks into three levels of blocks and each level consists of a stable block and a plastic block, referring to Section 3.1.\nSimilarly, we build AANets for ImageNet benchmarks but taking an 181818-layer ResNet  as the baseline architecture  [ref]25.\nPlease note that there is no architecture change applied to the classifiers, i.e., using the same FC layers as in  [ref]25. Hyperparameters and Configuration.\nThe learning rates γ1subscript𝛾1\\gamma_{1} and γ2subscript𝛾2\\gamma_{2} are initialized as 0.10.10.1 and 1×10−81superscript1081\\times 10^{-8}, respectively.\nWe impose a constraint on each pair of αηsubscript𝛼𝜂\\alpha_{\\eta} and αϕsubscript𝛼italic-ϕ\\alpha_{\\phi} to make sure αη+αϕ=1subscript𝛼𝜂subscript𝛼italic-ϕ1\\alpha_{\\eta}+\\alpha_{\\phi}=1.\nFor fair comparison, our training hyperparamters are almost the same as in [ref]11 [ref]25.\nSpecifically, on the CIFAR-100 (ImageNet), we train the model for 160160160 (909090) epochs in each phase, and the learning rates are divided by 101010 after 808080 (303030) and then after 120120120 (606060) epochs.\nWe use an SGD optimizer with the momentum 0.90.90.9 and the batch size 128128128 to train the models in all settings. Memory Budget.\nBy default, we follow the same data replay settings used in   [ref]25 [ref]11, where each time reserves 202020 exemplars per old class.\nIn our “strict memory budget” settings, we strictly control the memory budget shared by the exemplars and the model parameters.\nFor example, if we incorporate AANets to LUCIR , we need to reduce the number of exemplars to balance the additional memory used by model parameters (as AANets take around 20%percent2020\\% more parameters than plain ResNets).\nAs a result, we reduce the numbers of exemplars for AANets from 202020 to 131313, 161616 and 191919, respectively, for CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet, in the “strict memory budget” setting.\nFor example, on CIFAR-100, we use 530​k530𝑘530k additional parameters, so we need to reduce 530​k​floats×4​b​y​t​e​s/float÷(32×32×3​b​y​t​e​s/image)÷100​c​l​a​s​s​e​s≈7​i​m​a​g​e​s/class530𝑘floats4bytesfloat32323bytesimage100classes7imagesclass530k\\mathrm{floats}\\times 4\\mathrm{bytes/float}\\div(32\\times 32\\times 3\\mathrm{bytes}/\\mathrm{image})\\div 100\\mathrm{classes}\\approx 7\\mathrm{images}/\\mathrm{class}. Benchmark Protocol.\nWe follow the common protocol used in  [ref]25 [ref]11.\nGiven a dataset, the model is trained on half of the classes in the 00-th phase.\nThen,\nit learns\nthe remaining classes evenly in the subsequent N𝑁N phases.\nFor N𝑁N, there are three options as 555, 101010, and 252525, and the corresponding settings are called “N𝑁N-phase”.\nIn each phase, the model is evaluated on the test data for all seen classes. The average accuracy (over all phases) is reported.\nFor each setting, we run the experiment three times and report averages and 95%percent9595\\% confidence intervals.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Datasets.\nWe conduct CIL experiments on two datasets, CIFAR-100  and ImageNet [ref]37, following closely related work  [ref]25 [ref]11. CIFAR-100 contains 60,0006000060,000 samples of 32×32323232\\times 32 color images for 100100100 classes. There are 500500500 training and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
