      "content": "Paper Title: FactoFormer: Factorized Hyperspectral Transformers with Self-Supervised Pretraining\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConventional Classifiers: We used KNN, SVM, and RF as conventional classification methods. The number of nearest neighbors (K) is set to 10 for KNN. SVM was implemented using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The main two hyperparameters of RBF kernel œÉùúé\\sigma and ŒªùúÜ\\lambda are optimized using fivefold cross-validation on the training set with the range of œÉ=[2‚àí3,2‚àí2,‚Ä¶,24]ùúésuperscript23superscript22‚Ä¶superscript24\\sigma=\\left[2^{-3},2^{-2},...,2^{4}\\right] and Œª=[10‚àí2,10‚àí1,‚Ä¶,104]ùúÜsuperscript102superscript101‚Ä¶superscript104\\lambda=\\left[10^{-2},10^{-1},...,10^{4}\\right] respectively. In the Random Forest method (RF), 200 decision trees are used for experiments. Classic Backbone Networks: We compare our method with 1-D-CNN, 2-D CNN, RNN, and miniGCN methods. For the 1D-CNN model, 1-D convolutional filters with output sizes of 128 are combined with a batch normalization layer and ReLU activation function. Finally, a Softmax function is applied to the last layer of the model for classification. The 2-D CNN comprises three blocks, each consisting of a 2-D convolutional layer, a batch normalization layer, and a max-pooling layer with ReLU activation. In each block, convolutional kernels with filter sizes of 3√ó3√ó32,3√ó3√ó64333233643\\times 3\\times 32,3\\times 3\\times 64, and 1√ó1√ó128111281\\times 1\\times 128 are utilized. RNN is implemented using two recurrent layers with gated recurrent units of 128 neurons in each layer. In miniGCN, the network block consists of a batch normalization layer, a graph convolutional layer with 128 neurons, and a ReLU layer. Transformer Based Networks: For transformer-based networks, we used the ViT architecture [ref]27, SpectralFormer [ref]13, and MAEST . The ViT uses five layers, four attention heads, an embedding size of 64, and an MLP with a hidden dimension of 8. SpectralFormer[ref]13 uses the same settings as the ViT with cross-layer adaptive fusion (CAF). CAF employs a skip connection mechanism to integrate the features of skipping encoder blocks. MAEST is a self-supervised approach that utilizes Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to train an encoder-decoder network that reconstructs masked patches. Then a classification encoder with similar network architecture as SpectralFormer[ref]13 is initialized with the pretrained encoder weights and fine-tuned to perform classification.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: consists of a batch normalization layer, a graph convolutional layer with 128 neurons, and a ReLU layer.
