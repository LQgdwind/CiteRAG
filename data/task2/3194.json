      "content": "Paper Title: A Style and Semantic Memory Mechanism for Domain GeneralizationThis work was performed at JD AI Research.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We perform DG tasks via extensive evaluations on the following benchmarks: (1) Digits-DG [ref]53 includes 444 domains (MNIST , MNIST-M 4, SVHN  and SYN 4) with an evident domain shift in font style, stroke color and background. (2) PACS  is a widely used domain generalization benchmark, which is composed of four domains (Art Painting, Cartoon, Photo and Sketch). Each domain includes samples from 777 different categories, including a total of 9,99199919,991 samples. (3) Office-Home  contains around 15,5001550015,500 images of 656565 classes, distributed across 444 domains (Artistic, Clipart, Product and Real world). (4) DomainNet  is a recently established large-scale dataset for multi-source domain adaptation and domain generalization, which includes about 0.60.60.6 million images in 345345345 classes distributed across 666 domains (i.e., Clipart, Infograph, Quickdraw, Painting, Real, Sketch). For a fair comparison with prior works, we follow the standard leave-one-domain-out evaluation procedure as in   , where one domain is chosen as the unseen target and the remaining domains are used as source domains for training. For Digits-DG, PACS and Office-Home, the authors of [ref]53   have specified particular train and val splits for each domain to ensure a fair comparison. They use the entire train ++ val target data as the test data. We use the same data split definition for our experiments. For DomainNet, according to [ref]9, we employ their dataset division and report the accuracy on the test split of target domain. Implementation details. Following the backbone setting of [ref]53, we use 444 conv layers and a softmax layer for Digits-DG dataset. ReLU and 2√ó2222\\times 2 max-pooling are inserted after each convolution layer. The model is trained with SGD, initial learning rate of 0.050.050.05 and batch size of 128128128 for 505050 epochs. For both PACS and Office-Home, we use ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet as the CNN backbone, as in [ref]53 . We train the model with SGD, initial learning rate of 0.0020.0020.002 and batch size of 303030 for 606060 epochs. The learning rate is further decayed by the cosine annealing rule. For DomainNet, we experiment with ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 backbone architectures, as in [ref]9. For all experiments, the semantic encoder, style encoder and classifier are all implemented using a fully connected (FC) layer. The size of style and semantic memory bank is set as 2,04820482,048. Baselines. To evaluate our method, we consider comparisons with the following approaches: (1) Vanilla simply trains the plain classification model on all available source domains using all annotations, the model is then directly used to classify target samples. (2) CrossGrad  perturbs input using adversarial gradients from a domain classifier. (3) CCSA  explores a contrastive semantic alignment loss for domain-invariant representation learning. (4) MMD-AAE  imposes an MMD loss on the hidden layers of an autoencoder. (5) JiGen  utilizes an auxiliary self-supervision loss so that the features can be used to solve the Jigsaw puzzle task. (6) Epi-FCR  designs an episodic training strategy. (7) EISNet  develops a momentum metric learning scheme with the KùêæK-hard negative mining to improve the network generalization ability. (8) L2A-OT [ref]53 synthesizes extra data from pseudo-novel domains to augment the source domains. (9) DecAug  generates extra data augmentations through perturbing the disentangled style feature and semantic features. (10) DMG [ref]9 learns domain specific masks for generalization on different domains. (11) MixStyle  mixes instance level feature statistics of training samples across various sources to introduce more domain diversity via synthesizing. Results on Digits-DG. Table 1 shows that, our method exhibits clear advantages over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Please note that our model is especially effective and commanding on challenging DG directions, e.g., MNIST-M and SVHN, as they seem to have large domain variations compared with other directions. This is a valid justification that the instance level style invariance along with the proposed ‚Äújury‚Äù mechanism together is a legitimate idea to deal with domain generalization problems. Compared with the methods that hinge on marginal distribution alignment across domains, e.g., MMD-AAE and CCSA, our model even demonstrates around 8.5%percent8.58.5\\% performance boost on average. This well validates our assumption in Section 3.2, that intra-domain style invariance seems to be a more practical and suitable hypothesis in presence of computing background statistics hidden in domain styles. In other words, the prior knowledge on intra-domain style invariance effectively reduce the uncertainty when searching for optimal network parameters so that the parameters reduces overfitting to domain styles. Results on PACS.\nThis part of results is shown in Table 1. Our method achieves the best performance on all test domains. Note the recently proposed EISNet also involves the usage of a feature memory. However, the memory in EISNet is only used for the sake of hard triplets selection without consideration on feature invariance. In DecAug , similar semantic-style orthogonal regularization loss was used. However, orthogonality is perhaps the most widely used tool everywhere, and we simply employ orthogonality as an auxiliary regularizer. Nevertheless, our motivation and hypothesis are completely different from DecAug, highlighting the outstanding performance given our instance-level style invariance and ‚Äújury‚Äù mechanism. Results on Office-Home.\nThe results are shown in Table 1. Our STEAM achieves the best average performance. Notably, the simple vanilla model shows strong results on this benchmark. Most of baselines provide only marginal improvements than vanilla model that are under 1.0%percent1.01.0\\%. As discussed in L2A-OT, this might be owing to the fact that Office-Home is relatively a large composition of data, compared with PACS and Digits-DG, thus offering inherently bigger domain diversity in training data already. In contrast, our method shows the best performance on average with an impressive 2.1%percent2.12.1\\% improvement over the Vanilla. Results on DomainNet.\nDomainNet is considered as perhaps the most challenging benchmark, owing to its dataset size, both in terms of image number and category numbers. Table 2 shows that, on DomainNet dataset, the Vanilla baseline achieves competitive results in comparison to domain generalization methods MetaReg and DMG, while our method again surpasses all competitors. We observe that our model is leading in the table with improved average performance, especially when ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 are used as the backbone architectures, showing respectively 2.1%percent2.12.1\\% and 2.5%percent2.52.5\\% accuracy improvement. At this point, it is worthy to mention that our method has achieved better robustness, for consistently offering better performance than other baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: Datasets.
