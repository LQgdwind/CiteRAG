      "content": "Paper Title: Discovering Airline-Specific Business Intelligence from Online Passenger Reviews: An Unsupervised Text Analytics Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe competition in the airline industry has become fierce due to deregulation, and the proliferation of low-cost carriers (LCC). To sustain in this challenging environment and gain a competitive advantage, airline companies are striving for passenger satisfaction and loyalty. They offer competitive fares and provide differentiated services, such as priority check-in and on-board internet, to attract and retain customers. Nevertheless, the airline industry is frequently ranked low in customer satisfaction . Further, the U.S. Congress’ consistent efforts and the consequent establishment of the ”Airline Customer Service Commitment” too failed to ameliorate passenger dissatisfaction . Improving in critical areas of service quality is essential for customer contentment as well as for enhancing business performance and customer loyalty . Specifically, identifying service quality attributes that are most-valued by passengers and meeting/surpassing their expectation for those attributes is crucial for achieving high customer satisfaction . Traditionally, survey studies were used to understand customer expectations and satisfaction in the airline industry. However, Lucini et al.  criticized such survey methods as the aspects focused tend to be based on the knowledge of management or researchers and may not mirror the customer’s actual needs, resulting in an inconsistent measurement of perceived service quality. Another drawback to these techniques is that they limit the response a customer can provide, and the expected structured response also distorts the customer’s intrinsic voice . Finally, many of these survey forms are completed perfunctorily, and some customers even respond randomly, leading to a fictitious understanding of customer perception, which is more harmful to any business . With increasing accessibility to Web 2.0 technologies and expansion of social media websites, more customers express their opinions/experiences about a product or service on online forums without much restrictions . Even though online customer reviews (OCR) are subjective and represent a subset of actual customers, they are considered highly trustworthy for understanding a customer’s perspective . Besides, OCR also influences the decisions made by potential customers . A negative OCR can undermine the company’s reputation and also spreads five to six times quicker than positive reviews . Thus, businesses are faced with the need to understand and analyze these unstructured review data. Further, these reviews have become widely available and easily accessible, allowing businesses to effortlessly understand their strengths and weaknesses from a customer’s perspective . Hence it is presumed that the airline industry can also use OCR to improve its passenger experience. Typically, a customer review discusses several aspects of a product/service and has a sentiment associated with each aspect. For instance, consider the passenger’s review given in Figure 1. The first two sentences express a negative sentiment towards on-time performance and seat comfort, respectively. Whereas, the third sentence portrays the flight crew in a positive manner. Thus, each sentence in this review can be classified into a topic and its corresponding sentiment. A topic-wise summary of the customer opinion (i.e., proportion of positive, negative and neutral reviews for each topic) can be obtained by aspect and sentiment labeling of representative review sentences. Since OCR is a vast collection of unstructured text, processing them to gain insights is a challenge. However, with advances in natural language processing (NLP), many approaches have been introduced to effectively mine unstructured text [ref]8 . Hence, businesses can process millions of these unstructured textual data and gain insights from them without having to read or intervene manually. Prior research has also considered text analytics of airline reviews to identify the key dimensions impacting customer satisfaction   . While these works extract the topics discussed in OCR for a group of airlines, they do not provide a topic-wise sentiment summary of each airline, which is necessary to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of an airline and its competitors. Besides, these studies do not examine the prominent underlying cause of a positive or negative reviews. This paper aims to (i) identify the key aspects/topics affecting passenger satisfaction based on thousands of OCR, (ii) automatically classify each review sentence to its most prominent topic and sentiment (iii) provide a snapshot of topic-wise opinion summary of an airline (iv) extract business and competitive intelligence from OCR. We integrate three different techniques, namely, topic modeling, sentiment analysis and root cause identification, to achieve the aforementioned goals. First, an unsupervised ensemble technique based on topic modeling is proposed for aspect identification and labeling of review sentences. Likewise, an ensemble opinion analyzer is proposed to automatically detect the sentiment of each review sentence. Subsequently, these results are combined to obtain the sentiment summary for each topic. Besides, a data-driven root cause analysis is performed to identify the main reasons for customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction towards each aspect. Finally, the insights obtained are leveraged to provide managerial implications. Since the proposed approach provides comprehensive insights by automatically analyzing passenger reviews, it is efficient in terms of cost and time. Moreover, it serves as a decision support system to monitor the changes in customer preferences and enable the airline management establish their priorities, which in turn can improve passenger satisfaction, airline reputation, customer loyalty, and competitive advantage. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. A review of other relevant studies in the literature is presented in Section 2. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed approach. The case study descriptions, along with the results, are discussed in Section 4. Lastly, conclusions and the scope for future research are given in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: text, processing them to gain insights is a challenge.
