      "content": "Paper Title: DiffGuard: Semantic Mismatch-Guided Out-of-Distribution Detection using Pre-trained Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section begins by surveying existing OOD detection methods. Especially, we demonstrate diffusion models for OOD detection, and talk about the differences between our method and other reconstruction-based ones. OOD Detection Methods.\nIn general, OOD detection methods can be categorized as classification-based or generation-based. Classification-based methods utilize the output from the classifier-under-protection to differentiate between OODs and InDs.\nFor methods that do not modify the classifier, ODIN , ViM , MLS , and KNN  are typical ones. They extract and utilize information in the feature space (e.g., KNN), the logits space (e.g., MLS, ODIN), or both (e.g., ViM). Other methods modify the classifier by proposing new losses  or data augmentation techniques  [ref]30, or using self-supervised training  . Generation-based methods typically have a wider range of applications than classification-based ones because they have no restriction on classifiers. Most generation-based methods focus on either reconstruction quality based on inputs [ref]3  or likelihood/data-density estimated from the generative model  . Their basic assumption is that generative models trained with InD data may fail to make high-quality reconstructions [ref]3 or project OODs to low-density areas of the latent space . However, this assumption may not hold true  . In contrast, conditional synthesis does not rely on such an assumption. it differentiates OODs by constructing semantic mismatch (e.g., [ref]52 uses cGAN). Since semantic mismatch is the most significant property of OODs, this kind outperforms reconstruction-based ones. Our method leverages conditional image synthesis, which shares the same benefits as [ref]52. However, our method outperforms cGAN in terms of model training. DiffGuard is compatible with any normally trained diffusion models, which eliminates the need for additional training process. Diffusion Models.\nFollowing a forward transformation from the image distribution to the Gaussian noise distribution, diffusion models 5 are generative models trained to learn the reverse denoising process.\nThe process can be either a Markov 5 or a non-Markov process .\nThe recently proposed Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)  is a special kind. LDM conducts the diffusion process in a latent space to make the model more efficient. Diffusion Models for OOD Detection.\nPreviously, researchers primarily utilize the reconstruction ability of diffusion models for detecting OOD and novelty instances. They achieve this by measuring the discrepancy between the input image and its reconstructed counterpart. For example, [ref]30 trains a binary classifier with training data generated from the diffusion models to differentiate OODs.  conducts noise augmentations to input images and then compares the differences between the denoised images and the inputs for OOD detection. Similarly,  also uses diffusion models in a reconstruction-based manner, establishing a range of noise levels for the addition and removal of noise. Although reconstruction is one of the functions of diffusion models, a more significant advantage of diffusion models is their flexibility to handle different conditions.\nOur paper employs diffusion models in detecting OODs with semantic mismatch. By utilizing both input images and semantic labels as conditions for generation, diffusion models highlight the semantic mismatch on OODs, thus facilitating the differentiation of OODs from InDs.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: information in the feature space (e.g., KNN), the logits space (e.g., MLS, ODIN), or both (e.g., ViM). Other methods modify the classifier by proposing new losses  or data augmentation techniques  [ref]30, or using self-supervised training  . Generation-based methods typically have a wider range of applications than classification-based ones because they have no restriction on classifiers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
