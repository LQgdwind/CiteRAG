      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Complexity of Binary CSP: Vertex Cover, Treedepth, and Related Parameters\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper we explored the parameterized complexity of BinCSP for a variety of relatively strong structural parameters, including the vertex cover number, treedepth, and several modulator-based parameters. We believe that together with the previous works on XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP} and XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP} [ref]8 0   , our work uncovers a rich complexity structure within the class XPXP\\mathrm{XP}, which is worth further exploration. We selected concrete open questions below. In  , several problems such as Independent Set or Dominating Set, which are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by treewidth, were shown to be XALPXALP\\mathrm{XALP}- and XNLPXNLP\\mathrm{XNLP}-complete when parameterized by the logarithmic treewidth and pathwidth, which is at most k𝑘k when the corresponding width measure is at most k​log⁡n𝑘𝑛k\\log n. Can one prove similar results for the class XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} and parameterization by logarithmic treedepth? Theorem 1.3 provides natural complete problems only for the odd levels of the WW\\mathrm{W}-hierarchy. Similarly, we defined the SS\\mathrm{S}-hierarchy only for odd levels. It would be interesting to have a natural description of the situation also for the even levels. The characterizations of XSLPXSLP\\mathrm{XSLP} given by Theorems 6.1 and 6.9 can be “projected” to a rough characterizations of classes S​[d]Sdelimited-[]𝑑\\mathrm{S}[d] for odd d𝑑d by stipulating that the alternation is at most d𝑑d. Unfortunately, this projection turns out not to be completely faithful: the obtained problems do not precisely characterize the class S​[d]Sdelimited-[]𝑑\\mathrm{S}[d], but lie somewhere between S​[d−𝒪​(1)]Sdelimited-[]𝑑𝒪1\\mathrm{S}[d-{\\mathcal{O}}(1)] and S​[d+𝒪​(1)]Sdelimited-[]𝑑𝒪1\\mathrm{S}[d+{\\mathcal{O}}(1)]. Can we provide a compelling description of the levels of the SS\\mathrm{S}-hierarchy in terms of machine problems or in terms of model-checking first-order logic? What is the complexity of List Coloring parameterized by the vertex cover number? Currently, we know it is W​Wdelimited-[]1\\mathrm{W}-hard and in W​Wdelimited-[]2\\mathrm{W}. Similarly, what is the complexity of List Coloring and Precoloring Extension with the minimum size of a modulator to a treedepth-d𝑑d graph as the parameter? Can one obtain a better understanding of the complexity of BinCSP and List Coloring parameterized by the feedback vertex number?\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: parameters, including the vertex cover number, treedepth, and several modulator-based parameters.
