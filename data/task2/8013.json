      "content": "Paper Title: RoSE-Opt: Robust and Efficient Analog Circuit Parameter Optimization with Knowledge-infused Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIntegrated circuit (IC) technology advances human society by powering numerous applications and infrastructures with microelectronic chips of a small footprint.\nRecent advances in deep learning have shown great promise in transforming modern IC design workflows   [ref]3 .\nBy formulating each design stage as a learning problem, machine learning techniques can significantly shorten IC development cycles compared to conventional Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools.\nFor example, Google  and Nvidia [ref]3 have shown that deep learning methods can improve design efficiency by an order of 100×\\times at certain stages of the digital IC design flow, such as floor planning and power estimation.\nAnalog circuit is an essential type of circuit that bridges our physical world with the digital information realm   [ref]7  .\nYet, unlike digital ICs that benefit from well-established conventional EDA tools or emerging efficient learning-based design automation methods, analog circuits continue to rely on onerous human efforts and lack effective EDA techniques at all stages  0. The pre-layout design of analog circuits can be represented as a parameter-to-specification (P2S) optimization problem.\nGiven the topology of a circuit, the goal is to find optimal device parameters (e.g., width and finger number of transistors) to meet the desired specifications (e.g., power and bandwidth) of the circuit.\nThis problem is challenging due to several factors.\nFirst, it involves searching for parameters of diverse devices in a large design space.\nThe complexity grows exponentially with an increase in both design parameters and circuit specifications  .\nSecond, the actual interactions between the device parameters and the circuit specifications are complicated  0, depending on multiple variables, such as circuit topology, variations in process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) and post-layout parasitic effects.\nThere are no exact analytical rules to follow, which worsens the search process.\nConventionally, human designers use critical domain knowledge, such as circuit topologies and couplings between circuit specifications, to manually derive the device parameters.\nIn particular, a human designer exerts an intense effort to obtain empirical equations between the device parameters and the circuit specifications based on a simplified circuit topology.\nYet, despite the simplification, tens and even hundreds of iterative fine-tunings are still required to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the design. During the past several decades, there have been enormous explorations on automating the design of analog circuit device parameters.\nThese methods generally fall into two categories, knowledge-based techniques and optimization-based techniques.\nKnowledge-based techniques are designer-centric 1 2 3.\nThey customize the design steps for specific circuits based on domain knowledge and embed them into procedural scripts that mimic the actions of designers.\nThese scripts allow designers to have full control over the modification and debugging of circuits to guarantee design reliability.\nHowever, design efficiency is significantly thwarted, because designers, acting as optimization agents, are required to frequently interact with procedural scripts.\nIn contrast, optimization-based techniques are algorithm-centric.\nThey consider each step of analog circuit design as a black-box optimization problem and apply optimization methods, such as Bayesian optimization , Genetic algorithms 4, and emerging machine learning algorithms 0 5 6 7 8 9.\nThese algorithms can be run quickly to complete the design of an analog circuit with high efficiency.\nUnfortunately, due to the absence of knowledge from experienced designers, the reliability of the design is not guaranteed, e.g., device parameters are not robust to various non-idealities.\nThese defects limit the efficiency and reliability of state-of-the-art analog design automation techniques. To bridge this gap, we propose a learning framework, RoSE-Opt, to achieve robust and efficient analog circuit parameter optmization by synergizing domain knowledge of analog circuits and learning algorithms.\nAnalog circuit design strongly relies on domain knowledge, such as circuit topology, couplings between circuit specifications, and PVT variations; thus, without adequately considering these key domain knowledge in building learning-based design automation frameworks, the device parameters discovered by the algorithm are prone to suffer from inferior reliability issues due to various non-idealities.\nOur previous work 0 follows this principle and has explored the integration of this key domain knowledge into the design framework.\nIt also exploits a two-level optimization method by integrating Bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose the RoSE-Opt framework which advances the state-of-the-art method 0.\nIn particular:\n 1 We analyze the failed cases in which our trained RL agent cannot\nconverge to the optimal device parameters.\nIn these scenarios, the RL agent can still help designers by offering optimized initial points for manual tuning.\n 2 We study its ability to consider device parasitic in parameter optimization.\nA direct mapping of an analog circuit schematic with correctly-sized devices into a physical layout can lead to performance degradation, mainly due to parasitics from metal wires and electromagnetic effects, and needs tens of iterations between the two for fine-tuning.\nThis extended work demonstrates the promise of RoSE-Opt in addressing this problem.\n 3 At the algorithm level, we thoroughly study the performance of different RL optimization algorithms, such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) with an off-policy learning mechanism and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with an on-policy learning mechanism, to provide users with useful guidance in choosing appropriate RL algorithms for device sizing.\n 4 Finally, we showcase a Pareto optimization example, i.e., optimizing the figure-of-merit (FoM) of a circuit.\nOur framework can facilitate the identification of the optimal Pareto frontier.\nIn summary, we present a holistic BO-RL-based design automation framework to perform the P2S optimization tasks of analog circuit design with high robustness and efficiency.\nWe make following key contributions. This paper proposes a comprehensive BO-RL-based design automation framework, RoSE-Opt.\nOur learning framework explores and exploits both the domain knowledge of analog circuit design and the strong optimization ability of design automation algorithms. We perform a failure analysis of our method and show how to leverage the unsuccessful deployment trajectory to guide the fine-tuning of manual efforts toward design success.\nIn addition, we study its effectiveness in the scenarios of parasitic-aware device parameter optimization. We thoroughly characterize the performance of different RL optimization algorithms (i.e., DDPG vs. PPO) to provide users with useful insights in choosing appropriate RL algorithms for device parameter optimization. Experimental evaluations on benchmarking circuits show that our framework achieves 7.9×∼12×7.9\\times\\sim 12\\times improvement in training sample efficiency and a significant improvement in the design success rate and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the same problem.\nIn Pareto optimization, our framework identifies the optimal Pareto frontier by minimizing power consumption and maximizing the gain bandwidth product (GBW), all within a minimal number of simulations.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: numerous applications and infrastructures with microelectronic chips of a small footprint.\nRecent advances in deep learning have shown great promise in transforming modern IC design workflows   [ref]3 .\nBy formulating each design stage as a learning problem, machine learning techniques can significantly shorten IC development cycles compared to conventional Electronic Design Automation\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
