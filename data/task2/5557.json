      "content": "Paper Title: ASSET: Robust Backdoor Data Detection Across a Multiplicity of Deep Learning Paradigms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvaluation metrics. There are two key aspects throughout our evaluation: (1) How accurately can the poisoned samples be detected (upstream evaluation)? (2) After the suspicious points are removed, how would a downstream model learn from the remaining data perform (downstream evaluation)? For upstream evaluation, we utilize two metrics, namely, True Positive Rate (TPR), T​P​R=T​P/(T​P+F​N)𝑇𝑃𝑅𝑇𝑃𝑇𝑃𝐹𝑁TPR={TP}/{(TP+FN)},\nand False Positive Rate (FPR), F​P​R=F​P/(F​P+T​N)𝐹𝑃𝑅𝐹𝑃𝐹𝑃𝑇𝑁FPR={FP}/{(FP+TN)},\nwhere T​P𝑇𝑃TP, F​P𝐹𝑃FP, T​N𝑇𝑁TN, and F​N𝐹𝑁FN denote the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, respectively444Note that poison is considered positive and clean is considered negative..\nTPR depicts how well a specific backdoor detection method filters out the backdoored samples. A higher TPR (closer to 100%percent\\%) denotes a stronger filtering ability.\nFPR depicts how precise the filtering is: when a specific method achieves TPR that is high enough, FPR helps us to understand the trade-off, i.e., how many clean samples are wasted and wrongly flagged as backdoored during the detection. A lower FPR shows that fewer clean samples are wasted, and more clean data shall be kept and available for downstream usage. One thing worth noting is that no detection method can reliably remove all the poisoned samples. However, the remained backdoor samples that go unnoticed by a successful defense should be small enough to deactivate attacks.\nThus, we evaluate the backdoor attacks’ Attack Success Rate (ASR) on the downstream model trained using the filtered dataset to study whether the detection is good enough to stop attacks. ASR measures the proportion of backdoored test samples being classified into target classes. Additionally, we evaluate the downstream model’s Clean Accuracy (ACC). A high ACC means that the detection method is able to maintain a large enough clean set to support the model performance. blue red Dataset & models.\nWe incorporate three standard computer vision benchmark datasets into our evaluation: CIFAR-10  (main text), STL-10  (Appendix 6.3), and ImageNet [ref]55 (a randomly selected 100-class subset, Appendix 6.3). To ensure the effectiveness of the baselines and fair comparison, we set the base set size as 1000 for all the settings. We will later show that our method is robust to different choices of the base set size in the ablation study, Appendix 6.4. We obtain a 1000-size clean base set for each dataset by randomly selecting the samples from the test set and removing their label information.\nAll the upstream evaluation metrics (i.e., TPR and FPR) are evaluated on the respective training sets, i.e., the training set of Case-0, the fine-tuning set of Case-2, and the unlabeled pre-training set for Case-1.\nFor Case-0, we adopt all the remaining data from the test set for evaluation of the downstream metrics (i.e., ACC and ASR). For Case-1 and Case-2, we split the remaining test set into half being fine-tuning set and half being the downstream metric evaluation set.\nResNet-18 [ref]56 is adopted on the CIFAR-10.\nViT-Small/16  is adopted on STL-10 and ImageNet (Appendix 6.3).\nFor Case-1, we incorporate four state-of-the-art SSL training methods, i.e., SimCLR , MoCo V3 , BYOL , and the MAE 3, for evaluation. For Case-2, we consider the two most popular transfer learning cases, namely, FT-all and FT-last (detailed in Section 2).\nThe pre-trained model parameters for fine-tuning are loaded from the timm library555https://timm.fast.ai/. Baseline defenses.\nReferring to Table 1, we incorporate a wide range of existing backdoor detection for comparison, including both standard baselines used in prior work as well as state-of-the-art ones.\nIn particular, we consider Spectral\n, Spectre\n, and the Beatrix\n;\nwe include AC\n as a representative work that utilizes intermediate neural activation;\nABL\n, which was originally a robust training defense and repurposed as a detection method based on output losses;\nStrip\n\nas a representative detection approach based on model outputs;\nand CT\n, the most recent work reported achieving state-of-the-art performance on end-to-end SL settings based on confusion training.\nAll the implementations and hyperparameters follow the original papers. For methods that rely on or can be boosted by an additional base set, e.g., Spectre, Beatrix, Strip, CT, we use the same 1000-size base set as ours. We note that this comparison setting might not be fair, as compared to these baselines, our method relaxes the requirement on label information; in addition, AC and ABL cannot be adapted to use the base set.\nWe want to show that even without label information,\nour method can still achieve comparable or much better results with stronger robustness than the other baselines.\nDetailed explanations of the defense settings and how we adapted them to Case-1 and Case-2 are provided in Appendix 6.1. Backdoor attack settings.\nFor Case-0 we incorporate seven standard or state-of-the-art attacks, including four dirty-label and clean-label ones.\nFor dirty-label backdoor attacks, we incorporate localized backdoor attack BadNets , global-wised blended trigger Blended , wrapping-based invisible backdoor attack WaNet , and the state-of-the-art sample-specific invisible backdoor attack, ISSBA . For clean-label attacks, we include the standard Label Consistent (LC) attack , the state-of-the-art feature-collision-based hidden trigger backdoor, Sleeper Agent Attack (SAA) , and the state-of-the-art optimization-based Narcissus attack (Narci.) .\nFor Case-1, only limited existing work has explored the attack over SSL’s unlabeled training set. We incorporate\nthe Checkerboard trigger (C-brd) used in 9, the Colored Square trigger (C-squ) used in 0, and the state-of-the-art YCbCr frequency-based invisible trigger used in CTRL 1. In particular, CTRL has been shown to achieve a magnitude higher attacking efficacy than 0.\nFor Case-2, directly implementing some of the attacks from end-to-end SL may not lead to effective attacks, e.g., the Blended attack cannot achieve high ASR under the FT-all settings. Thus, we consider attacks that can maintain effectiveness for each TL setting.\nBadNets and the SAA are adopted for evaluation under the FT-all case. Blended and the hidden trigger backdoor attack (HTBA)  are adopted for the evaluation under the FT-last case. All the incorporated attacks’ settings, such as trigger design and trigger strength, all follow their original papers.\nAppendix 6.2 details the specifics of these attacks’ setups under each learning paradigm and visual examples of the poisoned samples we intend to detect. red\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: the model performance. blue red Dataset & models.\nWe incorporate three standard computer vision benchmark datasets into our evaluation: CIFAR-10  (main text), STL-10  (Appendix 6.3), and ImageNet [ref]55 (a randomly selected 100-class subset, Appendix 6.3). To ensure the effectiveness of the baselines and fair comparison, we set the base set size as 1000 for all the settings.
