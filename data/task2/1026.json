      "content": "Paper Title: Encoder-decoder semantic segmentation models for electroluminescence images of thin-film photovoltaic modules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor our segmentation models we utilize the encoder-decoder neural\nnetwork architecture. These networks consist of two parts: the\ncontraction part (or encoder) and the symmetric expansion part (or\ndecoder). The encoder compresses information content of an arbitrarily\nhigh-dimensional image into a feature vector. The decoder gradually\nupscales the encoded features back to the original\nresolution. Figure 3 schematically demonstrates a typical\nstructure of the encoder-decoder architecture. Each block represents\nan output of the convolutional layer, with the data flow going from\nleft to right. The arrows represent the skipping links, where the\ninput for the layer is copied from the encoder to the decoder\nparts. Different networks may have different number of layers,\nskipping connections and different activation functions. We take several popular networks and use parts of their architecture\nas an encoder or as a decoder. Combinations of encoders and decoders\nfrom different networks provide us with different segmentation\nnetworks. Furthermore, there are several tuning parameters available\nthat allow us to generate even more segmentation models. For the encoder part of our networks we use Mobile-net\n[ref]41, ResNet [ref]42, VGG-net\n and U-net [ref]44. For the\ndecoder part of our network we use U-net [ref]44,\nFCN-net , PSP-net  and\nSegNet . We use network\nimplementations available in . In order to be able to combine different encoder and decoder\narchitectures we organize all encoder outputs to have 5 feature\ntensors. Different models have slightly different permissible input\nimage sizes. The ResNet models require the input image\ndimension to be divisible by 32, the PSP-net models: divisible by\n192. The Mobile-net models have the fixed input image size of\n224×224224224224\\times 224 pixels. Table I summarizes the\ncombinations of the encoder and decoder models. Some encoders and\ndecoders have a tuning parameter. \\linelabeltuning parameters The\nResNet, VGG-net, U-net have the size of the input image as\nan input parameter. We select between either 256×256256256256\\times 256 and\n512×512512512512\\times 512. The SegNet’s parameter is the number of\nupsampling routines, see . The\nFCN-net’s parameter has a single parameter: number of features,\nthat can be equal 888 or 323232. Combinations of different encoders and\ndecoders with the choice of several tunable parameters provide us with\na choice of 34 trainable models\\linelabeltuning parameters result in\nmodels, i.e. we treat a single model with tuning parameters as\nseveral independent models corresponding to different choices of\ntuning parameters. Some of the FCN-net models with 32 layers are\ndiscarded as they require too much memory. All models work with input image patches that are smaller than a\ntypical EL image. The size of the input image regulates the\ninformation that is used for defect forecast. As shunts defects and\ndroplets have a local nature, we select a square image patch size with\nan edge length varying between 15 and 30 times the cell width.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: segmentation\nnetworks. Furthermore, there are several tuning parameters available\nthat allow us to generate even more segmentation models. For the encoder part of our networks we use Mobile-net\n[ref]41, ResNet [ref]42, VGG-net\n and U-net [ref]44. For the\ndecoder part of our network we use U-net [ref]44,\nFCN-net , PSP-net  and\nSegNet . We use network\nimplementations available in .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
