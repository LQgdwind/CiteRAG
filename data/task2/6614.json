      "content": "Paper Title: MPDIoU: A Loss for Efficient and Accurate Bounding Box Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt the very beginning, ℓnsubscriptℓ𝑛\\ell_{n}-norm loss function was widely used for bounding box regression, which was exactly simple but sensitive to various scales. In YOLO v1 , square roots for w𝑤w and hℎh are adopted to mitigate this effect, while YOLO v3  uses 2−w​h2𝑤ℎ2-wh. In order to better calculate the diverse between the groundtruth and the predicted bounding boxes, I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU loss is used since Unitbox . To ensure the training stability, Bounded-I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU loss  introduces the upper bound of I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU.\nFor training deep models in object detection and instance segmentation, I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU-based metrics are suggested to be more consistent than ℓnsubscriptℓ𝑛\\ell_{n}-norm   [ref]39. The original I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU represents the ratio of the intersection area and the union area of the predicted bounding box and the groundtruth bounding box (as Figure 2(a) shows), which can be formulated as where ℬg​tsubscriptℬ𝑔𝑡\\mathcal{B}_{gt} denotes the groundtruth bounding box, ℬp​r​dsubscriptℬ𝑝𝑟𝑑\\mathcal{B}_{prd} denotes the predicted bounding box. As we can see, the original I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU only calculates the union area of two bounding boxes, which can’t distinguish the cases that two boxes do not overlap. As equation 1 shows, if |ℬg​t​⋂ℬp​r​d|=0subscriptℬ𝑔𝑡subscriptℬ𝑝𝑟𝑑0|\\mathcal{B}_{gt}\\bigcap\\mathcal{B}_{prd}|=0, then I​o​U​(ℬg​t,ℬp​r​d)=0𝐼𝑜𝑈subscriptℬ𝑔𝑡subscriptℬ𝑝𝑟𝑑0IoU(\\mathcal{B}_{gt},\\mathcal{B}_{prd})=0. In this case, I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU can not reflect whether two boxes are in vicinity of each other or very far from each other. Then, G​I​o​U𝐺𝐼𝑜𝑈GIoU [ref]39 is proposed to tackle this issue. The G​I​o​U𝐺𝐼𝑜𝑈GIoU can be formulated as where 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is the smallest box covering ℬg​tsubscriptℬ𝑔𝑡\\mathcal{B}_{gt} and ℬp​r​dsubscriptℬ𝑝𝑟𝑑\\mathcal{B}_{prd} (as shown in the black dotted box in Figure 2(a)), and ∣C∣delimited-∣∣𝐶\\mid C\\mid is the area of box 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. Due to the introduction of the penalty term in G​I​o​U𝐺𝐼𝑜𝑈GIoU loss, the predicted box will move toward the target box in nonoverlapping cases. G​I​o​U𝐺𝐼𝑜𝑈GIoU loss has been applied to train state-of-the-art object detectors, such as YOLO v3 and Faster R-CNN, and achieves better performance than MSE loss and I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU loss. However, G​I​o​U𝐺𝐼𝑜𝑈GIoU will lost effectiveness when the predicted bounding box is absolutely covered by the groundtruth bounding box. In order to deal with this problem, D​I​o​U𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈DIoU [ref]40 was proposed with consideration of the centroid points distance between the predicted bounding box and the groundtruth bounding box. The formulation of D​I​o​U𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈DIoU can be formulated as where ρ2​(ℬg​t,ℬp​r​d)superscript𝜌2subscriptℬ𝑔𝑡subscriptℬ𝑝𝑟𝑑\\rho^{2}(\\mathcal{B}_{gt},\\mathcal{B}_{prd}) denotes Euclidean distance between the central points of predicted bounding box and groundtruth bounding box (as the red dotted line shown in Figure 2(b)). 𝒞2superscript𝒞2\\mathcal{C}^{2} denotes the diagonal length of the smallest enclosing rectangle (as the black dotted line shown in Figure 2(b)). As we can see, the target of ℒD​I​o​Usubscriptℒ𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈\\mathcal{L}_{DIoU} directly minimizes the distance between central points of predicted bounding box and groundtruth bounding box. However, when the central point of predicted bounding box coincides with the central point of groundtruth bounding box, it degrades to the original I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU. To address this issue, C​I​o​U𝐶𝐼𝑜𝑈CIoU was proposed with consideration of both central points distance and the aspect ratio. The formulation of C​I​o​U𝐶𝐼𝑜𝑈CIoU can be written as follows: However, the definition of aspect ratio from C​I​o​U𝐶𝐼𝑜𝑈CIoU is relative value rather than absolute value. To address this issue, E​I​o​U𝐸𝐼𝑜𝑈EIoU [ref]41 was proposed based on D​I​o​U𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈DIoU, which is defined as follows: However, as Figure 2 shows, the loss functions mentioned above for bounding box regression will lose effectiveness when the predicted bounding box and the groundtruth bounding box have the same aspect ratio with different width and height values, which will limit the convergence speed and accuracy. Therefore, we try to design a novel loss function called ℒM​P​D​I​o​Usubscriptℒ𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈\\mathcal{L}_{MPDIoU} for bounding box regression with consideration of the advantages included in ℒG​I​o​Usubscriptℒ𝐺𝐼𝑜𝑈\\mathcal{L}_{GIoU} [ref]39, ℒD​I​o​Usubscriptℒ𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈\\mathcal{L}_{DIoU} [ref]40, ℒC​I​o​Usubscriptℒ𝐶𝐼𝑜𝑈\\mathcal{L}_{CIoU} , ℒE​I​o​Usubscriptℒ𝐸𝐼𝑜𝑈\\mathcal{L}_{EIoU} [ref]41, but also has higher efficiency and accuracy for bounding box regression. Nonetheless, geometric properties of bounding box regression are actually not fully exploited in existing loss functions. Therefore, we propose M​P​D​I​o​U𝑀𝑃𝐷𝐼𝑜𝑈MPDIoU loss by minimizing the top-left and bottom-right points distance between the predicted bounding box and the groundtruth bounding box for better training deep models of object detection, character-level scene text spotting and instance segmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: upper bound of I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU.\nFor training deep models in object detection and instance segmentation, I​o​U𝐼𝑜𝑈IoU-based metrics are suggested to be more consistent than ℓnsubscriptℓ𝑛\\ell_{n}-norm   [ref]39.
