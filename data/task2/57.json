      "content": "Paper Title: A Novel Graph-based Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo Oracle\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne challenge of accurate trajectory prediction is how to capture pedestrians’ social interactions. Such interactions can be defined by hand-crafted rules, such as social forces  and stationary crowds’ influence [ref]34. However, such hand-crafted rules model social interactions based only on psychological or physical realization, which alone is insufficient to capture complex crowd interactions. Recent studies have investigated deep learning techniques to capture crowd social interactions. Such studies are mainly divided into pooling-based and graph-based approaches. For pooling-based approaches, Social-LSTM  proposed the social pooling layer to aggregate the social hidden state within the local neighborhood of the agent. SGAN  used a symmetric function to summarize the global crowd interactions. Many other works  improved the pooling methods with different tricks, aiming at better capturing pedestrians’ social interactions. Different from pooling-based approaches, graph-based approaches formulate the connections between interactive agents with a graph structure. The graph structure is good at capturing the spatial and temporal correlations between different agents [ref]34, thus, can lead to better trajectory prediction. Moreover, graph models are especially suitable for handling dynamic scenarios [ref]37 and heterogeneous agents . With the powerful attention mechanism, the graph attention networks [ref]10 can better capture pedestrians’ social interactions. Despite the advantages above, few works have introduced OAE into capturing pedestrians’ social interactions. As reported by Hasan et al. , knowing the head orientation is beneficial for capturing social interactions. Specifically, pedestrians’ future trajectories are always influenced by pedestrians in front. However, it is nontrivial to detect pedestrians’ head orientations. Hence, we present a social graph attention module by introducing OAE-based social attention into data-driven learned graph attention. We use pedestrians’ velocity orientations to approximate their head orientations.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: of accurate trajectory prediction is how to capture pedestrians’ social interactions.
