      "content": "Paper Title: Pushing the limits of fairness impossibility: Who’s the fairest of them all?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use three primary data sources for our experiments, the more recently developed American Community Survey (ACS) data as well as two more classical datasets, Heart Disease and COMPAS. We elaborate on each dataset in this section. The ACS data is a dataset made publicly available by the US Census Bureau. Specifically, Ding et. al [ref]14 have created an excellent Python package777https://github.com/zykls/folktables (MIT License) that enables users to pull model-ready data (for a requested year and geographic region) for a set of pre-defined binary classification tasks, such as predicting high income, health insurance coverage, whether they move or not, among others. The tasks are detailed in the paper and we use all of the pre-defined tasks without any additional modification except for Employment. We do not use the Employment task because of the assumption detailed in Section 2.2 regarding overlap. Experiments with this task occasionally yielded models that did not have overlap which made this task unsuitable for demonstrating our methodology. We reiterate that this is not a practical issue if one just ignored the non-overlapping bins, but requires a lengthy and technical fairness interpretation that we felt were beyond the purpose of our study. In terms of time and geography, we use 2020 data for all experiments while the geography varies. In the experiments shown on Table 1, we use the West Coast US states (California, Oregon, Washington). In 3 we wanted a larger dataset as we required a sufficiently large testing split, hence we used the West Coast States (’CA’, ’OR’, ’WA’, ’NV’, ’AZ’) with the \"ACS Mobility\" dataset and a 60/40 train-test split for the inprocessing comparison and East Coast States (’ME’,’NH’,’MA’,’RI’, ’CT’,’NY’, ’NJ’, ’DE’,’MD’,’VA’, ’NC’,’SC’,’GA’,’FL’) and same with the \"ACS Poverty\" dataset for the postprocessing comparison. There was no particular reason for selecting these geographies aside from obtaining a large enough sample that we can feasibly run multiple trials on. Though we are using census data there is no PII information nor any endangerment to the subjects in the data. However, we note that in practice, it is important to exercise caution and equity in picking groups to mitigate for, as selective mitigation of favored groups by a malicious practitioner can result in underperformance for deserving groups. The Heart Disease Dataset (3) is a publicly available dataset where the task is to predict whether or not an individual has heart disease. Most applications of this data use the standard processed \"Cleveland\" data and we use sex as the group variable. We could not find a standard and preprocessed version of this data and did it ourselves by one-hot-encoding categorical variables. The COMPAS dataset is based on the recidivism study noted in (). We use the preprocessed version made available in the publicly available AIF360 package () 888https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360 without any additional modification. In this dataset, the task is to predict whether or not an individual will recidivate and we use ethnicity as the group variable. We list the problem parameters used to create the results in Table 1 in Table 4. We use the same parameters for all tasks. A particular note is that in Table 1, the IPOPT method performs very poorly compared on the COMPAS and ACS Coverage data. This is because across the 10 trials we ran, the IPOPT algorithm had frequently failed to converge within the 10-minute time limit for these two datasets. From the outputs, we saw that convergence failure is accompanied by heavy violation of the predictive rate parity constraint (demographic parity and equalized odds are still satisfied) and a high objective value. The exact reason for frequent failure in these two datasets is unclear, however, we hypothesize that it is due to a relatively high predictive rate parity gap in the data which led to numeric issues. Such failures were not observed in the IP formulation while both solvers were provided the exact same problem parameters. All experiments were run on a MacBook Pro with a 2.4GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor with 32 GB RAM. We did not use the GPU for solving. Data, preprocessing steps, and the random forest models utilize Python’s scikit-learn (, BDS License) package. The optimization model is coded through Julia’s JuMP package ( MPL License). We use the Gurobi (0 Academic License) and IPOPT (8 Eclipse Public License) solvers for all problems. Due to lack of space, we only showed the method comparison Table 3 for the testing data. We show the results on the training data in Table 5.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: more classical datasets, Heart Disease and COMPAS.
