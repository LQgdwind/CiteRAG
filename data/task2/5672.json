      "content": "Paper Title: Identification of Systematic Errors of Image Classifiers on Rare Subgroups\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning based approaches have revolutionized many fields of computer vision [ref]30  and are increasingly applied in safety-critical applications such as automated driving . An important prerequisite for deployment of learned models in such safety-critical domains is that they need to work reasonably well for all subgroups from an operational design domain  and strong requirements are imposed on assuring safety of systems . That is: there must not be catastrophic but avoidable failure cases on any subgroup, regardless of how rare the subgroup might be.\nUnfortunately, spurious correlations in the training data can often result in classifiers that utilize shortcut decision making     - a phenomenon long known from animal and human psychology . Such shortcuts can work well on subgroups that occur frequently in-distribution, that is: on data that follows the same distribution as the training data. However, they can easily fail after a domain shift to out-of-distribution data since very rare subgroups become suddenly much more frequent . For instance, Beery et al.  demonstrate that a shift in background can largely affect an image classifier, resulting in misclassifying, e.g., a cow on the beach. Accordingly, a crucial aspect of model auditing  is to separately evaluate the behaviour of a classifier on every subgroup from a large set of subgroups. If the performance of a classifier on certain subgroups is considerably worse than on the totality of the domain’s data, then we denote this subgroup as a systematic error of a classifier  6 [ref]51. More specifically, a systematic error refers to a subgroup of inputs on which a pretrained classifier has a high probability of misclassification (“error”) and at the same time a large percentage of elements in the subgroup share a human-interpretable concept: the group appears semantically coherent to a human (“systematic”). Applying methods for identifying such systematic errors could become a prerequisite for deployment in many domains while at the same time, systematic error are actionable: their exemplars can be used for finetuning a model and improving its robustness, reliability, and fairness [ref]17. Some prior work  6 require the availability of a labelled hold-out set covering data from rare subgroups for identification of systematic errors on these subgroups. Unfortunately, it is often expensive to acquire (labelled) data for certain subgroups that are very rare in the domain pre-deployment, even though subgroups could become much more frequent after some domain shift. This is problematic because systematic errors are much more likely to occur on subgroups that are rare in the training data. Other prior work is based on large unlabelled hold-out data but requires a human-in-the-loop [ref]17, which increases the costs of systematic error identification and thus limits applicability. Another line of work (including ours) focuses on auditing models on synthetically generated subgroup data. Recent progress of text-to-image models     in terms of compositionality can allow synthesizing data of rare subgroups that have not been part of the training data. Wiles et al. [ref]51 focused on an open-ended approach that synthesizes data according to the distribution induced by a fixed prompt that encodes the class but no subgroup information. Concurrently to our work, Vendrow et al.  generated text-conditioned counterfactual examples to study the robustness to single semantic shifts. We propose PromptAttack (see Figure 2), which leverages text-to-image models for synthesizing images of subgroups by encoding subgroup information directly in the prompt. To deal with large operational design domains and the resulting combinatorial explosion of subgroups, PromptAttack builds upon combinatorial testing   that allows a near-equable coverage of the operational design domain while keeping the number of explored subgroups relatively small.\nIn contrast to the open-ended approach by Wiles et al. [ref]51, PromptAttack is targeted and reliably explores subgroups from a prespecified operational design domain (see Section 4.1). Moreover, it does not require any pretrained models or heuristics components for failure case clustering and captioning. In contrast to Vendrow et al. , PromptAttack can identify systematic errors on subgroups that require the concurrence of several semantic shifts (see Figure 7). Overall, our main contributions are the following: In Section 3, we introduce PromptAttack, a novel procedure for identifying systematic errors based on synthetic data from a text-to-image model, conditioned on a prompt encoding subgroup and class information. PromptAttack explores a large subset of subgroups from an operational design domain using combinatorial testing, achieving near-equable coverage of subgroups (Section 4.1). We propose a benchmark for testing and comparing methods for systematic error identification (Section 4.2). In contrast to prior work , this benchmark does not train multiple classifiers with training-time interventions but is based purely on inference-time interventions on zero-shot classifiers such as CLIP 0. PromptAttack identifies classifier-specific and targeted systematic misclassifications on rare subgroups of ImageNet classifiers (see Figure 1 and Section 5).\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Deep learning based approaches have revolutionized many fields of computer vision [ref]30  and are increasingly applied in safety-critical applications such as automated driving .
