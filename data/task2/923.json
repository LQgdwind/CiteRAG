      "content": "Paper Title: RefVOS: A Closer Look at Referring Expressions for Video Object Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLanguage-guided Image Segmentation: The task, also known as referring image segmentation, was first tackled by Hu et al. . They use VGG-16  to obtain a visual representation of the image, and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to obtain an embedding of the RE. From the concatenation of visual and language features, the segmentation of the referred object is obtained. Posterior work [ref]24 explored how to include multi-scale semantics in the pipeline, by proposing a Recurrent Refinement Network that takes pyramidal features and refines the segmentation masks progressively. Liu et al.  argued to better represent the multi-modality of the task by jointly modeling the language and the image with a multi-modal LSTM that encodes the sequential interactions between words, visual features and the spatial information. With the same purpose of better capturing the multi-modal nature of this task, long-range correlations between the visual and language representations can be reinforced by learning a cross-modal attention module (CMSA) [ref]41. Building on the same idea, BRINet  adds a gated bi-directional fusion module to better integrate multi-level features. Another relevant work is STEP . They present a method that learns a visual-textual co-embedding, and that iteratively refines the textual embedding of the RE with a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network in a collaborative learning setup to improve the segmentation.\nAn alternative consists in using off-the-shelf object detectors, like MAttNet . In this case, a language attention network decomposes REs into three components: subject, location, and relationships, and merges the features obtained for each into single phrase embeddings. Given the object candidate by an off-the-shelf object detector model and a RE, the visual module dynamically weights scores from all three modules to fuse them. A different approach proposed recently is CMPC [ref]16, which leverages multi-modal graph reasoning to identify the target objects. RefVOS is a simpler model trained end-to-end that obtains a performance comparable to the state of the art on still images. Language-guided Video Object Tracking: Object Tracking is a similar task to Video Object Segmentation as it also follows a referent across video frames, but in the tracking case the model localizes the object with a bounding box instead of a binary mask. Li et al.  and Feng et al.  tackle the object tracking problem given a linguistic phrase instead of using the bounding box at the first frame. Our work provides pixel-wise segmentation masks that could be easily converted into bounding boxes, and at the same time avoid the annotation ambiguities present when bounding boxes overlap. Language-guided Video Object Segmentation (LVOS): VOS 0 9 has traditionally focused on semi-supervised setups in which\na binary mask of the object is provided for the first frame of the video.\nKhoreva et al.  propose to replace the mask supervision with a linguistic expression.\nIn their work, they extend the DAVIS-2017 dataset 1, a popular dataset for VOS, by collecting referring expressions for the annotated objects. They provide two different kinds of annotations from two annotators each: first frame annotations are the ones that are produced by only looking at the first frame of the video, whereas full video annotations are produced after seeing the whole video sequence.\nThey use the image-based MAttNet  model pretrained on RefCOCO to ground the localization of the referred object, and then train a segmentation network with DAVIS-2017 to produce the pixel-wise prediction. Temporal consistency is enforced, so that bounding boxes are coherent across frames, with a post-processing step.\nTo the authors’ knowledge, Khoreva et al.  is the only work previous to ours that focuses on REs for video object segmentation. Related work by Gavrilyuk et al.  addresses a similar task by segmenting video objects given a natural language query. They extend the Actor-Action Dataset (A2D) 8 by collecting phrases, but some of them may be ambiguous with respect to the intended referent, as they were not produced with the aim of reference, but description.\nThe authors propose a model with a 3D convolutional encoder and dynamic filters that specialize to localize the referred objects. Wang et al. 6 also leverage 3D convolutional networks, adding cross-attention between the visual and the language encoder. Concurrent to our work, Seo et al. 4 propose URVOS, a model for LVOS composed of a cross-modal attention module for the visual and lingual features, and a memory attention module to leverage information from past predictions in a sequence. Our work proposes a simpler model trained end-to-end that treats each video frame independently and outperforms all previous works. Referring Expression Categorization:\nRefCOCO, RefCOCO+  and RefCOCOg  are datasets that provide REs for the still images in MSCOCO .\nThe datasets focus on different aspects related to the difficulty of REs:\nthe REs for RefCOCO and RefCOCO+ were collected using the interactive ReferIt two-player game , designed to crowdsource expressions that uniquely identify the target referents.\nHowever, for RefCOCO+, location information was disallowed.\nRefCOCOg, in turn, collected non-interactively, only contains non-trivial instances of target objects, that is, there is at least one other object in an image of the same class.\nThe CLEVR dataset  contains objects of certain shapes, attributes such as sizes and colors, and spatial relationships.\nCLEVR uses synthetic images and phrases designed to test VQA systems, while our work focuses on human-produced language and natural videos. Khoreva et al.  categorize the REs they collected for DAVIS-2017 in order to analyze the effectiveness of their proposed model.\nThis is similar to our work, however, while they distinguish REs according to their length and whether they contain spatial words (e.g., left) or verbs, we propose a more fine-grained, semantic categorization that also distinguishes between different aspects of verb meaning related to motion and object relations.\nKhoreva et al.  furthermore analyze the REs in DAVIS-2017 with respect to the parts of speech they contain, while we use our semantic categories for dataset analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to obtain an embedding of the RE. From the concatenation of visual and language features, the segmentation of the referred object is obtained. Posterior work [ref]24 explored how to include multi-scale semantics in the pipeline, by proposing a Recurrent Refinement Network that takes pyramidal features and refines the segmentation masks progressively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
