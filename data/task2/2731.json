      "content": "Paper Title: A Hierarchical Network-Oriented Analysis of User Participation in Misinformation Spread on WhatsApp\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe dataset used refers to messages shared in publicly accessible political-oriented groups in Brazil, originally gathered by the WhatsApp Monitor We thank the authors of  for sharing the anonymized data with us.. We restricted the period of analysis to six weeks of great political mobilization in the country, from September \\nth17 to October \\nth28, 2018, which includes the \\nth1 and \\nth2 rounds (October \\nth7 and \\nth28, respectively) of the 2018 Brazilian general elections. Our choice of the period is motivated by prior observations in academic studies  [ref]7  [ref]16 as well as respectable news sources777https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/11/01/whatsapp-2, https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45956557, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/whatsapp-fake-news-brazil-election-favoured-jair-bolsonaro-analysis-suggests that the WhatsApp platform was widely used for misinformation spread in the country around this electoral period. We chose to study information spread on the monitored groups on a per-week basis, thus building six non-overlapping snapshots. Also, we focused our study on the messages shared in 155 monitored groups with some message sharing activity in all six snapshots. Table 2 presents a summary of the dataset for each week/snapshot, having the weeks with election dates (3r‚Äãdsuperscript3ùëüùëë3^{rd} and 6t‚Äãhsuperscript6ùë°‚Ñé6^{th}) highlighted in bold. The table shows the number of unique active users, the average numbers of users and messages per group and the average number of messages shared by a user in a group. The number of active users refers to number of distinct anonymized user identifiers that shared at least one message in one of the groups during the given week. The table also presents the numbers of messages shared in different media types per week. Despite some fluctuations in the numbers, there seems to be a general trend towards an increase in messaging activity around the election dates. We processed the dataset to extract and store the following\ninformation associated with each message: timestamp, anonymized user identifier888We note that the original dataset contains only cellular phone numbers, which were mapped onto anonymized identifiers. As such, the same individual participating in one or more groups with multiple phone numbers will be interpreted as different users.,\ngroup identifier and the (textual, image, audio or video) message content.\nNext, we adopted a series of heuristics for filtering and identifying near duplicate content, which is a necessary step to build the media co-sharing networks, as described in Section 3.3. The specific heuristic employed depends on the media type. For textual messages, we strictly followed the procedure adopted in [ref]7. First, we filtered out messages shorter than 180 characters so as to retain only those with higher chance of carrying relevant information. Towards identifying near duplicate content, the similarity between pairs of messages was computed using the Jaccard similarity, defined as the ratio of the number of common words to the total number of distinct words in both messages. As specified in [ref]7, a similarity threshold of 0.7 was empirically set by manually inspecting a sample of the messages. Thus, messages with similarity greater than 0.7 were grouped together and considered as near duplicates.\nFor images, we followed the procedure specified in : the Perceptual Hashing (pHash) algorithm  was used to calculate a fingerprint for each image in the dataset. This hashing algorithm is able to identify near duplicate images that hold similar color variations or that have been cropped and resized. Images having the same hash-values were then grouped as near duplicates.\nFor audio and videos, we used the generic identification that the WhatsApp tool creates during data transfer to detect the same content being shared multiple times.\nAt the end, one message for each near duplicate group was selected as representative of the content. We note that our near duplicate identification process is limited by the heuristics used, which, in some cases, notably audio and video content, may be somewhat conservative. Thus, the characteristics of the networks built from our data may be more conservative than in reality. Yet, as we will see in Section 4, even under such conservative constraints, it is still possible to identify distinguishing properties of users most often engaged in misinformation spread.\nAs future work, we intend to explore more sophisticated heuristics, such as word [ref]43 and sentence embeddings  (for textual messages), product quantization  (for images) and techniques based on audio and video content analysis .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: includes the \\nth1 and \\nth2 rounds (October \\nth7 and \\nth28, respectively) of the 2018 Brazilian general elections.
