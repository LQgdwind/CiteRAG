      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Improving Embedding Based Models of Social Network Alignment via Pseudo Anchors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNetwork embedding aims at mapping each node of a network into a low dimension space with the structural proximity property preserved. Earlier works in this area are mainly based on dimension reduction via matrix factorization  .\nSome more recent ones like GraRep  and HOPE  try to decompose multiple types of matrices defined for modeling high-order and global structural information. Inspired by the Skip-gram algorithm of word2vec , shallow neural network based algorithms, such as DeepWalk [ref]12 LINE [ref]13 and Node2vec , were proposed for network embedding. Negative sampling and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) adopted in the optimization make the embedding learning scalable. The main difference among them resides on how they determine the “context” for the target nodes. Depth First Search (DFS) [ref]12, Breadth First Search (BFS) [ref]13, and the balance strategy between DFS and BFS  are leveraged in them respectively. By drawing the equivalence between Skip-gram and matrix factorization, NetMF  was proposed for unifying network representation learning into a matrix factorization framework. Further, NetSMF [ref]22 and ProNE  address the efficiency issues in the matrix factorization framework by leveraging sparse matrices for fast and scalable learning. To achieve powerful representation capability, deep neural networks have also been proposed for network embedding.\nFor instance, SDNE  uses a deep autoencoder to maintain the similarity between the first and second orders. GraphGAN  introduces the GAN model with the use of a generator to fit the real distribution of the node embedding.\nAlso, Convolutional Graph Neural Networks (ConvGNNs) have attracted extensive attention for modeling graphs. For instance, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)  uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix to learn the graph properties. Furthermore, several works, such as GAT  and RWNN , incorporate the attention mechanism into the GNN model for more robust learning.\nIn addition, to address the learning issues related to ConvGNNs, GraphSAGE  aggregates randomly selected neighboring nodes for efficient learning, and DROPEDGE  learns the representation by randomly dropping edges for alleviating the over-smoothing problem. HNN  adopts hyperedge distillation for hpyergraph based representation learning. For all these models, even with a deeper architecture utilized, the strategy for aggregating neighbors’ information in each layer is essentially a structural preserving process. For structural preserving embedding algorithms applied to a single social network, the objective function tends to make neighboring nodes (such as adjacent nodes or nodes that share many common neighbors) as close as possible. This is reasonable for some downstream tasks such as link prediction, as there is a high probability for users being friends if they are in “structural” proximity. However, for user alignment across social networks, we expect to learn a space not only can maintain the structural proximity but also allow the node embeddings to be organized more evenly apart to ease the identification of the corresponding anchor from its close neighbors in another network. Therefore, how to learn the network embedding driven by the objective of the alignment task remains open, which is the main goal of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: types of matrices defined for modeling high-order and global structural information.
