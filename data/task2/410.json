      "content": "Paper Title: How to generate random lambda terms?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor many years, the exact-size sampling paradigm was the de facto\nstandard in combinatorial generation. Its long-lasting dominance was brought to\nan end with the seminal paper of Duchon, Flajolet, Louchard, and\nSchaeffer  who introduced the framework of\nBoltzmann models. Instead of generating random structures of fixed size\nn𝑛n, Boltzmann models provide a more relaxed, approximate-size sampling\nenvironment which uses the analytic properties of associated generating functions. Fix a class 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} of combinatorial structures we want to sample. Under the\nBoltzmann model we assign to each object α∈𝒜𝛼𝒜\\alpha\\in\\mathcal{A} a\nprobability measure where x𝑥x is some aptly chosen, positive real-valued control parameter,\nand |α|𝛼|\\alpha| denotes the size of object α𝛼\\alpha. If we sample in accordance\nwith the above Boltzmann distribution, outcome structures of equal size\ninvariably occur with the same probability. Boltzmann models retain\ntherefore the usual requirement of uniformity however now, the size of\nthe outcome object is no longer fixed, but instead varies. Indeed, let N𝑁N be a\nrandom variable denoting the outcome size of a Boltzmann sampler\ngenerating objects according to (14). Summing over all\nα∈𝒜𝛼𝒜\\alpha\\in\\mathcal{A} of size n𝑛n we find that We can control the expected size or generated objects by choosing suitable\nvalues of the control parameter x𝑥x. The expected average and standard\ndeviation of N𝑁N satisfy, respectively, Suppose, for instance, that we want to design a Boltzmann model for plane binary\ntrees. Recall that the associated generating function C​(z)𝐶𝑧C(z) satisfies the\nrelation C​(z)=1+z​C​(z)2𝐶𝑧1𝑧𝐶superscript𝑧2C(z)=1+z{C(z)}^{2}. If we want to centre the mean output tree size\naround some fixed value n𝑛n, we need to find a suitable control parameter x𝑥x\nsuch that 𝔼x​(N)=nsubscript𝔼𝑥𝑁𝑛\\mathbb{E}_{x}(N)=n. A direct computations reveals that we should\nuse So, if we want to obtain a random tree in some admissible size window\n[(1−ε)​n,(1+ε)​n]1𝜀𝑛1𝜀𝑛{[(1-\\varepsilon)n,(1+\\varepsilon)n]} with tolerance ε𝜀\\varepsilon, we\ncalibrate x𝑥x according to (17) and reject\ntrees falling outside of the prescribed size window. Boltzmann samplers.\nFor many interesting instances of decomposable combinatorial classes, such as\nrational languages or algebraic data types, it is possible to\nautomatically design appropriate Boltzmann models and corresponding\nsamplers generating random objects in accordance with the underlying Boltzmann\ndistribution,\nsee   [ref]6 . Much like exact-size recursive samplers, the Boltzmann sampler layout follows\nthe inductive structure of the target specification. Suppose that we want to\nsample an object from a (disjoint) union class 𝒜=ℬ+𝒞𝒜ℬ𝒞\\mathcal{A}=\\mathcal{B}+\\mathcal{C}. According to the\nBoltzmann distribution (14) the\nprobability of sampling an object from ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} is equal to B​(x)/A​(x)𝐵𝑥𝐴𝑥B(x)/A(x).\nLikewise, the probability of sampling an object from 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is equal to C​(x)/A​(x)𝐶𝑥𝐴𝑥C(x)/A(x). The corresponding Boltzmann sampler Γ​(𝒜)Γ𝒜\\Gamma(\\mathcal{A}) for 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}\nperforms therefore a single Bernoulli trial with parameter B​(x)/A​(x)𝐵𝑥𝐴𝑥B(x)/A(x). If\nsuccessful, the sampler invokes Γ​(ℬ)Γℬ\\Gamma(\\mathcal{B}). Otherwise, it calls the\nremaining sampler Γ​(𝒞)Γ𝒞\\Gamma(\\mathcal{C}). Clearly, such a sampler conforms with the\nBoltzmann distribution. Now, suppose that we want to sample an object from a product class 𝒜=ℬ×𝒞𝒜ℬ𝒞\\mathcal{A}=\\mathcal{B}\\times\\mathcal{C}. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the probability\nmeasure of a product object α=(β,γ)∈𝒜𝛼𝛽𝛾𝒜\\alpha=(\\beta,\\gamma)\\in\\mathcal{A} satisfies Therefore, in order to sample an object from 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} we can independently\ninvoke samplers Γ​(ℬ)Γℬ\\Gamma(\\mathcal{B}) and Γ​(𝒞)Γ𝒞\\Gamma(\\mathcal{C}), collect their outcomes,\nand construct a pair out of them. The result is a random object from 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}. The disjoint union ++ and Cartesian product ×\\times suffice to design\nBoltzmann samplers for algebraic specifications, in particular unambiguous\ncontext-free grammars. Let us remark, however, that Boltzmann sampler are\nnot just limited to these two operations.\nOver the years, efficient Boltzmann samplers for both labelled and unlabelled\nstructures were developed. Let us just mention Boltzmann samplers for\nvarious Pólya structures , first-order\ndifferential specifications [ref]15, labelled planar\ngraphs , or plane partitions . In most cases, especially when optimised using anticipated\nrejection , Boltzmann samplers are remarkably efficient,\nfrequently generating random structures of sizes in the millions. For typical\nalgebraic specifications, Boltzmann samplers calibrated to the target size\nwindow [(1−ε)​n,(1+ε)​n]1𝜀𝑛1𝜀𝑛[(1-\\varepsilon)n,(1+\\varepsilon)n] admit, on average, a linear O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n)\ntime complexity under the real arithmetic computation\nmodel  . For exact-size\nsampling where the tolerance ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0, the complexity becomes O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}). Boltzmann samplers for λ𝜆\\lambda-terms were first developed by\nLescanne   for\nTromp’s binary λ𝜆\\lambda-calculus .\nTromp’s special encoding of (plain) lambda terms as binary strings, provided\nan unambiguous context-free specification fitting the framework of\nBoltzmann samplers. With their help, it became possible to generate\nλ𝜆\\lambda-terms a couple of orders of magnitude larger than using\nrecursive method. Boltzmann models, especially if used with rejection methods, provide a rich\nsource of random λ𝜆\\lambda-terms. Although quite general, Boltzmann\nsamplers cannot be used for all term representations and size notions. Recall\nthat in order to derive a corresponding Boltzmann model, we have to, inter\nalia, evaluate the associated generating functions at the calibration parameter\nx𝑥x. For some representations, such as for instance Wang’s closed\nλ𝜆\\lambda-term model , the associated\ngenerating function is not analytic around the complex plane origin333In\nsuch a case the corresponding counting sequence grows super-exponentially fast,\ni.e. asymptotically faster than any exponential function Cnsuperscript𝐶𝑛C^{n}.. Moreover,\nwithout a finite specification we cannot derive a finite set of Boltzmann\nsamplers. In such cases we have to resort to alternative sampling methods\nincluding, e.g. rejection-based samplers.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: data types, it is possible to\nautomatically design appropriate Boltzmann models and corresponding\nsamplers generating random objects in accordance with the underlying Boltzmann\ndistribution,\nsee   [ref]6 .
