      "content": "Paper Title: Discrete approximation of the Griffith functional by adaptive finite elements\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ΓΓ\\Gamma-convergence approximation of free discontinuity problems (e.g. by more tractable ones from a numerical point of view) is of fundamental importance in applications. It has been proven in  that it is not possible to approximate free discontinuity functionals by means of local integral functionals. To overcome this difficulty, a first possibility is to introduce an additional variable like, e.g., in phase field approximations where the sharp discontinuity is smoothened into a diffuse discontinuity. It represents one of the most popular methods which have already proven to be successful in other contexts such as the Modica-Mortola approximation of the perimeter functional , or the Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation of the Mumford-Shah functional . In the context of brittle fracture, such approximations, which have a founded mechanical interpretation as a gradient damage model, have only recently been established in full generality in  (see also  ). The main drawback is that, an additional numerical approximation would give rise to a multiscale problem with on the one hand the parameter of approximation, and on the other hand the mesh size (see e.g.  [ref]7 ). Another possibility is to use nonlocal integral functionals as e.g. in   1. For what concerns the numerical treatment of free discontinuity problems, the main difficulty is related to the fact that the jump set is part of the unknowns and that standard discontinuous finite element methods do not in general apply in this context. Having this problematic in mind as well as the multiscale issues arising in phase field or nonlocal approximations, one is thus tempted to find single scale discrete approximations of free discontinuity problems. There is a huge literature on this subject and, without being exhaustive, we refer to discrete-to-continuous approximations results  5 6    , nonlocal finite elements approximations   or discrete approximations based on stochastic meshes in  0. Let us focus on the discrete approximation result obtained in [ref]23 for the Mumford-Shah functional in dimension N=2𝑁2N=2. In that work, the classical Mumford-Shah functional is approximated in the sense of ΓΓ\\Gamma-convergence by a functional of the form putting a restriction on the functional space on which Fεsubscript𝐹𝜀F_{\\varepsilon} is defined. The functional Fεsubscript𝐹𝜀F_{\\varepsilon} is discrete in the sense that u𝑢u is (a scalar-valued) continuous function and piecewise affine on suitable ε𝜀\\varepsilon-dependent meshes (see Definition 1.1). It consists in an adaptive finite element approximation because there is an implicit mesh optimization whose numerical implementation has been carried out in 1. The function fε​(∇u)subscript𝑓𝜀∇𝑢f_{\\varepsilon}(\\nabla u) takes the form 1ε​f​(ε​|∇u|2)1𝜀𝑓𝜀superscript∇𝑢2\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}f(\\varepsilon|\\nabla u|^{2}) where f𝑓f is a nondecreasing function satisfying the standard properties (1.4). Typical examples of functions f𝑓f are, on the one hand the arctan\\arctan function (as e.g. in  following a conjecture of De Giorgi) and, on the other hand f​(t)=t∧κ𝑓𝑡𝑡𝜅f(t)=t\\wedge\\kappa. The main feature of this result is that, allowing the mesh to move gives enough flexibility to approximate isotropic surface energies. The constant μ𝜇\\mu appearing in the functional F𝐹F is explicit and only depends on κ𝜅\\kappa and the geometry of the triangulation. An analogous analysis has been carried out in , where the author constraints the mesh to be made either of equilateral triangles, or of right isosceles ones. In that case, the result is that the functional Fεsubscript𝐹𝜀F_{\\varepsilon} ΓΓ\\Gamma-converges to an anisotropic version of the Mumford-Shah functional for some function ϕ:𝕊1→ℝ:italic-ϕ→superscript𝕊1ℝ\\phi:\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\to\\mathbb{R}, which can be explicitly computed, depending on the normal νusubscript𝜈𝑢\\nu_{u} to the jump set Jusubscript𝐽𝑢J_{u}. In , the same problem is addressed in the two-dimensional vectorial setting. If fεsubscript𝑓𝜀f_{\\varepsilon} is as before, the following approximating energy is considered As in , the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-dependent mesh is fixed and made either of equilateral triangles, or of right isosceles triangles, and the result is that this functional ΓΓ\\Gamma-converges to an anisotropic version of the Griffith functional where ϕ:𝕊1→ℝ:italic-ϕ→superscript𝕊1ℝ\\phi:\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\to\\mathbb{R} is as in . Note that if f​(t)=t∧κ𝑓𝑡𝑡𝜅f(t)=t\\wedge\\kappa, then In order to recover the isotropic Griffith energy (1.1), a similar approximation result is considered in  where, now, the meshes are allowed to move as in [ref]23, but the function fεsubscript𝑓𝜀f_{\\varepsilon} now depends on the full gradient ∇u∇𝑢\\nabla u (instead of the symmetric gradient) and behaves like (compare with (1.2)). In that case, the analysis of [ref]23 can be adapted to show a ΓΓ\\Gamma-convergence result towards the isotropic Griffith energy (1.1) with the same geometric multiplicative constant μ𝜇\\mu (as in [ref]23) in front of the surface energy.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: drawback is that, an additional numerical approximation would give rise to a multiscale problem with on the one hand the parameter of approximation, and on the other hand the mesh size (see e.g.  [ref]7 ).
