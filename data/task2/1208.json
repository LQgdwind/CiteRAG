      "content": "Paper Title: XTQA: Span-Level Explanations for Textbook Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVQA requires a machine to answer questions accurately given an image . We classify VQA methods into three categories: joint embedding-based, attention mechanism-based and explainable. Joint embedding-based  6  methods use convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to learn representations of images and questions respectively, and then project them into a common space to predict answers. Fukui et al.  proposed the multi-modal compact bi-linear pooling method to learn joint input representations and project them into the answer space to predict answers. However, bi-linear representations may limit the applicability to high-dimensional complex computation tasks. To address this issue, the low-rank bi-linear pooling method using Hadamard product 6 and factorized bi-linear pooling  methods are proposed to learn multi-modal representations efficiently. However, these methods may feed irrelevant or noisy information into the answer space. Attention mechanism-based  [ref]12 8 methods assign different importance to input representations before information fusion by computing attention coefficients. Anderson et al. [ref]12 proposed a combined bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism that computes attention at the level of salient image regions and objects. Li et al. 8 proposed a relation-aware graph attention network to learn question-adaptive multi-modal representations. Khademi et al.  devised a multi-modal neural graph memory network to perform reasoning about the interactions of objects. Ma et al. 9 proposed a multitask learning framework to jointly optimize multi-modal learning. However, these methods cannot provide explanations for humans. Explainable methods [ref]30    give humans explanations with the help of specified means such as external knowledge and symbols. FVQA [ref]30 queries the external knowledge base to obtain a supporting fact and predicts the answer. Huk Park et al.  proposed a multi-modal approach to explanations using post-hoc justifications. Yi et al.  proposed a neural-symbolic visual question answering architecture that disentangles question and image understanding from reasoning. Based on this paper, Mao et al.  proposed a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes generated programs on the latent scene representations to perform reasoning. The explanations of the above works are generated or extracted by complete supervision. By comparison, our model extracts span-level explanations with different lengths for different questions under the answer supervision rather than span supervision, i.e., weak supervision.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: pooling  methods are proposed to learn multi-modal representations efficiently.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
