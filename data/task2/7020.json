Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Following the official settings, we use ViT-Large with 24 Transformer blocks as the backbone. The image of 224 ×\\times 224 is partitioned into 14 ×\\times 14 patches with the size of 16 ×\\times 16. We also apply MAE [ref]22 and BEiT [ref]1 as teacher networks. The output size is 1024 ×\\times 196 for one instance. All teachers are pre-trained by original settings (1600 epochs). For the student network, we also apply a self-supervised method to train. By a convolution layer as projection, the student’s input and output have the same size as the teachers’. At the distillation training stage, the size of the memory queue is set to 50,000, and the temperature is set to 0.009 after several experiments. We use PyTorch along with LAMB  optimizer with momentum(beta) 0.9, max gradient norm parameter of 5.0, and weight decay of 1e-4 for 100 epochs. The learning rate is set to 8e-4 and updated by 40 warm-up epochs with a cosine decay scheduler. The batch size is 1024 for a single GPU. Moreover, we run our experiments on Tesla V100 with 8 GPUs with 32GB memory. We only use unlabeled ImageNet 1K  for all self-supervised and distillation methods, and both ImageNet 1K and MS-COCO  for downstream fine-tuning and evaluation. Linear classification is conducted on ImageNet 1K, and object detection and semantic segmentation are evaluated on MS-COCO. For image classification, we apply the pre-trained student’s weights to a backbone that has the same size and depth as the student and append a multi-layer-perceptron layer (two linear layers with a ReLU activation in between) at the end of the fine-tuning model after average pooling. Faster R-CNN  and Mask R-CNN  are used for object detection and semantic segmentation, respectively, in which after applying the student’s weights, we append the Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN’s neck and head, then fine-tune all the layers of the model. For fairly comparison, we apply same baseline architecture and pre-training weights on all benchmarks. Table 1\nshows training hyper-parameters for all models, in which CAE-L applies to teacher models and ResNet-50 applies to student models.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: For teacher network, we take CAE [ref]5 as default.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
