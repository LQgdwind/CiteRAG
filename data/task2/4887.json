      "content": "Paper Title: Brand New K-FACs: Speeding up K-FAC with Online Decomposition Updates\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe desirable properties () of Natural Gradient (NG; ) has determined research in optimization for Deep Learning (DL) to lately focus on developing (and improving) tractable NG implementations. K-FAC ([ref]1, [ref]2) is such a tractable implementation of NG for DL which makes substantial progress per epoch, but requires computing the inverses of the so-called “Kronecker-Factors” (K-Factors). While tractable, computing these inverses can become very slow for wide nets . By noting that the exponential-average (EA) construction paradigm of the K-Factors leads to eigen-spectrum decay, a way to significantly speed up the K-factors inversion using randomized linear algebra was proposed in [ref]3. In this paper, we exploit the EA construction paradigm of K-Factors in a different fashion, by using online-NLA techniques (), and propose an even cheaper111Than the “inversion” procedure proposed in [ref]3. (but less accurate) way of estimating the K-factors inverses for FC layers. Our contributions are as follows: Linear Time Inverse Computation. Proposing a new, cheaper way of performing the “inverse computation” in k-fac ([ref]1) for FC layers, exploiting the online construction paradigm of exponentially-averaged K-Factors (and the eigenspectrum decay thereof). W.r.t. the very recently proposed randomized approach of rs-kfac (in ), our proposed update is faster, but provides lower “inversion” accuracy222However, we can trade-off speed to gain accuracy by increasing update frequency.. This computation is linear in layer size (compare to quadratic for randomized K-FACs [ref]3 and cubic for standard K-FAC [ref]1, [ref]2). See Section 3. Linear Time Inverse Application. Proposing a way to apply the (proposed, low-rank) inverse representation of K-factors onto the Gradient whose time scales linearly in layer size (compare to quadratic for randomized K-FACs [ref]3 and cubic for standard K-FAC [ref]1, [ref]2). We only propose this, but the numerical results herein do not use it yet (see Section 5). Implementing it is future work. Simple theoretical results showing that under worst-case scenarios our proposed update to K-Factors inverses is strictly better than no update. This result is valuable in the context of the update being very cheap. See Sections 3 and 4. Numerical results showing our proposed online update (when introduced on top of the existing updates in a given rs-kfac algorithm) can significantly improve the error in K-Factors inverse with minimal computation time overhead. See Section 4. 3 practical algorithms (“Brand New K-FACs”) using our proposed update, possibly combined with rs-kfac updates, and a “correction” we introduce. See Section 3. Numerical results (for a particular case-study) showing that two of the Brand New K-FACs (b-kfac, b-kfac-c) outperform rs-kfac for all the considered target test accuracies, while the other one (b-r-kfac) does so (only) for high target test accuracy. See Section 6. Numerical results (for a particular case-study) showing b-r-kfac is better than k-fac ([ref]1) for 3/4 error metrics, while being almost on par for the 4thsuperscript4th4^{\\text{th}} metric and 3×3\\times cheaper.
