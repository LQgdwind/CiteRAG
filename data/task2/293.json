      "content": "Paper Title: Coded Secure Multi-Party Computation for Massive Matrices with Adversarial Nodes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider a system, including ΓΓ\\Gamma sources, N𝑁N processing nodes or workers and one data collector or master. There is not any communication between sources but each source is connected to each of the workers. Each source γ∈{1,2,…,Γ}𝛾12…Γ\\gamma\\in\\{1,2,...,\\Gamma\\} has access to a matrix 𝐗[γ]superscript𝐗delimited-[]𝛾\\mathbf{X}^{[\\gamma]}, where 𝐗[γ]superscript𝐗delimited-[]𝛾\\mathbf{X}^{[\\gamma]} is chosen independently and uniformly at random from 𝔽zγ×vγsuperscript𝔽subscript𝑧𝛾subscript𝑣𝛾\\mathbb{F}^{z_{\\gamma}\\times v_{\\gamma}}, for some integers zγ​ and ​vγsubscript𝑧𝛾 and subscript𝑣𝛾{z_{\\gamma}\\text{ and }v_{\\gamma}} and finite field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}.\nWe assume each worker has access to a function of 𝐗[γ]superscript𝐗delimited-[]𝛾\\mathbf{X}^{[\\gamma]}, with the size of 1mγ1subscript𝑚𝛾\\frac{1}{m_{\\gamma}} fraction of it size, for some integer mγsubscript𝑚𝛾m_{\\gamma}.\nThere is a point to point private link between each pair of workers. Also there is an authenticated broadcast channel among all workers such that the identity of the broadcaster is known. All the workers are connected to the master, which is interested in computing an arbitrary polynomial function of 𝐗,𝐗,…,𝐗[Γ]superscript𝐗delimited-[]1superscript𝐗delimited-[]2…superscript𝐗delimited-[]Γ\\mathbf{X}^{},\\mathbf{X}^{},...,\\mathbf{X}^{[\\Gamma]} denoted by 𝐘≜𝐆​(𝐗,𝐗,…,𝐗[Γ])≜𝐘𝐆superscript𝐗delimited-[]1superscript𝐗delimited-[]2…superscript𝐗delimited-[]Γ\\mathbf{Y}\\mathrel{\\triangleq}\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{X}^{},\\mathbf{X}^{},...,\\mathbf{X}^{[\\Gamma]}). We assume that an arbitrary subset 𝒮={s1,s2,…,st}𝒮subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2…subscript𝑠𝑡\\mathcal{S}=\\{s_{1},s_{2},\\dots,s_{t}\\} of workers are malicious, for some integer t≤N𝑡𝑁t\\leq N. It means that they can collude and share their data with each other. In addition malicious workers may not follow the protocol. Indeed, they may do anything, including misleading the other workers, to make the computation result incorrect. Assume that all existing links are error-free and secure. In this system we follow a three-step solution as follows: Sharing: In this step, source γ𝛾\\gamma sends 𝐗~γ,j=𝐅γ,j​(𝐗[γ])subscript~𝐗𝛾𝑗subscript𝐅𝛾𝑗superscript𝐗delimited-[]𝛾\\mathbf{\\widetilde{X}}_{\\gamma,j}=\\mathbf{F}_{\\gamma,j}(\\mathbf{X}^{[\\gamma]}) to the worker j𝑗j, where 𝐅γ,j​(𝐗):𝔽zγ×uγ→𝔽p×q:subscript𝐅𝛾𝑗𝐗→superscript𝔽subscript𝑧𝛾subscript𝑢𝛾superscript𝔽𝑝𝑞\\mathbf{F}_{\\gamma,j}(\\mathbf{X}):\\mathbb{F}^{z_{\\gamma}\\times u_{\\gamma}}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{F}^{p\\times q}, for some integer parameters p​ and ​q𝑝 and 𝑞p\\text{ and }q and j∈{1,2,…,N}𝑗12…𝑁j\\in\\{1,2,...,N\\}. We defined 1mγ≜p​qzγ×uγ≜1subscript𝑚𝛾𝑝𝑞subscript𝑧𝛾subscript𝑢𝛾\\frac{1}{m_{\\gamma}}\\triangleq\\frac{pq}{z_{\\gamma}\\times u_{\\gamma}} as normalized storage capacity of source γ𝛾\\gamma to each worker. Thus, 1mγ1subscript𝑚𝛾\\frac{1}{m_{\\gamma}} is a real non-negative number between 0 and 1. Computation and Communication: Workers process their input data and communicate with each other in this step. Let ℳn→n′subscriptℳ→𝑛superscript𝑛′\\mathcal{M}_{n\\rightarrow n^{\\prime}} be the set of all messages that worker n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} receives from worker n𝑛n in this step, for some n,n′∈{1,2,…,N}𝑛superscript𝑛′12…𝑁n,n^{\\prime}\\in\\{1,2,...,N\\}. In the main protocol, for ease of understanding, computation and communication step will be partitioned into 2 phases, subsharing phase, and constructing the product of subshares phase. Reconstruction: In this step, each worker n𝑛n, n∈{1,2,…,N}𝑛12…𝑁n\\in\\{1,2,...,N\\}, sends a message, denoted by 𝐘nsubscript𝐘𝑛\\mathbf{Y}_{n} to the master, such that the master is able to reconstruct 𝐘=𝐆​(𝐗,𝐗,…,𝐗[Γ])𝐘𝐆superscript𝐗delimited-[]1superscript𝐗delimited-[]2…superscript𝐗delimited-[]Γ\\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{X}^{},\\mathbf{X}^{},...,\\mathbf{X}^{[\\Gamma]}) from 𝐘1,𝐘2,…​𝐘Nsubscript𝐘1subscript𝐘2…subscript𝐘𝑁\\mathbf{Y}_{1},\\mathbf{Y}_{2},...\\mathbf{Y}_{N}. All schemes that are proposed in secure fault-tolerant MPC systems must satisfy some constraints regarding, correctness, privacy for the workers, and privacy for the master, as follows. Correctness: Master must have sufficient information to derive the correct result. More precisely, Note that the correctness condition must be satisfied in the presence of adversarial nodes. Privacy for the workers: Let t∈{1,…,N}𝑡1…𝑁t\\in\\{1,...,N\\}. If any arbitrary subset 𝒮={s1,s2,…,st}𝒮subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2…subscript𝑠𝑡\\mathcal{S}=\\{s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{t}\\} of workers collude and share their data, they can not gain any information about the inputs, i.e., Privacy for the master: Master must not gain any additional information beyond the function result, i.e., Consider the secure MPC system, explained above, with t𝑡t malicious workers and mγ=msubscript𝑚𝛾𝑚m_{\\gamma}=m, for γ∈[Γ]𝛾delimited-[]Γ\\gamma\\in[\\Gamma], and some integer m𝑚m. The recovery threshold, denoted by Nt,1m∗subscriptsuperscript𝑁𝑡1𝑚N^{*}_{t,\\frac{1}{m}}, is defined as the minimum number of workers N𝑁N, needed to calculate an arbitrary polynomial function of private inputs 𝐘=𝐆​(𝐗,𝐗,…,𝐗[Γ])𝐘𝐆superscript𝐗delimited-[]1superscript𝐗delimited-[]2…superscript𝐗delimited-[]Γ\\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{X}^{},\\mathbf{X}^{},...,\\mathbf{X}^{[\\Gamma]}), while satisfying the correctness condition, the privacy condition at the workers, and the privacy condition at the data collector. Remark 1:\n\nIn this paper, the objective is to introduce an upper-bound on Nt,1m∗subscriptsuperscript𝑁𝑡1𝑚N^{*}_{t,\\frac{1}{m}}, by developing an achievable scheme for this problem. Remark 2:\n\nThe difference between this set-up and secure matrix multiplication [ref]32 [ref]30 8 7 9    6 is that in secure matrix multiplication, the master is interested in the result of multiplication of two matrices, or multiple pairs of matrices, and there is no privacy constraint at the master. Also there is no communication among the workers. Thus adversarial behavior of malicious workers can be detected and corrected using schemes similar as what is used in Reed-Solomon decoding. However, in this paper, workers communicate with each other to be able to calculate any polynomial function, rather than just matrix multiplication. The challenge is then to prevent adversarial nodes to mislead other workers, and also prevent errors propagating in the network. Remark 3:\n\nThe difference between this set-up and Lagrange coding 5 is that Lagrange code is design to compute 𝐆​(𝐗1),…,𝐆​(𝐗Γ)𝐆subscript𝐗1…𝐆subscript𝐗Γ\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{X}_{1}),\\ldots,\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{X}_{\\Gamma}), for some polynomial function 𝐆𝐆\\mathbf{G} and some input matrices 𝐗1,…,𝐗Γsubscript𝐗1…subscript𝐗Γ\\mathbf{X}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{X}_{\\Gamma}. In addition, each worker can handle computing one of these tasks. Lagrange code introduces coded redundancy in executing those tasks. The algorithm can also protect privacy of data at the workers. Lagrange codes is a single-shot scheme, without any interaction among the workers. The advantage thus is that adversarial nodes can be handled at the master, following the same approaches used in Reed-Solomon decoding.\nThe disadvantage is that the recovery threshold grows linearly with the degree of 𝐆𝐆\\mathbf{G}. In contrary, in the proposed problem formulation here, workers can communicate with each other, and thus the recovery threshold does not increase with the degree of polynomial. This makes dealing with adversarial nodes more challenging.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: on Nt,1m∗subscriptsuperscript𝑁𝑡1𝑚N^{*}_{t,\\frac{1}{m}}, by developing an achievable scheme for this problem.
