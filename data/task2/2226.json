Optimal transport models try to align the representations of the source and target domains\nvia the optimal distribution matching  [ref]21 and domain structure exploration . Domain adversarial training of neural networks is another popular approach to learn domain invariant and task discriminative representations . Adversarial discriminative models employ an adversarial objective with respect to a domain discriminator to encourage domain confusion .\nThis approach has multiple variants, some of which also exploit class-specific and group-specific domain recognition components   .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: on corresponding activation layers of the two network streams .
