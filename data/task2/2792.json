Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust and Decomposable Average Precision for Image Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use several Python libraries often used in image retrieval. We use PyTorch  as a general framework to implement our neural networks, losses and training loops. We use several utilities from PyTorch Metric Learing 7, an open-source Python library focused on helping researcher working on image retrieval and metric learning. We use Faiss  to compute metrics (i.e. to perform nearest neighbours search), which is a Python library often used in image retrieval to compute the rankings or the similarity matrix. To load and use the transformer models we use timm [ref]45, a library implementing recent computer vision models, with pretrained weights for most of them. To handle all our config files, we use Hydra , this library makes it possible to combine the use of Yaml configuration files and overriding them using the command line. We use the publicly available implementation of SoftBinAP333https://github.com/naver/deep-image-retrieval 2 which is under a BSD-3 license. The original codes of SmoothAP444https://github.com/Andrew-Brown1/Smooth_AP , BlackBox555https://github.com/martius-lab/blackbox-backprop 8  are under an MIT license. For FastAP  we use the implementation from 7 (MIT license), the original implementation of FastAP666https://github.com/kunhe/FastAP-metric-learning is also under an MIT license.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: to perform nearest neighbours search), which is a Python library often used in image retrieval to compute the rankings or the similarity matrix.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
