      "content": "Paper Title: Option-Aware Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImitation Learning. Imitation learning methods  seek to learn to perform a task from expert demonstrations, where the learner is given only samples of trajectories from the expert and is not provided any reinforcement signals, such as the environmental rewards which are usually hard to acquire in real-life scenarios. There are two main branches for this algorithm setting: behavioral cloning (BC) , which learns a policy as a supervised learning problem over state-action pairs from expert trajectories, and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) , which first infers a reward function under which the expert is uniquely optimal and then recovers the expert policy based on it. Behavioral cloning only tends to succeed with large amounts of data, due to the compounding error caused by covariate shift [ref]21. Inverse reinforcement learning, while avoiding the compounding error, is extremely expensive to solve and scale, since it requires reinforcement learning to get the corresponding optimal policy in each iteration of updating the reward function. GAIL  and AIRL  have been proposed to scale IRL for complex high-dimensional control tasks. They realize IRL through an adversarial learning framework, where they alternatively update a policy and discriminator network. The discriminator serves as the reward function and learns to differentiate between the expert demonstrations and state-action pairs from the learned policy. While, the policy is trained to generate trajectories that are difficult to be distinguished from expert data by the discriminator. Mathematical details are provided in Section III-A. AIRL explicitly recovers the reward function and provides more robust and stable performance among challenging tasks  [ref]13 , which is chosen as our base algorithm for extension. Hierarchical Imitation Learning. Given the nature of subtask decomposition in long-horizon tasks, hierarchical imitation learning can achieve better performance than imitation learning by forming micro-policies for accomplishing the specific control for each subtask first and then learning a macro-policy for scheduling among the micro-policies. The micro-policies (a.k.a., skills) in RL can be modeled with the option framework proposed in [ref]6, which extends the usual notion of actions to include options — the closed-loop policies for taking actions over a period of time. We provide further details about the option framework in Section III-B. Through integrating IL with the options, the hierarchical versions of the IL methods mentioned above have been developed, including hierarchical behavioral cloning (HBC) and hierarchical inverse reinforcement learning (HIRL). In HBC, they train a policy for each subtask through supervised learning with the corresponding state-action pairs, due to which the subtask annotations need to be provided or inferred. In particular, the methods proposed in   require segmented data with the subtask information. While, in  , they infer the subtask information as the hidden variables in a Hidden Markov Model  and solve the HBC as an MLE problem with the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm . Despite its theoretical completeness, HBC is also vulnerable to compounding errors in case of limited demonstrations. On the other hand, the HIRL methods proposed in   have extended GAIL with the option framework to recover the hierarchical policy (i.e., the high-level and low-level policies mentioned above) from unsegmented expert data. Specifically, in , they introduce a regularizer into the original GAIL objective function to maximize the directed information between generated trajectories and the subtask/option annotations. However, the high-level and low-level policies are trained in two separate stages in their approach, which will inevitably lead to convergence with a poor local optimum. As for the approach proposed in  which claims to outperform  and HBC, it replaces the occupancy measurement in GAIL, which measures the distribution of the state-action pairs, with option-occupancy measurement to encourage the hierarchical policy to generate state-action-option tuples with similar distribution to the expert demonstrations. However, they do not adopt the directed information objective to enhance the causal relationship between the option choice and the corresponding state-action sequence. In this paper, we propose a new HIL algorithm based on AIRL, which takes advantage of the directed information objective and updates the high-level and low-level policies in an end-to-end fashion. Moreover, we provide theoretical justification of our algorithm, and demonstrate its superiority on challenging robotic control tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: is uniquely optimal and then recovers the expert policy based on it.
