Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mathematical Capabilities of ChatGPT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe subdatasets that make up our GHOSTS dataset are summarized in Table 1. In the following, we describe each subdataset in more detail. This subdataset consists of a collection of books    that are widely used in universities to teach upper undergraduate or first-year graduate courses in a degree in mathematics. We have used most of the exercises from these books’ first and second chapters, except for the book , where we only used exercises from the first chapter, which was longer than the other books’ chapters. This subdataset consists of a number of proofs sourced from math.stackexchange.com, a collection of books  , and the MATH dataset [ref]11, where parts of the proofs were intentionally deleted and the LLM was prompted to fill in the gaps: This was done either by (1) using a MISSING token, (2) finishing the proof early and prompting the LLM to complete it, or (3) explicitly asking for certain conditions or results. This subdataset consists of a selection of exercises from the book Problem-Solving Strategies , that is often used to prepare for mathematical competitions. We selected and graded the LLM outputs on one hundred exercises drawn from all chapters. This subdataset consists of random samples of integrals from the test set of . There are three ways in which integrals are generated in : Forward generation (FWD), Backward generation (BWD), and Backward generation with integration by parts (IBP). We sample 212121 integrals from FWD test set, 202020 integrals from the BWD test set, and 595959 integrals from the IBP test set.\nAs these integrals are given in Polish/prefix notation, a natural-language prompt conversion of them is unlikely to be witnessed in the training dataset of (Chat)GPT.\nThe assessment was done by verifying the correctness of the output both by using Mathematica, as well as making use of the provided solutions (in Polish notation), which  generated using SymPy.\nIn particular, we notice that all integrals in this dataset have solutions that can be expressed using elementary functions. This subdataset consists of a random sample of problems from the MATH dataset [ref]11.\nThe latter dataset attaches a level of difficulty to each problem.\nWe focused on two domains, Algebra and Probability Theory, and sampled an equal number of problems at each level of difficulty. This subdataset consists of problems that were not sampled from a particular source but generated by a human expert in the field. In the file Named Theorem Proof Completion, we focused on prompting the LLM to provide proof outlines of various theorems that are sufficiently well-known within Functional Analysis to have names. In the Definition Retrieval file, we asked the LLM to correctly state various definitions centered around Functional Analysis and Topology. In contrast, in the Reverse Definition Retrieval file, we verified whether the LLM was able to deduce the name of a mathematical object by describing its properties. Because input to (Chat)GPT is purely textual (at the time of writing), certain types of questions that might be stated and solved in a non-text-based fashion (e.g., questions involving graphical diagrams, without text explaining the diagram555See, e.g., Exercise 15 in [38, Chapter 2], which asked the reader to inspect a figure on which the problem is based., as occasionally occur in ), have been excluded. Our subdatasets can be categorized along the following dimensions (see Appendix B.1 for more details): Mathematical difficulty (ascending): (M1) Elementary arithmetic problems, (M2) Symbolic problems, (M3) (Under)graduate-level exercises, (M4) Mathematical olympiad problems. Question type: (Q1) Stating mathematical facts, (Q2) Overview-type review questions, (Q3) Computational questions, (Q4) Theorem proofs or puzzle solutions, (Q5) Proof-completion questions. Types of high out-of-distribution likelihood: (D1) Nontrivial problem encoding, (D2) Succinct solution, (D3) Spoken dialogue. The existing datasets of natural-language mathematics are far from covering all possible combinations across these dimensions. In our well-crafted GHOSTS datasets, we have striven to cover each of these aspects individually, as can be seen in Table 1. The next section specifies the format of our dataset and the methodology for analyzing (Chat)GPT’s output.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: the first chapter, which was longer than the other books’ chapters. This subdataset consists of a number of proofs sourced from math.stackexchange.com, a collection of books  , and the MATH dataset [ref]11, where parts of the proofs were intentionally deleted and the LLM was prompted to fill in the gaps: This was done either by (1) using a MISSING token, (2) finishing the proof early and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
