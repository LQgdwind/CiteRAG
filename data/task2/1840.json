      "content": "Paper Title: Risk-Conditioned Distributional Soft Actor-Critic for Risk-Sensitive Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep reinforcement learning (RL) is attracting considerable interest in the field of mobile-robot navigation, due to its promise of superior performance and robustness compared with classical planning-based algorithms [ref]1 [ref]2.\nDespite this interest, few existing works on deep-RL-based navigation attempt to design risk-averse policies.\nThis is surprising for several reasons.\nFirst, a navigating robot might cause harm to humans, to other robots, to itself or to its surroundings, and risk-averse policies may be safer than risk-neutral policies, while avoiding the over-conservative behaviour typical of policies based on worst-case analyses .\nSecond, in environments with such complex structure and dynamics that it is impractical to provide accurate models, policies optimizing certain risk measures are an appropriate choice, as they actually provide guarantees on robustness to modelling errors .\nThird, the end-users, insurers and designers of navigation agents are risk-averse humans , so risk-averse policies seem to be the natural choice. To address the issue of risk in RL, recent works [ref]6  have introduced the concept of distributional RL. Distributional RL learns the distribution of accumulated rewards, rather than just the mean of that distribution. By applying an appropriate risk measure, which is simply a mapping from this distribution of rewards to a real number, distributional RL algorithms can infer risk-averse or risk-seeking policies.\nDistributional RL\nhas\nshown superior sample efficiency and performance on arcade games , simulated robotics benchmarks  , and real-world grasping tasks .\nHowever, the theoretical basis for these excellent results is not understood , and it is not clear that these advantages would necessarily extend to navigation tasks. Moreover, one might prefer risk-averse policies in one environment, for instance to avoid scaring pedestrians, but such policies might be too risk-averse to pass through a narrow passage. So, one might need to train policies with different risk measures, suited to each environment, which would be computationally expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, to efficiently train an agent that can adapt to multiple risk measures, we present the risk-conditioned distributional soft actor-critic (RC-DSAC) algorithm which learns a wide range of risk-sensitive policies concurrently. In our experiments, RC-DSAC showed superior performance and safety compared with both non-distributional and distributional baselines. It could also adapt its policy to different risk measures without retraining. In summary, our main contributions are: A novel navigation algorithm based on distributional RL, that can learn a variety of risk-sensitive policies concurrently; Improved performance over baselines in multiple simulation environments; Generalization to a wide range of risk measures at run-time. The next section discusses related work. Subsequent sections, explain our method and present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: learning (RL) is attracting considerable interest in the field of mobile-robot navigation, due to its promise of superior performance and robustness compared with classical planning-based algorithms [ref]1 [ref]2.\nDespite this interest, few existing works on deep-RL-based navigation attempt to design risk-averse policies.\nThis is surprising for several reasons.\nFirst, a navigating robot might\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
