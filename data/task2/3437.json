User preference recommendation aims to predict the preferences for target users based on the observed user-item interactions   , which is a fundamental functionality among the current recommendation studies . Despite the efforts of traditional recommendation methods (e.g., collaborative-filtering-based methods  and content-based methods ), they cannot mine the hidden high-order relations between users and items, thus restricting their effectiveness of user preference prediction. To this end, researchers start devoting knowledge graph (KG) based recommendations  , which combines the user-item interactions with the side information of KG to improve the recommendation performance. Fig. 1 gives an example of movie recommendation on KG that consists of users, items, and entities, where items denote movies to be recommended and entities (e.g, actors, directors, and singers) are the side information provided by KG. In Fig. 1, there exists an interaction relation between the user u1subscript𝑢1u_{1} and the movie i1subscript𝑖1i_{1}, where i1subscript𝑖1i_{1} is acted by actor e1subscript𝑒1e_{1} and is directed by director e2subscript𝑒2e_{2}. Traditional recommendations only focus on the short-connectivity user-item relations such as u→risuperscript→𝑟𝑢𝑖u\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle r}}{{\\rightarrow}}i. That is, they only capture the low-order dependences for recommendations, e.g., only users who have watched the same movies (e.g., u1subscript𝑢1u_{1} and u2subscript𝑢2u_{2} watch i1subscript𝑖1i_{1}) tend to share similar preferences. Hence, the recommendation performance of traditional methods is limited. In contrast, the KG-based approaches are capable of discovering the long connectivity relations based on the side information hidden in KG, e.g., u1→ri1→de2→di3→ru4superscript→𝑟subscript𝑢1subscript𝑖1superscript→𝑑subscript𝑒2superscript→𝑑subscript𝑖3superscript→𝑟subscript𝑢4u_{1}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle r}}{{\\rightarrow}}i_{1}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{\\rightarrow}}e_{2}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{\\rightarrow}}i_{3}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle r}}{{\\rightarrow}}u_{4}. In that case, users u1subscript𝑢1u_{1} and u4subscript𝑢4u_{4} are also likely to share similar preferences even when they have not watched any same movies. Overall, the KG-based recommenders can fully exploit user-item interactions for better recommendation analytics. Despite their effectiveness, we argue that current KG-based methods only focus on improving the recommendation performance from the data level (i.e., leveraging knowledge associations to provide additional semantics beyond collaborative signals), which would inevitably experience a lack of information and poor performance in cold-start scenarios because of overfitting and popularity biases  . Take the movie recommendation in Fig. 1 as an example. If we want to recommend movies for user u4subscript𝑢4u_{4}, the recommendation results may be unsatisfied, as u4subscript𝑢4u_{4} is only interacted with movie i3subscript𝑖3i_{3}. Based on the long connectivity path u4→ri3→de2→di1superscript→𝑟subscript𝑢4subscript𝑖3superscript→𝑑subscript𝑒2superscript→𝑑subscript𝑖1u_{4}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle r}}{{\\rightarrow}}i_{3}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{\\rightarrow}}e_{2}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{\\rightarrow}}i_{1} and the popularity of movie i1subscript𝑖1i_{1} among existing users, the recommenders tend to recommend i1subscript𝑖1i_{1} as the interested movie for u4subscript𝑢4u_{4}. However, another possible recommendation path u4→ri3→de2→di4superscript→𝑟subscript𝑢4subscript𝑖3superscript→𝑑subscript𝑒2superscript→𝑑subscript𝑖4u_{4}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle r}}{{\\rightarrow}}i_{3}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{\\rightarrow}}e_{2}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle d}}{{\\rightarrow}}i_{4} is ignored due to insufficient interactions of movie i4subscript𝑖4i_{4}. Recently, the success of meta-learning sheds light on modeling tasks with scarce training samples  . Specifically, meta-learning aims to learn prior knowledge from different tasks, which can be further employed to accommodate new tasks even when there are few data samples. Inspired by meta-learning, if we treat the preference learning for each user as a single task, we can model the preference learning for different users as different tasks under the meta-learning settings. Thus, the designed meta learner can derive meta user-item interactions with strong generalization, which can be employed to deal with new tasks such as cold-start users or cold-start items. Although a few studies 6  utilized meta-learning for cold-start problems and have achieved promising performance, they are traditional methods without any KG information leverage. Specifically, they either consider the short connectivity relations among users and items  as discussed above, or rely on labor-intensive process to derive semantic facets . Consequently, they cannot generalize generic prior knowledge for fast and accurate recommendations. To tackle the cold-start problems on KG-based recommendation, for the first time, we propose a meta-learning approach considering both user-item and KG. Two challenges exist as follows. Challenge I: How to efficiently learn the user preference when evolving the cold-start issues?\nExisting KG-based recommendations highly rely on the massive user-item feedback, and thus, they\nsuffer from dramatic performance degradation when the user-item interactions are scarce  . This implies existing methods can not be directly adopted for our studied cold-start recommendations. Hence, it is necessary to redesign a learnable structure via meta-learning, which is able to capture the high-order meta collaborative information from limited user-item interactions. Challenge II: How to capture entities’ prior knowledge of KG to provide more accurate recommendation in cold-start scenarios? Existing KG-based methods demonstrate that the semantic embeddings of entities from KG are beneficial for recommendation analytics  . However, none of those methods consider how to derive meta entities’ knowledge with limited interactions. Thus, it is also challenging to make full use of the knowledge information (i.e., automatically learn strong generalizations for new users or new items) provided by KG under the meta-learning settings. To address the above two challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework on KG for cold-start recommendation, called MetaKG, which simultaneously learns the general knowledge from collaborative relations and entities. Specifically, we first define the collaborative knowledge graph (CKG) [ref]45, a hybrid structure of user-item interaction graph and knowledge graph, to represent the user behaviors and item knowledge in a unified way. Next, we design two novel meta learners to encode users’ potential interests and entities’ semantics from CKG, respectively.\nThe collaborative-aware meta learner is developed to encode collaborative signals by exploiting gradients of aggregation layer within each user preference learning task, which can automatically generalize high-order connectivities between users and items.\nThe knowledge-aware meta learner is further designed to capture the general knowledge semantics of KG by leveraging gradients of embedding and attention layers across tasks.\nIn other words, the collaborative-aware meta learner learns the user preference of each learning task to handle the first challenge, while the knowledge-aware meta learner shares general semantic knowledge over different learning tasks to tackle the second challenge.\nGuided with two meta learners, MetaKG can achieve good generalization across tasks, and enables fast adaptation to cold-start scenarios with superior effectiveness and efficiency. To sum up, this paper makes the following key contributions: Meta-learning on KG. We exploits meta-learning on KG-based recommendations, i.e., MetaKG, which achieves good generalization to alleviate the cold-start problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate meta-learning on KG-based recommendations. Novel meta learners. We design two meta learners, including collaborative-aware meta learner and knowledge-aware meta learner, to capture user preferences and knowledge associations. Thus, MetaKG can effectively capture the high-order collaborative relations and semantic representations with limited user-item interactions in cold-start scenarios. Adaptive task scheduler. To provide informative tasks for meta learners and to prevent the model from being corrupted by noisy tasks, we further propose an adaptive task scheduler for the meta learner training process that decides which task to use later by predicting the probability being sampled for each task, and the scheduler is jointly optimized with two meta learners for better generalization. Extensive experiments. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks while considering different cold-start scenarios. The results confirm that our proposed MetaKG substantially outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work, and Section 3 presents the background. Section 4 gives problem definitions. Section 5 details our framework and methods.
