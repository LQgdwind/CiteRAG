      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Sustainable Deep Learning for Multi-Label Classification on NILM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the analysis of the related work shows, the approaches to solving NILM involve either a two stage process in which first disaggregation is done that is followed by classification that performs automatic appliance identification or both, or a one stage process in which ON/OFF classification is done directly on aggregated data. In the last few years, several classic ML and DL methods have been proposed in this area. Classic ML algorithms utilized in reviewed work are Random k-labELset (RAkEL)   , factorial Hidden Markov Model (fHMM) , Random Forrest (RF)  [ref]27, Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC) , Classification And Regression Tree (CART) [ref]27, Extra Tree (ET) [ref]27, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) [ref]27 , Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) [ref]27 and Naïve Bayes (NB) [ref]27. The latest state-of-the-art approaches for NILM are based on DL algorithms, as shown in Table I. In the reviewed works, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)   [ref]24 and Recurrent CNNs (CRNN)    are the most common choice. However, a variety of other algorithms are also used, e.g. Adverserial Auto Encoders (AAE) , a custom archtecture TTRNet  and Spiking Neural Network (SNN) . Utilizing the fully supervised learning method, Wu et al. conducted an experiment to evaluate various classical machine learning algorithms for multi-label classification of NILM data for load identification. Their findings indicate that Random Forest (RF) outperforms other learning algorithms. Similarly, Rehmani et al. [ref]27 demonstrated that computationally intensive deep learning (DL) algorithms, such as CNN and RNN, were not required for their particular datasets, as already classical machine learning algorithms, such as kNN and RF, yielded accuracy of 99 %. However, openly available and well documented REFIT and UK-DALE datasets, recently used in many reference works as well as in this study, do not exhibit suitable performance with the classical machine learning and are used with DL models. To address the high computational complexity and carbon footprint associated with DL models, we designed a novel DL architecture based on the principles established in our previous work . Additionally, to ensure consistency with the latest research, we compared our approach to works by Langevin et al.  and Tanoni et al. , who also utilized the same datasets of REFIT and UK-DALE. Furthermore, we also considered the findings of Ahajjam et al. , who discovered that the optimal signal length varies across datasets, and hence, we adopted the same signal length as Tanoni et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: ML and DL methods have been proposed in this area.
