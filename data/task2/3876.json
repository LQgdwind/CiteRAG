      "content": "Paper Title: Episodic Memory Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImagine wearing a pair of AI-powered, augmented reality (AR) glasses and walking around your house. Such smart-glasses will possess the ability to “see” and passively capture egocentric visual data from the same perspective as its wearer, organize the surrounding visual information into its memory, and use this encoded information to communicate with humans by answering questions such as, “where did you last see my keys?”. In other words, such devices can act as our own personal egocentric AI assistants. There has been a rich history of prior work in training navigational agents to answer questions grounded in indoor environments – a task referred to as Embodied Question Answering (EQA) in literature   [ref]15 [ref]32. However, egocentric AI assistants differ from EQA agents in several important ways. First, such systems passively observe a sequence of egocentric visual frames as a result of the human wearer’s navigation, as opposed to taking actions in an environment. Second, AI systems for egocentric assistants would be required to build scene-specific memory representations that persist across different questions. This is in direct contrast with EQA where contemporary approaches have treated every question as a clean-slate navigation episode. EQA agents start navigating with no prior information about the scene (even if the current question is about a scene that they have witnessed before). And third, EQA agents respond to questions by uttering language token(s). Responding to a question such as, “where did you last see my keys?” with the answer — “hallway” isn’t a very helpful response if there are multiple hallways in the house. In contrast, our setup presents a scenario wherein an egocentric assistant can potentially localize answers by grounding them within the environment tour. Therefore, as a step towards realizing the goal of such egocentric AI assistants, we present a novel task wherein the AI assistant is taken on a guided tour of an indoor environment and then asked to localize its answers to post-hoc questions grounded in the environment tour (Fig. 1). This pre-exploratory tour presents an opportunity to build an internal, episodic memory of the scene. Once constructed, the AI assistant can utilize this scene memory to answer multiple, follow-up questions about the tour. We call this task – Episodic Memory Question Answering (EMQA). More concretely, in the proposed EMQA task, the system receives a pre-recorded sequence of RGB-D images with the corresponding oracle pose information (the guided agent tour) as an input. It uses the input tour to construct a memory representation of the indoor scene. Then, it exploits the scene memory to ground answers to multiple text questions. The localization of answers can happen either within the tour’s egocentric frame sequence or onto a top-down metric map (such as the house floorplan). The two output modalities are equivalent, given the agent pose. The paper makes several important contributions. First, we introduce the task of Episodic Memory Question Answering. We generate a dataset of questions grounded in pre-recorded agent tours that are designed to probe the system’s spatial understanding of the scene (”where did you see the cushion?”) as well as temporal reasoning abilities (“where did you first/last see the cushion?”). Second, we propose a model for the EMQA task that builds allocentric top-down semantic scene representations (the episodic scene memory) during the tour and leverages the same for answering follow-up questions. In order to build the episodic scene memory, our model combines the semantic features extracted from egocentric observations from the tour in a geometrically consistent manner into a single top-down feature map of the scene as witnessed during the tour [ref]5. Third, we extend existing scene memories that model spatial relationships among objects [ref]5 (“what” objects were observed and “where”) by augmenting them with temporal information (“when” were these objects observed), thereby making the memory amenable for reasoning about temporal localization questions. Fourth, we compare our choice of scene representation against a host of baselines and show that our proposed model outperforms language-only baselines by ∼150%similar-toabsentpercent150\\sim 150\\%, naive, “off-the-shelf” solutions to the task that rely on making frame-by-frame localization predictions by 37% as well as memory representations from prior work that aggregate (via averaging , GRU , context-conditioned attention ) buffers of observation features across the tour. Finally, in addition to photorealistic indoor environments , we also test the robustness of our approach under settings that have a high fidelity to the real world. We show qualitative results of a zero-shot transfer of our approach to a real-world, RGB-D dataset  that presents significantly challenging conditions of imperfect depth, pose and camera jitter - typical deployment conditions for egocentric AR assistants. In addition to that, we break away from the unrealistic assumption of the availability of oracle pose in indoor settings   and perform a systematic study of the impact of noise (of varying types and intensities) in the agent’s pose. We show that our model is more resilient than baselines to such noisy perturbations.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: has been a rich history of prior work in training navigational agents to answer questions grounded in indoor environments – a task referred to as Embodied Question Answering (EQA) in literature   [ref]15 [ref]32.
