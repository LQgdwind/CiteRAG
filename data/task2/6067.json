The concept is widely adopted as the standard solution concept for Stackelberg games and it provides an action guide for the leader.\nNevertheless, if the follower actually responds (even slightly) suboptimally to the leader, the quality of the leader’s SSE strategy may deteriorate substantially. Indeed, suboptimal responses of the follower are fairly common in practice for various reasons. There has been extensive literature on modeling suboptimal follower behaviors and addressing issues they cause. At a high level, these approaches can be divided into two different categories. The first is to explicitly model the follower’s suboptimal decision-making process and use probabilistic modeling to capture the distribution of the follower’s suboptimal actions. A prominent example, among many others, is the well-known quantal response (QR) model which softens the assumption of optimal follower response: it assumes that the follower selects every pure strategy with a probability positively related to the utility they offer  . The other category — which is what this paper falls into — uses worst-case analysis. Specifically, it avoids explicitly modeling the follower’s irrational behavior and instead considers the worst possible follower behavior, within some plausible ranges. The benefit of this approach, compared to probabilistic modeling such as the quantal response model, is that it requires much less prior knowledge about the follower. Different variants of this approach have been studied in the literature on Stackelberg games. For example,\nLetchford et al.  and Kiekintveld et al.  consider situations where the leader does not precisely know the follower’s utilities but only knows the intervals containing follower utilities. They study robust Stackelberg strategies that optimize against the worst-case follower utilities. Recent work by Kroer et al.  further extends this approach to extensive-form games under limited lookahead by the opponent. While also being about robust Stackelberg strategies, our proposed solution concept of robust Stackelberg equilibrium (RSE) relaxes the aforementioned robust studies by further reducing the required knowledge of follower behavior. Specifically, RSE simply assumes that the follower can take any suboptimal action whose utility is up to a small difference from the optimal one; the worst-case analysis is then adopted which assumes that the follower selects the worst response against the leader’s interest from these suboptimal actions.\nAs a result, optimal leader strategies obtained using this concept offer enhanced robustness against potentially suboptimal follower actions.\nNotably, the RSE solution concept does not make any specific assumptions about the underlying cause of the follower’s deviation from the perceived optimal actions — they may come from the leader’s inaccurate knowledge about the true follower utilities   , or the follower’s inability of exactly perceiving leader strategies [ref]4 , or the follower’s inability of finding an optimal response, or even a mixture of some of these factors [ref]38. These causes of deviation from optimality can all be viewed as some form of sub-optimal follower behavior. A concern one may have is that RSE will be more conservative (thus resulting in worse leader utility) than previous robust models with specified causes for sub-optimal follower actions. Fortunately, our results imply that the solution quality of RSE will gracefully improve until the best possible (i.e., the leader utility of SSE) as the level of the follower’s sub-optimality, regardless of which causes, decreases to 00. Despite its simplicity and power to capture a wide range of suboptimal behaviors, there appears to be a lack of thorough analysis in the literature for such a natural solution concept of robust Stackelberg equilibrium, regarding its properties as an equilibrium concept and its related algorithmic questions. For simultaneous move games, similar concepts of robust Nash equilibrium have indeed been proposed and thoroughly analyzed  . However, simultaneous-move games are quite different from Stackelberg games.\nFor Stackelberg games, most relevant to ours is perhaps an applied study of [ref]38 who proposed a mixed integer linear program for computing a subtle variant of our RSE solution in order to find robust leader strategies. However, the running time of their program is exponential in the worst case; moreover, as we will elaborate in Section 3, the RSE variant they considered may not always exist. Many fundamental questions still remain: how to define the equilibrium concept so that it always exists? If exists, what is the computational complexity of finding the RSE? Are there provably sub-exponential algorithms for computing the RSE? What are the connections between RSE and other equilibrium concepts? These are the questions we aim to answer in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: from the perceived optimal actions — they may come from the leader’s inaccurate knowledge about the true follower utilities   , or the follower’s inability of exactly perceiving leader strategies [ref]4 , or the follower’s inability of finding an optimal response, or even a mixture of some of these factors [ref]38.
