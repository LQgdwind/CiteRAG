      "content": "Paper Title: SyntheWorld: A Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset for Land Cover Mapping and Building Change Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTab. 11 presents the F1 scores of the FC-siam-Diff [ref]10 model on three building change detection benchmark datasets: LEVIR-CD+ [ref]5, SECOND , and WHU-CD . The table compares the results of the model when run without (w / o) and with (w / o) SyntheWorld, which is not present in the main paper. We follow a mixed training approach, maintaining a ratio of 7: 1 for real to synthetic images. We use the Adam  optimizer, setting the learning rate at 1e-3. Each experiment is conducted over 100 epochs and is executed on a Tesla A100 GPU. Specifically, for the LEVIR-CD+ dataset, the model scored an F1 of 0.751 without SyntheWorld and improved to 0.766 with SyntheWorld. On the SECOND dataset, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.614 without SyntheWorld, and this score increased to 0.677 when SyntheWorld was used. Lastly, on the WHU-CD dataset, the F1 score of the FC-siam-Diff model was 0.812 without SyntheWorld and reached 0.840 with the use of SyntheWorld. In all three cases, the use of SyntheWorld improved F1 scores, showing that it had a positive impact on the performance of the FC-siam-Diff [ref]10 model when incorporating SyntheWorld. We also include three tables that detail the results of the same experiment set, i.e. training data is scarce, performed using the FC-siam-Diff [ref]10, ChangeFormer , and STANet [ref]5 models. Tab. 12 shows the performance of the FC-siam-Diff model when trained with different fractions of the real-world training set, both with and without SyntheWorld. Consistently, across all real-world datasets and at every percentage level, the incorporation of SyntheWorld boosts the model’s performance. Similar results are presented in  Tab. 13 and  Tab. 14, which correspond to the ChangeFormer and STANet models, respectively. Again, in each case, the addition of SyntheWorld consistently enhances the model’s performance across all datasets and at each level of real-world training data usage. These results corroborate the main finding reported in the paper, reinforcing that the SyntheWorld dataset invariably provides a significant performance boost, particularly when the amount of real training data is limited. This beneficial effect is observed not only in the DTCDSCN 2 model, but also in the FC-siam-Diff, ChangeFormer, and STANet models. As demonstrated in Tables 15, 16, and 17, we have conducted comprehensive experiments with the DTCDSCN and FC-siam-Diff models, training them on two synthetic datasets, AICD  and SyntheWorld, and subsequently testing these models on three real-world datasets. In the training phase with the synthetic datasets, we utilized the Adam optimizer and set the learning rate to 5e-4. A notable observation is that synthetic data-trained models typically achieved their best performance within fewer than 50 epochs. In order to draw a meaningful comparison, Oracle experiments were also performed, in which the models were trained directly on real-world datasets. In these instances, we adopted a higher learning rate of 1e-3 and found that the models reached their optimal performance approximately around the 100 epoch mark. The experiments underscored a clear trend: regardless of the real-world dataset used for testing, the models trained on the SyntheWorld dataset consistently outperformed the ones trained on the AICD dataset. Moreover, the performance of SyntheWorld-trained models, while not matching the models trained directly on the real-world datasets, came close enough to indicate a significant value of the synthetic dataset in training effective change detection models. Further support for the effectiveness of the SyntheWorld dataset can be found in Fig. 15, which provides a visual comparison of model performance when trained with different datasets using different models. This highlights the immense potential of the SyntheWorld dataset for building change detection. The ability of SyntheWorld to close the gap between synthetic and real-world data to an acceptable margin is an encouraging sign. It signifies that we could significantly reduce our reliance on large volumes of real-world data for training effective change detection models.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Tab. 11 presents the F1 scores of the FC-siam-Diff [ref]10 model on three building change detection benchmark datasets: LEVIR-CD+ [ref]5, SECOND , and WHU-CD .
