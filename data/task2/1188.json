      "content": "Paper Title: Action Duration Prediction for Segment-Level Alignment of Weakly-Labeled Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show results on two popular weakly-supervised action alignment datasets based on three different metrics. We compare our method with several existing methods under different initialization schemes. Further, the contribution of each component of our model is quantitatively and qualitatively justified. Datasets. 1) The Breakfast Dataset (BD)¬†[ref]16 consists of around 1.7k untrimmed instructional videos of few seconds to over ten minutes long. There are 48 action labels demonstrating 10 breakfast recipes with a mean of 4.9 instances per video. The overall duration of the dataset is 66.7h, and the evaluation metrics are conventionally calculated over four splits. 2) The Hollywood Extended Dataset (HED)¬†[ref]3 has 937 videos of 17 actions with an average of 2.5 non-background action instances per video. There are in total 0.8M frames of Hollywood movies and, following¬†[ref]3, we split the data into 10 splits for evaluation. There are four main differences between these two datasets: i) Actions in the BD follow an expected scenario and context in each video. However, the relation between consecutive actions in the HED can be random. ii) Camera in the BD is fixed while there are scene cuts in the HED, making the duration prediction more challenging. iii) Background frames are over half of the total frames in the HED, while the percentage of them in the BD is about 10%, and iv) The inter-class duration variability in the BD is considerably higher than the HED. Metrics.\nWe use three metrics to evaluate performance: 1) acc is the frame-level accuracy averaged over all the videos. 2) acc-bg is the frame-level accuracy without the background frames. This is specifically useful for cases where the background frames are dominant as in the HED. 3) IoU defined as the intersection over union averaged across all videos. This metric is more robust to action label imbalance and is calculated over non-background segments. Implementation. For a fair comparison, we obtained the pre-computed 64 dimensional features of previous work¬†  , computed using improved dense trajectories¬† and Fisher vectors¬†, as described in¬†.\nA single layer bi-directional LSTM with 64 hidden units is shared between the DurNet and VSNet, and a single layer LSTM with 64 hidden units for the OSNet. We followed the same frame sampling as ¬†, ¬†[ref]8 or¬†, depending on the method we use for initialization. We use the cross-entropy loss function for all networks, using Adam optimization¬†, learning rate of 10‚àí5superscript10510^{-5} and batch size of 64. LùêøL in the DurNet was set to 7 and 4 for the BD and HED respectively. In our experiments on the BD, we used an a‚Äãl‚Äãp‚Äãh‚Äãaùëéùëôùëù‚Ñéùëéalpha of 60 frames and Œ∂ùúÅ\\zeta, Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta, and ŒªùúÜ\\lambda were adjusted to 1, 30, and 5 respectively for our selector network. Beam size in our beam search was set to 150 and other hyperparameters were picked after grid search optimization (refer to supplementary material). Training Strategy.\nDuring training, alignment results of a baseline weakly-supervised method, e.g. CDFL¬†, NNViterbi¬† or TCFPN¬†[ref]8, on the training data is used as the initial pseudo-ground truth. We also adopt the pre-trained frame-level action classifier (visual model) of the baseline (CDFL, NNViterbi or TCFPN) as our main action selector component. The initial pseudo-ground truth is used to train our duration and action selector networks. Then, new alignments are generated through the proposed Segment-Level Beam Search algorithm on the training videos. We call these new alignments the ‚Äúnew pseudo-ground truth‚Äù. The adopted visual model is finally retrained based on our ‚Äúnew pseudo-ground truth‚Äù, and used alongside our other components to align the test videos.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: methods under different initialization schemes.
