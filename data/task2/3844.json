      "content": "Paper Title: Model Selection, Adaptation, and Combination for Transfer Learning in Wind and Photovoltaic Power Forecasts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the extension of volatile energy resources, such as wind and¬†photovoltaic (PV) parks, one fundamental problem is adding new parks to an operator‚Äôs portfolio.\nThe historical data for such a new (target) park is often limited.\nAt the same time, reliable forecasts are fundamental to assure grid stability due to the weather dependency.\nHowever, typically there are numerous pre-trained models from existing parks that we can utilize for such a forecasting task¬†.\nUtilizing those pre-trained source models often increases the forecast accuracy, reduces the computational effort, and reduces the carbon emission for training a new model¬† [ref]3.\nNow, the question arises what is the best way to use of this model hub of pre-trained models.\nThe field of research¬†inductive transfer learning (ITL) provides methods for this problem¬†[ref]4. Fig.¬†1a summarizes our proposed strategy.\nThe first step is to select an appropriate source model.\nRecently,¬†[ref]4  showed that selecting an appropriate source model for knowledge transfer for a target substantially influences the test error for computer vision tasks.\nTo select a source model, consider, e.g., we have two source tasks \\task1subscript\\task1\\task_{1} and \\task2subscript\\task2\\task_{2} of a wind park with model parameters \\parametersLinModel1subscript\\parametersLinModel1\\parametersLinModel_{1} and \\parametersLinModel2subscript\\parametersLinModel2\\parametersLinModel_{2}.\nThese models have a set of input observations \\setInputFeatures1subscript\\setInputFeatures1\\setInputFeatures_{1} and \\setInputFeatures2subscript\\setInputFeatures2\\setInputFeatures_{2} as well as the sets of response values \\setOutputFeatures1subscript\\setOutputFeatures1\\setOutputFeatures_{1} and \\setOutputFeatures2subscript\\setOutputFeatures2\\setOutputFeatures_{2}.\nBased on this information, we want to select one of the models for knowledge transfer for a target task \\taskTsubscript\\taskùëá\\task_{T} with parameters \\parametersLinModelTsubscript\\parametersLinModelùëá\\parametersLinModel_{T} and its respective sets \\setInputFeaturesTsubscript\\setInputFeaturesùëá\\setInputFeatures_{T} and \\setOutputFeaturesTsubscript\\setOutputFeaturesùëá\\setOutputFeatures_{T}. The diagram in¬†Fig.¬†1b visualizes this problem for wind power forecasts.\nIn renewable power forecasts, we utilize weather forecasts, such as the wind speed or radiation, from a so called¬†numerical weather prediction (NWP) model.\nThese predicted weather features are the input \\setInputFeatures\\setInputFeatures\\setInputFeatures to machine learning (ML) models, with parameters \\parametersLinModel\\parametersLinModel\\parametersLinModel, predicting the expected power generation ùîº‚Äã[p‚Äã(\\setOutputFeatures|\\setInputFeatures,\\parametersLinModel)]ùîºdelimited-[]ùëùconditional\\setOutputFeatures\\setInputFeatures\\parametersLinModel\\mathbb{E}[p(\\setOutputFeatures|\\setInputFeatures,\\parametersLinModel)] in a day-ahead forecasting task between 242424 and 484848 hours into the future.\nIn the diagram, we can observe that the similarity \\similarityMeasure\\similarityMeasure\\similarityMeasure depends on the relation between the input feature wind and the power generated by a wind park, i.e., for different wind speeds and models, we expect a different power generation. Once a model is selected, the second step adapts the source knowledge with the limited target data with an¬†adaptation strategy.\nOften this adaptation strategy is fine-tuning the final layer of a neural network.\nOnly with such an adaptation can we make reliable and task-specific power forecasts for a new target task of a new park with limited data.\nTo the best of our knowledge, different adaptation and selection strategies have been so far not considered for¬†ITL in the field of renewable power forecasts.\nWe close this gap with this article.\nSelecting and adapting a single source model from a model hub has the disadvantage of neglecting knowledge from other source tasks that are potentially beneficial.\nHowever, we can additionally combine models through ensemble techniques.\nCombining knowledge can be seen as a mixture of selection, where more relevant models are weighted higher, and adaptation, where source models are weighted to fit the target.\nSince¬†ITL has been insufficiently studied so far for renewable power forecasts¬†, especially for day-ahead forecast horizons between 242424 and 484848 hours into the future, we answer the following research questions: What is an appropriate similarity measure for model selection for a new target park from a model hub with pre-trained models? What is the best adaptation strategy once a model is selected? Compared to selecting and adapting a single model, are ensemble strategies beneficial for combining knowledge? To answer those research questions, we train a¬†Bayesian extreme learning machine (BELM), a¬†multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and a¬†temporal convolution network (TCN) as source models on six datasets including 667667667 distinct parks.\nWe consider the¬†gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) as a baseline¬†that outperforms physical models even with limited target data¬†[ref]7. Based on these datasets and source models, our main contributions to answering the research questions can be summarized as follows:\nFirst, we propose the¬†normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE), due to its strong correlation with the forecasting error, as well as the marginal likelihood or evidence as a¬†selection strategy for question one.\nTherefore, we replace the last layer of a neural network with a¬†Bayesian linear regression (BLR), as proposed in¬†[ref]4 for computer vision tasks.\nSecond, we propose to utilize the¬†BLR as a model to¬†adapt a source model to the target and answer question two.\nTo ensure that we find the best adaption strategy, we directly apply a source model on the target and consider the state-of-the-art such as weight decay as well as Bayesian tuning¬†[ref]4.\nConsidering the two selection strategies, we evaluate 181818 combinations making it the most extensive evaluation for¬†transfer learning (TL) in renewable power forecasts.\nThird, due to the¬†BLR as the output layer, we propose¬†combining multiple source models through¬†Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to answer question three.\nFinally, we propose the¬†coopetitive soft gating ensemble (CSGE) as ensemble technique for¬†ITL.\nThe source code is open accessible111https://github.com/scribbler00/DEELEA, accessed 2022-07-15. The remainder of this article is structured as follows.\n¬†Section¬†2 describes related work.\nThe following¬†¬†Section¬†3 introduces relevant definitions and details the proposed approach.\nWe describe the datasets and discuss the experiment‚Äôs most essential findings in¬†Section¬†4.\nIn the final¬†Section¬†5, we summarize our work and provide insights for future work.\n\\listofsymbols\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: such a forecasting task¬†.\nUtilizing those pre-trained source models often increases the forecast accuracy, reduces the computational effort, and reduces the carbon emission for training a new model¬† [ref]3.\nNow, the question arises what is the best way to use of this model hub of pre-trained models.\nThe field of research¬†inductive transfer learning (ITL) provides methods for this problem¬†[ref]4.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
