We explain the details of these algorithms and show the code resources in Appendix¬†D. Value-based Methods To enhance the expressive power of QMIX, Qatten  introduces an attention mechanism to enhance the expression of QMIX; QPLEX  transfers the monotonicity constraint from Q values to Advantage values ; QTRAN++  and WQMIX [ref]21 further relax the monotonicity constraint through a true value network and some theoretical constraints; however, Value-Decomposition Networks (VDNs)¬† only requires a linear decomposition where Qt‚Äão‚Äãt=‚àëiNQisubscriptùëÑùë°ùëúùë°superscriptsubscriptùëñùëÅsubscriptùëÑùëñQ_{tot}=\\sum_{i}^{N}Q_{i}, which can be seen as strengthening the monotonicity constraint. Policy-based Methods LICA [ref]39 completely removes the monotonicity constraint through a policy mixing critic. For other MARL policy-based methods, VMIX¬† combines the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)  with QMIX to extend the monotonicity constraint to value networks, i.e., replacing the value network (not Q value network) with the monotonic mixing network. DOP [ref]33 learns the policy networks using the Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA)  with the QisubscriptùëÑùëñQ_{i} decomposed by QMIX. At last, we briefly describe the properties of these algorithms in Table 2. All these algorithms show that their performance exceeds QMIX in SMAC, yet we find that they do not consider the impact of various code-level optimizations (Appendix A) in the implementations.  Moreover, the performance of these algorithms is not even consistent in these papers. For example, in papers  and [ref]33, QPLEX and DOP outperform QMIX, while in paper , both QPLEX and DOP underperform QMIX.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: power of QMIX, Qatten  introduces an attention mechanism to enhance the expression of QMIX; QPLEX  transfers the monotonicity constraint from Q values to Advantage values ; QTRAN++  and WQMIX [ref]21 further relax the monotonicity constraint through a true value network and some theoretical constraints; however, Value-Decomposition Networks (VDNs)¬† only requires a linear decomposition\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
