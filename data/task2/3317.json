      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph-based Methodology for the Sensorless Estimation of Road Traffic Profiles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a subset of Machine Learning, deep learning [ref]25 has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to the impressive results obtained in several fields such as natural language processing  or computer vision . The excellent modeling capabilities of deep learning architectures expanded the competence of multiple research fields, though these improvements were temporally constrained to Euclidean data (i.e., data that can be expressed in a m𝑚m-dimensional Euclidean space) . Traffic forecasting is a problem that can be formulated in an Euclidean space. Traffic flow, speed or travel time are usually expressed as time series. A forecasting model receives as input the traffic state at times {t−n,…,t}𝑡𝑛…𝑡\\{t-n,\\dots,t\\} and outputs the expected traffic state at t+h𝑡ℎt+h, where t𝑡t is the current time instant, n𝑛n represents a time window of past traffic values, and hℎh is the forecasting horizon. The superior modeling capabilities of deep learning made authors concentrate their research efforts on solving traffic forecasting problems with this family of learning models. Different deep learning architectures have been proposed over the last years: from basic convolutional and recurrent networks to more complex and deep architectures such as those based on the attention mechanism [ref]29 (a more comprehensive analysis of related efforts to date is provided in [ref]3). State-of-the-art architectures from other fields were applied to traffic forecasting, expecting similar levels of predictive performance. However, as demonstrated in [ref]3, deep learning architectures do not necessarily outperform conventional machine learning methods (e.g. ensemble learning). The traffic state at previous instants {t−n,…,t}𝑡𝑛…𝑡\\{t-n,\\dots,t\\} contains enough valuable information given the high persistence of the traffic time series to be predicted. Even a naïve model where the latest recorded traffic state value serves as the predicted traffic value can be shown to yield a sufficiently good forecast for low values of the horizon hℎh. In summary, the feature learning capability of deep learning models is not differential for this specific application scenario, and poses further problems such as the interpretability of the knowledge captured by such black-box models once they have learned to forecast traffic . It was not until the upsurge of geometric deep learning  when multiple techniques arose towards developing new applications concerning non-Euclidean data: those tasks where data can be described as a graph  or as a manifold .\nAs for the subject of this manuscript, traffic networks can be easily defined as graphs, where the road segments are the edges, and the crossroads are the nodes (although some authors prefer the opposite representation). This way, an abstraction of the traffic network can be defined as a graph 𝒢=(𝒱,ℰ,A)𝒢𝒱ℰA\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E},\\textbf{A}), where 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} is a set of N𝑁N nodes representing the junction of road segments, ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} is a set of edges symbolizing those road segments, and A is a binary adjacency matrix in which element a​i,j𝑎i,ja\\textsubscript{i,j} represents the reachability between nodes i𝑖i and j𝑗j of the traffic network: node j𝑗j can be reached from node i𝑖i if a​i,j=1𝑎i,j1a\\textsubscript{i,j}=1. Bearing the above definitions in mind, graph neural networks (GNNs) are a type of deep learning architecture that is specifically designed to exploit the information represented by graph data structures . From the development of novel GNNs, researchers achieved to apply this technology towards traffic forecasting , as the traffic state (e.g., flow or mean speed) can be easily encapsulated as node features. This way, each node of the graph has a collection of features, composed by its traffic state of previous time instants. According to the reachability defined by A, the GNN can perform operations with not only the traffic features of one node but also merging the information of its neighbor nodes. Given the ability of graph representations to condense the characteristics of a road network into a non-Euclidean space, the surroundings of a road segment should be able to be expressed as a collection of graph-based features that conforms to intuition and domain knowledge about behavioral patterns of traffic flows in urban networks with different topologies. For this reason, the road segment similarity finding method proposed in this work is based on features distilled from a graph representation which is intended to portray the topology and context of the neighboring.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: As a subset of Machine Learning, deep learning [ref]25 has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to the impressive results obtained in several fields such as natural language processing  or computer vision .
