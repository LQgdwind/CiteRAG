      "content": "Paper Title: Point Cloud Based Reinforcement Learning for Sim-to-Real and Partial Observability in Visual Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is a Machine Learning paradigm used to solve problems modeled as Markov Decision Process (MDP), which has presented important achievements in several areas, being board games , videogames [ref]2 and robotic tasks  among the most common ones. As most complex robotic tasks (e.g., locomotion, navigation, manipulation, etc.) have a sequential nature and are difficult to model, RL becomes highly convenient, as it provides a framework which focuses on the desired behavior of the agent (i.e., reward function) rather than its implementation (i.e., explicit design of the policy), by learning a policy through interactions with the environment. However, several difficulties limit the widespread use of RL and other learned-based methods in robots. Since RL approaches require an enormous amount of data/interactions for training, and the nature of RL is based on learning from previous mistakes, implementing the training procedure in the robot is impractical as it is both time-consuming and dangerous (or costly). For these reasons, most successful RL applications for robots rely on training policies on simulators and then deploying them on real robots (Figure 1 shows examples of simulated and real environments). Doing so, however, rises a new problem. Since the environment in which the policy is evaluated is different from the environment it was trained on, and due to the sequential nature of MDPs, policy trajectories differ considerably, and in many cases, renders the policies useless. This is a classic problem that is usually referred to as sim-to-real transfer or more generally as the reality gap, and it has been intensively addressed by different approaches. Some examples are: matching train/evaluation distributions [ref]4, [ref]5, , trying to consider random dynamics , and using some small real-world set of interactions to either adapt or retrain policies on the real robot . On another note, the most successful applications of RL involve tasks that are known to be fully observable , [ref]2. Since RL considers MDPs, when observations are used instead of states, performance is strongly affected. A common approach to address this issue is to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to integrate temporal information. While this approach attains good results in many tasks, it still has many limitations, including handling long sequences. To address these, external memories have been proposed , 0, 1. Although their use as observations is direct, they are usually task-specific (e.g., maps for navigation), may require information that is usually not available at evaluation time (e.g., ground-truth information), and are non-differentiable, so they can not be learned end-to-end. While previous attempts to address sim-to-real transfer and partial observability have achieved varying levels of success, current state-of-the-art methods are not enough to seamlessly transfer policies trained in simulators to the real world. To achieve this goal, our main proposal is based on the use of point clouds to represent the state-space, instead of the most commonly used RGB or RGBD images in robotic tasks, whenever applicable. The reasoning behind this is that point clouds projected in the cartesian space become highly independent of the robots and its sensors, making it a canonical space suited for learning representations capable of sim-to-real transfers. Additionally, the nature of point clouds allows us to address up to some extent the partial observability problem, as we can explicitly exploit previous information by integrating it into the representation. To test out these hypotheses, we consider a visual navigation task as our case of study, as it features a high-dimensional observation space, requires long temporal sequences, and has been intensively used as a testbed for sim-to-real approaches in the past 2, [ref]5, [ref]4, 3. Our experiments indicate that in simple settings, our approach achieves similar performance to the baselines, yet in more realistic conditions our method considerably outperforms the image-based baseline in all configurations. It is highly unaffected by unseen robot configurations (robot-to-robot transfers) whereas the baseline fails completely, presents higher performances when environment randomization is used during training, and obtains a better sim-to-sim capability. Finally, during real-world experiments, only the proposed method attains satisfactory results with an out-of-the-box configuration, validating its sim-to-real performance. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we propose a method to achieve out-of-the-box sim-to-real, and validate it with real-world experiments, 2) we provide a strategy to explicitly address the limited observability proper of robotic tasks. 3) we present a point cloud network design that extracts multi-scale features, designed for its use with the large batch sizes used in recent popular RL algorithms, while taking into account the limitations of current GPUs.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: (RL) is a Machine Learning paradigm used to solve problems modeled as Markov Decision Process (MDP), which has presented important achievements in several areas, being board games , videogames [ref]2 and robotic tasks  among the most common ones.
