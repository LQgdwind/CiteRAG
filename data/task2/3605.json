      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Generate Synthetic Training Data using Gradient Matching and Implicit Differentiation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe neural architecture search (NAS) is one of the most promising areas for distillation and it is important to note that the time spent on distillation should be added to the time spent on the NAS, this idea was also mentioned in review444https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJg_ECEKDr of¬†. So, in this section, we check the performance of all known distillation methods. We think that it is fair to distill the data by all methods for the same limited time. We have chosen a time limit of ‚âà15absent15\\approx 15 minutes, and it is based on common sense and NAS time spent in similar experiments¬†[ref]3. Note that this limit may not be accurate, as distillation takes an integer number of steps, and each step may take slightly different times. To check the performance we use the following scheme. First we train teacher ŒªùúÜ\\lambda with three restarts. The number of steps is determined by the time limit indicated above. Then, to get the final results we train five randomly initialized students Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta for each of the three teachers. Each student‚Äôs training takes 1000 optimization steps. In our work we use the MNIST¬† benchmark and make the same preparations as in¬†. We extract part of the training data for validation (10 thousands of images) and use it to get the best teacher hyperparameters. We use |‚Ñ¨ùíØ|=256superscript‚Ñ¨ùíØ256|\\mathcal{B^{T}}|=256 batch size of training data. For most of our experiments we use ConvNet¬†9 as a student. As student‚Äôs optimizer we use SGD with momentum with the same parameters as suggested in¬†[ref]3. We use the same teacher optimizers as in the original papers¬†,¬†[ref]3,¬†. The volume of synthetic data can be controlled by ipc (images per class) parameter. For each table in this paper, the largest numbers in the column are shown in bold. Table¬†I shows mean and standard deviation of test accuracy, reached by students trained on distilled data. Note that there is only one difference from previous works, we use time limit for each distillation procedure, so there is degradation in performance. For this experiment, we use K=1000,N=10formulae-sequenceùêæ1000ùëÅ10K=1000,N=10 as default hyperparameters values. To check the memory consumption we use a special tool555https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cuda.html#torch.cuda.max_memory_reserved, which can measure the GPU memory usage. Note that using of the unroll distillation procedure consumes the most memory. The second column shows the number of teacher parameters, and although GTN (k=64ùëò64k=64) is twice as large as DD, there is not much difference in memory usage.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: to distill the data by all methods for the same limited time.
