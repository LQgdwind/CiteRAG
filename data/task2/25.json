      "content": "Paper Title: Smart Data driven Decision Trees Ensemble Methodology for Imbalanced Big Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn a binary classification problem, a dataset is said to be imbalanced when there is a notable difference in the number of instances belonging to different classes . The class with the larger number of instances is known as the majority class. Similarly, the class with the lower number of instances is known as the minority class, and usually contains the concept of interest. As stated earlier, this problem poses a major challenge to standard classifier learning algorithms, since they will bias towards the class with the greater representation, as their internal search process is guided by a global search measure weighted in favor of accuracy . In datasets with high imbalance ratio (IR), classifiers that maximize the accuracy will treat the minority class as noise and ignore it, achieving a high accuracy by only classifying the majority class, since more general rules will be preferred. Many techniques have been proposed to tackle imbalanced data classification. However, ensembles have established themselves as the state-of-the-art in performance   [ref]16. Because of their accuracy orientation, ensembles cannot be directly applied to imbalanced datasets, since the base classifiers will ignore the minority class. Their combination with other techniques that tackle the class imbalance problem can improve ensemble performance in these scenarios. These hybrid approaches involve the addition of a data sampling step that allows the classifier to better detect the different classes. In the literature, data preprocessing methods for imbalanced data classification can be divided into different categories: oversampling methods, undersampling methods, and hybrid approaches  . The former (such as ROS ) replicates the minority class instances until a certain balance is reached. On the other hand, undersampling techniques (such as RUS ) remove examples from the majority class until the proportion of classes is adjusted. Hybrid approaches combine the previous two techniques, usually starting with an oversampling of the data, followed by an undersampling step that removes samples from both classes, in order to remove noisy instances and improve the classifier performance. The SMOTE algorithm, along with its many extensions  , constitute the current state-of-the-art in data preprocessing for imbalanced data. It adds synthetic instances from the minority class until the class distribution is balanced. Those new instances are created by the interpolation of several minority class instances that belong to the same neighborhood. SMOTE calculates the k nearest neighbors of each minority class example. Then, in the segment that connects every instance with its k closest neighbors, a synthetic instance is randomly created . Clustering has also been employed effectively for the data imbalanced problem as a way to increase the density of points belonging to certain neighborhoods  . These methods balance the data by localizing groups of instances belonging to different neighborhoods, and then applying a data sampling technique, improving the later learning process  . Performance evaluation is a key factor for assessing the classification performance. In binary classification problems, the confusion matrix (shown in Table 1) collects correctly and incorrectly classified examples from both classes. Traditionally, accuracy (Equation 1) has been the most extended and widely used metric for assessing classification performance. However, accuracy is not a valid metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets, since it will not show the classification of both classes, only the majority class, and it will led to wrong conclusions. The Geometric Mean (GM), described in Equation 2, attempts to maximize the accuracy of both minority and majority classes at the same time . The accuracy of both minority and majority classes is represented by the True Positive Rate (TPR) =T​PT​P+F​Nabsent𝑇𝑃𝑇𝑃𝐹𝑁=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN} and True Negative Rate (TNR) =T​NT​N+F​Pabsent𝑇𝑁𝑇𝑁𝐹𝑃=\\frac{TN}{TN+FP}. Another popular evaluation metric for imbalanced data is the Are Under the Curve (AUC) . AUC combines the classification performance of both classes, showing the trade-off between the TPR and False Positive Rate. This metric provides a single measure of a classifier performance, compared against a random classifier.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: general rules will be preferred.
