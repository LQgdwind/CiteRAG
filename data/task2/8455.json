      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement learning-enhanced genetic algorithm for wind farm layout optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, the Jensen wake model  is used, which assumes a uniform velocity profile behind the rotor with linear wake expansion due to energy entrainment.\nThe schematic and velocity contours of the Jensen single wake model is shown in Fig. 1.\nHere, U𝑈U is the free-stream wind velocity, U1subscript𝑈1U_{1} denotes the wake wind speed immediately behind the turbine, r1subscript𝑟1r_{1} is the initial wake radius, and rwsubscript𝑟𝑤r_{w} and Uwsubscript𝑈𝑤U_{w} represent the wake radius and wake velocity, respectively, at a downwind distance x𝑥x. According to the law of momentum conservation, the wake radius (rwsubscript𝑟𝑤r_{w}) expands linearly with downwind distance (x𝑥x) , such that rw=r1+αe​xsubscript𝑟𝑤subscript𝑟1subscript𝛼𝑒𝑥r_{w}=r_{1}+\\alpha_{e}x. Here, αesubscript𝛼𝑒\\alpha_{e} is the entrainment constant, defined as: where zhsubscript𝑧ℎz_{h} is the hub height and z0subscript𝑧0z_{0} is the surface roughness length. According to the deviation of the Jensen wake model shown in the appendix, the Jensen single wake model can be written as: where Δ​U=U−UwΔ𝑈𝑈subscript𝑈𝑤\\Delta U=U-U_{w}. Note that the Jensen model employed in this work is the same as that used by Frandsen , differing from the original Jensen wake model   in the calculation of the entrainment constant α𝛼\\alpha and the initial wake radius r1subscript𝑟1r_{1}. To account for the impact of wakes from upwind turbines on velocity deficit, the quadratic sum method , which assumes the conservation of the mean kinetic energy deficit during wake interaction, is employed. Thus, the wind speed Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} at turbine i𝑖i is determined as follows: where Ui​jsubscript𝑈𝑖𝑗U_{ij} represents the wind speed at turbine i𝑖i influenced by the wake from turbine j𝑗j, with the summation encompassing the n𝑛n turbines located upwind of turbine i𝑖i. Various wake superposition methods can be applied, and comprehensive reviews of these methods are available in Refs.  . Besides, when the downstream turbine is only partially within the wake, the wake deficit should be scaled according to the fraction of the rotor area ,denoted as Awsubscript𝐴𝑤A_{w}, that lies within the upstream turbine’s wake .\nThen, the effect of the corresponding deficit must be reduced as: Fig. 2 illustrates the schematic of wake interference between an upwind turbine j𝑗j, and a downwind turbine i𝑖i, which is similar to the previous studies  [ref]47. In the figure, rwsubscript𝑟𝑤r_{w} represents the radius of the wake from the jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} turbine as it reaches the it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} turbine, and Awsubscript𝐴𝑤A_{w} denotes the overlapped area between the jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} turbine’s wake and the rotor of the downwind turbine. Then Awsubscript𝐴𝑤A_{w} can be calculated as: Here d1=rw2+d2−r22​d,d2=d−d1,θ1=2​cos−1​d1rw,θ2=2​cos−1​d2rformulae-sequencesubscript𝑑1superscriptsubscript𝑟𝑤2superscript𝑑2superscript𝑟22𝑑formulae-sequencesubscript𝑑2𝑑subscript𝑑1formulae-sequencesubscript𝜃12superscriptcos1subscript𝑑1subscript𝑟𝑤subscript𝜃22superscriptcos1subscript𝑑2𝑟d_{1}=\\frac{r_{w}^{2}+d^{2}-r^{2}}{2d},\\,d_{2}=d-d_{1},\\,\\theta_{1}=2\\text{cos}^{-1}\\frac{d_{1}}{r_{w}},\\,\\theta_{2}=2\\text{cos}^{-1}\\frac{d_{2}}{r}. In the present WFLO problem, three different wind conditions blowing from different directions are considered. To accurately calculate the velocity deficit factor for turbine i𝑖i under the influence of multiple wakes, it is essential to have precise information regarding the relative distances between turbines aligns with the wind direction θ𝜃\\theta.\nConsider the scenario in which turbine i𝑖i is located within the wake of turbine j𝑗j when the wind blows in the direction of θ𝜃\\theta. The coordinates of turbine i𝑖i in a northwest coordinate system, with the origin at turbine j𝑗j, are given as (xi,yi)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖(x_{i},y_{i}). Through a passive transformation rotation matrix, one can determine the coordinates of turbine i𝑖i relative to a coordinate system where the x-axis aligns with the wind direction θ𝜃\\theta and the origin remains at turbine j𝑗j. Consequently, the coordinates (xi′,yj′)superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖′superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑗′(x_{i}^{{}^{\\prime}},y_{j}^{{}^{\\prime}}) of turbine i𝑖i relative to the wind direction θ𝜃\\theta can be derived using the following equation: After determining the relative distances between all turbines within the wind farm, the next step involves calculating the velocity deficit for each turbine. Following this, the power output of all turbines is computed based on the theoretical wind turbine power curve, as described in Refs.   . Once the wind farm’s total power output is determined, it is adjusted by the probability of different wind speeds and directions. Finally, the cost of energy is calculated based on this weighted power output. The turbine parameters used in the present work is the same as the previous studies in Refs.   , with zh​u​b=60​m,D=40​m,z0=0.3​m, and ​CT=0.88formulae-sequencesubscript𝑧ℎ𝑢𝑏60mformulae-sequence𝐷40msubscript𝑧00.3m, and subscript𝐶𝑇0.88z_{hub}=60\\,\\text{m},\\,D=40\\,\\text{m},\\,z_{0}=0.3\\,\\text{m, and }C_{T}=0.88. Then the axial induction factor a=0.33𝑎0.33a=0.33 can be obtained according to Eq. (17). The power is defined by the equation: P=0.3​U3​(kw)𝑃0.3superscript𝑈3(kw)P=0.3U^{3}\\,\\text{(kw)}, enabling the calculation of the total power extracted by the wind farm as: where N𝑁N denotes the total number of turbines.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: corresponding deficit must be reduced as: Fig. 2 illustrates the schematic of wake interference between an upwind turbine j𝑗j, and a downwind turbine i𝑖i, which is similar to the previous studies  [ref]47.
