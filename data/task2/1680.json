      "content": "Paper Title: Is Simple Uniform Sampling Effective for Center-Based Clustering with Outliers: When and Why?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe overview the related works below. k𝑘k-center clustering with outliers.\n Charikar et al.  proposed a 333-approximation algorithm for k𝑘k-center clustering with outliers in arbitrary metrics.\nThe time complexity of their algorithm is at least quadratic in data size, since it needs to read all the pairwise distances. A following streaming (4+ϵ)4italic-ϵ(4+\\epsilon)-approximation algorithm was proposed by  McCutchen and Khuller .\n Chakrabarty et al.  showed a 222-approximation algorithm for metric k𝑘k-center clustering with outliers based on the LP relaxation techniques.\n Bădoiu et al.  showed a coreset based approach but having an exponential time complexity if k𝑘k is not a constant.\nRecently,  Ding et al.  provided a greedy algorithm that yields a bi-criteria approximation (returning more than k𝑘k clusters) based on the idea from [ref]24; independently,  Bhaskara et al.  also proposed a similar greedy bi-criteria approximation algorithm. Both their results yield 222 (or 2+ϵ2italic-ϵ2+\\epsilon)-approximation for the radius and need to return O​(kϵ)𝑂𝑘italic-ϵO(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon}) cluster centers.\nSeveral non-uniform and uniform sampling methods were studied in [ref]18  . k𝑘k-median/means clustering with outliers. The early work of k𝑘k-means clustering with outliers dates back to 1990s, in which  Cuesta-Albertos et al.  used the “trimming” idea to formulate the robust model for k𝑘k-means clustering. Georgogiannis  provided a theoretical analysis of the robustness of k𝑘k-means clustering with respect to outliers.\nThere are a bunch of algorithms with provable guarantees that have been proposed for k𝑘k-means/median clustering with outliers  [ref]27  , but they are difficult to implement due to their high complexities. Several heuristic but practical algorithms without provable guarantees have also been studied, such as 0 1. Liu et al. 2 provided a new objective function through combining clustering and outlier removal. Paul et al. 3 recently proposed a robust center-based clustering method based on “Median-of-Means” which can be solved via gradient-based algorithms. Moreover, several sampling based methods were proposed to speed up the existing algorithms.\nBy using the local search method, Gupta et al.  provided a 274274274-approximation algorithm for k𝑘k-means clustering with outliers; they showed that the well known k𝑘k-means++ method 4 can be used to reduce the complexity. Furthermore,  Bhaskara et al.  and  Deshpande et al.  respectively showed that the quality can be improved by modifying the k𝑘k-means++ seeding.\nPartly inspired by the successive sampling method of Mettu and Plaxton 5,  Chen et al.  proposed a novel summary construction algorithm to reduce input data size. Im et al.  provided a sampling method by combining k𝑘k-means++ and uniform sampling. Charikar et al. [ref]18 and  Meyerson et al.  provided different uniform sampling approaches respectively;  Huang et al. ,  Ding and Wang 6 also presented the uniform sampling approaches in Euclidean space. Recently  Huang et al. 7 obtained a robust coreset for the clustering with outliers problem based on the framework of Braverman et al. 8. Sublinear time algorithms. Uniform sampling is closely related to sublinear algorithms. A number of uniform sampling based sublinear time algorithms have been studied for the problems like clustering 9   and property testing .\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: time complexity if k𝑘k is not a constant.\nRecently,  Ding et al.  provided a greedy algorithm that yields a bi-criteria approximation (returning more than k𝑘k clusters) based on the idea from [ref]24; independently,  Bhaskara et al.  also proposed a similar greedy bi-criteria approximation algorithm.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
