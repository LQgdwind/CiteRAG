      "content": "Paper Title: Positional Encoding Augmented GAN for the Assessment of Wind Flow for Pedestrian Comfort in Urban Areas\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a building’s 3D geometry, we simplify this to a 2D image using grayscale to represent building height. With this, we can formalize the CFD prediction task to an image-to-image translation problem as in . Given our two domains 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} and 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}, building geometry and CFD flow field respectively, we want to learn the mapping functions, 𝒳→𝒴→𝒳𝒴\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}, between the image pair (xi,yi)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖(x_{i},y_{i}), having xi∈𝒳subscript𝑥𝑖𝒳x_{i}\\in\\mathcal{X} and yi∈𝒴subscript𝑦𝑖𝒴y_{i}\\in\\mathcal{Y}. This mapping is visualized in Figure 1. We will compare methods performing this translation using both cGANs and autoencoders. We denote our data as {(xi,yi)}i=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑁\\{(x_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}, where xi,yi∈ℝH×W×Csubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖superscriptℝ𝐻𝑊𝐶x_{i},y_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W\\times C}. To capture the conditional mapping between the image pairs, not only between the two domains, the GAN receives the building geometries as a condition for the CFD flow field to be generated, i.e., G:x→y:𝐺→𝑥𝑦G:x\\rightarrow y. As the mapping between geometry and CFD simulation is a one-to-one mapping, we would like our model to be deterministic; therefore, we do not give our generators a random noise vector z𝑧z as proposed in . The generator G𝐺G is optimized to generate outputs that are indistinguishable from the real simulations together with an adversarially trained discriminator D𝐷D, which is trained to discriminate between real CFD simulation, {(x,y)}𝑥𝑦\\{(x,y)\\}, or from the generator, {(x,G​(x))}𝑥𝐺𝑥\\{(x,G(x))\\}. The adversarial training procedure is shown in Figure 2. We will investigate the data-driven CFD prediction by defining three main frameworks based on the most advanced state of the art methods in computer vision: 1) Pix2Pix architecture , 2) CycleGAN [ref]2 and 3) U-Net-based autoencoder .\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: We will investigate the data-driven CFD prediction by defining three main frameworks based on the most advanced state of the art methods in computer vision: 1) Pix2Pix architecture , 2) CycleGAN [ref]2 and 3) U-Net-based autoencoder .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
