Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

These include: (a) SB, LAB [ref]3, which is a background-aware approach that considers external annotations from object instances belonging to neither seen or unseen. This extra information helps SB, LAB [ref]3 to address the confusion between unseen and background. (b) DSES [ref]3 is a version of above approach that does not use background-aware representations but employs external data sources for background. (c) HRE : A YOLO based end-to-end ZSD approach based on the convex combination of region embeddings. (d) SAN [ref]2: A Faster-RCNN based ZSD approach that takes advantage of super-class information and a max-margin loss to understand unseen objects better. (e) PL-48, PL-65 [ref]19: A RetinaNet based ZSD approach that uses polarity loss for better alignment of visual features and semantics. (f) ZSDTD : This approach uses textual description instead of a single-word class-label to define semantic representation. The additional textual description enriches the semantic space and helps to better relate semantics with the visual features. (g) GTNet : uses multiple GAN models alongwith textual descriptions similar to , to generate unseen features to train a Faster-RCNN based ZSD model in a supervised manner. (h) Baseline: The baseline method trains a standard Faster-RCNN model for seen data ùí≥ssuperscriptùí≥ùë†\\mathcal{X}^{s}. To extend it to unseen classes for ZSD, it first gets seen predictions ùê©ssubscriptùê©ùë†\\mathbf{p}_{s}, and then project them onto class semantics to get unseen predictions ùê©u=ùêñu‚ÄãùêñsT‚Äãùê©ssubscriptùê©ùë¢subscriptùêñùë¢superscriptsubscriptùêñùë†ùëásubscriptùê©ùë†\\mathbf{p}_{u}=\\mathbf{W}_{u}\\mathbf{W}_{s}^{T}\\mathbf{p}_{s} as in [ref]19.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
