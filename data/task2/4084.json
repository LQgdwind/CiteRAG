      "content": "Paper Title: Space-time unfitted finite element methods for time-dependent problems on moving domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt has been established that solving the FE problem on the active space leads to ill-conditioning problems. Therefore, we use an AgFE space to solve this issue. The key idea of AgFEM is to eliminate the problematic DOFs using well-posed DOFs. This is achieved by defining a discrete extension operator. Let ℰ¯:V¯h,i​n→V¯h,a​c​t:¯ℰ→subscript¯𝑉ℎ𝑖𝑛subscript¯𝑉ℎ𝑎𝑐𝑡\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}:\\bar{V}_{h,in}\\rightarrow\\bar{V}_{h,act} be the spatial extension operator between space-only interior V¯h,i​nsubscript¯𝑉ℎ𝑖𝑛\\bar{V}_{h,in} and active V¯h,a​c​tsubscript¯𝑉ℎ𝑎𝑐𝑡\\bar{V}_{h,act} FE spaces. The space-only discrete extension operator has been previously described, e.g., in [ref]3. The spatial AgFE space is defined as V¯h,a​g≐ℰ¯​(V¯h,i​n)approaches-limitsubscript¯𝑉ℎ𝑎𝑔¯ℰsubscript¯𝑉ℎ𝑖𝑛\\bar{V}_{h,ag}\\doteq\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}(\\bar{V}_{h,in}). The discrete extension operator relies on a set of linear constraints that constrain the ill-posed DOFs (i.e., the ones that only belong to ill-posed cells) by the well-posed DOFs (the ones that belong to at least one well-posed cell). We do not provide the full construction of the space-only operator for the sake of conciseness. The interested reader can find the complete definition in [ref]3 for the case of conforming background meshes, [ref]5 for non-conforming adaptive meshes and  for a version of this extension that is well-suited to high-order approximations. The space-time extension proposed herein can be applied in all these situations. In this work, we must define a slab-wise space-time discrete extension operator between Vh,i​nnsuperscriptsubscript𝑉ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑛V_{h,in}^{n} and Vh,a​c​tnsuperscriptsubscript𝑉ℎ𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑛V_{h,act}^{n}. We do this by combining the slab-wise aggregation algorithm in Section 2.2, the tensor-product definition of these spaces in Section 2.3 and the space-only extension operator in [ref]3. In particular, at time slab Jnsuperscript𝐽𝑛J^{n}, the space-time extension operator ℰn:Vh,i​nn→Vh,a​c​tn:superscriptℰ𝑛→superscriptsubscript𝑉ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑉ℎ𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑛\\mathcal{E}^{n}:V_{h,in}^{n}\\rightarrow V_{h,act}^{n} is defined as follows: where ℰ¯n:V¯h,i​nn→V¯h,a​c​tn:superscript¯ℰ𝑛→superscriptsubscript¯𝑉ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑛superscriptsubscript¯𝑉ℎ𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑛\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}^{n}:\\bar{V}_{h,in}^{n}\\rightarrow\\bar{V}_{h,act}^{n} is a space-only extension operator at slab Jnsuperscript𝐽𝑛J^{n}.
