      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Generate Synthetic Training Data using Gradient Matching and Implicit Differentiation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe general idea behind data distillation is to optimize hyperparameters (pixels of synthetic images are hyperparameters in an image classification problem) using gradients (also called hypergradients). The use of backpropagation  to optimize hyperparameters has been suggested in [ref]9 and . Backpropagation through L-BFGS  and SGD with momentum  has been introduced in . Because of the great spatial complexity of this backpropagation, a more efficient one has been proposed in . There were also the results of data optimization experiments. The successful distillation of the MNIST dataset 6 was shown in . Leaving only 10 examples (one for each class), and thus reducing the dataset volume by 600 times, the LeNet model [ref]6 trained on compressed dataset showed an accuracy close to that of training on the original dataset. The authors also mentioned the distilled data generalization problem and suggested using a fixed distribution to initialize the network. In [ref]6, the authors show a way to distill both objects and their labels. Their experiments show that such distillation increases accuracy for multiple image classification benchmarks and allows distilled datasets to consist of fewer samples than number of classes. Despite this, recent works ,  do not use label distillation, because joint optimization complicates the problem since labels depend on objects, and vice versa. It is important to note that most of the works in data distillation were inspired by network distillation 6, that is the transfer of knowledge from an ensemble of well-trained models into a single compact one.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: synthetic images are hyperparameters in an image classification problem) using gradients (also called hypergradients).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
