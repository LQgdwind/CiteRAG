Corresponding author: Barbara Pernici, ORCID: 0000-0002-2034-9774.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSocial media have been investigated in many crisis and emergency scenarios, for two main reasons: i) they provide a viable source of information covering areas and situations in which it is difficult to set up systematic data collection (i.e., they are one of the possible “non-traditional data sources” ); and ii) there is the potential to extract timely information concerning the affected areas.\nConsequently, many research papers are published in this domain, including a special track at the International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management on Social Media for Crisis Management .\nOne of the main goals of the research in this area is to automatically extract information about an event to characterize, highlight and react to emergencies. This domain particularly seeks visual information because it provides substantial evidence of ongoing events [ref]21 . Extracting relevant information from tweets presents several challenges. First of all, the contents of the tweets must be relevant to the event and to the type of information being searched.\nRelevance can depend on the use of the information and the actors involved; therefore, its definition is part of a data analysis project description, as it will be discussed in the following of this paper.\nThe extraction process requires several phases of data preparation and analysis, as raw datasets extracted from social media usually contain a very low percentage of useful information, estimated to be between 0.5% and 3% in the literature  . However, even a very small number of relevant posts can be useful in providing a significant overview on the areas in which the event occurs  . To solve this “needle in the haystack” problem, a purely manual analysis is not viable, given the massive number of posts to be examined.\nIn Fig. 1, a typical social media analysis scenario is depicted, in which a human computing approach is used, interleaving fully automatic and human-supported phases. The information extraction process can be split into two macrophases: in the first one, the Data preparation phase, data are prepared for the analysis, while in the second phase, Data Analysis, data are examined by data analysts. Let us assume that a flooding event has to be analyzed.\nAs a first step, social media data are prepared in the Data preparation phase.\nTo prepare the data, first we need to retrieve posts from social media, selecting the appropriate query for the search. The selection of keywords is critical, as on the one hand we aim to collect as much information as possible, whereas using generic keywords for events might result in a large amount of irrelevant content.\nIn some approaches, the native geolocations of posts are used for filtering the data. However, the proportion of natively geolocated tweets is very low;\nhence there is a high risk of excluding useful information if only the geolocated tweets are considered.\n The second step includes the removal of duplicates, basic cleaning actions on the raw dataset, for example, on poorly formatted text, and filtering posts to retain only those that are possibly relevant to the event.\nOne point of attention is that quality issues are often present when extracting information from social media. Texts and images might\nnot be relevant to the event, and biases and fake news may be present.\nIn addition, the raw datasets resulting from the data collection step contain “noisy” data, including uninformative posts talking about the event or marginally related or generic texts or images, such as posts with memes. Therefore, filtering mechanisms must be put in place to prepare the dataset, clean the data (e.g., excluding exact duplicates and near duplicates), and filtering only potentially relevant data. Several models for image and text classification in social media have been developed, mainly based on deep neural networks (e.g., ). One of the open problems, beyond the development of the classifiers themselves, is the selection and configuration of the classifiers that are better suited for a given situation, as events can present distinctive characteristics in different contexts and locations around the world. As a result, the “Cleaning and filtering phase” is usually a rather complicated one, which is often developed specifically for a given data analysis project. The third step is an automatic annotation to enrich with additional information derived from the automatic analysis of posts. Automatic annotation can include both labeling through automatic classification, for example, the impact level of a naturale disaster in terms of visible damage in an image, and also automatic geolocation of posts that are not natively geolocated, adding location information.\nThis information is critical for identifying the posts retrieved for the events to be studied. At this point, the prepared dataset can be examined by the data analyst, within the Data Analysis phase, in which hypotheses are explored (e.g, determining whether a given area was actually affected by an event or not) and information can be extracted. To support this analysis, crowdsourcing can be leveraged to provide additional contributions from citizen scientists, for example, by checking and refining the output of the automatic annotation and cleaning performed in the previous steps. As crowdsourcing activities can involve tasks that are inherently difficult (e.g., identifying if there are persons in a blurred image from a distance) or might be performed by an unspecialized crowd, a systematic analysis of the crowdsourcing-derived information must be performed to assess its validity. After the pre-analysis phase of the crowdsourced data, an actual data analysis can be performed to derive valuable knowledge. Different types of analysis can be envisioned, and the following are considered in this study: Images of events: the intended result consists in retrieving images from a location, usually displaying them using a GIS (Geographical Information System). Thematic mapping: evidence, such as the intensity of a flood event emerging from the prepared posts, is aggregated in given geographical areas, normalized and often weighted (e.g., based on population information). Alerts: early alerts for a starting event are generated, and timeliness is the primary goal of the analysis. In this case, the balance between the manual and automatic activities to be performed must be assessed, as the results are useful if they are delivered in the first hours after the event onset . A more advanced type of analysis would be to solicit and then tackle problems proposed by the citizens themselves via crowdsourcing. This requires the ability to organize and analyze proposals, that can be provided by decision support tools, such as for instance Decidim4CS222https://decidim4cs.ml. We do not discuss these tools further in this study, which mainly focuses on social media analysis. Some critical issues emerge from projects studying emergencies (such as Crowd4SDG333https://crowd4sdg.eu/ and E2mC [ref]21), as well as from the literature (see Section 5): Depending on the type of task being performed, time constraints can be more or less stringent. In particular, there is a significant difference between alerts, which must be almost immediate to be useful, and thematic mappings, which are usually expected some time after the event.\nIn some cases, there can be little or no time for human interventions in processing posts.\nTherefore, timeliness is a parameter that should be considered when designing a system in this context. In addition, while the number of retrieved posts can be high, relevant and useful posts may be few in number. Therefore, a sufficient level of recall is required during the filtering activities. Additionally, some circumstances or local situations may hinder the use of social media. Therefore, availability of data is often problematic. Moreover, the recall of relevant posts and the specificity of the collected data must usually be balanced for practical purposes. Finally, usability of the tools is also an important aspect. Tools should be designed keeping the non-IT final users in mind. They should be very flexible in their configuration and provide user-friendly interfaces and interchange formats. In the following sections, the Crowd4SDG approach for providing solutions to these problems is presented.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: extract information about an event to characterize, highlight and react to emergencies.
