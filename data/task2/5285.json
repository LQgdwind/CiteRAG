      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-end AI Framework for Interpretable Prediction of Molecular and Crystal Properties\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere we explore the use of explainable AI and\ndimension reduction techniques.\nThis is motivated by\nrecent studies in which explainable AI approaches, such\nas Excitation Backpropagation [ref]17, CAM [ref]18 and Grad-CAM  and Contrastive gradient [ref]20, were used to identify\nkey functional groups in molecular structures which\ncontribute to toxicity .\nSimilarly, dimension reduction has been used to\nvisualize the distribution shift of sampled molecules in the feature space with or without transfer learning. We explore\nthe use of these tools to gain new insights into the\ninformation that our AI suite extracts from input data\nto produce reliable predictions. Model performance attribution.\nBy projecting the second last layer’s high dimensional\nvector representation of graph neural network onto\nmolecular structure and visualizing the projection,\nwe can better understand the\nphysical and chemical properties of the\ninput data that affect predictions of our AI models.\nThe top panels of Figure  8 present\nmodel interpretation results of\nhow PhysNet model predicts HOMO based on\nmolecular structures\nvia the Grad-CAM method. The N atoms and the H atoms\nconnected to them are highlighted,\npossibly indicating that for PhysNet, these atoms\ncarry more weight\nin the prediction of HOMO. We do not claim that explanations\nfound by our deep learning model are the definite reasons for\naccurate prediction of QM properties such as HOMO or\nZPVE, since these QM properties may not be simply determined by\natomic species and coordinates. However, AI-explained\nvisualization can help us better make sense of the patterns of\ncomplex molecular property predictions. Dimension Reduction\nTo reveal the correlation between model features and\ntarget properties,\nwe applied the UMAP dimension reduction technique to find the\ndistributions of small molecules by projecting their high-dimensional\nstructural and chemical data onto low-dimension spaces.\nUMAP has been shown to achieve comparable or even better performance than\nother dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA)\n  and t-distributed stochastic\nneighbor embedding (tSNE)  on non-linear datasets .\nDimension reduction results for PhysNet model\nwith HOMO as target\nproperty is shown in the bottom panel of\nFigure  8, where each dot in the\nplot represents a molecule, color-coded based on its\nHOMO value. A 10% randomly selected subset (13.4k molecules) of the\nQM9 dataset was used to produce these results, which consists of stable small\nmolecules composed of CHONF.\nFrom the scatter plot we know that molecules with similar HOMO values\nare clustered together and there is clear separation of molecules\nwith low and high HOMO values. We present additional\nillustrative results in B. Roughness of Molecular Property Landscape.\nFor molecular property prediction, the predictive performance of\ngraph neural networks has been shown to correlate to the roughness\nof molecular property landscape    . We adopted the recently proposed state-of-the-art roughness index (ROGI)  to measure\nhow rough the HOMO and ZPVE landscapes are for four graph neural network models: PhysNet, SchNet, MPNN, MPNN-transformer. The calculation of molecular landscape roughness involves specifying a molecular representation and a distance metric. Molecular representations can be either learned by the graph neural network, with values extracted from the second last layer, or calculated based on molecular structures, as represented by SMILES strings or 3D Cartesian coordinates. The distance metrics are used to measure how different two molecular representations are. Example distance metrics include Tanimoto similarity, Euclidean distance, cityblock distance and cosine distance. To calculate the ROGI values, learned molecular representation and one of the aforementioned distance metrics are used. Using Euclidean distance as the distance metric and HOMO as the target property, we show the ROGI values and mean absolute errors of four graph neural networks in Figure 9.\nWe observe that a lower ROGI value in general corresponds to a lower mean absolute error, that is, higher predictive performance. We attribute this trend to the direct relation of a higher performing model to the smoothness of the resulting molecular property landscape.\nThe exception is MPNN, which corresponds to a lower ROGI value despite a higher MAE as compared to the MPNN-transformer, which may be because the addition of transformer layers roughens the molecular property landscape while\nfacilitating model training. Key findings: Our proposed approach\nbrings together disparate\ninterpretability AI tools to explore and make sense of\nAI model predictions, encompassing model performance\nattribution and scientific visualization; dimension reduction\nwith UMAP to explore clustering of molecules with\nsimilar properties; and metrics such as the roughness index\nto quantify the predictive performance of our AI models\nfor QM properties. These complementary tools provide\nvaluable insights into the features and patterns of\ninput data that are relevant for AI inference.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Here we explore the use of explainable AI and\ndimension reduction techniques.\nThis is motivated by\nrecent studies in which explainable AI approaches, such\nas Excitation Backpropagation [ref]17, CAM [ref]18 and Grad-CAM  and Contrastive gradient [ref]20, were used to identify\nkey functional groups in molecular structures which\ncontribute to toxicity .\nSimilarly, dimension reduction\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
