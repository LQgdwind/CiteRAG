      "content": "Paper Title: Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn reinforcement learning (RL) , an agent learns to perform a sequence of actions in an environment that maximizes cumulative reward based on the Markov decision process (MDP) formalism     .\nA primary driving force behind the explosion of RL is its integration with powerful nonlinear function approximators like deep neural networks (DNNs), aiming to develop agents that can accomplish challenging tasks in complex and uncertain environments.\nThis partnership with deep learning, i.e., deep reinforcement learning (DRL), has enabled RL to successfully extend to tasks with high-dimensional state and action spaces, ranging from arcade games , board games [ref]8 to robotic control tasks . An alternative approach to solving RL problems is using black-box optimization, known as direct policy search 0 or neuroevolution 1 when applied to neural networks.\nEvolution strategies (ES) 2 are a particular family of these optimization algorithms that are heuristic search procedures inspired by natural evolution.\nRecent research has reported that ES can be competitive to popular backpropagation-based algorithms such as policy gradient and Q-learning on challenging RL problems, with much faster training speed when many central processing units (CPUs) are available due to better parallelization 3.\nES can reliably train neural network policies, in a fashion well suited to scale up to modern distributed computer systems without requirements for temporal discounting, backpropagating gradients and value function approximation 4 5 6.\nThe promising properties of applying ES for solving RL problems include: Since ES only needs to communicate scalar returns of complete episodes, it is highly parallelizable and enables near-linear speedups in runtime as a function of CPUs. ES uses a fitness metric that consolidates returns across an entire episode, making it invariant to sparse or deceptive rewards with arbitrarily long time horizons. The population-based evolutionary search provides diverse exploration, particularly when combined with explicit diversity maintenance techniques.\nMoreover, the redundancy inherent in a population also facilitates robustness and stable convergence properties, especially when incorporated with elitism. Traditional research on ES algorithms for RL tasks mainly focuses on stationary optimization problems, which are precisely given in advance and remain fixed during the entire evolutionary process.\nInstead, the environments of real-world RL applications are often dynamic, where the state space, available actions, state transition functions or reward functions may change over time instead of being static, such as for multi-agent cases 7, robot navigation problems 8 or online learning settings 9.\nThis challenge leads to the dynamic optimization problems 0 1 for corresponding ES algorithms where the fitness function, design variables, or environmental conditions change over time. In the paper, we tackle the dynamic environment as a sequence of stationary tasks on a certain timescale where each task corresponds to a stationary environment during the associated time period.\nLearning in such dynamic environments is characterized not only by the capability of acquiring complex skills, but also the ability to adapt rapidly under a non-stationary task distribution.\nHumans and animals can learn complex models that precisely and reliably reason about real-world phenomena, and they can rapidly adjust such models in the face of unexpected changes.\nAlthough (deep) neural network models can represent very complex functions, they lack the capability of rapidly adapting to dynamic environments.\nTo circumvent the necessity for repeatedly re-evolving, recent research exploits transfer learning techniques 2 as a tool to reuse information available from a set of source tasks to help the evolutionary performance in a related but different target task 0.\nGenerally, it requires repeatedly accessing and processing a potentially large distribution of source tasks to provide a good knowledge base for target environments that are supposed to be consistent with the source distribution. An increasing number of real-world scenarios requires RL algorithms to be capable of adapting their behaviors in an incremental manner to environments that may drift or change from their nominal situations, continuously utilizing previous knowledge to benefit the future decision-making process.\nHence, incremental learning 3 4 5 emerges by incrementally adjusting the previously learned policy to a new one whenever the environment changes,\n111In this setting, the policy parameters of the new environment are initialized from the previously learned optima of the original environment.\nThe reason is that, the previous optimal policy empirically performs better than a randomly initialized one, since it has learned some of the features (e.g., nodes in the neural network) of the state-action space.\nThis procedure is akin to the pre-training in the deep learning community, where layers in a neural network extract hierarchical levels of feature representation.\nModel parameters pre-trained on common datasets, such as ImageNet 6, can be used as a helpful initialization for general downstream tasks 7.\nwhich offers an appealing alternative that is amenable for rapid learning adaptation to dynamic environments.\nSuch an incremental adaptation is crucial for intelligent systems operating in the real world, where changing factors and unexpected perturbations are the norm.\nIncremental learning has been widely investigated to cope with learning tasks with an ever-changing environment 8, in areas such as supervised learning 9, RL 3 4, machine vision 0, human-robot interaction 1, and system modeling 2.\nHowever, an equivalent notion of incremental learning in ES for RL domains has largely eluded researchers, with few related work available in the literature.\nHere, we aim to develop a new incremental learning framework for the derivative-free ES algorithms, which is orthogonal and complementary to the previous one in 4 that is investigated for the derivative-based RL approaches. In the paper, we formulate an incremental learning procedure that uses natural evolution strategies (NES) to update the parameters of a policy network for RL in dynamic environments.\nTo increase the capability of rapid learning adaptation, we incorporate an instance weighting mechanism with ES to improve the learning adaptation, while not sacrificing the speed/scalability benefits of ES.\nDuring parameter updating, we assign higher weights to instances that contain more knowledge on the new environment, thus encouraging the search distribution to move towards new promising areas in the parameter space.\nWe propose two easy-to-implement metrics for calculating the weights: instance novelty and instance quality.\nFirst, instance novelty intends to indicate the instance’s difference from the previous optimum in the original environment, with the help of a domain-dependent behavior characterization that describes the behavior of the associated policy.\nSecond, instance quality corresponds to how well the instance performs in the new environment, where its performance is evaluated by the received return of the associated policy.\nTogether, instances with high weights are supposed either to differ more from the original environment (high novelty) or to be more in line with the new environment (high quality).\nThe resulting algorithm, Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution Strategies (IW-IES), “reinforces” the evolutionary process of searching for well-behaving policies that fit in the new environment, thus facilitating more rapid learning adaptation to dynamic environments. We test whether IW-IES improves the performance of ES on challenging RL tasks ranging from robot navigation to locomotion in dynamic environments.\nExperimental results confirm that IW-IES is capable of handling various dynamic environments, and achieves significantly rapid learning adaptation to these tasks.\nIn summary, the main contributions are listed as follows. We introduce Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution Strategies (IW-IES), a family of scalable ES algorithms that addresses challenging RL problems in dynamic environments from an incremental learning perspective. We incorporate an instance weighting mechanism with ES to facilitate learning adaptation to dynamic environments, while retaining scalability benefits and enabling a near-linear speedup in runtime as more CPUs are used. We propose two easy-to-implement metrics for calculating the weights: instance novelty and instance quality, which effectively enhance the evolutionary performance almost without extra computational complexity. We perform extensive experiments to verify that IW-IES can consistently improve learning adaptation to dynamic environments over various state-of-the-art baselines. The rest of this paper sequentially presents the background on ES algorithms for RL domains in Section II, the proposed algorithm with designed weighting metrics in Section III, the experiments in Section IV, and the conclusions in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: with deep learning, i.e., deep reinforcement learning (DRL), has enabled RL to successfully extend to tasks with high-dimensional state and action spaces, ranging from arcade games , board games [ref]8 to robotic control tasks .
