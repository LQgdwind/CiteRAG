      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Training Workload Balancing for Decentralized Multi-Agent Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEffective training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often requires access to a vast amount of data typically unavailable on a single device. Transferring data from different devices (a.k.a., clients or agents) to a central server for training raises security and privacy concerns, as well as communication costs and challenges. To address these issues, there is a growing trend towards cooperative training of machine learning models across a network of devices, eliminating the need to transfer the local training data. Federated Learning (FL)  algorithms have gained substantial attention as a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm. In FL, a central server acts as a coordinator among participating agents, enabling them to update a global model using their locally trained weights.\nThe training process of FL, however, causes a major challenge when dealing with real-world resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile/IoT devices and edge servers) that often exhibit heterogeneous computation and communication capacities, along with varying dataset sizes.\nSuch heterogeneity not only introduces substantial variations in training time across agents, leading to the straggler problem (i.e., some devices significantly lag behind others) but also wastes the available spare resources of faster agents. To address the challenges due to the unbalanced workload on resource-constrained devices, different methods have been proposed recently. One popular approach involves splitting the global model into an agent-side model (consisting of the initial layers of a global model) and a server-side model (the remaining layers), where agents only need to train the smaller agent-side model using Split Learning (SL) [ref]2 . However, SL requires agents to wait for backpropagated gradients from the server to update their models, resulting in substantial communication overhead in each training round.\nTo address the latency and communication issues of SL, a federated SL algorithm is developed by incorporating local-loss-based training . However, their approach uses fixed agent-side models, limiting their adaptability to varying computation and communication resources in dynamic environments.\nAlong another line, agents can be segmented into tiers based on their training speed, and agents from the same tier are selected in each training round to mitigate the straggler problem [ref]5 [ref]6. However, existing tier-based approaches [ref]5 [ref]6 require agents to train the entire global model locally, which is not scalable for training large models.\nFor these methods [ref]2  [ref]5 [ref]6 , a central server is required to coordinate the training of all agents.\nA centralized server, both prone to latency bottlenecks   and susceptible to failures and targeted attacks , can significantly undermine the reliability of the entire distributed learning process.\nTo mitigate these issues, decentralized (peer-to-peer) systems have emerged as an alternative 0 1 2.\nDistinct from distributed systems that utilize a central server for coordination, these systems rely on peer-to-peer communication, offering improved resilience and security due to the absence of a single point of failure. However, without the coordination of a centralized scheduler, workload balancing in these decentralized systems becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Communication-Efficient Training Workload Balancing for Decentralized Multi-Agent Learning (ComDML) that effectively addresses the challenges of training workload balancing in decentralized systems, operating without a server or coordinator.\nIn ComDML, the training workload is balanced by allowing slower agents to offload a portion of their workload to faster agents, ensuring efficient utilization of available resources (see Fig. 1).\nTo reduce synchronization and communication overhead between paired agents, ComDML employs local-loss-based split training, where the paired agents can determine how to split the model and then train the split model in parallel.\nComDMLâ€™s core objective is to minimize the overall training time. ComDML achieves it by employing an integer programming formulation that balances agent workloads based on both computation and communication capacities. Recognizing heterogeneous environments where agent computation and communication capabilities fluctuate, ComDML leverages a dynamic, decentralized pairing scheduler. This scheduler pairs agents and assigns workloads based on observed capabilities, ensuring efficient computation and communication in heterogeneous settings.\nThe scheduler prioritizes pairing the slowest agents first by maintaining a shared list of training times. This list guides agents to pair up at each round, starting with the slowest, to minimize the overall training time.\nThis pairing strategy employs lightweight, low-overhead local split model profiling, which quantifies the communication overhead (in terms of intermediate data size) for various pairing options.\nTo make workload offloading decisions, slower agents consider both local profiling and the communication and computation capacities of faster agents, ensuring optimal workload balancing for the shortest total training time. In this way, the proposed pairing scheduler operates in a decentralized manner with minimal information exchange among agents. Using standard assumptions in FL 3 4 and local-loss-based training techniques 5 , we show the convergence of ComDML for both convex and non-convex functions. The convergence analysis is novel as it considers multiple split models for each paired agent in a heterogeneous environment. Using ComDML, we conduct training experiments on large models (ResNet-56 and ResNet-110 6) across various numbers of agents using popular datasets including CIFAR-10 7, CIFAR-100 7, and CINIC-10 8, alongside their non-identical and independent distribution (non-I.I.D.) variants.\nOur extensive experimental results demonstrate that ComDML achieves a remarkable reduction in overall training time by up to 71% while maintaining model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate its performance under various privacy measures. These measures include minimizing distance correlation between raw data and intermediate representations, shuffling data patches, and applying differential privacy to model parameters. Our results demonstrate that ComDML can effectively incorporate these privacy techniques with minimal impact on model accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: model (consisting of the initial layers of a global model) and a server-side model (the remaining layers), where agents only need to train the smaller agent-side model using Split Learning (SL) [ref]2 .
