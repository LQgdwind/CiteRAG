      "content": "Paper Title: ST-ExpertNet: A Deep Expert Framework for Traffic Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMixture of experts (MoE) belongs to a type of combining method, which is similar to boosting and negative correlation learning methods. The basic ideas of MoE is to train multiple experts, and each expert is assigned to a different part of the subtask. Therefore, MoE is a good compromise between a single global model or multiple local models, but one of the most important questions for MoE is how to divide a dataset into different parts. Now, MoE can be roughly divided according to whether the data is divided in advance . Based on the implicit problem space partitioning   , the prior information is used to partition the dataset by clustering methods. The key issues for these technologies are the reliability of the prior information and how to balance the data after clustering. To overcome this challenge, a gating approach has been proposed to balance the learning strategy by guiding the experts to learn to handle different subsets of training data   .\nThere are other kinds of work focuing on adopting different models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) , Gaussian Processes  and Dirichlet Processes , or different expert configurations such as a hierarchical\nstructure , infinite numbers of experts [ref]27, and\nadding experts sequentially  into the framework.\nOur work extends the application of MoE systems into the framework of flow prediction in urban computing by dividing the flow tensor space. Further, our design serves as a more explainable and efficient framework which can adopt every ST-models, which aims to improve their performance and interpretation.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) , Gaussian Processes  and Dirichlet Processes , or different expert configurations such as a hierarchical\nstructure , infinite numbers of experts [ref]27, and\nadding experts sequentially  into the framework.\nOur work extends the application of MoE systems into the framework of flow prediction in urban computing by dividing the flow tensor\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
