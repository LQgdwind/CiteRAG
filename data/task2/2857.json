      "content": "Paper Title: Inverse analysis of material parameters in coupled multi-physics biofilm models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProperties and performance of inverse analysis approaches depend strongly on the model used to represent the experiments that are used to drive the inverse analysis. Results of an inverse analysis can never be better than the physical model incorporated. In the given setting of inverse analysis the numerical model of the experiment is referred to as the forward model. The forward model must include all physical aspects that are relevant. In the same sense all the aspects a model covers should be represented in the experimental data used.\nThe choice of a suitable forward model therefore depends on the type of data used and the type of application for parameters to be determined. The best case is that the model used for modeling the experiment in an inverse analysis is the same as the one, the parameters are aimed to be used with to make valid predictions for biofilm behavior in the future. In the following we briefly sketch models and methods that we have developed in the past and that are used in this work.\nModeling approaches to fluid-solid interaction with scalar transport have been proposed in  and have been extended to include biofilm growth in .\nPorous properties of biofilms and porous flow through them are known for a long time [ref]15. For solving fluid-poroelasticity interaction (FPI) a novel method was developed in  and applied to a kind of finger shaped biofilm example therein. The inverse analysis algorithm proposed in this paper is obviously not limited to the kind of models presented here. It can also be applied for other models, like one that describes damage in the sense of detachment  or viscoelastic behavior .\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: interaction with scalar transport have been proposed in  and have been extended to include biofilm growth in .\nPorous properties of biofilms and porous flow through them are known for a long time [ref]15.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
