Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Our\nimplementation utilizes\nPyTorch¬†[ref]33.\nWe employ a 3-layer GIN¬†[ref]50 as the encoder network with ReLU\nactivation function with all weights initialized randomly. The output dimensions\nfor the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd GIN layers are 64, 32, and 16, respectively. In the\nNTN layer, we specify K=16ùêæ16K=16. Following the approach in¬†, we\nuse 16 histogram bins for pairwise node embedding comparisons. For training, we\nchoose the Adam optimizer¬†, setting the learning rate to\n0.0010.0010.001 and the weight decay to 0.00050.00050.0005. The model is trained with a batch size\nof 128128128 over 100 epochs. All datasets are converted into standard dataloaders\ncompatible with\nPyTorch Geometric\n(PyG)¬† for GNN processing. To present each technique in the\nbest light, we computed all timings for our ground truth\ndistance¬† on a machine with a 16-Core (8P/8E) Intel\nI9-12900K CPU @ 5/4 GHz with 32 GB memory, as the approach benefits most from\nmultiple cores. MTNN timings are computed on a machine equipped with a 6-core\nIntel i7-6800K CPU @ 3.50GHz, 68GB of memory, and an Nvidia 3090Ti GPU, since it\nbenefits most from a better GPU.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Merge trees are computed using TTK¬†6 and\nParaview¬† is used for dataset visualization.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
