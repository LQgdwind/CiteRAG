      "content": "Paper Title: S2TA: Exploiting Structured Sparsity for Energy-Efficient Mobile CNN Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional neural network (CNN) inference has quickly become an important workload in (ultra) low-power mobile    and\nIoT/embedded  [ref]10 [ref]11 [ref]5 devices. CNN accelerators are now a standard component in mobile SoCs    , where\n8-bit integer (INT8) CNN inference is the most widely used  due to the stringent requirements on energy efficiency (TOPS/W) and area efficiency (TOPS/mm2). A common strategy to improve CNN accelerator efficiency is to exploit sparsity, as zeros in the data tensors (both weights and activations) reduce the theoretical compute and storage requirement significantly.\nZeros in CNNs are statistically distributed in a random pattern.\nExploiting the random sparsity, which is also commonly referred to as unstructured sparsity, has been the main focus of sparse hardware accelerators to date     . Exploiting unstructured sparsity, however, requires complex hardware structures that introduce significant area and energy overhead, which are particularly detrimental to mobile/embedded inference scenarios. Exploiting unstructured sparsity introduces hardware overheads due to additional buffers used in data manipulation.\nThere are two fundamental approaches to supporting random sparsity.\nThe first is the inner-product style   which requires an operand gather stage to evenly distribute the unpredictable workload to the PEs to perform the MAC operations.\nThe second, is the outer-product style which has more conventional operand distribution and MAC operations, but then requires a result scatter stage to spread the non-contiguous results of the individual MACs over the output feature maps.\nBoth of these approaches introduce significant hardware overheads in the form of large buffers that drastically degrade the energy and area-efficiency of the accelerator. We quantitatively show that the additional buffers required to exploit unstructured sparsity,\nwhich may seem like nitty-gritty engineering details, in fact increase the energy per MAC of a baseline (systolic array) dense accelerator by 71%. As a result, random sparse accelerators published to date have demonstrated high speedup, but due to hardware overheads, have limited energy and area efficiency gains. We argue that the sparsity-exploiting microarchitecture structures must be lightweight for it to be beneficial to exploit sparsity at all in mobile/embedded CNN accelerators. Otherwise, the energy/area overheads can easily eclipse the speedup gains. To that end, we propose to exploit structured sparsity, which has regular sparsity patterns that allow the hardware additions required to be very lean. In particular, we focus on Density Bound Block (DBB) \nformat, which\ntiles data tensors into blocks, and then introduces a bound on the maximum number of non-zero elements per block.\nDBB overcomes both of the challenges with random sparsity.\nFirstly, the maximum number of MAC operations is fixed, which significantly achieves high PE utilization without operand buffers.\nSecondly, the blocked data limits the location of output results, eliding distributed accumulators. We first propose two\nprimitives: W-DBB and A-DBB, which exploit DBB in weight\nand activation sparsity, respectively. Weight sparsity is statically known, and thus the hardware design is relatively straightforward. Activation sparsity, however, is dynamic. We propose a dynamic pruning scheme co-designed with a novel time-unrolled architecture to implement A-DBB.\n Building on\nW-DBB and A-DBB, we describe how to integrate the two building blocks into a fully-sparse CNN accelerator that efficiently exploits sparsity in both weights and activations. In particular, we focus on the well-known systolic array architecture, popular in mobile/embedded inference scenarios due to its extreme efficiency arising from high data reuse. We show that both W-DBB and A-DBB can be easily integrated into a classic SA architecture by introducing a tensor PE (TPE) design\nenabling further efficiency gains.\n In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: Quantifying Overhead of Exploiting Unstructured Sparsity We provide the first quantitative analysis of the hardware overheads (area and energy)\nof exploiting unstructured sparsity. We show that the additional operand and accumulator buffers\nintroduce about 50% and 10% energy and area overhead compared to the datapath of a baseline dense INT8 CNN accelerator.\nThese overheads are amortized in floating-point designs    , where the datapath power is much higher, but in the mobile INT8 case, these overheads eclipse the gains. Joint Weight/Activation DBB Sparsity\nWe propose an architecture that exploits DBB sparsity in both weights and activations.\nThis is non-trival, because while weight sparsity is known offline, activation sparsity is not known until runtime and can vary wildly.\nWe propose Dynamic Activation Pruning (DAP), which co-designs training time activation DBB pruning and novel run-time hardware support.\nDAP compresses activations by 2–3×\\times with negligible impact on test accuracy. Time-Unrolled Variable DBB Sparsity\nWe propose a new time-unrolled microarchitecture to serialize the processing of MACs in a DBB block across time. Structured Sparse Tensor Accelerator (S2TA)\nWe show that joint DBB weight and activation sparsity can be efficiently incorporated into CNN accelerators. As a case study, we target the systolic array template, by extending the traditional scalar PE into a tensor PE (TPE) that consumes compressed DBB data blocks.\n Evaluation in 16nm and 65nm\nWe implement the S2TA design\nin both 16nm and 65nm technology.\nOn a range of popular models (AlexNet, MobileNetv1, VGG-16, ResNet50v1), S2TA demonstrates 2.08×\\times lower energy compared to the baseline without DBB.\nCompared to the state-of-the-art unstructured sparse accelerator SparTen  and Eyeriss-v2 , S2TA\nhas 2.2×\\times and 3.1×\\times lower energy on AlexNet in 65nm technolgy.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Convolutional neural network (CNN) inference has quickly become an important workload in (ultra) low-power mobile    and\nIoT/embedded  [ref]10 [ref]11 [ref]5 devices.
