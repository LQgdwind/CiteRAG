      "content": "Paper Title: Group isomorphism is nearly-linear time for most orders\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSurprisingly, the brute-force nO​(log⁡n)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑛n^{O(\\log n)} complexity of group isomorphism\nhas been resilient. Progress has fragmented into work on numerous\nsubclasses 𝔛𝔛\\mathfrak{X} of groups; the precise problem studied today\nis: We follow the convention that an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times n table with\nentries in [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] corresponds to the multiplication table of a binary product\nwhere the rows and columns are both labelled by 1,2,…,n12…𝑛1,2,\\ldots,n. Moreover, for\na group multiplication we require that the identity element is denoted\n“111”, that is, the first row and first column must both be 1,2,…,n12…𝑛1,2,\\ldots,n;\nif this is not the case, then we reject the input. Grochow-Qiao  give a detailed survey of recent progress on group\nisomorphism; here we summarize a few results related to our setting. Iliopoulos\n, Karagiorgos-Poulakis , Vikas , and Kavitha\n progressively improved the complexity for the class\n𝔄𝔄\\mathfrak{A} of abelian groups (where the product satisfies a∗b=b∗a𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑎a*b=b*a for all\na,b𝑎𝑏a,b), resulting in a linear-time algorithm for\n𝔄𝔄\\mathfrak{A}-GroupIso in a RAM model (more on this below).\nWagner-Rosenbaum  gave an n0.25​log⁡n+O​(1)superscript𝑛0.25𝑛𝑂1n^{0.25\\log n+O(1)} time algorithm\nfor the class 𝔑psubscript𝔑𝑝\\mathfrak{N}_{p} of groups of order a power of a prime p𝑝p, and\nlater generalized this to the class of solvable groups. Li-Qiao \nproved an average run time of nO​(1)superscript𝑛𝑂1n^{O(1)} for an essentially dense subclass\n𝔑p,2⊂𝔑psubscript𝔑𝑝2subscript𝔑𝑝\\mathfrak{N}_{p,2}\\subset\\mathfrak{N}_{p}. Babai-Codenotti-Qiao \nproved an nO​(1)superscript𝑛𝑂1n^{O(1)} bound for the class 𝔗𝔗\\mathfrak{T} of groups with no\nnontrivial abelian normal subgroups. Das-Sharma  described a\nnearly-linear time algorithm for the class of Hamiltonian groups, again in a RAM\nmodel. Other research combines results for separate\nclasses by considering isomorphism between groups that decompose into a subgroup\nin class 𝔛𝔛\\mathfrak{X} and a quotient in class 𝔜𝔜\\mathfrak{Y}, see also\nSection 2; we call this the\n(𝔛,𝔜)𝔛𝔜(\\mathfrak{X},\\mathfrak{Y})-extension problem. Le Gall\n[ref]19 studied (𝔄,ℭ)𝔄ℭ(\\mathfrak{A},\\mathfrak{C})-extensions,\nwhere ℭℭ\\mathfrak{C} consists of cyclic groups. Grochow-Qiao \nconsidered (𝔄,𝔗)𝔄𝔗(\\mathfrak{A},\\mathfrak{T})-extensions, and outlined a general\nframework for solving extension problems. A further class of algorithms considers terse input models, such as black-box\nmodels or groups of matrices or permutations; we refer to Seress\n[32, Section 2] for details of those models. In this\nformat, groups can be exponentially larger than the data it takes to specify the\ngroup. Using this model, the second author proved an (log⁡n)O​(1)superscript𝑛𝑂1(\\log n)^{O(1)}-time algorithm for subgroups and quotients of finite Heisenberg\ngroups, and further variations in collaborations with Lewis and\nBrooksbank-Maglione; see 6 and the references therein.\nRecently, in  the authors proved a polynomial-time isomorphism test\nfor permutation groups of square-free and cube-free orders. These examples\ndemonstrate that input models may have an outsized influence on the complexity\nof group isomorphism. Some of the motivation of this and earlier work  has been the\nobservation that, in contrast to graph isomorphism, the difficulty of group\nisomorphism is influenced by the prime power factorization of the group orders\nn𝑛n. For example, if n=2e±1𝑛plus-or-minussuperscript2𝑒1n=2^{e}\\pm 1 is a prime, then there is exactly one\nisomorphism type of groups of prime order n𝑛n and isomorphism can be tested by\ncomparing orders. Yet, there are n2​e2/27−O​(e)superscript𝑛2superscript𝑒227𝑂𝑒n^{2e^{2}/27-O(e)} isomorphism types of groups\nof prime power order n∓1=2eminus-or-plus𝑛1superscript2𝑒n\\mp 1=2^{e}, see [5, p. 23]. As of today,\nisomorphism testing of groups of order 2esuperscript2𝑒2^{e} has the worst-case complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: that decompose into a subgroup\nin class 𝔛𝔛\\mathfrak{X} and a quotient in class 𝔜𝔜\\mathfrak{Y}, see also\nSection 2; we call this the\n(𝔛,𝔜)𝔛𝔜(\\mathfrak{X},\\mathfrak{Y})-extension problem.
