      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding the Performance of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in Drug Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver recent years, there has been increasing interest in machine learning with graph structured data, with approaches created for homogeneous graph embeddings , graph-specific neural models  and knowledge graph embedding 0. Whilst there have been numerous new model architectures proposed in the literature, there has been less work performed on understanding how these models are affected by the rest of the choices made in the machine learning pipeline, for example, how robust they are across hyperparameter values and model initialisations, or how performance changes across dataset splits. However, the work that does exist demonstrates some interesting observations. For example, several graph neural network approaches were compared under a fair evaluation procedure , which showed that a change in train/test split would drastically alter the ranking of the models and that simpler baseline approaches, with correctly tuned hyperparameters, could outperform more complex models. The performance of different graph neural networks for graph-level classification has also been compared [ref]14, with results showing that baselines approaches not using the graph structure can outperform those that do. The need for consistent, rigorous and reproducible benchmarks for graph machine learning is also an area of increasing research interest  . Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embeddings\nA study comparing seven different knowledge graph embedding techniques under a consistent evaluation framework on the non-biomedical benchmark datasets FB15K-237  and WNRR  has been performed 3. The authors observe that as new models are introduced, they are often accompanied with new training regimes or objective functions, making assessing the value of the new model architecture alone challenging. They undertake a detailed comparison across combinations of models, training paradigms and hyperparameters, using a Bayesian search approach. They find that earlier and comparatively simpler models, are very competitive when trained using modern techniques 3. However, the study did not consider how model initialisation or dataset splits can affect performance. In a similar study, 19 knowledge graph embedding approaches, implemented in the PyKEEN framework , are compared across eight different benchmark datasets . One of the aims of the study was to investigate whether original published results could be reproduced, a task they found challenging. Additionally they perform detailed experiments over models and training paradigm combinations, searching over the hyperparameter space for a maximum of 24 hours or 100 training repeats. Again they find that suitably tuned simple models can out-perform complex ones. The study does not consider drug discovery datasets specifically and does not assess how models perform across model seeds or dataset splits. Biomedical Domain Specific Evaluations\nThe use of various homogeneous graph embedding techniques has been assessed across a range of biomedical tasks such as drug-drug and protein-protein interactions .\nWhilst not exploring knowledge graph embedding techniques, the work explores how various hyperparameters affect predictive performance.\nThey explore random walk and neural network based techniques including DeepWalk 0 and Graph Convolution based auto-encoders 2, using various task specific homogeneous graphs.\nAn additional review compares both graph and knowledge graph specific approaches and their use in the biomedical world, however no experimental comparisons are made between the different approaches 5. The performance of five knowledge graph embedding approaches (TransE, ComplEx, DistMult, SimplE and RotatE) have been compared on a knowledge graph constructed from the SNOMED resource .\nThe models are assessed on the tasks of link prediction, visualisation and entity classification, with a limited grid-search being performed to choose the hyperparameters. Work has assessed the performance of knowledge graph embedding approaches for tasks within the drug discovery domain such as predicting drug-target interactions 6.\nA different, often task-specific, graph is used for each of these experimental setups with much of the data being taken from the BioSNAP repository .\nHowever often these graphs are less complex than resources like Hetionet, with a typically limited number of entity and relationship types being present.\nResults use k-fold cross validation to assess performance variability over dataset splits, with a grid-search over a range of hyperparameters also being performed. The effect of different data splitting strategies for predicting drug-drug interaction using graph-based methods (including TransE and TransD) has been investigated .\nThe work argues that realistic data splits should be used in order to avoid over-optimistic results, with several domain specific and time-based splits being assessed.\nAdditionally the work claims that the tuning of various hyperparameters had little impact on the overall model performance.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: approaches, with correctly tuned hyperparameters, could outperform more complex models. The performance of different graph neural networks for graph-level classification has also been compared [ref]14, with results showing that baselines approaches not using the graph structure can outperform those that do.
