      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation for Action Recognition: A Disentanglement Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArchitecture.\nFollowing the latest works [ref]31 [ref]37, we use I3D [ref]6 as the backbone333The existing widely adopted backbones for video-based UDA include ResNet-101 and I3D. However, more recent backbones, e.g. Transformer-based or VideoMAE-based  , are promising to be used in this task.. However, different from CoMix which jointly trains the backbone, we simply use the pretrained I3D model on Kinetics , provided by [ref]6, to extract RGB features. For the first three benchmarks, RGB features are used as the input of TranSVAE. For Sprites, we use the original image as the input, for the purpose of visualizing the reconstruction and disentanglement results. We use the shared encoder and decoder structures across the source and target domains. For RGB feature inputs, the encoder and decoder are fully connected layers. For original image inputs, the encoder and decoder are the convolution and deconvolution layers (from DCGAN ), respectively. For the TRN model, we directly use the one provided by . Other details on this aspect are placed in Appendix. Configurations.\nOur TranSVAE is implemented with PyTorch¬†. We use Adam with a weight decay of 1‚Äãe‚àí41superscriptùëí41e^{-4} as the optimizer. The learning rate is initially set to be 1‚Äãe‚àí31superscriptùëí31e^{-3} and follows a commonly used decreasing strategy in . The batch size and the learning epoch are uniformly set to be 128 and 1,000, respectively, for all the experiments. We uniformly set 100 epochs of training under only source supervision and involved the target pseudo-labels afterward. Following the common protocol in video-based UDA [ref]37, we perform hyperparameter selection on the validation set. The specific hyperparameters used for each task can be found in the Appendix. NVIDIA A100 GPUs are used for all experiments. Kindly refer to our Appendix for all other details. Competitors.\nWe compared methods from three lines. We first consider the source-only (ùíÆonlysubscriptùíÆonly\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{only}}) and supervised-target (ùíØsupsubscriptùíØsup\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sup}}) which uses only labeled source data and only labeled target data, respectively. These two baselines serve as the lower and upper bounds for our tasks. Secondly, we consider five popular image-based UDA methods by simply ignoring temporal information, namely DANN , JAN , ADDA , AdaBN , and MCD . Lastly and most importantly, we compare recent SoTA video-based UDA methods, including TA3N , SAVA , TCoN , ABG , CoMix [ref]31, CO2A [ref]37, and MA2L-TD . All these methods use single modality features. We directly quote numbers reported in published papers whenever possible. There exist recent works conducting video-based UDA using multi-modal data, e.g. RGB + Flow. Although TranSVAE solely uses RGB features, we still take this set of methods into account. Specifically, we consider MM-SADA , STCDA , CMCD , A3R , CleanAdapt , CycDA , MixDANN  and CIA .\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Architecture.\nFollowing the latest works [ref]31 [ref]37, we use I3D [ref]6 as the backbone333The existing widely adopted backbones for video-based UDA include ResNet-101 and I3D.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
