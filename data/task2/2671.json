      "content": "Paper Title: Computation Rate Maximum for Mobile Terminals in UAV-assisted Wireless Powered MEC Networks with Fairness Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe wireless powered MEC network can be divided into two types according to the carriers of MEC servers and energy transmitters. The first type is the wireless powered MEC network, where the BS is the carrier [ref]10    , while the second type is the UAV-assisted wireless powered MEC network, where the UAV is the carrier [ref]1    [ref]5. In the system with the BS as the carrier, the works mainly focus on resource allocation and offloading decision [ref]10    . In [ref]10 and , the parameters such as offloading decision, CPU frequency, and transmission time of terminals were optimized to minimize the energy consumption and maximize the computation rate respectively. Different from [ref]10 , Mao et al. investigated the max-min energy efficiency optimization problem to guarantee the fairness of energy efficiency among different devices . To utilize the advantages of DRL in handling problems with sophisticated state space and time-varying environment, Min et al.  proposed a deep Q network (DQN) based offloading policy for energy-harvesting MEC network to improve the computation performance. Huang et al.  proposed a DRL-based online computation offloading (DROO) framework. Instead of solving for the hybrid integer continuous solution altogether, DROO decomposes the optimization problem into a binary offloading decision sub-problem and a continuous resource allocation subproblem, and tackles them separately by deep learning and traditional optimization methods, respectively. In the system with the UAV as the carrier, the previous works only considered the case where the locations of terminals are fixed [ref]1    [ref]5. To maximize the weighted sum computation rate of terminals, Zhou et al. [ref]1 jointly optimized the CPU frequencies, transmit powers, and offloading times of terminals as well as the UAV trajectory. Ref.  minimized the energy consumption of the UAV while guaranteeing the computation rate of all terminals. Ref.  proposed a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based workflow model, which allows parallel transmitting and computing. In particular, the UAV was arranged to hover over designated successive positions, and the parameters such as the service sequence of terminals, computing resource allocation, and hovering time of UAV were jointly optimized. To assist the service of UAV, Liu et al.  utilized idle sensor devices to cooperate with the UAV to provide computation offloading service for busy sensor devices, and Hu et al. [ref]5 utilized access points (APs) to offer wireless power and computation offloading services for the UAV. The offline algorithms in [ref]1    [ref]5 require the system information a priori.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: powered MEC network can be divided into two types according to the carriers of MEC servers and energy transmitters.
