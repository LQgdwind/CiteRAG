For static, non-streaming, environments, several techniques to visualize single-feature effects exist.\nThe PDP shows the marginal effect a set of features has on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model [ref]16.\nA PDP can show whether the relationship between the target and a feature is linear, monotonic or more complex. [ref]16  5\nPDPs have successfully been applied in various application domains across disciplines    .\nApplication domains include, imbalanced classification costs as encountered in the criminal justice domain , animal-habitat factors in ecological research , congestion prediction for traffic planning , and hyperparameter optimization for automated machine learning pipelines . Apart from visualizing the feature effects, the PDP can also be summarized in a FI score by computing the deviation between the individual feature scores in relation to the mean PD curve  5.\nWhen significant interaction effects are present, the relationship between the response and predictors may vary considerably.\nConsequently, the use of an average curve, such as the PDP, may obscure the intricate nature of the modeled relationship, thereby masking the underlying complexity .\nIndividual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots  refine the PDP by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations.\nAccumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves  present an alternative visualization approach to PDPs, which do not require unreliable extrapolation with correlated predictors.\nALE plots are far less computationally expensive than PDPs.\nHowever, in case of strong correlation, an interpretation of the effect across intervals is not permissible 5.\nTo overcome the problem of feature interactions, stratifying PDPs by conditioning on a correlated and potentially interacting feature to group ICE curves was suggested .\nVINE  achieves this by clustering ICE curves with similar slopes.\nREPID  uses a tree-based approach to identify and cluster homogeneous ICE curves to produce individual effect curves for each unique cluster.\nShapley dependence plots 4 use the SHAP value of a feature for the y-axis and the value of the feature for the x-axis.\nThus, SHAP dependence plots capture vertical dispersion due to interaction effects in the model.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: explain dynamic models.\nSince tree-based approaches are commonly applied in such streaming scenarios model-specific approaches that compute global feature importance (FI) have been proposed  [ref]23.\nMoreover, also model-agnostic variants exist that calculate FI for any model type trained on real-time streams of data  .\nYet, the approach of using a single point estimate to model feature\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
