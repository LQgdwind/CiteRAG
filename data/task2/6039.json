      "content": "Paper Title: Variance-Reduced Gradient Estimation via Noise-Reuse in Online Evolution Strategies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst-order optimization methods are a foundational tool in machine learning.\nWith many such methods (e.g., SGD, Adam) available in existing software, ML training often amounts to specifying a computation graph of learnable parameters and computing some notion of gradients to pass into an off-the-shelf optimizer. Here, unrolled computation graphs (UCGs), where the same learnable parameters are repeatedly applied to transition a dynamical system’s inner state, have found their use in various applications such as recurrent neural networks  , meta-training learned optimizers [ref]3 , hyperpameter tuning  [ref]6, dataset distillation [ref]7 , and reinforcement learning  0. While a large number of automatic differentiation (AD) methods exist to estimate gradients in UCGs 1, they often perform poorly over loss landscapes with extreme local sensitivity and cannot handle black-box computation dynamics or discontinuous losses 2 [ref]3 3. To handle these shortcomings, evolution strategies (ES) have become a popular alternative to produce gradient estimates in UCGs 4. ES methods convolve the (potentially pathological or discontinuous) loss surface with a Gaussian distribution in the learnable parameter space, making it smoother and infinitely differentiable. Unfortunately, vanilla ES methods cannot be applied online444Online here means a method can produce gradient estimates using only a truncation window of an unrolled computation graph instead of the full graph, thus allowing the interleaving of partial unrolls and gradient updates. — the computation must reach the end of the graph to produce a gradient update, thus incurring large update latency for long UCGs.\nTo address this, a recently proposed approach, Persistent Evolution Strategies 5 (PESPES\\mathrm{PES}), samples a new Gaussian noise in every truncation unroll and accumulates the past sampled noises to get rid of the estimation bias in its online application. In this work, we investigate the coupling of the noise sampling frequency and the gradient estimation frequency in PESPES\\mathrm{PES}. By decoupling these two values, we arrive at a more general class of unbiased, online ES gradient estimators. Through a variance characterization of these estimators, we find that the one which provably has the lowest variance in fact reuses the same noise for the entire time horizon (instead of over a single truncation window as in PESPES\\mathrm{PES}). We name this method Noise-Reuse Evolution Strategies (NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES}). In addition to being simple to implement, NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} converges faster than PESPES\\mathrm{PES} across a wide variety of applications due to its reduced variance. Overall, we make the following contributions: We propose a class of unbiased online evolution strategies gradient estimators for unrolled computation graphs that generalize Persistent Evolution Strategies 5. We analytically and empirically characterize the variance of this class of estimators and identify the lowest-variance estimator which we name Noise-Reuse Evolution Strategies (NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES}). We identify the connection between NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} and the existing offline ES method FullESFullES\\mathrm{FullES} and show that NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} is a better alternative to FullESFullES\\mathrm{FullES} both in terms of parallelizability and variance. We demonstrate that NRESNRES\\mathrm{NRES} can provide optimization convergence speedups (up to 5-60×\\times) over AD/ES baselines in terms of wall-clock time and number of unroll steps in applications of 1) learning dynamical systems, 2) meta-training learned optimizers, and 3) reinforcement learning.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: parameters are repeatedly applied to transition a dynamical system’s inner state, have found their use in various applications such as recurrent neural networks  , meta-training learned optimizers [ref]3 , hyperpameter tuning  [ref]6, dataset distillation [ref]7 , and reinforcement learning  0.
