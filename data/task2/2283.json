As games become more complex and less linear, and uses of PCG tools become more diverse, the need for generators that are reliable, expressive, and trustworthy is increasing. Largely speaking, game content generators can produce outcomes either in an offline or in an online manner . Compared to offline PCG, online PCG is flexible, dynamic and interactive but it comes with several drawbacks: it needs to be able to generate meaningful content rapidly without causing any catastrophic failure to the existing game content. Because of the many challenges that arise when PCG systems operate online (i.e. during play), only limited studies have focused on that mode of generation    . In this paper we introduce a framework for online PCG at the intersections of the experience-driven PCG (EDPCG) [ref]7 and the PCG via reinforcement learning (PCGRL) [ref]8 frameworks. The ED(PCG)RL framework, EDRL for short, enables the generation of personalised content via the RL paradigm. EDRL builds upon and extends PCGRL as it makes it possible to generate endless levels of arcade-like games beyond the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework  0 in an online fashion. It also extends the EDPCG framework as it enables RL agents to create personalised content that is driven by experience-based reward functions. EDRL benefits from experience-driven reward functions and RL agents that are able to design in real-time based on these functions. The result is a versatile generator that can yield game content in an online fashion respecting certain functional and aesthetic properties as determined by the selected reward functions. We test EDRL initially in Super Mario Bros (SMB) (Nintendo, 1985)1 through the generative designs of RL agents that learn to optimise certain reward functions relevant to level design. In particular, we are inspired by Koster’s theory of fun 2 and train our RL agents to moderate the level of diversity across SMB level segments. Moreover, we test the notion of historical deviation by considering earlier segment creations when diversifying the current segment. Finally, we repair defects in levels (e.g., broken pipes) via a neural net-assisted evolutionary repairer 3, and then check the playability of levels through agent-based testing. Importantly, EDRL is able to operate online in SMB as it represents the state and action via a latent vector. The key findings of the paper suggest that EDRL is possible in games like SMB; the RL agents are able to online generate playable levels of varying degrees of fun that deviate over time. Beyond introducing the EDRL framework, we highlight a number of ways this paper contributes to the current state of the art. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first functional implementation of PCGRL in SMB, a platformer game with potentially infinite level length, that is arguably more complex than the GVGAI games studied in [ref]8. Second, compared to tile-scale design in [ref]8, the proposed approach is (required to be) faster as level segments are generated online through the latent vectors of pre-trained generators. Finally, we quantify Koster’s fun 2 as a function that maintains moderate levels of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) within a level teaching our RL agent to generate levels with such properties.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: (i.e. during play), only limited studies have focused on that mode of generation    .
