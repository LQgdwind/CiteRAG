      "content": "Paper Title: Proposal-Free Temporal Action Detection via Global Segmentation Mask Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nResults on ActivityNet \nFrom Table 1,\nwe can make the following observations:\n(1) TAGS with I3D feature achieves the best result in average mAP. Despite the fact that our model is much simpler in architecture design compared to the existing alternatives. This validates our assumption that with proper global context modeling, explicit proposal generation is not only redundant but also less effective.\n(2) When using the relatively weaker two-stream (TS) features,\nour model remains competitive and even surpasses I3D based\nBU-TAL , A2Net [ref]47 and the very recent ContextLoc  and MUSES  by a significant margin.\nTAGS also surpasses a proposal refinement and strong G-TAD based approach CSA \non avg mAP.\n(3) Compared to RTD-Net which employs an architecture similar to object detection Transformers, our TAGS is significantly superior. This validates our model formulation in exploiting the Transformer for TAD. Results on THUMOS14 \nSimilar conclusions can be drawn in general on THUMOS from Table 1.\nWhen using TS features, TAGS achieves again the best results, beating strong competitors like TCANet [ref]39, CSA  by a clear margin. There are some noticeable differences:\n(1) We find that I3D is now much more effective than two-stream (TS),\ne.g., 8.8% gain in average mAP over TS with TAGS, compared with 0.6% on ActivityNet. This is mostly likely caused by the distinctive characteristics of the two datasets in terms of action instance duration and video length.\n(2) Our method achieves the second best result with marginal edge behind MUSES .\nThis is partly due to that MUSES benefits from additionally tackling the scene-changes. (3) Our model achieves the best results in stricter IOU metrics (e.g., IOU@0.5/0.6/0.7) consistently using both TS and I3D features, verifying the effectiveness of solving mask redundancy.\n Computational cost comparison \nOne of the key motivations to design a proposal-free TAD model is to reduce the model training and inference cost.\nFor comparative evaluation, we evaluate\nTAGS against two representative and recent TAD methods (BMN [ref]18 and G-TAD )\nusing their released codes.\nAll the methods are tested on the same machine with one Nvidia 2080 Ti GPU.\nWe measure the convergence time in training\nand average inference time per video in testing.\nThe two-stream video features are used.\nIt can be seen in Table 3 that our TAGS\nis drastically faster, e.g., 20/25×20/25\\times for training and clearly quicker – 1.6/1.8×1.6/1.8\\times for testing in comparison to G-TAD/BMN, respectively.\nWe also notice that our TAGS needs less epochs to converge.\nTable 3 also shows that our TAGS has the smallest FLOPs and the least parameter number.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: generation is not only redundant but also less effective.\n(2) When using the relatively weaker two-stream (TS) features,\nour model remains competitive and even surpasses I3D based\nBU-TAL , A2Net [ref]47 and the very recent ContextLoc  and MUSES  by a significant margin.\nTAGS also surpasses a proposal refinement and strong G-TAD based approach CSA \non avg mAP.\n(3) Compared to RTD-Net which\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
