      "content": "Paper Title: FaaSten Your Decisions: Classification Framework and Technology Review of Function-as-a-Service Platforms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe technical view in our classification framework comprises a set of categories and dimensions that have to be considered by software development and operations specialists willing to identify if a given FaaS platform suffices the low level, technical requirements.\nFor example, a runtime for the programming language used in the company or project might not be supported by the platform which would complicate the development.\nFigure 3 presents a set of categories helping to classify a given FaaS platform from the technical perspective.\nIn the following, we discuss all categories and their respective dimensions in-detail. Essentially, a FaaS platform might provide various mechanisms that facilitate the overall function and application development experience.\nFirstly, to start developing functions in a specific programming language, e.g., Python or Java, the platform must support the required Function Runtimes.\nNote that even in cases when the platform does not support a particular language, it still might be possible to develop function in such language if the platform supports Runtime Customization, e.g., by supplying custom container images as a function runtime.\nHowever, since a custom container image has to be created first following the specific set of requirements (e.g., implementing a required interface), instead of simply providing the source code, this option also introduces additional management efforts. As FaaS platforms typically impose varying requirements on, for example, the way functions have to be implemented , the source code development can also be simplified via plugins for popular IDEs and Text Editors such as IntelliJ IDEA [ref]44 or Visual Studio Code  that provide support, e.g., for platform-specific syntax highlighting or automated code packaging.\nMoreover, a platform can provide Client Libraries for a set of programming languages that wrap the platform’s APIs as a part of platform’s Software Development Kit (SDK) to facilitate the development process, e.g., usage of platform-specific libraries for working with typed events’ data. An important aspect in FaaS platforms which can simplify several distinct phases of the application lifecycle is Version Management of serverless applications and functions.\nApart from facilitating the development process, versioning is also helpful for application deployment, e.g., to support canary releases  or blue-green deployments .\nIt is hence advantageous if a FaaS platform provides mechanisms for managing versions on the level of single Function versions, or entire Application versions, i.e., a combination of functions and resources tracked together.\nIt is worth mentioning that while it is always possible, for instance, to encode version identifiers as part of function or application names or namespaces, however such implicit versioning is less advantageous than the presence of dedicated mechanisms for version management.\nAdditionally, a platform might not support version management on the serverless application level in case no notion of an application is present. Due to the event-driven nature of FaaS the event sources support plays an important role in deciding whether the platform is suitable for given development requirements.\nFor instance, one of the common FaaS use cases is when a function needs to be exposed as an Endpoint via an API Gateway .\nSubsequently, several endpoint-related aspects can be considered here, e.g., whether a Synchronous Call or an Asynchronous Call is supported and which protocols can be used for performing such calls, e.g., HTTP or gRPC.\nMoreover, it might be needed to use a custom endpoint’s name instead of the default resource name assigned when exposing the function as an endpoint, i.e., Endpoint Customization must be supported.\nIn addition, in case a secure communication via HTTPS is required, a platform must provide TLS Support. The next dimension of event sources encapsulates different Data Store types.\nSince serverless applications comprise non-managed components, we consider only the higher-level storage types  such as File Level which includes object stores like AWS S3, and Database Mode that covers SQL and NoSQL databases like Azure CosmosDB. Another relevant event source is the Scheduler, which allows invoking functions on a scheduled basis.\nTypically, internally these sources are implemented using cron jobs, hence developers might need to understand the subtle differences in the required format of cron expressions. Such event source dimensions as Message Queue and Stream Processing Platform are the next important parts for FaaS platforms.\nBeing one of the main integration mechanisms, messaging plays a crucial role in serverless component integration.\nExamples of messaging and streaming solutions include AWS SQS , Apache Kafka , and RabbitMQ . Generally, multiple event sources such as AWS Alexa , IBM Watson , or GitHub  are not related to particularly-large dimensions and instead represent particular use cases, which is covered by the Special-purpose Service dimension.\nThe list of supported specialized service offerings varies drastically from platform to platform and might be a major factor influencing the choice of a suitable platform . Finally, a platform might provide Event Source Integration options, which makes it possible to trigger functions using custom event sources.\nExamples of integration options might include plugin development or webhook-based integration.\nEssentially, the integration using proxy components such as event gateways or message queues is possible in the majority of the cases due to the loosely coupled nature of serverless applications.\nHowever, the crucial point here is that the platform’s documentation describes official ways to integrate custom event sources, for example, company’s proprietary applications emitting custom events, which hastens the overall development process. The next significant aspect characterizing FaaS platforms is related to possible ways of orchestrating multiple functions.\nApart from connecting functions by means of events and message queues, the specification of workflows  incorporating multiple functions is another way to orchestrate complex function interactions.\nTherefore, support for Function Orchestration brings additional benefits to platform users.\nIn this category, we consider only FaaS-oriented orchestrators such as AWS Step Functions or Azure Durable Functions following the definition of a function orchestrator provided in Section 3.1.\nEssentially, the majority of function orchestrators are separate offerings that are tailored to work with FaaS platforms and require a separate classification framework.\nFor instance, multiple criteria from the business view can also be used to classify function orchestrators, e.g., installation, licensing, or quotas.\nMoreover, other orchestration aspects, e.g., expressiveness and extensibility of the underlying workflow language, require a more detailed analysis. For the sake of brevity, we present the baseline information relevant for developers willing to start defining function orchestrations.\nFirstly, the Workflow Definition process might vary significantly , e.g., a custom Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) can be used to define a function workflow, or even a standard language such as BPEL .\nAnother option is to implement an orchestrating function in a general-purpose programming language such as Java, which will be responsible for calling other involved functions and aggregating the results.\nHere, the execution of orchestrating functions is controlled by the function orchestrator that handles stateful operations or error handling, for instance, making this option not valid for programming languages that are not explicitly supported by the orchestrator.\nAnother dimension to consider is the presence of documentation for Control Flow Constructs, e.g., to understand how parallel or sequential task execution can be modeled or whether it is possible to handle errors during the workflow execution.\nAdditionally, function orchestrators can impose Quotas on certain aspects of function workflows execution.\nFor example, the overall Execution Time might be restricted or the Task Input and Output Size can be limited to a particular value . Another crucial set of mechanisms is related to testing and debugging of standalone functions and entire serverless applications.\nWhile FaaS platforms are typically not responsible for the code development, additional ways to test Functional and Non-functional aspects of deployed functions can be provided, e.g., unit and integration testing, load testing, etc.\nFor example, a platform might offer mechanisms for facilitating unit testing with platform-specific libraries, or verifying function invocation using dedicated CLI commands.\nMoreover, a combination of Local and Remote debugging mechanisms might be provided by the platform.\nIn all these cases, both platform-native and third-party tooling may provide the possible set of solutions. The presence of mechanisms for observing serverless applications is a crucial factor for deciding on the FaaS platform.\nFor instance, platforms might provide various Logging and Monitoring options including both platform-native tooling and third-party tooling.\nAdditionally, platforms can provide documented ways to integrate existing tools, e.g., using a push-based or pull-based integration approaches. The next category groups together dimensions related to facilitating delivering developed applications.\nTo hasten application deployment, various Deployment Automation tools can be supported by the platform.\nFor example, a platform-native deployment automation tool such as AWS Cloud Formation , or a third-party tools such as the Serverless Framework  can be present.\nMoreover, presence of documented CI/CD Pipelining ways can facilitate the DevOps processes. The ability to use existing applications as a basis for implementation as well as having access to exemplary code and configuration snippets can facilitate reducing the time to market.\nEssentially, we distinguish two separate dimensions of Code Reuse, namely the availability of supported Function Marketplaces, and Code Sample Repositories which are actively-maintained by the platform’s provider or open source community. Finally, FaaS platforms might provide various Access Management options related to using the platform from both, developer’s and user’s perspectives.\nFor example, a platform can provide native or support external Authentication mechanisms.\nAdditionally, there might be supported Access Control mechanisms for defining the access rules for functions and related resources that interact with them, e.g., forbidding a function to access a particular data store resources.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: requirements on, for example, the way functions have to be implemented , the source code development can also be simplified via plugins for popular IDEs and Text Editors such as IntelliJ IDEA [ref]44 or Visual Studio Code  that provide support, e.g., for platform-specific syntax highlighting or automated code packaging.\nMoreover, a platform can provide Client Libraries for a set of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
