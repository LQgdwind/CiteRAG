      "content": "Paper Title: Holistic Interaction Transformer Network for Action Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpatio-temporal action detection is the task of recognizing actions in space and in time. In this regard, it is fundamentally different and more challenging than plain action detection, whose goal is to label an entire video with a single class. A sound spatio-temporal action detection framework aims to deeply learn the information in each video frame to correctly label each person in the frame. It should also keep a link between neighboring frames to better understand activities with continuous properties such as “open” - “close” [ref]1 [ref]5 [ref]14  . In recent years, more robust frameworks have been introduced that explicitly consider the relationship between the spatial entities   since if two persons are in the same frame, they are likely to be interacting with each other. However, using only person features is insufficient for capturing object-related action (e.g., volleyball spiking). Others try to understand the relationship not only between persons on the frame but also their surrounding objects  . These methods have two main shortcomings. First, they only rely on objects with high detection confidence which might result in ignoring important objects that may be too small to be detected or unknown to the off-the-shelf detector. For example, in Figure 1, none of the objects the actors are interacting with are detected. Secondly, these models struggle to detect actions related to objects not present in the frame. For instance, consider the action “point to (an object)”. It is possible that the object the actor is pointing at is not in the current frame. Figure 1 illustrates one of our motivations for undertaking this research. Most humans’ actions are contingent on what they do with their hands and their poses when executing specific actions. The person on the left is “picking up/lifting (something)” which is not noticeable even by humans. Still, our model is able to capture this action since we consider the person’s hand features and the pose of the subject (the bending position is typical of someone picking up something). A similar issue occurs with the person on the right who is “sitting and holding (an object)”. The man is holding a cup, but the object detector does not find the object, probably because it is very small or highly transparent. Using hand features, our model implicitly focuses on these challenging objects. Our proposed Holistic Interaction Transformer (HIT) network uses fine-grained context, including person pose, hands, and objects, to construct a bi-modal interaction structure. Each modality comprises three main components: person interaction, object interaction, and hand interaction. Each of these components learns valuable local action patterns. We then use an Attentive Fusion Mechanism to combine the different modalities before learning temporal information from neighboring frames that help us better detect the actions occurring in the current frame.\nWe perform experiments on the J-HMDB , UCF101-24 , Multisports  and AVA  datasets, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the first three while being competitive with the SOTA methods on AVA. The main contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows: We propose a novel framework that combines RGB, pose and hand features for action detection. We introduce a bi-modal Holistic Interaction Transformer (HIT) network that combines different kinds of interactions in an intuitive and meaningful way. We propose an Attentive Fusion Module (AFM) that works as a selective filter to keep the most informative features from each modality and an Intra-Modality Aggregator (IMA) for learning useful action representations within the modalities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three of the most challenging spatio-temporal action detection datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: video frame to correctly label each person in the frame.
