MU methods can be computationally intensive, time-consuming, or data-dependent, and resource constraints pose significant challenges in their practical implementation . Some common types of resource constraints in MU include: Computational resources such as processing power, memory, or storage, may be intensive when required to effectively train or apply debiasing models . Several deep learning-based unlearning methods may require large-scale neural networks or extensive computational resources for training, which may not be readily available in resource-constrained environments or in applications with low-power devices . Time constraints for when unlearning techniques may require significant time to train or apply, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex models [ref]102. Time constraints can be particularly challenging in real-time or online learning scenarios, where timely debiasing or unlearning is critical . For example, in time-sensitive applications such as fraud detection or online advertising, the time required for unlearning may impact overall system performance or responsiveness. Data availability particularly for labeled data can be costly in scenarios where unlearning techniques require labeled data for training, validation, or fine-tuning [ref]52. Data availability constraints may arise when dealing with sensitive or proprietary data, or when data collection is time-consuming or expensive 7. Lack of data availability can impact the effectiveness and generalizability of unlearning techniques, as they may not have access to sufficient data to effectively mitigate biases. Addressing resource constraints requires careful consideration of the available resources and the specific requirements of the unlearning techniques. Some potential approaches to mitigate resource constraints in MU include: Model optimization for the computational resources used by unlearning techniques by using techniques such as model compression, model quantization or model approximation. These techniques can reduce the computational overhead of unlearning methods and enable their deployment in resource-constrained environments or on low-power devices  8. Parallelization to leverage parallel computing techniques, such as distributed computing, multi-core processors or GPUs, can accelerate the training or application of unlearning techniques. Parallelization can help overcome computational resource constraints and expedite the debiasing or unlearning process 9 . Online and incremental learning approaches that update the debiasing or unlearning models in an online or incremental manner, without requiring complete retraining . Online and incremental learning can be more time-efficient and resource-friendly compared to batch training methods, as they update the models incrementally based on new data rather than retrain the entire model from scratch  . Transfer learning techniques such as fine-tuning or domain adaptation, to leverage pre-trained models or knowledge from related tasks or domains . Transfer learning can help overcome data availability constraints by leveraging knowledge learned from other sources, reducing the reliance on labeled data for training unlearning models. Data augmentation techniques such as data synthesis, data generation, or data simulation, to augment the available data and create synthetic data points for training unlearning models. Data augmentation can help overcome the challenge by generating additional training data, which can improve the effectiveness and generalizability of unlearning techniques   .\n\nReference markers found: [102]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]102: in applications with low-power devices . Time constraints for when unlearning techniques may require significant time to train or apply, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex models [ref]102. Time constraints can be particularly challenging in real-time or online learning scenarios, where timely debiasing or unlearning is critical . For example, in time-sensitive applications\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
