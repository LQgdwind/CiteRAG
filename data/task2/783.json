      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Partition Selection for Big-Data Workloads using Summary Statistics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we discuss related work in sampling-based AQP, data skipping, and partition-level sampling. Sampling-based AQP.  Sampling-based approximate query processing has been extensively studied, where query results are estimated from a carefully chosen subset of the data . A number of techniques have been proposed to improve upon simple row-level random sampling, for example, by using auxiliary data structures such as an outlier index  or by biasing the samples towards small groups  . Prior work has shown that, despite the improvements in sampling techniques, it is often difficult to construct a sample pool that offers good results for arbitrary queries given feasible storage budgets 4. Instead of computing and storing samples apriori   , our work makes sampling decisions exclusively during query optimization. Prior works have used learning to improve the sampling efficiency for AQP. One line of work uses learning to model the dataset and reduce the number of samples required to answer queries . Similarly, prior work tries to learn the underlying distribution that generates the dataset from queries, and relies on the learned model to reduce sample size over time . Our work is closer to works that use learned models to improve the design of the sampling scheme. Recent work proposes a learned stratified sampling scheme wherein the model predictions are used as stratification criteria [ref]56. However, the work focuses on row-level samples and on count queries; we support a broader scope of queries with aggregates and group bys and work with partition-level samples. In the evaluation, we compare against a scheme inspired by learned stratified sampling. Data Skipping.  Our work is also closely related to prior works on data skipping which studied the problems of optimizing data layouts  [ref]55   and indexing   , improving data skipping given a query workload. Building on the observation that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to find a data layout that offers optimal data skipping for all queries, we instead choose to work with data in situ. Researchers and practitioners have also looked at ways to use statistics and metadata to prune partitions that are irrelevant to the query. The proposed approaches range from using simple statistics such as min and max to check for predicate ranges  , to deriving complex pruning rules for queries with joins 3. Our work is directly inspired by this line of work and extends deterministic pruning to probabilistic partition selection. Partition-level sampling.  Researchers have long recognized the I/O benefits of partition-level sampling over row-level sampling 9 . Partition-level samples have been used to build statistics such as histograms and distinct value estimates for query optimizers  . Prior work has studied combining row-level and partition-level Bernoulli style sampling for SUM, COUNT, and AVG queries, in which one can adjust the overall sampling rate but each sample is treated equally 5. Our work more closely resembles importance sampling where we sample more important partitions with higher probability. Partition level sampling is also studied in the context of online aggregation (OLA) where query estimates can be progressively refined as more data gets processed, and users can stop the processing when the answer reaches target accuracy  7 . Classic work in OLA assume that tuples are processed in a random order, which often require random shuffling as an expensive processing step . Our approach does not require random layout, and in fact, should not be used if the data layout is random. Prior work has also studied OLA over raw data, which requires an expensive tuple extraction step to process raw files . PS3 can work with data stored in any format as long as per-partition statistics are available and focuses on selecting fewer partitions instead of stopping processing early within a partition, since the most expensive operation for our setup is the I/O cost of reading the partition.\n\nReference markers found: [56]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]56: that use learned models to improve the design of the sampling scheme.
