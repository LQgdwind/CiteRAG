      "content": "Paper Title: A Comprehensive Overview on 5G-and-Beyond Networks with UAVs: From Communications to Sensing and Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBesides multiple access schemes, promising techniques to prolong the lifetime of MTDs have also been proposed including energy conservation schemes and wireless power transfer (WPT) techniques   [ref]209    . Particularly, WPT provides several competitive advantages over the other energy harvesting techniques such as its continuous availability and long service range. However, the performance of energy harvesting at the MTDs critically depends on the locations of the power sources (e.g., BS, WiFi, etc.). For MTDs that are close the power sources, a sufficient amount of energy can be harvested, conversely, for those which are far away from the power sources, energy harvesting may not be possible at all due to the high sensitivity of typical energy receivers  [ref]214. Fortunately, UAVs with their high mobility provide a new promising solution to tackle these shortcoming of WPT. The first relevant work  studied a UAV-mounted energy transmitter broadcasting wireless energy to charge two MTDs. The results showed that when the distance between the two MTDs is very small, the Pareto boundary of the energy region can be achieved by fixing the UAV’s horizontal position. In contrast, when the distance between the two MTDs is large, to achieve the Pareto boundary of the energy region, the UAV should fly and hover between the two MTDs. Subsequently, this work was extended to a more general setup with multiple MTDs in  where the authors studied two different objective functions, namely the maximization of the sum energy harvested by all the MTDs and the max-min energy harvested among MTDs. Different from the above works, which obtained locally optimal solutions, a globally optimal one-dimension UAV trajectory design was developed with the aim of maximizing the minimum energy received by either one of the MTDs . In addition, UAV-aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is drawing considerably attention in the research community . Specifically, receiver devices in WPCN first harvest energy from the signals sent by the UAV in the downlink, and then utilize\nthe harvested energy to transmit information to the UAV in the uplink. Depending on the configuration of the UAVs, the UAV-aided WPCN can be classified into two categories. The first is the integrated UAV-aided WPCN, where the energy transmitter and information receiver are carried by one UAV  [ref]219  .\nThe other is the separated UAV-aided WPCN, where the energy transmitter and information receiver are installed on two different UAVs  . Specifically, the system energy maximization problem and the max-min throughput optimization problem in UAV-enabled WPCNs were studied in  and [ref]219, respectively. Then,  extends the work in [ref]219 to a two-user interference channel for WPCN employing two UAVs. In , the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based algorithm was proposed to tackle the max-min optimization problem in a general multi-UAV enabled WPCN.\nFurthermore, UAV-enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) was proposed recently, where the UAV is deployed as an aerial BS to simultaneously send\ninformation and energy to the receivers on the ground   . Specifically, the UAV’s trajectory, transmit power, and the users’ power splitting ratios were jointly optimized to maximize the minimum achievable rate among the users with their harvested energy constraints, whereas in , the max-min harvested energy among users was considered subject to users’ achievable rate constraints. An overview on UAV-enabled SWIPT was presented in  by considering the context of IoT works for emergency communications. On the other hand, different from terrestrial BSs which are connected to the power grid, UAVs are typically powered by on-board batteries with limited energy storage capacity, which thus drastically limits their endurance. To overcome the short flight time of UAV, several techniques have been proposed, which can be classified into two categories: external-powered UAV and mechanical dynamic optimization.\n\nReference markers found: [209]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]209: Besides multiple access schemes, promising techniques to prolong the lifetime of MTDs have also been proposed including energy conservation schemes and wireless power transfer (WPT) techniques   [ref]209    .
