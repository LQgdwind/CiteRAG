      "content": "Paper Title: SAT Solving for Variants of First-Order Subsumption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost formal verification approaches use automated reasoners in their backend\nto, for example, discharge verification conditions   [ref]3, produce/block\ncounter-examples    [ref]7, or enforce security and privacy\nproperties   0 1. All these approaches crucially\ndepend on the efficiency of the underlying reasoning procedures,\nranging from SAT/SMT solving 2 3 4 to first-order\nproving 5 6 7 8.\nIn this paper, we focus on effective extensions of first-order theorem proving with SAT-based reasoning, improving the state-of-the-art in proving first-order (program)\nproperties. The leading algorithmic approach in first-order theorem proving is saturation 7 6.\nWhile the concept of saturation is relatively unknown outside of the theorem\nproving community, similar algorithms that are used in other areas, such as\nGröbner basis computation 9, can be considered examples of\nsaturation algorithms. The key idea in saturation theorem proving is to reduce the problem of\nproving the validity of a first-order formula A𝐴A to the problem of establishing\nunsatisfiability of ¬A𝐴\\lnot A by using a sound inference system.\nThat is, instead of proving A𝐴A, we refute ¬A𝐴\\lnot A, by selecting and applying inferences rules.\nIn this paper, we focus on saturation algorithms\nusing the superposition calculus, which is the\nmost commonly\nused inference system for first-order logic with equality 0. During saturation, the first-order prover keeps a set of\nusable clauses C1,…,Cksubscript𝐶1…subscript𝐶𝑘C_{1},\\ldots,C_{k} with k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0.\nThis is the set of clauses that the prover\nconsiders as possible premises for inferences.\nAfter applying an inference with one or more usable clauses\nas premises, the consequence Ck+1subscript𝐶𝑘1C_{k+1} is added to the set of usable clauses.\nThe number of usable clauses is an important factor for the efficiency of proof search.\nA naive saturation algorithm that keeps all derived clauses in the usable set\nwould not scale in practice.\nOne reason is that first-order formulas in general yield infinitely\nmany consequences.\nFor example, consider the clause where x𝑥x is a universally quantified variable ranging over the\nalgebraic datatype list, where list elements are integers; 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒\\mathit{positive} is a unary predicate over list such that 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥\\mathit{positive}(x) is valid iff all elements of x𝑥x are\nnonnegative integers; and 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒\\mathit{reverse} is a unary function symbol\nreversing a list. As such, clause (1)\nasserts that the reverse of a list x𝑥x of\nnonnegative integers is also a list of nonnegative integers (which\nis clearly valid). Note that, when having clause (1) as a usable clause during proof search,\nthe clause ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)) can be derived for any n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1 from clause (1). Adding ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)) to the set of usable clauses\nwould, however, blow up the search space unnecessarily. This is\nbecause ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)) is a logical consequence of\nclause (1), and hence, if a formula A𝐴A can be proved\nusing ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)), then A𝐴A is also provable using\nclause (1). Yet, storing ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)) as usable formulas is highly inefficient as n𝑛n can be\narbitrarily large. To avoid such and similar cases of unnecessarily increasing the set of\nusable formulas during proof search,\nfirst-order theorem provers implement the notion of\nredundancy 1, by extending the standard superposition\ncalculus with term/clause ordering and literal selection functions.\nThese orderings and selection functions are used to eliminate\nso-called redundant clauses from the search space, where redundant\nclauses are logical consequences of smaller clauses w.r.t. the considered\nordering.\nIn our example above, the clause\n¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x))\nwould be a redundant clause as\nit is a logical consequence of clause (1), with\nclause (1) being smaller (i.e. using fewer symbols)\nthan ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)).\nAs such,\nif clause (1) is already a usable\nclause, saturation\nalgorithms implementing redundancy should ideally not store ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)) as usable clauses.\nTo detect and reason about redundant clauses, saturation\nalgorithms with redundancy extend the superposition inference system\nwith so-called simplification rules.\nSimplification rules do not add new formulas to the set of (usable)\nclauses in the search space,\nbut instead simplify and/or delete redundant formulas from the search\nspace,\nwithout destroying the refutational completeness of\nsuperposition:\nif a formula A𝐴A is valid, then ¬A𝐴\\neg A can be refuted\nusing the superposition\ncalculus extended with simplification rules.\nIn our example above, this means that if ¬A𝐴\\neg A can be refuted using\n¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)), then ¬A𝐴\\neg A can be refuted in\nthe superposition\ncalculus extended with simplification rules, without using\n¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)) but using\nclause (1) instead. Ensuring that simplification rules are applied efficiently for eliminating\nredundant clauses is, however, not trivial.\nIn this paper, we show that\nSAT-based approaches can effectively\nidentify the application of simplification rules during saturation,\nimproving thus the efficiency of saturation algorithms with redundancy. While redundancy is\na powerful criterion for keeping the set of clauses used in proof\nsearch as small as possible, establishing whether an arbitrary first-order\nformula is redundant is as hard as proving whether it is valid.\nFor example, in order to derive that ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)) is redundant in our example above, the prover\nshould establish (among other conditions) that it is a logical consequence\nof (1), which essentially requires proving based on\nsuperposition.\nTo reduce the burden of proving redundancy,\nfirst-order provers implement sufficient\nconditions towards deriving redundancy, so that these conditions can\nbe efficiently checked (ideally using only syntactic arguments and no\nproofs). One\nsuch condition comes with the notion of subsumption, yielding\none of the most impactful simplification rules in superposition-based\ntheorem proving 2 and SAT solving 3. The intuition behind first-order subsumption is that a (potentially large) instance of a clause C𝐶C\ndoes not convey any additional information over C𝐶C,\nand thus it should be avoided to have both C𝐶C and its instance in\nthe set of usable clauses; to this end, we say that the instance of\nC𝐶C is subsumed by C𝐶C.\nMore formally, a clause C𝐶C subsumes another clause D𝐷D if there is a substitution σ𝜎\\sigma\nsuch that σ​(C)𝜎𝐶\\sigma(C) is a submultiset of D𝐷D111we consider a clause C𝐶C as a multiset of its literals.\nIn such a case, subsumption removes the subsumed clause D𝐷D from the clause set.\nTo continue our example above, a unit clause 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒m​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑥\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{m}(x)), with m≥1𝑚1m\\geq 1,\nwould prevent us from deriving ¬𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(x)∨𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒​(𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒n​(x))𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒superscript𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑥\\lnot\\mathit{positive}(x)\\lor\\mathit{positive}(\\mathit{reverse}^{n}(x)) for any n≥m𝑛𝑚n\\geq m,\nand hence eliminate an infinite branch of clause derivations from the search space. To detect possible inferences of subsumption and related rules,\nstate-of-the-art provers use a two-step approach 4:\n(i) retrieve a small set of candidate clauses, using literal filtering\nmethods,\nand then\n(ii) check whether any of the candidate clauses represents an actual instance of the rule.\nStep (i) has been well researched over the years, leading to highly efficient\nindexing solutions 5 6 4.\nInterestingly, step (ii) has not received much attention,\neven though it is known that checking subsumption relations between multi-literal clauses\nis an NP-complete problem 7.\nAlthough indexing in step (i) allows the first-order prover to skip\nstep (ii) in many cases,\nthe application of (ii) in the remaining cases may remain problematic\n(due to NP-hardness).\nFor example, while profiling subsumption in the world-leading\ntheorem prover Vampire 6, we observed\nsubsumption applications, and in particular calls to the literal-matching\nalgorithm of step (ii), that consume more than 20 seconds of running\ntime.\nGiven that millions of such matchings are performed during a typical\nfirst-order proof attempt,\nwe consider such cases highly inefficient, calling for improved\nsolutions towards step (ii). In this paper we address this demand and\nshow that a tailored SAT-based encoding can significantly improve the\nliteral matching, and thus subsumption, in first-order theorem\nproving. We also advocate the flexibility of SAT solving for variants of subsumption, in particular when combining subsumption with resolution. We bring the\nfollowing main contributions. (1)\nWe propose a generic SAT-based encoding for capturing potential\napplications of both subsumption and subsumption resolution in first-order theorem proving (Sections 4-5).\nA solution to our SAT-based encoding gives a concrete application\nof subsumption and/or subsumption resolution, allowing the first-order prover to apply that\ninstance of subsumption (resolution) as a simplification rule during\nsaturation. Moreover, our encoding is complete in the sense that any instance of subsumption (resolution) is a model of our SAT problem (Theorems 5.11, 5.18 and 5.22). (2)\nWe tailor encodings of subsumption and subsumption resolution for effective SAT-based redundancy elimination (Section 6). Importantly, we adjust unit propagation and\nconflict resolution in SAT solving towards efficient handling of subsumption and subsumption resolution (Section 6.1). Our resulting SAT-based redundancy approaches are directly integrated in saturation (Section 7), without changing the underlying design of efficient saturation. (3)\nWe establish a flexible learning approach to choose between encodings with different properties. We detail how to train decision trees to obtain the best complexity-efficiency trade-off in choosing encodings for subsumption resolution (Section 8).\nAs part of an empirical study, we analyse the utility of solving subsumption and subsumption resolution problems for a large portion of our computation budget. We introduce a method to choose an appropriate cutoff threshold and stop the SAT search prematurely. We empirically show that solely solving simple instances of subsumption and subsumption resolution is not a good solution, even with an educated timeout strategy. (4) We implemented our SAT-based redundancy approach as a new SAT\nsolver in the\nVampire theorem prover.\nWe empirically evaluate our approach on the standard benchmark library TPTP\n(Section 9).\nOur experiments demonstrate that using SAT solving for deciding and applying\nsubsumption and subsumption resolution brings clear improvements in the saturation process\nof first-order proving,\nfor example, improving the (time) performance of the prover\nby a factor of 1.361.361.36 when both subsumption and subsumption resolution are enabled. This paper is an extended version of the conference papers\n“First-Order Subsumption via SAT Solving” 8\nand\n“SAT-Based Subsumption Resolution” 9\npublished at FMCAD 2022 and CADE 2023, respectively. In Section 5, we extend the SAT-based subsumption framework of 8 to subsumption resolution and complemented 9 with unifying support for both subsumption and subsumption resolution.\nIn Section 6 we extend the SAT solving algorithms of 8 9 to solve both subsumption and subsumption resolution.\nAs such, Sections 4-6 unify the approaches of 8 9 into a flexible technique for SAT-based redundancy checking in saturation. Our paper therefore adjusts the texts of 8 9 and extends their results with formal theoretical arguments and proofs. In addition, this paper brings the following new contributions when compared\nto our papers 8 9.\nFirst, we introduce a symbolic approach to combine SAT-based encodings with learning heuristics to dynamically select the most promising encoding during run-time (Section 8.2).\nSecond, we expand preprocessing via pruning techniques and use our SAT solver only on hard(er) problems (Section 6.2). Here, we provide a faster multilayered filter to detect unsatisfiable instances before they even reach the SAT engine.\nThird, we bring in an empirically motivated approach to trade completeness of SAT-based subsumption (resolution) for computation time, by cutting off early the harder instances of subsumption and subsumption resolution (Section 8.1).\nWe show that subsuming simple clauses is not enough in practice, strengthening our argument for more scalable algorithms in the context of redundancy elimination.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Most formal verification approaches use automated reasoners in their backend\nto, for example, discharge verification conditions   [ref]3, produce/block\ncounter-examples    [ref]7, or enforce security and privacy\nproperties   0 1.
