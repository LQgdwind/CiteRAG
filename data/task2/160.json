      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination by Spatial Differentiation for Traffic Signal Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCoordination among agents plays a critical role in MARL algorithms, either centralized or decentralized. In this paper, we propose a coordination mechanism among distributed agents. Each agent is based on Dueling-Double-Deep Q Network (D3QN)[ref]22[ref]23[ref]24, which is one of the best Q value-based model until now. A detailed description of it can be found in Appendix A. We found that some studies already use D3QN directly on the TSC problem , but it can only be used as an independent Q-learning (IQL) method in the multi-intersection problem. For the TSC problem, the idea of distributed agents is wise and what we need is an appropriate decentralized coordination mechanism. Therefore, we propose γ𝛾\\gamma-Reward framework for coordination (Figure 3). The basic theory of DRL inspires the main idea of this article. For the TSC problem, not only the temporal decision should be regarded as MDP, the road network itself is more like a Markov Chain since the decision of the current intersection will affect other intersections in the future. So it should consider not only the TD-error (see Appendix A.1) in time, but also a “TD-error” in space which is defined as the spatial differentiation. Figure 4 shows a diagram of multi-intersection road network with 3×3333\\times 3 intersections. Since the decision of intersection I22subscript𝐼22I_{22} at time t𝑡t will affect the next intersection I23subscript𝐼23I_{23} at time t+n𝑡𝑛t+n, the result of intersection I22subscript𝐼22I_{22} at time t𝑡t should be affected not only by the current intersection reward rtI22subscriptsuperscript𝑟subscript𝐼22𝑡r^{I_{22}}_{t}, but also by the reward rt+njsubscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑗𝑡𝑛r^{j}_{t+n} of the surrounding intersections at time t+n𝑡𝑛t+n, where j∈I12,I21,I23,I32𝑗subscript𝐼12subscript𝐼21subscript𝐼23subscript𝐼32j\\in{I_{12},I_{21},I_{23},I_{32}}. The formula of spatial differentiation is as follows: Where 𝒩I22={I12,I21,I23,I32}subscript𝒩subscript𝐼22subscript𝐼12subscript𝐼21subscript𝐼23subscript𝐼32\\mathcal{N}_{I_{22}}=\\{I_{12},I_{21},I_{23},I_{32}\\} represents the four intersections around intersection I22subscript𝐼22I_{22}. The parameter n𝑛n is called delay span which represents the time span of most vehicles reach the next intersection after current action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t}. It is related to the length of the road, the average velocity on the exiting lane and sample interval. The whole formula can also be treated as value function of reward, thus it is a spatial differentiation of reward-value function. In Equation 2, Rt+nj/rtjsubscriptsuperscript𝑅𝑗𝑡𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑗𝑡{R^{j}_{t+n}}/{r^{j}_{t}} shows the change of traffic capacity at intersection j𝑗j between time t𝑡t and t+n𝑡𝑛t+n. If Rt+nj/rtjsubscriptsuperscript𝑅𝑗𝑡𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑗𝑡{R^{j}_{t+n}}/{r^{j}_{t}} is greater than threshold c𝑐c, it indicates that the traffic capacity of the intersection j𝑗j is deteriorated, in other words, the decision of the intersection I22subscript𝐼22I_{22} at the time t𝑡t will cause the adjacent intersection j𝑗j to be more congested; conversely, Rt+nj/rtjsubscriptsuperscript𝑅𝑗𝑡𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑗𝑡{R^{j}_{t+n}}/{r^{j}_{t}} less than c𝑐c indicates that the capacity of intersection j𝑗j is improved, and the decision of the intersection I22subscript𝐼22I_{22} at time t𝑡t is good for j𝑗j.\nThrough some region transformations, the differential item is served as a penalty. It finally multiplies by a spatial discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma as an amendment to reward. Since the training goal of DRL is to maximize the reward function, the existence of the penalty item forces the agent to pay attention to the situation around the intersection while improving its own policy. This equation is also in line with the idea of MARL with networked agents which dates back to Varshavskaya et al. . 𝒬​𝒟𝒬𝒟\\mathcal{QD}-learning further gives a convergence proof of this kind of MARL algorithm. It incorporates the idea of consensus + innovation to the standard Q-learning algorithm and has the following Q-value update equation: where the term after αt,o,asubscript𝛼𝑡𝑜𝑎\\alpha_{t,o,a} denotes a local innovation potential that incorporates newly obtained observations, and the term after βt,o,asubscript𝛽𝑡𝑜𝑎\\beta_{t,o,a} is a consensus potential (agent collaboration) which captures the difference of Q-value estimates from its neighbors. Analogously, our Q-value update equation can be changed as follows: The spatial differentiation term denotes the consensus like 𝒬​𝒟𝒬𝒟\\mathcal{QD}-learning and we further construct the communication in the temporal domain and the spatial domain at the same time. Although Equation 2 uses future information which sounds contrary to the causality, it is achievable in the programming. Since we use Q-learning as a basic model which is off-policy, it saves the trajectory of state-action pair and the obtained reward into a replay buffer. In this way, the raw reward rtisubscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑖𝑡r^{i}_{t} is saved first and then corrected after n𝑛n steps. Therefore the calculation process can be realized (see Appendix B for pseudocode).\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: role in MARL algorithms, either centralized or decentralized.
