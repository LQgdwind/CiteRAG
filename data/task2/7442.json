      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty Quantification via Stable Distribution Propagation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural networks are part of various applications in our daily lives, including safety-critical domains such as health monitoring, driver assistance, or weather forecasting.\nAs a result, it becomes important to not only improve the overall accuracy but also to quantify uncertainties in neural network decisions.\nA prominent example is autonomous driving [ref]1 , where a neural network is not only supposed to detect and classify various objects like other cars or pedestrians on the road but also to know how certain it is about this decision and to allow, e.g., for human assistance for uncertain cases.\nSuch prediction uncertainties can arise from different sources, e.g., model uncertainties and data uncertainties [ref]3 [ref]4  .\nThese types of uncertainties have received considerable attention over the years.\nThere is a line of work focusing on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection  , e.g., via orthogonal certificates  or via Bayesian neural networks      .\nAnother line of works focuses on quantifying data uncertainties, e.g., via uncertainty propagation     0, ensembles 1, quantile regression  2, post-hoc recalibration 3, or also via Bayesian neural networks 4.\nData uncertainties can primarily arise from two important sources:\n(i) input uncertainties, i.e., uncertainties arising in the observation of the input features, and (ii) output uncertainties, i.e., uncertainties arising in the observation of the ground truth labels.\nIn this work, we primarily focus on quantifying how input uncertainties lead to prediction uncertainties, but also introduce an extension for quantifying input and output uncertainties jointly by propagating through a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN).\n\n\nTo address this task,\nthe following work focuses\non propagating distributions through neural networks.\nWe consider the problem of evaluating f​(x+ϵ)𝑓𝑥italic-ϵf(x+\\epsilon), where f𝑓f is a neural network, x𝑥x is an input data point, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is a random noise variable (stable distribution, e.g., Gaussian).\nTo this end, we approximate f​(x+ϵ)𝑓𝑥italic-ϵf(x+\\epsilon) in a parametric distributional form, which is typically a location and a scale, e.g., for the Gaussian distribution, this corresponds to a mean and a covariance matrix.\nEvaluating the true output distribution Y𝑌Y (f​(x+ϵ)∼Ysimilar-to𝑓𝑥italic-ϵ𝑌f(x+\\epsilon)\\sim Y)\nexactly is intractable, so the goal is to find a close parametric approximation, ideally minμy,Σy⁡D​(𝒩​(μy,Σy),Y)subscriptsubscript𝜇𝑦subscriptΣ𝑦𝐷𝒩subscript𝜇𝑦subscriptΣ𝑦𝑌\\min_{\\mu_{y},\\Sigma_{y}}D\\big{(}\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{y},\\Sigma_{y}),Y\\big{)} for some distributional metric or divergence D𝐷D.\n\n\nDue to the complexity of neural networks, specifically many non-linearities, it is intractable to compute the distribution of f​(x+ϵ)𝑓𝑥italic-ϵf(x+\\epsilon) analytically.\nA straightforward way to approximate location and scale, i.e., the mean and (co-)variances, μ𝜇\\mu and ΣΣ\\Sigma, of f​(x+ϵ)𝑓𝑥italic-ϵf(x+\\epsilon) is to use a Monte Carlo (MC) estimate.\nHowever, this approach can often become computationally prohibitive as it requires evaluating a neural network f𝑓f a large number of times.\nAdditionally, the quality of the approximation for the covariances as well as the quality of their gradients deteriorates when the data is high-dimensional, e.g., for images.\nWe, therefore, focus on analytical parametric approximations of f​(x+ϵ)𝑓𝑥italic-ϵf(x+\\epsilon).\n\n\nThis work proposes a technique, Stable Distribution Propagation (SDP), for propagating stable distributions, specifically Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, through ReLU-activated neural networks.\nPropagating the locations (e.g., means for the case of Gaussian) through a layer corresponds to the regular application of the layer or the neural network.\nFor propagating scales (e.g., (co-)variances for the case of multivariate Gaussians), we can exactly propagate them through affine layers and further propose a local linearization for non-linear layers.\nThe motivation for this is as follows:\nWhile it is intractable to find an optimal μy,Σysubscript𝜇𝑦subscriptΣ𝑦\\mu_{y},\\Sigma_{y}, the problem can be separated into layer-wise problems using a divide-and-conquer strategy as, e.g., also done in moment matching approaches.\nWhile divide-and-conquer works, looking at the problem from the perspective of multiple layers and deep networks again shows that any errors in individual layers caused by respective approximations accumulate exponentially.\nTherefore, the proposed method also considers a more robust approximation.\nNamely, we rely on the total variation (TV) to find the distribution that maintains as much probability mass at exactly correct locations as possible to reduce the overall propagation error.\nAs the argmax-probability under respective distributions is intractable, we further propose a pairwise distribution loss function for classification tasks.\nOur evaluation for multiple-layer architectures confirms that this shows a better performance compared to marginal moment matching for multi-layer nets. Overall, the perspective of f​(x+ϵ)𝑓𝑥italic-ϵf(x+\\epsilon) allows assessing the sensitivity of the neural network for uncertainty quantification.\nIn particular, it allows assessing the effects of uncertainties due to input measurement errors (Figure 1, left).\nFurther, incorporating the sensitivity of a neural network during training can also enable selective prediction: because the method is able to regularize or minimize the output variance, the variance of predictions for observed data is minimized while the variance for predictions of unobserved data tends to be larger (Figure 1, right).\n\n\nStable Distribution Propagation (SDP) provides\nan efficient technique for propagating distributions with covariances (or correlated scales) that performs\n (i) competitively to moment matching approximations (DVIA) at a fraction of the computational cost and\n (ii) superior to covariance-free marginal moment matching approaches.\nTo our knowledge, our method is the first method to enable propagation of Cauchy distributions, or more generally the family of symmetric α𝛼\\alpha-stable distributions.\nTo empirically validate SDP, we\n (i) compare it to other distribution propagation approaches in a variety of settings covering total variation (TV) distance and Wasserstein distance;\n (ii) compare it to other uncertainty quantification methods on 8 UCI 5 regression tasks;\nand\n (iii) demonstrate the utility of Cauchy distribution propagation in selective prediction on MNIST 6 and EMNIST 7.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: forecasting.\nAs a result, it becomes important to not only improve the overall accuracy but also to quantify uncertainties in neural network decisions.\nA prominent example is autonomous driving [ref]1 , where a neural network is not only supposed to detect and classify various objects like other cars or pedestrians on the road but also to know how certain it is about this decision and to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
