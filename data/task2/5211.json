Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

To the best of our knowledge, these are the only methods for which papers are available. DD-PPO  applies end-to-end RL with large-scale distributed training. Habitat-Web  applies end-to-end imitation learning using human teleoperated demonstrations. OVRL  pretrains a visual encoder using DINO [ref]5 on images from the Omnidata dataset  before applying end-to-end RL. ProcTHOR  applies end-to-end RL on a large procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes. It currently holds the state-of-the-art SPL on HM3D. For MP3D, we compare PEANUT with eight other methods. Of these eight methods, five use end-to-end learning: DD-PPO , Habitat-Web , and OVRL  are described above. Red Rabbit 2 incorporates 6 auxiliary tasks for end-to-end RL. It is the winner of the 2021 Habitat ObjectNav Challenge. TreasureHunt [ref]29 artificially inserts objects from the YCB dataset  into MP3D scenes to provide additional data for end-to-end RL. The other three methods are modular methods: ANS  is a modular method that trains an RL-based goal selection policy to maximize area explored. PONI  is a modular method that predicts potential functions on the frontiers of a top-down map, and then selects goals by picking the highest-potential frontier. The potential function is a sum of the connected free space and the inverse distance to the target. Stubborn  is a modular method that simply sets the goal to be one of four corners of a local crop of the map, rotating when reaching a dead-end. It also fuses target detections across frames. It is currently the best-performing modular method on MP3D.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: applies end-to-end RL with large-scale distributed training.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
