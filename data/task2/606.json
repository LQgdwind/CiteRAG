      "content": "Paper Title: Self-healing Dilemmas in Distributed Systems: Fault Correction vs. Fault Tolerance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-healing mechanisms usually address different types of faults classified according to recent taxonomies  . Assuming reliable communication channels, faults are differentiated as follows : (i) Crash - agents stop responding and terminate. (ii) Omission - agents sporadically skip sending/receiving messages. (iii) Timing - agents do not complete a task in a certain time frame. (iv) Arbitrary (Byzantine)- agents deviate from the expected behavior and operate unpredictably. Another classification distinguishes between (i) transient, (ii) intermittent, (iii) permanent and (iv) Byzantine faults . While transient faults draw parallels with omission ones and are a result of a temporary affecting condition, e.g. network connectivity, intermittent faults are random, temporary and usually result of hardware failure. In contrast, crash hardware faults require repair of the root cause and are a subset of permanent faults. Byzantine faults result in corrupted/malicious agents sharing manipulated, forged or incorrect data. In large-scale decentralized systems, designing self-healing mechanisms exclusively for certain fault types is ineffective. Several such faults can co-occur, cascade or even have a cause-effect relationship resulting in vicious adaptation cycles, e.g. a faulty fault detection causing faulty fault correction and vice versa. Modeling the interplay of faults and formalizing complex fault scenarios as well as their impact on self-healing performance is fundamental and missing. In such fault scenarios, the reliability of fault detection plays a key role . Two main fault-detection approaches of periodic heartbeat messages and agent interactions are identified. The latter further distinguishes between timeout and missing callback detection. Replication   is a common approach that supports both fault tolerance and fault correction in terms of guarantying the availability of (backup) resources and repair modules for self-healing . Replication can be active vs. passive based on whether replicas are used only when faults occur , adaptive based on criteria for replication  , dynamic by switching on-the-fly replication schemes , or homogeneous vs. heterogeneous based on whether replicas are identical copies or equivalent processes . Replication is applied to check-point schemes based on rollback protocols  , consensus protocols and hybrid approaches . Replication methods are particularly applicable in multi-agent systems, for instance, group replication via proxy servers , replication of agents based on the criticality of their planned actions , adjustable group replication with a leader agents  or introducing a special class of agents for redundancy maintenance . New replication strategies designed for the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems are subject of recent work [ref]21 . Self-healing methods  can be preventive (proactive)  or reactive (resilient) . The former methods require prediction based on probabilistic modeling and monitoring [ref]24. The latter ones require learning capabilities from historic data and observations  . Despite the large body of work on fault correction and fault tolerance, a recent comprehensive review of such approaches for multi-agent systems identifies as imperative the need for generalized and standardized evaluation of fault-tolerance approaches . Another recent systematic evaluation of 36 state-of-the-art self-healing systems from the research communities of autonomic computing, self-adaptive, self-organizing and self-managing systems (ICAC, SASO, TAAS, SEAMS) is illustrated . Empirical assessments conclude that multiple input traces covering a vast spectrum of failure characteristics are required to predict the performance of a self-healing system. Therefore, generalized models that predict the impact of faults and their correction on large-scale decentralized systems are missing so far . Predicting without knowledge about the computational/application scenario, executed application algorithms and application data is challenging . Such models have the potential to fundamentally influence the understanding of how to design and deploy more cost-effective decentralized self-healing systems. What makes particularly challenging the inception of such general models is the absence of central control units, the agents’ autonomy, the network uncertainties and the non-determinism of system operations . In particular, failed processes are often indistinguishable from slow processes in asynchronous decentralized environments that inherit the impossibility of distributed consensus  . As a consequence, fault detection inherits such uncertainties  0 (is the process faulty or slow?), which in turn results in dilemmas on what self-healing adaptations to apply, i.e. fault correction vs. fault tolerance. This paper addresses these self-healing dilemmas.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: agents  or introducing a special class of agents for redundancy maintenance .
