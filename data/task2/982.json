      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Invariant Representations and Risks for Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost existing research on domain adaptation focuses on the unsupervised setting, i.e. the data from target domain are fully unlabeled. Recent deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods usually employ a conjoined architecture with two streams to represent the models for the source and target domains, respectively [ref]19. Besides the task loss on the labeled source domain, another alignment loss is designed to align the source and target domains, such as discrepancy loss [ref]1  [ref]19 [ref]21  , adversarial loss     , and self-supervision loss   0 1 2 3 4.\nSemi-DA deals with the domain adaptation problem where some target labels are available 5 6 7 8.  empirically observed that UDA methods often fail in improving accuracy in Semi-DA and proposed a min-max entropy approach that adversarially optimizes an adaptive few-shot model. Different from these works, our proposed method aims to align both the marginal feature distributions as well as the conditional distributions of the label over the features, which can overcome the limitations that exist in UDA methods that only align feature distributions .\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: unlabeled. Recent deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods usually employ a conjoined architecture with two streams to represent the models for the source and target domains, respectively [ref]19. Besides the task loss on the labeled source domain, another alignment loss is designed to align the source and target domains, such as discrepancy loss [ref]1  [ref]19 [ref]21  , adversarial\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
