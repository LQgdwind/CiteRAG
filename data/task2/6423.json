      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge Distillation via Token-level Relationship Graph\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaselines.  We compare our approach with two kinds of prevalent and advanced knowledge distillation baselines, i.e., individual distillation and relation-based (including graph-based) distillation: Individual distillation includes the vanilla KD , FitNet , AT , SP [ref]18, AB , DIST ,\nSemCKD [ref]7,\nDKD . Relation-based distillation includes SP [ref]18, RKD ,CRD , CC  and two graph-based distillations, i.e., IRG  and HKD . Datasets.  We assess the effectiveness of TRG on two widely used datasets: CIFAR-100  and ImageNet . The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of color-scaled images with dimensions 32×32323232\\times 32, featuring objects from 100 different classes. It is divided into a training set of 50,000 images and a validation set of 10,000 images. Additionally, we also conduct experiments on long-tailed CIFAR-100 (CIFAR-100-LT) , a modified version of CIFAR-100 where the number of instances in the minor classes is reduced. For large-scale tasks, we utilize the ImageNet dataset, where all the images are resized to dimensions (224×224224224224\\times 224). Similar to CIFAR-100-LT, we evaluate the classification performance on ImageNet-LT  (the long-tailed version of ImageNet-1K with imbalance rate of 101010), which serves as an experimental benchmark for testing on imbalanced datasets. We operate the standard data augmentation (i.e., flipping and random cropping) and normalization as conducted in [ref]35   on the above two datasets.\n\n Networks.  We conduct a series of classification with typical mainstream architectures and lightweight networks on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets. Our implementation for CIFAR-100 follows the practice in [ref]7. A variety of teacher-student pairs based on popular visual network architectures are tested, including ResNet [ref]35, VGG , WideResNet (WRN) , and several lightweight networks such as MobileNet  and ShuffleNet .\nIn CIFAR-100 training, we adapt ResNet and WideResNet to small-scale datasets by using PreAct layer [ref]35.\nWe modify the first convolutional layer of ResNet to the kernel size of 3×3333\\times 3, strides of 1, and padding of 1.\nFor the ImageNet evaluation, we further investigate the performance of our approach using Vision Transformer (ViT)-based networks. Following the architectural guidelines established by DeiT , we conduct experiments using DeiT models and assess their performance when combined with various existing KD methods.\n\n Training Details for CIFAR-100/CIFAR-100-LT.  For the training of CIFAR-100, we adopt SGD optimizier with 0.9 Nesterov momentum, the total training epoch is predetermined to 240, the warm-up epoch is set to 15, and we divide the learning rate by 10 at epochs 150, 180, and 210. The initial learning rate is set to 0.01 for lightweight architectures, and 0.05 for the other series. We train with weight decay 5​e−45superscript𝑒45e^{-4} for regularization. We set the temperature τ=4𝜏4\\tau=4 for conventional KD loss and the initial temperature τg=0.1subscript𝜏𝑔0.1\\tau_{g}=0.1 for graph-based contrastive loss.\n\n Training Details for ImageNet/ImageNet-LT. For training on the ImageNet dataset, we adopt the recommended practices provided by the PyTorch official documentation. Our models are trained by a total of 100 epochs for CNN-like networks and 200 epochs for ViT-based architectures (both use 10-epoch warm up). In CNN-based training, we initialize the learning rate to 0.1 and decrease it by a factor of 10 every 30 epochs. The batch size is set to 128×41284128\\times 4, and the weight decay rate is set to 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}. Additionally, we utilize a cosine schedule with a 10-epoch warm-up phase during training.\nIn ViT training, we use the AdamW  optimizer with the learning rate of 5​e−45superscript𝑒45e^{-4}. The learning rate is adjusted with the cosine annealing strategy. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments on the ImageNet dataset are conducted using 4 GPUs of RTX3090. The optimal results are determined by maximizing the top-1 accuracy on the validation set.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: advanced knowledge distillation baselines, i.e., individual distillation and relation-based (including graph-based) distillation: Individual distillation includes the vanilla KD , FitNet , AT , SP [ref]18, AB , DIST ,\nSemCKD [ref]7,\nDKD .
