      "content": "Paper Title: VLPD: Context-Aware Pedestrian Detection via Vision-Language Semantic Self-Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a research hot-spot of pedestrian detection, handling occlusion should make the best of limited information from visible parts of pedestrian, and also avoid the noisy one from occlusion by other pedestrians or non-human objects. On the one hand, part-aware methods handle the visible parts with other parts occluded by contextual objects. For example, OR-CNN  re-scores parts to highlight the visible ones. PRNet++[ref]33 progressively refines the predicted visible and full-body boxes. Extra labels of less frequently occluded heads facilitate HBAN8, JointDet [ref]5 and PedHunter . Some methods  0  handle the visible and full bodies by parallel branches. Moreover, DMSFLN  explores the feature distributions between both branches. On the other hand, crowd-aware methods are specialized to intra-class occlusion without context modeling. Some post-processing methods 5  9 focus on the over-suppression of dense predictions in crowd scenes, and the others 8 handle the under-suppression of sparse ones. For the heavily overlapped pedestrians, loss-based methods   0 identify them by learning representations. Differently, our proposed VLPD discriminates non-human occluders and pedestrians via the contrastive learning of PSC, on the basis of the self-supervised learning via self-generated explicit labels of semantic classes from VLS.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: objects.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
