      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Counterfactual Explanations Through the Lens of Adversarial Examples: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the increasing use of Machine learning (ML) models in critical domains, such as health care and law enforcement, it becomes important to ensure that their decisions are robust and explainable. To this end, several approaches have been proposed in recent literature to explain the complex behavior of ML models    . One such popular class of explanations designed to provide recourse to individuals adversely impacted by algorithmic decisions are counterfactual explanations 0 6  . For example, in a credit scoring model where an individual loan application is denied, a counterfactual explanation can highlight the minimal set of changes the individual can make to obtain a positive outcome  [ref]20. Algorithms designed to output counterfactual explanations often attempt to find a closest counterfactual for which the model prediction is positive 0 6  [ref]20. Adversarial examples, on the other hand, were proposed to highlight how vulnerabilities of ML models can be exploited by (malicious) adversaries    . These adversarial examples are usually also obtained by finding minimal perturbations to a given data instance such that the model prediction changes   . Conceptually, adversarial examples and counterfactual explanations solve a similar optimization problem  0 . Techniques generating adversarial examples and counterfactual explanations use distance or norm constraints in the objective function to enforce the notion of minimal perturbations. While adversarial methods generate instances that are semantically indistinguishable from the original instance, counterfactual explanations or algorithmic recourse111Note that counterfactual explanations, contrastive explanations, and recourses are used interchangeably in prior literature. Counterfactual/contrastive explanations serve as a means to provide recourse to individuals with unfavorable algorithmic decisions. We use these terms interchangeably as introduced and defined by Wachter et al. 0., encourage minimal changes to an input so that so that a user can readily act upon these changes to obtain the desired outcome. In addition, some methods in both lines of work use manifold-based constraints to find natural adversarial examples 1 or realistic counterfactual explanations by restricting them to lie on the data manifold  . While the rationale of producing a counterfactual close to the original instance is motivated by the desideratum that counterfactuals should be actionable and easily understandable, producing close instances on the other side of the decision boundary could just as easily indicate adversarial activity. This begs the question to what extent do counterfactual explanation algorithms return solutions that resemble adversarial examples. However, there has been little to no work on systematically analyzing the aforementioned connections between the literature on counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples. Present Work.\nIn this work, we approach the study of similarities between counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples from the perspective of counterfactual explanations for algorithmic recourse. Therefore, we consider consequential decision problems (e.g., loan applications) commonly employed in recourse literature and our choices of data modalities (i.e., tabular data) and algorithms are predominantly motivated by this literature.\nIn particular, we make one of the first attempts at establishing theoretical and empirical connections between state-of-the-art counterfactual explanation and adversarial example generation methods. More specifically, we analyze these similarities by bounding the distances between the solutions of salient counterfactual explanation and popular adversarial example methods for locally linear approximations.\nOur analysis demonstrates that several popular counterfactual explanation and adversarial example generation methods such as the ones proposed by Wachter et al. 0 and Carlini and Wagner , Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. ,\nare equivalent for certain hyperparameter choices.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that C-CHVAE and the natural adversarial attack (NAE) 1 provide similar solutions for certain generative model choices. Finally, we carry out extensive experimentation with multiple synthetic and real-world data sets from diverse domains such as financial lending and criminal justice to validate our theoretical findings. We further probe these methods empirically to validate the similarity between the counterfactuals and adversarial examples output by several state-of-the-art methods. Our results indicate that counterfactuals and adversarial examples output by manifold-based methods such as NAE and C-CHVAE are more similar compared to those generated by other techniques. By establishing these and other theoretical and empirical similarities, our work raises fundamental questions about the design and development of existing counterfactual explanation algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: in a credit scoring model where an individual loan application is denied, a counterfactual explanation can highlight the minimal set of changes the individual can make to obtain a positive outcome  [ref]20.
