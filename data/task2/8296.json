      "content": "Paper Title: On the Computational Complexity of Schrödinger Operators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we discuss the complexity of TIM Hamiltonians.\nTo be more concrete, Theorem 2.4 and 2.6 are featured respectively for characterizing the complexity of (i) estimating the ground energy and (ii) time-independent simulation for TIM Hamiltonians which are defined as follows. (TIM Hamiltonian)\nAn n𝑛n-qubit TIM Hamiltonian is that of a transverse field Ising model taking the following form: where hu,gu,gu,vsubscriptℎ𝑢subscript𝑔𝑢subscript𝑔𝑢𝑣h_{u},g_{u},g_{u,v} are real coefficients and Xu,Zusubscript𝑋𝑢subscript𝑍𝑢X_{u},Z_{u} are Pauli operators acting on the u𝑢uth qubit. Let us introduce the definition of stoquastic Hamiltonian and complexity class StoqMA for later use. (k𝑘k-local termwise-stoquastic Hamiltonian)\nWe call a Hamiltonian H𝐻H that acts on the n𝑛n-qubit Hilbert space ℂ2nsuperscriptℂsuperscript2𝑛\\mathbb{C}^{2^{n}} k𝑘k-local termwise-stoquastic if it can be written as where each Hjsubscript𝐻𝑗H_{j} acts nontrivially on at most k𝑘k qubits, and when written in the computational basis, Hjsubscript𝐻𝑗H_{j}’s off-diagonal entries are nonpositive. (StoqMA , informal)\nThe complexity class StoqMA is an extension of the classical class MA where the verifier can accept quantum states as a proof instead of a bitstring in the definition of MA. The verifier can then apply classical reversible circuits on the state and measure the first qubit in the {|+⟩,|−⟩}ketket\\{{|{+}\\rangle},{|{-}\\rangle}\\} basis.\nIt accepts the proof iff the measurement outcome is ‘+’. The prefix “Stoq” in StoqMA comes from the fact that determining the ground energy of a k𝑘k-local termwise-stoquastic Hamiltonian is a complete problem for StoqMA as long as k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2  .\nThis resembles the fact that determining the ground energy of a general k𝑘k-local Hamiltonian is QMA-complete for k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 . The following result from Brayvi and Hastings  characterizes the difficulty of estimating the ground energy for a general TIM Hamiltonian. Determining the ground energy of TIM Hamiltonian is StoqMA-complete.\nMore specifically, estimating within error 1/poly⁡(n)1poly𝑛1/\\operatorname{poly}(n) the smallest eigenvalue of the TIM Hamiltonian with |hu|,|gu|,|gu,v|≤poly⁡(n)subscriptℎ𝑢subscript𝑔𝑢subscript𝑔𝑢𝑣poly𝑛|h_{u}|,|g_{u}|,|g_{u,v}|\\leq\\operatorname{poly}(n) given explicitly, is complete for the complexity class StoqMA under P reductions. Now let us turn to the complexity of simulating a TIM Hamiltonian in a time-independent fashion.\nThe problem is not settled in previous literature explicitly to our best knowledge.\nHowever, it turns out that the simulation task is BQP-complete by virtue of a few reductions and techniques from previous works. We call a family of Hamiltonians acting on n𝑛n-qubit Hilbert spaces ℂ2nsuperscriptℂsuperscript2𝑛\\mathbb{C}^{2^{n}} BQP-complete if the following problem is (Promise)BQP-complete under P reductions: Input. An integer n𝑛n, a positive t≤poly⁡(n)𝑡poly𝑛t\\leq\\operatorname{poly}(n), the description of a Hamiltonian H𝐻H from the family, a product state |ψ⟩∈ℂ2nket𝜓superscriptℂsuperscript2𝑛{|{\\psi}\\rangle}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{2^{n}} with each component being 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left({1}\\right)-qubit and a projector M=|μ⟩​⟨μ|⊗I𝑀tensor-productket𝜇bra𝜇𝐼M={|{\\mu}\\rangle}\\!{\\langle{\\mu}|}\\otimes I where |μ⟩ket𝜇{|{\\mu}\\rangle} is an 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left({1}\\right)-qubit state. Output. Yes if Tr⁡(M​|ϕ⟩​⟨ϕ|)>2/3trace𝑀ketitalic-ϕbraitalic-ϕ23\\Tr{M{|{\\phi}\\rangle}\\!{\\langle{\\phi}|}}>2/3 or No if Tr⁡(M​|ϕ⟩​⟨ϕ|)<1/3trace𝑀ketitalic-ϕbraitalic-ϕ13\\Tr{M{|{\\phi}\\rangle}\\!{\\langle{\\phi}|}}<1/3 given the promise that one must be the case, where |ϕ⟩≔e−i​H​t​|ψ⟩≔ketitalic-ϕsuperscript𝑒𝑖𝐻𝑡ket𝜓{|{\\phi}\\rangle}\\coloneqq e^{-iHt}{|{\\psi}\\rangle}. TIM Hamiltonians with coefficients bounded in poly⁡(n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(n) are BQP-complete. It is obvious that it should be in BQP since general local Hamiltonian simulation is in BQP.\nWe focus on proving its BQP-hardness below.\nBy Theorem 42 of [22, SI] we know that X​X+Z​Z𝑋𝑋𝑍𝑍XX+ZZ Hamiltonians are BQP-complete.444In fact, one can even restrict the topology of such Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice and the BQP-completeness will remain unchanged by virtue of [ref]64. From that result, a similar X​X+Y​Y𝑋𝑋𝑌𝑌XX+YY family also finds its application in verification of quantum simulators .\nTo be more specific, the family of Hamiltonians consist of H𝐻H taking the shape where |ai​j|,|bi​j|≤poly⁡(n)subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗subscript𝑏𝑖𝑗poly𝑛\\absolutevalue{a_{ij}},\\absolutevalue{b_{ij}}\\leq\\operatorname{poly}(n).\nNow we employ the technique from   to embed the spectrum of H𝐻H into a 3-local termwise-stoquastic matrix (in the computational basis).\nWrite H=−∑kHk𝐻subscript𝑘subscript𝐻𝑘H=-\\sum_{k}H_{k} where Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k} are 2-local real matrices of size 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n}.\nConstruct Hk~~subscript𝐻𝑘\\widetilde{H_{k}} of size 2n+1superscript2𝑛12^{n+1} from Hksubscript𝐻𝑘H_{k} by the following replacement rule: Hk~~subscript𝐻𝑘\\widetilde{H_{k}} is 3-local if we interpret it as acting on n+1𝑛1n+1 qubits and it is clearly stoquastic.\nNote that Hk~=Hk⊗|−⟩⟨−|+|Hk|⊗|+⟩⟨+|\\widetilde{H_{k}}=H_{k}\\otimes{|{-}\\rangle}\\!{\\langle{-}|}+\\absolutevalue{H_{k}}\\otimes{|{+}\\rangle}\\!{\\langle{+}|} where |⋅|⋅\\absolutevalue{\\cdot} applies entrywise.\nHence we can construct the following 3-local stoquastic Hamiltonian: Therefore, the evolution of |ψ⟩ket𝜓{|{\\psi}\\rangle} under Hamiltonian H𝐻H can be simulated by the evolution of |ψ⟩​|−⟩ket𝜓ket{|{\\psi}\\rangle}{|{-}\\rangle} under H~~𝐻\\widetilde{H}.\nWe conclude that 3-local termwise stoquastic Hamiltonians are also BQP-complete.\nFinally, as detailed in Section 5.4 of [22, SI], 3-local termwise-stoquastic Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated by TIM Hamiltonians.\nThis is achieved by chaining local simulation protocols from  and , which reduces 3-local termwise-stoquastic Hamiltonians to 2-local ones, and 2-local ones to TIM Hamiltonians, respectively.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [64]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]64: X​X+Z​Z𝑋𝑋𝑍𝑍XX+ZZ Hamiltonians are BQP-complete.444In fact, one can even restrict the topology of such Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice and the BQP-completeness will remain unchanged by virtue of [ref]64.
