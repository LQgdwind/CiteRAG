      "content": "Paper Title: Knowledge-driven Active Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Learning (DL) methods have achieved impressive results over the past decade in fields ranging from computer vision to text generation [ref]31. However, most of these contributions relied on overly data-intensive models (e.g. Transformers), trained on huge amounts of data . With the advent of Big Data, sample collection does not represent an issue any more, but, nonetheless, in some contexts the number of supervised data is limited, and manual labelling can be expensive .\nTherefore, a common situation is the unlabelled pool scenario [ref]36, where many data are available, but only some are annotated.\nHistorically, two strategies have been devised to tackle this situation: semi-supervised learning which exploits the unlabelled data to enrich feature representations , and active learning which selects the smallest set of data to annotate to improve the most model performances [ref]49. The main assumption behind active learning strategies is that there exists a subset of samples that allows to train a model with a similar accuracy as when fed with all training data.\nIteratively, the strategy indicates the optimal samples to be annotated from the unlabelled pool. This is generally done by ranking the unlabelled samples w.r.t. a given measure, usually on the model predictions [ref]49  , or on the input data distribution   and by selecting the samples associated to the highest rankings  .\nWhile being theoretically sound, an understanding of the selected samples based on their content is not straightforward, in particular to non-ML experts.\nThis issue becomes particularly relevant when considering that Deep Neural Networks are already seen as black box models   On the contrary, we believe that neural models must be linked to Commonsense knowledge related to a given learning problem.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose for the first time to exploit this symbolic knowledge in the selection process of an active learning strategy. This not only lower the amount of supervised data, but it also enables domain experts to train a model leveraging their knowledge. More precisely, we propose to compare the predictions over the unsupervised data with the available knowledge and to exploit the inconsistencies as a criterion for selecting the data to be annotated.\nDomain knowledge, indeed, can be expressed as First-Order Logic (FOL) clauses and translated into real-valued logic constraints (among other choices) by means of T-Norms  to assess its satisfaction   . In the experiments, we show that the proposed Knowledge-driven Active Learning (KAL) strategy (i) performs better (on average) than several standard active learning methods, particularly in those contexts where domain-knowledge is rich. We empirically demonstrate (ii) that this is mainly due to the fact that the proposed strategy allows discovering data distributions lying far from the initial training data, unlike uncertainty-based approaches.\nFurthermore, we show that (iii) the KAL strategy can be easily employed also in regression and object-detection contexts, where standard uncertainty-based strategies are not-straightforward to apply , (iv) the provided knowledge is acquired by the trained model, (iv) KAL can also work on domains where no knowledge is available if combined with a XAI technique,\nand, finally, (vi) KAL is not computationally expensive unlike many recent methods. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the proposed method is explained in details, with first an example on inferring the XOR operation and then contextualized in more realistic active learning domains; the aforementioned experimental results on different datasets are reported in Section 3, comparing the proposed technique with several active learning strategies; in Section 4 the related work about active learning and about integrating reasoning with machine learning is briefly resumed; finally, in Section 5 we conclude the paper by considering possible future work.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Deep Learning (DL) methods have achieved impressive results over the past decade in fields ranging from computer vision to text generation [ref]31.
