      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity and Approximability of Optimal Sensor Selection and Attack for Kalman Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe authors in  and [ref]32 studied the design-time sensor selection problem for discrete-time linear time-varying systems over a finite time horizon. The objective is to minimize the estimation error with a cardinality constraint on the chosen sensors (or alternatively, minimize the number of chosen sensors while guaranteeing a certain level of performance in terms of the estimation error). The authors analyzed the performance of greedy algorithms for this problem. However, their results cannot be directly applied to the problems that we consider here, since we aim to optimize the steady state estimation error. The papers  and  considered the same design-time sensor selection as the one we consider here. In , the authors expressed the problem as a semidefinite program (SDP). However, they did not provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the proposed algorithm. The paper  showed that the problem is NP-hard and provided upper bounds on the performance of any algorithm for the problem; these upper bounds were functions of the system matrices. Although  showed via simulations that greedy algorithms performed well for several randomly generated systems, the question of whether such algorithms (or other polynomial-time algorithms) could provide constant-factor approximation ratios for the problem was left open. We resolve this question in this paper by showing that there does not exist any polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem. In , the authors studied the problem of attacking a given observation selection in Gaussian process regression  to maximize the posteriori variance of the predictor variable. It was shown that this problem is NP-hard. Moreover, they also gave an instance of this problem such that a greedy algorithm for finding an optimal attack will perform arbitrarily poorly. In , the authors considered the scenario where the attacker can target a different set of sensors at each time step to maximize certain metrics of the error covariance of the Kalman filter at the final time step. Some suboptimal algorithms were provided with simulation results. Different from  and , we study the problem where the attacker removes a set of installed sensors to maximize the trace of the steady state error covariance of the Kalman filter associated with the surviving sensors, and provide fundamental limitations on achievable performance by any possible algorithm for this problem.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: The authors in  and [ref]32 studied the design-time sensor selection problem for discrete-time linear time-varying systems over a finite time horizon.
