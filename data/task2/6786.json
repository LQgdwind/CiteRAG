      "content": "Paper Title: DiffGuard: Semantic Mismatch-Guided Out-of-Distribution Detection using Pre-trained Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe effectiveness of deep learning models is largely contingent on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data assumption, i.e., test sets follow the same distribution as training samples . However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often does not hold true . Consequently, the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for practical applications, so that OOD samples can be rejected or taken special care of without harming the system’s performance . For image classifiers, a primary objective of OOD detection is to identify samples having semantic shifts, whose contents differ from all legal classes in the training dataset . To differentiate such OOD samples and in-distribution (InD) ones,\nsome existing solutions utilize information from the classifier itself, such as internal features , logits , or both . While simple, these solutions inevitably face a trade-off between the InD classification accuracy and the over-confidence of the trained classifier for OOD detection , especially on hard OOD inputs. Some other methods propose using an auxiliary module for OOD detection based on either reconstruction quality  or data density 4. The auxiliary module does not affect the training process of the classifier, but these methods tend to have a low OOD detection capability. To the best of our knowledge, MoodCat [ref]52 is the only attempt that directly models the semantic mismatch of OOD samples for detection. Specifically, it employs a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to synthesize an image conditioned on the classifier’s output label together with the input image. For InD samples with correct labels, the synthesis procedure tries to reconstruct the original input; while for OOD samples with semantically different labels, ideally the synthesis result is dramatically different from the input image, thereby enabling OOD detection. While inspiring, due to the difficulty in cGAN training with potentially conflicting conditions, MoodCat is not applicable to ImageNet-scale datasets. Recently, diffusion models have surpassed GANs in terms of both training stability and generation quality. Moreover, they are amenable to various conditions during generation, including both label conditions [ref]42 [ref]16 and image-wise conditions through DDIM inversion .\nWith the above benefits, we propose a new semantic mismatch-guided OOD detection framework based on diffusion models, called DiffGuard.\nSimilar to [ref]52, DiffGuard takes both the input image and the classifier’s output label as conditions for image synthesis and detects OODs by measuring the similarity between the input image and its conditional synthesis result. However, it is non-trivial to apply diffusion models for semantic mismatch identification. A critical problem with label guidance in diffusion models is the lack of consideration for the classifier-under-protection. This issue arises in both types of guidance in diffusion models, namely classifier guidance111Classifier guidance relies on a noisy classifier rather than the classifier-under-protection. See Sec. 3.2.1 for more details. [ref]42 and classifier-free guidance [ref]16. If the guidance cannot match the semantics of the classifier’s output, the synthesis result may fail to highlight the semantic mismatch of OODs. To address this problem, we propose several techniques that effectively utilize information from the classifier-under-protection. Additionally, we propose several test-time enhancement techniques to balance the guidance between the input image and the label condition during generation, without even fine-tuning the diffusion model. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on the standard benchmark, OpenOOD . Given Cifar-10 or ImageNet as the InD dataset, DiffGuard outperforms or is on par with existing OOD detection solutions, and it can be easily combined with them to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: We propose a diffusion-based framework for detecting OODs, which directly models the semantic mismatch of OOD samples, and it is applicable to ImageNet-scale datasets; We propose several test-time techniques to improve the effectiveness of conditioning in OOD detection. Our framework can work with any pre-trained diffusion models without the need for fine-tuning, and can provide plug-and-play OOD detection capability for any classifier; Experimental results show that our framework achieves SOTA performance on Cifar-10 and demonstrates strong differentiation ability on hard OOD samples of ImageNet. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related OOD detection methods and diffusion models. Section 3 presents our framework and details the proposed solution. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. We also provide discussion on limitations and future works in Section 5. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: or data density 4.
