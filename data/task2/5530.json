Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

ROUGE-2 F1-score and ROUGE-L F1-score of the LSTM-based model in  are 12.7 and 29.50, respectively while those in the gradient boosting regression model  are 13.9 and 31.6, respectively. Both the above methods use extractive summarization on the full text (sans abstract) of the paper, that is, they select a set of sentences from a given document for inclusion in the research highlights. Rehman et al.  use abstractive summarization to generate research highlights from abstracts only, and the best performing model in it is a pointer-generator network with coverage and GloVe embeddings that records ROUGE-1 F1, ROUGE-2 F1, ROUGE-L F1, METEOR score, and BERTScore F1 values as 31.46, 8.57, 29.14, 12.01 and 85.31, respectively. In a follow-up work, Rehman et al. [ref]39 combined named-entity recognition (NER) with coverage-augmented pointer-generator network to generate research highlights from different parts of a paper. The best performing model in [ref]39 is denoted as (NER + PGM + Coverage) in Table V, and it uses only the abstract; it produces ROUGE-1 F1, ROUGE-2 F1, ROUGE-L F1, METEOR, and BERTScore F1 values as 38.13, 13.68, 35.11, 31.03 and 86.3, respectively.\nWe clearly observe that the method proposed in this paper, i.e., a pointer-generator network with coverage and SciBERT word embeddings, achieves the best ROUGE-2 F1-score and ROUGE-L F1-score which are 14.26 and 35.51, respectively. The same model also achieves the highest METEOR score and BERTScore F1 of 32.62 and 86.65, respectively, among the three pointer-generator models compared in Table V. (Note that here we have measured the performance on the holdout test set.) The above model (PGM + Coverage + SciBERT) uses only the abstracts as input unlike the methods in  and , that use the full text of the paper. Abstracts being much shorter than the main text of a paper, the computational overhead is significantly reduced. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for the CSPubSum dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: score\nF1\n\n\n\nLSTM Classification \n—\n12.7\n29.50\n—\n—\n\nGradient Boosting Regressor \n—\n13.9\n31.60\n—\n—\n\nPGM + Coverage + GloVe \n31.46\n8.57\n29.14\n12.01\n85.31\n\nNER + PGM + Coverage [ref]39\n38.13\n13.68\n35.11\n31.03\n86.3\n\nPGM + Coverage + SciBERT (ours)\n38.26\n14.26\n35.51\n32.62\n86.65\n\n Table V compares the performance of our proposed approach (PGM + Coverage + SciBERT) with other\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
