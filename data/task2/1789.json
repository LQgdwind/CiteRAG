This task is key for understanding how conversations portray specific topics, such as individuals being in favour or against a given set of prescriptions about the COVID-19 pandemic. Studying stances through language has been historically performed through human intervention, which involves a person reading text, reconstructing syntactic and semantic associations between words in the text and then classifying the result. Human intervention is clearly not sustainable when dealing with thousands of interconnected stances as expressed in thousands and thousands of online social posts . The advent of social media content gave voice to millions of internet users, a voice that could potentially report stances of relevance for understanding how real-world events are debated online . Towards this direction, computer and data science recently developed numerous approaches and frameworks to tackle stance detection, mainly powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence, cf.   . Although machine learning is usually highly accurate in detecting whether a stance is positive or negative [ref]22 or reconstructing the polarity and intensity of the sentiment expressed in language [ref]5 , it provides little information about the underlying structure of the stance. That is, such approaches are not able to understand how conceptual elements are entwined in a given stance in order to determine its overall meaning and emotional outline. Achieving more interpretable models of language processing and stance detection remains an open challenge  . The present work merges machine learning with cognitive networks , which are network representations of how linguistic knowledge is connected and processed within the human mind in a cognitive system known as the mental lexicon . There are multiple ways to build networks out of texts, like using the relevance of words across paragraphs  or co-occurrence networks to identify writing styles and authorship across manuscripts . However, in reconstructing a stance it is necessary to identify not only conceptual associations but also emotional trends and sentiment patterns . This combination is necessary in order to identify how individuals semantically framed specific concepts of social discourse (i.e. which associates surround a specific word), and what emotions revolve around each concept/idea. The inextricable connection between knowledge and affect recently led to the framework of textual forma mentis networks (TFMNs), cf. [ref]29, which can extract syntactic, semantic, and emotional associations between words in text to create a knowledge graph that reconstructs the structure of the knowledge that authors embed in their posts. Networks like the ones used in the present work have successfully highlighted how students and researchers perceived STEM subjects , how trainees changed their own mindset after a period of formal training , and have also identified key concepts in short texts [ref]29.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: stance detection, mainly powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence, cf.   .
