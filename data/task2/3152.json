      "content": "Paper Title: BCD Nets: Scalable Variational Approaches for Bayesian Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the key uses of statistical methods is learning causal relationships from observed data a.k.a. causal discovery . Causal models allow us to forecast the effects of interventions and counterfactuals in several real-world domains, such as economic policy [ref]57 and medicine .\nAlthough early approaches to statistical inference\nemphasised that ‘correlation is not causation’ , it has since been shown that for certain families of data-generating processes, it is indeed possible to infer causal relationships from purely observational data  .\nOne such widely studied data-generating process is the linear-Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) , where the causal relationships between the random variables in the model can be represented via a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG).\nThe value of any variable in the DAG of a linear-Gaussian SEM is given by a linear combination of the values of its parent nodes and additive noise.\nFor causal discovery, naive Monte-Carlo sampling or enumeration of the possible DAGs quickly becomes intractable, since the number of possible DAGs over a model grows super-exponentially with the number of variables .\nA variety of methods have been developed over the years to efficiently sample or optimize over DAGs    .\nFor example, a recent line of work scales to high dimensions by maximizing the likelihood of the model (MLE)\nover a set of continuous relaxations of adjacency matrices using gradient-based methods and specialized DAG regularization terms.\n2   . However, the majority of the aforementioned works for scalable causal discovery in linear-Gaussian SEMs focus on recovering point estimates for the underlying DAG via MLE.\nIn many practical scenarios, however, a point estimate\nfails to reflect the uncertainty in inferring the underlying DAG.\nThis includes scenarios where the true DAG is non-identifiable given (infinite) observational data as well as\npractical limitations due\nto an imperfect optimization algorithm, model mismatch, or simply a finite dataset.\nIn any of the above scenarios, it is desirable to obtain an explicit posterior distribution over the unobserved DAG instead of a single point estimate .\nCausal inference is increasingly being applied in situations with important real-world consequences, where such a Bayesian estimation procedure could be useful to sample and reason over alternative generative mechanisms for observed data. To achieve this goal, we propose Bayesian Causal Discovery Nets (BCD Nets), an algorithmic framework for Bayesian causal discovery in linear-Gaussian SEMs based on modern variational inference  .\nClassical approaches to Bayesian causal discovery struggle in higher dimensions  , with limited improvements via Monte Carlo approximations  [ref]58.\nIn order to scale our variational method to high dimensions, we address several design challenges.\nFirst, we describe an expressive variational family of factorized posterior distributions over the SEM parameters (edge weights and noise variance) using deep neural networks.\nThe factorization exploits the decomposition of DAGs into triangular matrices and permutations for specifying the distribution over edge weights and node orderings respectively.\nFurther, for low-variance stochastic optimization of the variational objective, we exploit recent advances in modeling and reparametrizing distributions over permutations via continuous relaxations  .\nFinally, we employ a horseshoe prior  on the edge weights, which promotes sparsity.111Code is available at github.com/ermongroup/BCD-Nets We evaluate BCD Nets for causal discovery on a range of synthetic and real-world data benchmarks.\nOur experiments demonstrate that with finite datasets, there is considerable uncertainty in the inferred posterior over DAGs.\nUsing BCD Nets, we are able to effectively quantify the uncertainty and significantly outperform competing estimators  [ref]58 on the standard Structured Hamming Distance metric, especially in low data regimes.\n\nReference markers found: [57]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]57: relationships from observed data a.k.a. causal discovery .
