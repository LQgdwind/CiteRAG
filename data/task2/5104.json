Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Color-Event based Tracking: A Unified Network, Dataset, and Metric\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the single-modality input of the benchmarked baseline trackers, we feed the 25 trackers with an early-fusion (EF) strategy. Specifically, we stack the event stream into images and fuse the generated event images with the color images at the rate of 0.2:1. The baseline trackers assessed in our benchmark can be divided into three groups: - Four Siamese-based trackers: SiamRCNN , TrSiam [ref]40, SiamRPN , and SiamFC . - Eight Transformer-based trackers: AiATrack , OSTrack , MixFormer22k 5, MixFormer1k 5, TransT , STARK-ST101 , STARK-ST50 , and STARK-S50 . - Thirteen Discriminant-based trackers: RTS , ToMP101 [ref]45, ToMP50 [ref]45, TrDimp [ref]40, KeepTrack , KYS , PrDiMP50 , PrDiMP18 , SuperDiMP , SuperDiMPSimpleSimple{}_{\\text{Simple}} , DiMP18 0, DiMP50 0, and ATOM 1. Additionally, three algorithms that follow the middle-level feature fusion (MF) strategy are re-trained and evaluated, including MDNet-MF , VITAL-MF 2, and SiamFC-MF .\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: generated event images with the color images at the rate of 0.2:1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
