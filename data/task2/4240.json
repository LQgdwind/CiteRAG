      "content": "Paper Title: LaRa: Latents and Rays for Multi-Camera Bird’s-Eye-View Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo plan and drive safely, autonomous cars need accurate 360-degree perception and understanding of their surroundings from multiple and diverse sensors, e.g., cameras, RADARs, and LiDARs. Most of the established approaches tardily aggregate independent predictions from each sensor [ref]1  .\nSuch a late fusion strategy has limitations for reasoning globally at the scene level and does not take advantage of the available prior geometric knowledge that links sensors. Alternatively, the bird’s-eye-view’s (BEV) representational space, a.k.a. top-view occupancy grid, recently gained considerable interest within the community.\nBEV appears as a suitable and natural space to fuse multiple views  [ref]5 or sensor modalities   and to capture semantic, geometric, and dynamic information.\nBesides, it is a widely adopted choice for downstream driving tasks including motion forecasting [ref]5   [ref]10 and planning    .\nIn this paper, we focus on BEV perception from multiple cameras.\nThe online estimation of BEV representations is usually done by:\n(i) imposing strong geometric priors such as a flat world  or correspondence between pixel columns and BEV rays ,\n(ii) predicting depth probability distribution over pixels to lift from 2D to 3D and project back in BEV  [ref]5, a system subject to compounding errors, or,\n(iii) learning a costly dense mapping between multi-camera features and the BEV grid pixels . Here, we depart from these dominant strategies and introduce ‘LaRa’, a novel transformer-based model for vehicle segmentation from multiple cameras.\nIn contrast to prior works, we propose to use a latent ‘internal representation’ instantiated as a collection of vectors.\nFusing multiple views into a compact latent space comes with several benefits.\nFirst, it provides an explicit control on the memory and computation footprint of the model, instead of the quadratic scaling of the full mapping between multi-camera features and the BEV grid pixels .\nBy design, the number of latents that we use is much smaller compared to the spatial resolution of the BEV grid, enabling a highly-efficient aggregation of information at the latent-level while exploiting spatial cues within and across camera views.\nMoreover, we also hypothesize that discarding error-prone modules in the pipeline such as depth estimation  [ref]5 can boost model accuracy and robustness.\nFinally, we can directly predict at the full-scale BEV resolution bypassing noisy upsampling operations. This is infeasible, within a reasonable computational budget, for prior works restricted to coarser BEV grids as they map densely between all the image and BEV grid pixels .\nBesides, as an orthogonal contribution, we augment input features with ray embeddings that encode geometric relationships within and across images.\nWe show that such spatial embeddings, encoding prior geometric knowledge, help guide the cross-attention between input features and the latent vectors. Our approach is extensively validated against prior works on the nuScenes [ref]10 dataset.\nWe significantly improve the performance on the vehicle segmentation task, outperforming recent high-performing models  .\nMoreover, we show interesting properties of our cross-attention, which naturally stitches multiple cameras together.\nWe also perform several ablation and sensitivity studies of our architecture with respect to hyper-parameters changes.\nOverall, LaRa is a novel model that learns the mapping from camera views to bird’s-eye-view  for the task of vehicle semantic segmentation.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows: We encode multiple views into a compact latent space that enables precise control on the model’s memory and computation footprint, decoupled from the input size and output resolution. We augment semantic features with spatial embeddings derived from cameras’ calibration parameters and show that it strongly helps the model learn to stitch multiple views together. Our architectural contributions are validated on nuScenes where we reach new SOTA results.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of their surroundings from multiple and diverse sensors, e.g., cameras, RADARs, and LiDARs.
